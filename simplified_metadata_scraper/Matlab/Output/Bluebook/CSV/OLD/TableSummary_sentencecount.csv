firmer than those currently prevailing as described in paragraph (12) above. However, some possibility exists that
the changes in short-term market interest rates required under
Alternative B or C could be large enough to have appreciable effects
on market expectations about the course of interest rates. On the other hand, given the still sensitive state
of securities markets, the adoption of Alternative B, involving a
marginal firming in money markets, might lead to some stiffening of
market interest rates and renewed apprehensions about financial

indicated in the above tables would require a more pronounced easing of
money market conditions than under Alternative A. On the other hand, some partly offsetting
upward interest rate pressure, chiefly in longer maturity ranges,
might develop if there were a heightening of expectations that signifi-
cantly easier credit availability would lead to intensification of
inflationary conditions later on..

what more rapidly, along with the more rapid growth in money supply,
as compared with alternative A. Money supply growth is not expected to
become more rapid until October, although the exact lags over the near-
term in public and bank responses to monetary policy changes are con-
jectural. Thus,
the upward effect on the adjusted bank credit proxy of the rather
marked lowering of market interest rates expected under this alterna-
tive might not be extremely sharp, and will likely depend in part on the
extent to which businesses switch from open market to bank borrowing
and on the extent to which banks and dealers take speculative positions

(11) In the case of alternative A, the Federal funds range
is wide enough to allow for some tightening from recent levels. If demand for money at given Federal funds rates
continues to be greater than anticipated--as a result of financial
transactions or the need to finance a temporary large post-strike bulge
in GNP--the Committee may be faced with the possibility of either per-
mitting the Federal funds rate to rise above the ranges shown in
paragraph (10) for any particular alternative chosen, or permitting,
at least temporarily, a higher money growth rate than contemplated..
(15) Alternative A.",5,"Alternative A involves a 5 per cent
money growth rate; alternative B, 6 per cent; and alternative C, 7 per

necessarily be inconsistent with continued declines in long-term rates,
particularly if over-all credit demands slacken, it is assumed that the
Committee would not want to indicate that it was seeking ""to promote""
some easing of credit market conditions under a policy course that
contemplates the possibility of some firming of money market conditions..

very likely encourage some further shift away from Euro-dollar borrow-

supply present alternatives that take account in differing ways of the
recent shortfalls relative to expectations, as follows:
(A) Alternative A shows a pattern consistent with a 6 per
cent annual rate of growth for M1 over the first quarter of 1971. This
would be equal to the rate of growth for the quarter that the Committee
indicated as the minimum acceptable at its last meeting, at a time when
it was expected that fourth quarter growth would be 5 per cent. Thus
alternative A does not make up for the fourth quarter shortfall. As a result, under alternative A the March level of the money
supply would be about $1 billion below previous expectations. First qtr. annual rate of increase

Alternative A 5 --5-3/4 6 8
B 4 --4-3/4 7-1/2 10-1/2
C 3-1/4-- 4 8-1/2 11-1/2. (9) Realization of alternative A aggregates would require, in
the staff's judgment, pushing the Federal funds rate up from its recent
trading range of around 4-1/2 per cent. In either case, movements in the bill rate would be influenced by ex-
pectations as to future discount rate actions as well as by the nature of
forthcoming Treasury financings..
(12) With the forthcoming Treasury refunding probably largely
discounted by the market, with recent corporate issues well received, and
in light of the still large spread of long- over short-term rates, it
seems likely that longer-term interest rates will drop further, except
under conditions specified for alternative A. Interest rate declines
would tend to accelerate should the Federal funds rate move down
significantly from prevailing levels..
(15) Alternative A.",6,"(B) Alternative B shows a growth path for the first quarter
which makes up for the shortfall in December and in the fourth quarter. Marginal
reserve measures would be tighter than recently prevailing..
(10) Under alternative B, the money market may have to be
eased from currently prevailing conditions; the funds rate was around
half of the 4--4-3/4 per cent range specified. Such a statement has been omitted since this directive
might entail tighter money market conditions with potential consequences
for credit markets generally..
(19) Alternative B. Whereas alternative B includes a statement to the effect that ""the
Committee seeks to promote some easing of conditions in credit markets,""
the word ""some"" is omitted in the corresponding statement in this alter-
native. This difference reflects the expectation that interest rates
would decline somewhat more under this alternative--which calls for
""more rapid growth in money""--than under alternative B.

the growth rate in money supply for the September-to-March period back up
to the 6 per cent rate of expansion experienced over the first three
quarters of 1970. Under alternative C, which
would probably require a funds rate below 4 per cent, the bill rate might
also decline below 4 per cent, although expectations that rates were
bottoming out might tend to inhibit such a decline in the 3-month rate. That interest rates--encompassing intermediate- and longer-

Alt. It would be anticipated, however, that by early spring, the Federal
funds rate would have to rise rather sharply--to around 4-1/2 --5 per cent,
with a concurrent snapback in bill rates--as reserves are provided less
generously in order to move down to the assumed longer-run growth rate,
typified in alternative A by a 6 per cent growth in M1 for the second. This tendency is likely to become more widespread,
especially under alternative A, and may serve, along with an increase of
consumer spending as projected in the Green Book, to moderate savings
inflows. Under alternative B, the rate

(Per cent annual rate). (10) Since the alternative B pattern of growth in monetary
aggregates involves a somewhat less rapid February--March annual growth
rate for M1 of 9 per cent, attainment of this rate would seem to
involve a smaller reduction in the Federal funds rate than under alterna-
tive A--perhaps a funds rate in a 3--3-1/2 per cent range--and a net free
reserve position of $50-$150 million. Because of the more gradual approach to making up the shortfall in M1
under alternative B, a sizable later snapback in money market rates would
not be expected. Under alternative B, the rate
of growth in M2 would be expected to be only slightly less rapid than
under alternative A. The indicated language with respect to the aggregates (i.e., the
reference to the ""narrowly defined money stock, ' followed by a separate
reference to ""the other monetary and credit aggregates"") is suggested
to make clear (1) that it is with respect to M1 that a shortfall is to
be made up, and (2) that the Committee is also taking account of the
behavior of key monetary aggregates other than M1..

alternative A only in the omission of the clause (following the reference

highly problematical because of uncertainties about the timing and extent
of bank cuts in offering rates on consumer-type accounts and the effect
of this on savers in a period of declining market interest rates..
(15) With a policy of keeping to prevailing money market
conditions, termed alternative C, M1 growth in the first quarter would
be at a 6 per cent annual rate and no pick-up from this rate would be
anticipated in the second quarter. A relatively rapid M1 growth would,
however, be expected in February and March as the effects of recent

is, it assumes current money market conditions. However, as indicated in the preceding paragraph,
under alternative A, M1 would be expected to grow more rapidly in the second
quarter than in the first. Growth in M2 would be expected to moderate from the first
quarter pace, even under alternative A, however, as the initial asset ad-
justment by the public to the sharp drop of late 1970 and early 1971 in market
rates relative to time deposit offering rates runs it course..
(13) An effort to move onto growth paths for aggregates in the
second quarter slower than shown for alternative A--given staff assumptions
as to the strength of economic recovery and attendent credit demands--seems
likely to require a rise in the Federal funds rate from current levels during
the next four weeks. The money market conditions now estimated to be con-
sistent with alternative A through C are shown in the table below, using the
second quarter annual rate of growth in M1 as a convenient index of the col-

to that of the present directive, except that it is proposed--in view of
the recent increases in long-term rates--to call for accommodating ""any""

staff would expect long-term market yields to work down, given the present
wide spread of long over short rates, once headway is made in absorbing the
exceptionally large volume of corporate bonds in the immediate offing. Thus, a rise in
short-rates of about the magnitude indicated for alternative B might not be
accompanied by any appreciable rise in long rates over the second quarter as a
whole, although an initial market reaction would be likely; money market
tightening of the degree contemplated under alternative C might well bring a
more lasting long-term rate advance..

Growth in M1:. (11) A tightening of the money market between now and mid-year
to the degrees indicated by the suggested specifications for alternatives B
and C would have little effect on growth in M1 during June, but would begin
to have more noticeable effects in ensuing months.1/ Under alternative B the
M 1 growth rate in the third quarter would be expected to be reduced to 9-1/2 per
cent and under alternative C to 8 per cent. Thus, during fall
the money supply could be growing considerably less than might be desired
unless interest rates were moved sharply downward in the interim..
(12) Alternative B, which indicates a somewhat more gradual
deceleration of the aggregates than alternative C, is less likely to lead
to sharp and sustained upward interest rate adjustments and hence to the
need for a later easing in money market conditions. However, over the near-
term a funds rate around 5-1/4 per cent, as specified in alternative B, would
likely induce a renewed increase in long-term interest rates, particularly as
expectations of a discount rate increase became more prevalent and another
rise in the prime rate more likely. Under alternative B, the 3-month bill
would be likely to move into a 4-5/8--5-1/4 per cent range by or shortly
after mid-year; and the rate would likely be substantially higher under
alternative C..
(14) Loan demands on banks over the summer months are expected to
be fairly strong as economic recovery proceeds and as some borrowers switch
from the open market to banks. As will be noted,
the proposed proviso retains the sense of the reference to capital
market developments in the present directive (i.e., to take account of
such developments in any firming operations) by indicating that somewhat
firmer conditions are to be sought under the proviso only ""if capital
markets are not under excessive pressure."".
(17) Alternative B. This language is proposed for possible
use if the Committee decides (a) to formulate its primary instruction
in terms of desired growth rates for the monetary and credit aggregates
(subject to any constraints that might be imposed by developments in
capital markets), and (b) to adopt as targets for the time being the
growth rates discussed earlier in connection with alternative B.

moderate growth in monetary [DEL: and credit] aggregates over the months
ahead, taking account of [DEL: the current Treasury financing,]

exchange markets].",7,"Though not as magnified, similar control problems
could develop in moving onto other less restrictive paths--for instance,
the alternative C path presented for consideration at this time..

shown in the detailed table on page 7. Alternative A Alternative B Alternative C

Growth in M1:. (11) A tightening of the money market between now and mid-year
to the degrees indicated by the suggested specifications for alternatives B
and C would have little effect on growth in M1 during June, but would begin
to have more noticeable effects in ensuing months.1/ Under alternative B the
M 1 growth rate in the third quarter would be expected to be reduced to 9-1/2 per
cent and under alternative C to 8 per cent. However, by late summer or early
fall, it is our best estimate that the growth rate would be sharply reduced,
perhaps in alternative C to only about a 3--4 per cent annual rate, although
there are great difficulties of course in pinpointing exact months in which
low growth rates would be likely to emerge. Thus, during fall
the money supply could be growing considerably less than might be desired
unless interest rates were moved sharply downward in the interim..
(12) Alternative B, which indicates a somewhat more gradual
deceleration of the aggregates than alternative C, is less likely to lead
to sharp and sustained upward interest rate adjustments and hence to the
need for a later easing in money market conditions. But the general interest rate increase
would not carry as far as under alternative C and there would be a greater
probability of a corrective market rally later on..
(13) Under all three alternatives, growth in M2 is expected to
slow more than growth in M1 between the second and third quarters. Under alternative B, the 3-month bill
would be likely to move into a 4-5/8--5-1/4 per cent range by or shortly
after mid-year; and the rate would likely be substantially higher under
alternative C..
(14) Loan demands on banks over the summer months are expected to
be fairly strong as economic recovery proceeds and as some borrowers switch
from the open market to banks. It is proposed to use the phrase ""to moderate growth in monetary aggregates
in the months ahead"" as a summary description of the objective for the
aggregates, deleting the words ""and credit"", on the assumption that the
Committee will not view recent rates of growth in the adjusted proxy as
so large as to require moderation..
(18) Alternative C. This language is proposed for possible

cussed earlier in connection with alternative C, and to instruct the Desk

imply a 7-1/2 per cent annual rate of increase in total reserves, seasonally
adjusted, from June to September, assuming excess reserves average about

developments under alternative A would not be expected to lead to higher
interest rates in either short- or long-term markets, at least in the

to be substantial..

(5) Although M1 in July has turned out to be somewhat
stronger than previously projected, the need for reserves in the first three
weeks of the month was considerably less than expected (as shown by the
difference between ""path"" and ""actual"" required reserves in the table above). Thus, with the need for reserves reduced,
growth of member bank total reserves in July is falling substantially short

in member bank borrowings. 1/

alternative B, on the other hand, would envisage a gradual firming of the
money market, to the extent permitted by the Treasury financing, to a Federal
funds rate of 6 per cent by late in the inter-meeting period; a funds rate
fluctuating around 6 per cent has been assumed for the alternative B paths
for the monetary aggregates. Under alternative B, growth is expected
to be only about 1/2 percentage point lower than under alternative A in the

imply a 7-1/2 per cent annual rate of increase in total reserves, seasonally
adjusted, from June to September, assuming excess reserves average about
$225 million. Reserve growth would be somewhat
less under alternative B, particularly for nonborrowed reserves, with
part of the drop-off in nonborrowed offset by increased borrowing. The
proposed language contemplates that in making operating decisions under the

(16) While the market probably has already discounted some re-

lower end of the range specified in alternative B--would undoubtedly be
interpreted by the market as a significant policy move. If the public appetite for demand as against

specifications, for example, the Committee might nevertheless wish to provide
only the quantity of reserves consistent with those projections. This would imply the possibility of significantly larger

if the Committee decides (a) to formulate its primary instruction in terms
of desired growth rates in the monetary and credit aggregates, and (b) to
adopt as targets growth rates similar to those associated with the directive
adopted at the previous meeting, as discussed above in connection with

for the second alternative (B) might also be employed with directive
language presented in a later section under the label of alternative C. It is possible
that such a move could carry rates to unsustainably low levels, but, on the
other hand, it is still unclear whether the decline in market yields to date
has fully discounted the changed outlook on inflation..

a Federal funds rate in a 5--5-5/8 per cent range--the annual rate of growth
in M1 is likely to be only about one or two per cent in September and around
currently anticipated from September to October mainly in consequence of an
expected drop in U.S. Government deposits from their unusually high mid-
September level. Under alternative C, money supply growth would be expected
to be a little more rapid in the fourth quarter than under alternative A. The pick-up could be quite modest under alternative
A, however, while under alternative C the cumulative impact of lower interest
rates could lead to a return to growth rates of around 6 per cent or so..

of short- and long-term interest rates--might well ease somewhat between
now and the next Committee meeting even under Alternative A. Credit demands
from businesses and State and local governments in long-term markets appear
to be tapering off, and investors have shown a greater willingness to purchase
longer-term securities. On balance, we would expect the 3-month bill rate to be in a 4-1/4--4-3/4

build-up would carry with it the potential for a sharp subsequent market
reversal or for the need to expand money and credit rapidly to forestall
such a reversal..

might encompass a Federal funds rate in a 4-1/2--4-7/8 per cent range;
member bank borrowings in a $150-$300 million range; and, taking account
of recent wide swings in excess reserves, a net reserve position for
member banks in a plus $250 million to minus $150 million area. Alternative C would imply a significant further
easing of money market conditions from those that have recently evolved,
with, for example, the Federal funds rate thought to be consistent with
this alternative in a 3-7/8--4-1/2 per cent range..
(10) Under alternative A/B, we would expect the 3-month bill
rate to be in a 4--4-5/8 per cent range between now and mid-December. Under alternative C, however, short-term interest
rates would almost certainly decline over the period ahead, with the bill
rate likely to be in a 3-3/4--4-1/4 per cent range..
(12) The narrow money supply (M1) under alternative A/B is
expected to show only a slight decline in November at a one per cent
annual rate, but to resume growth beginning in December. On balance, under alternative A/B, we would anticipate a growth
rate in consumer-type time deposits of around 11 per cent in the fourth
quarter, but slowing to about 7 per cent in the first quarter as consumer
spending continues to rise. Under alternative C, bank credit expansion
would be somewhat more rapid in the last few weeks of the current quarter,
and considerably larger than under alternative A/B in the first quarter
of next year as growth in M2 accelerates..
(16) Assuming the tight end of the money market range for
alternative A/B, it is possible that the technical position of markets
will lead to an increase in interest rates over the near-term despite
the recent discount rate reduction. An easing on the money market toward
the lower end of the alternative A/B range would likely offset such a
tendency should it arise. (17) Alternative A. If the Committee adopts this alternative, it may wish to consider the
money market conditions noted for alternative A in paragraph (9) as
a description of the conditions to be maintained, and for purposes
of the proviso clause to adopt the aggregate growth paths discussed
earlier in connection with alternative A as the ""expected"" paths. As in alternative A,
the Committee may wish to indicate a greater willingness to countenance
overshoots in the aggregates than shortfalls..
(19) Alternative C.",10,"The proviso clause has been formulated in one-way terms, guarding against
significant shortfalls but not excesses, on the assumption that the
Committee would not want money market conditions to be tightened in the
coming period if the aggregates should appear to be expanding on paths
above those projected, which involve no growth over the fourth quarter for
M1 and relatively low growth rates for M2 and the bank credit proxy..
(18) Alternative B. The language for alternative B,
""To implement this policy, the Committee seeks to
achieve moderate growth in monetary and credit aggregates over
the months ahead. This language differs from that of alternative
B in indicating that the Committee seeks ""to promote substantial growth"" rather
than ""to achieve moderate growth"" in the aggregates over the months ahead.",3,"Alternative A/B Alternative C

December 1-1/2 3. Alternative C would imply a significant further
easing of money market conditions from those that have recently evolved,
with, for example, the Federal funds rate thought to be consistent with
this alternative in a 3-7/8--4-1/2 per cent range..
(10) Under alternative A/B, we would expect the 3-month bill
rate to be in a 4--4-5/8 per cent range between now and mid-December. Under alternative C, however, short-term interest
rates would almost certainly decline over the period ahead, with the bill
rate likely to be in a 3-3/4--4-1/4 per cent range..
(12) The narrow money supply (M1) under alternative A/B is
expected to show only a slight decline in November at a one per cent
annual rate, but to resume growth beginning in December. The lower interest rates and greater reserve supply under
alternative C would likely lead to a more rapid 3 per cent rate of growth
in December, followed by an 8 per cent expansion in the first quarter..
(13) Growth in time and savings deposits other than large CD's
is expected to slow in late November and December from the recent rapid
pace. Under alternative C there could be a
pick-up in business borrowing from banks as lending terms ease further,
but the increased inflow of demand and consumer-type deposits associated
with that alternative would probably generate enough resources so that
banks would not need to be more aggressive in that CD market..
(15) With private demand deposits flat and outstanding U.S.
Government deposits declining on balance over the fourth quarter, the
bank credit proxy is expected to grow at only about a 3--4 per cent
annual rate over the period, followed by only a modest pick-up in the
first quarter. Under alternative C, bank credit expansion
would be somewhat more rapid in the last few weeks of the current quarter,
and considerably larger than under alternative A/B in the first quarter
of next year as growth in M2 accelerates..
(16) Assuming the tight end of the money market range for
alternative A/B, it is possible that the technical position of markets
will lead to an increase in interest rates over the near-term despite
the recent discount rate reduction. And if the money market moved into the
alternative C range, the whole market would likely adjust downward in
yield, impelled in part by expectations of a further decline in the
discount rate. As in alternative A,
the Committee may wish to indicate a greater willingness to countenance
overshoots in the aggregates than shortfalls..
(19) Alternative C. It
is proposed for possible use if the Committee decides to pursue the more
aggressive course contemplated by the specifications given earlier for
alternative C.

around those most recently prevailing, the 3-month bill rate may be in a 3-7/8--

(16) In long-term credit markets, fundamental forces working to hold
interest rates down appear strongest in the corporate and mortgage markets. Even under alternative A,
interest rates in these two markets might not show any significant rise. On the other
hand, if this easing trend were to be extended further, all bond markets
would certainly strengthen..
(18) Alternative A. If the Committee wishes to formulate the
directive in terms of money market conditions subject to a proviso clause,
for purposes of the proviso clause it could employ the growth rates of
either alternative A or B--e.g., 6 or 7 per cent, respectively, for M1
in the first quarter. If the Committee favors the alternative A growth
rates, it might adopt the following language. ""To implement this policy, [DEL: the Committee seeks to promote

The primary instruction calls for maintaining ""about the money market con-
ditions that have prevailed on average since the preceding meeting"" because
the mid-points of the ranges for money market conditions noted in paragraph
(11) for the alternative A growth rates are closer to the average level of
money market conditions since the November 16 meeting than they are to
easier conditions recently prevailing. System open market operations until the next

similar to that adopted by the Committee on December 14. The choice of operating procedure depends in part on the Committee's
relative confidence in reserves or money market conditions as bearing a more
dependable relationship to bank deposit behavior..

This language differs from that adopted at the last meeting (as amended
on December 20) by omitting references to the ""months ahead"" and to
international developments, and it would be associated with different
money market specifications. To the extent that pressures from this
source do in fact develop, it is thought that past Committee discussion
gives the Manager sufficient flexibility to cope with them..
(8) If the Committee were to adopt the language of alternative
A, it may wish to consider instructing the Manager to ease the Federal funds
rate from the prevailing 3-5/8 per cent to the neighborhood of 3-1/4 per
cent in the first week following the meeting and to the neighborhood of 3
per cent in the second week, unless a sudden surge of M1 growth were to
appear. The estimates for total reserves,
seasonally adjusted and rounded, consistent with the proposed targets I and
II are shown in the table; and detailed weekly and monthly seasonally un-
adjusted figures have been prepared for use if this alternative procedure
is adopted..
(11) Since effects on money market conditions would be a
secondary consideration in the Manager's operations under alternative B,
the Committee need not prejudge the direction of the funds rate, as would
be the case under alternative A. Depending on developments affecting the
demand for money, the funds rate under this procedure might rise or fall
from currently prevailing levels, and the rate movements could be sub-
stantial.",4,"Alternative B, on
the other hand, places primary stress on bank reserves as the operating
target variable, with a money market conditions constraint in a proviso
clause. If
such an approach were successful in moving M1 onto the path specified by the
Committee as desired, the staff believes that the odds are that the funds
rate would need to be raised in the ensuing weeks in order to keep growth
in M1 around the target rate, particularly if a 6 per cent target path for
M1 is adopted but also perhaps under an 8 per cent target..

June weakness in narrowly defined money supply temporarily reflected in
some part either direct or indirect effects of large outflows of dollars
from the U. S..
(10) With respect to money and short-term market conditions,
the staff's best current estimate is that the Federal funds rate will need
to move up from the recent 4-1/2--4-5/8 per cent range--given rising trans-
action demands for cash associated with expansion in GNP--in attaining the
reserve path and aggregates of alternatives B or C, with a more pronounced
rise likely under alternative C. If loan demands
strengthen as expected, and assuming bank sources of funds become more
costly and show only moderate growth (as is most likely under alternative C),
banks would probably become more reluctant buyers of longer-term issues of
securities. (19) Alternative C.

be associated with little change in money market conditions. Under this
alternative, M 1 would be expected to grow over the fourth and first
quarters combined at about a 7-1/2 per cent rate, the same rate as had
been specified for the third quarter under alternative A in the last
bluebook. (The period of heavy Treasury borrowing will not come
until October, but some financing may be needed in September, possibly close
to the time when the System will also be selling Treasury issues to absorb
the excess reserves released by the combined effects of changes in Regulation D
and J.) Even under alternative A, although little change would be anticipated
in the Federal funds rate, the 3-month Treasury bill rate might rise from
its recently depressed rate by 50 basis points or so during the fourth quarter,
and very likely will advance further in early 1973. Even under alternative A
a moderate slowing of inflows to accounts is expected to occur; under
alternative B the higher level of short-term market rates would have a
more noticeable effect. As shown in the table on page 8,
growth in M2 over the fourth quarter is expected to slow progressively
more than M1 under alternatives B and C..

would probably remain relatively stable until late in the year. (18) Alternative A.

less aggressively to slow growth in the aggregates--moderating the ex-
pansion of M1 to an annual rate of 7-1/2 per cent in the fourth quarter
and 6 per cent in the first. Upward pressure on
short-term rates, of course, would be considerably greater under alternative B--
and more so under C. Thus, the 3-month bill rate might rise to 5 per cent
or more by the end of the fourth quarter under B and could be approaching. Even under alternative A
a moderate slowing of inflows to accounts is expected to occur; under
alternative B the higher level of short-term market rates would have a
more noticeable effect. However, the increases

expansion in M1 down to a 6-1/2 per cent annual rate by the fourth quarter. Under this approach, the response of
interest rates would be less marked than under
Alternative C; the Federal funds rate would be expected to fluctuate
around 5-1/4 per cent, about 50 basis points above its recent level. The money market rates associated with
alternative C would reduce inflows still further, and given present
rate ceilings, they could also make all but the highest yielding longer-
term accounts non-competitive with market instruments by the time of

objectives. In addition, apart

alternative A, but would probably show greater upward adjustments, at
least in the short-run, under alternatives B and C. Demands on bond

run paths for the aggregates that include a 5--6 per cent annual rate of
growth for M1, the longer-run target specified by the Committee at its
last meeting. For example,
in alternative B, the January-February M 1 growth is indicated at
per cent, as compared with the 5--6 per cent longer-run target. It is
expected that revenue sharing payments in January and the beginning of
tax refunds next month will exert some temporary stimulus to growth in
holdings of cash and time and savings deposits..
(13) To achieve the aggregates of alternative B, the staff
expects that money market conditions will tighten from around prevail-
ing levels, given the continuing strong transaction demands for money
implicit in the rapid growth in nominal GNP projected for the first and
second quarters. The potential for money market tightening implied by
the alternative B monetary target paths is indicated by the 5-5/8--6-1/4
per cent Federal funds rate range shown for that alternative. A
rise in the funds rate of the dimensions contemplated in alternative B
would likely be accompanied by a further rise in short-term rates generally,

experience, the sharp drop in demand for money relative to GNP growth

upward revision in the projection of nominal GNP for the second quarter..

Treasury bill rate is likely to move back up into a 6-1/4--6-5/8 per cent
range under alternative B. In this assessment of the bill market, we have not assumed any substantial
reflow of funds from abroad..

the conditions of alternative B partly as restraint on bank credit availa-

funds rate is expected to rise into the upper part of a 10 to 12-1/2
per cent range between now and mid-September. Under alternative A, we would expect the funds rate to drop between now and the
next meeting, though perhaps not to the bottom of the indicated range..
(18) Other key assumptions in the monetary relationships pre-
sented are: (a) continued strength in business loan demand on banks;
(b) some reduction in demand for consumer and mortgage credit; (c) con-
tinued active demand by banks for large CD funds, though perhaps less
aggressive demand than in the past four months taken as a whole;
(d) greater bank reluctance to participate in the securities market, par-
ticularly under alternative C, in view of the wide spread of their bor-
rowing costs over their return on portfolio. Retention of the reference to domestic financial developments
is proposed only for alternative C, the one alternative that contemplates
a significant tightening of the money market. Alternative C

(9) Alternative A specifications include a 6-month growth rate for
M I of 6 per cent, the rate required to reach the longer-run 5-1/4 per cent path
by March. It also implies a smaller drop in interest rates than does
alternative A. The market interest rates
decline envisaged under alternative A and B would lead to greater growth in
consumer-type time deposits than under C and hence to somewhat greater growth
in M2 . For the period through August, these
are as follows: M1, 5 per cent; M2 , 7-1/2 per cent; and the bank
credit proxy, 14 per cent.

to a 4-1/2 per cent trend line (shown by the dotted line on the chart)
that starts from the September money supply estimate available at the
last Committee meeting. (9) Given the lagged effects on money demand of the interest
rate increases of earlier this year, the staff believes that attainment of the
growth rates for reserves and monetary aggregates specified in alternative B
is likely to involve a further decline in the Federal funds rate over the
near-term. Under alternative B, and even more
so under A, short-term market interest rates are likely to decline over
the next few weeks as market expectations of further easing in policy
are confirmed. Bank prime rates probably would be reduced, and some
further rate declines would be likely to occur in long-term markets..
(12) Although the interest rate declines anticipated under the
easing alternatives might be fairly sharp, it is quite likely that rates
will turn around, particularly under alternative B. Thus, under alternative B, bill
rates might be back in the neighborhood of current levels, or perhaps
above them, by around year-end. The degree of any reversal would be
tempered, however, if it proves necessary to reduce the funds rate
somewhat below the bottom of the alternative B range later this year in
order to achieve the desired monetary growth path..
(14) Other key assumptions underlying the monetary relation-
ships discussed in this bluebook are: (1) resumed expansion of out-
standing large negotiable CD's, as banks experience moderate business
loan growth and seek to offset a run-off on balance in U.S. Government
deposits between now and year-end; (2) expansion of other time and
savings deposits at banks at a moderate rate under alternative C as
money market conditions remain unchanged and short-term interest rates
rise from current levels, with net inflows strengthening under the
easier conditions of alternatives B and A; (3) reimposition of some
sort of interest rate ceilings on consumer-type certificates maturing
in 4 years or more at banks and other savings institutions, with the
ceiling structure working to redistribute savings flows at the margin
toward nonbank savings institutions. Alternative B

encompass a Federal funds rate centered in a 9-1/2--10-1/2 per cent range
and member bank borrowings that fluctuate around $1.5 billion. However, it has become very difficult in recent weeks to anticipate shifts
in member bank demands for borrowing as market conditions change, and
these estimates of borrowing could even be a bit on the high side..
(11) Under alternative C, unless the Federal funds rate declines
to the lower end of the indicated range, Treasury bill rates are likely
to move somewhat higher, as expectations of additional easing in monetary
policy are disappointed. The degree of any reversal would be
tempered, however, if it proves necessary to reduce the funds rate

cash borrowing until March (unless foreign central banks find it necessary
to redeem sizable amounts of Treasury specials) and sharply diminished
Federal agency borrowing; and (4) moderate growth in consumer-type time

cent growth rate in M 1 over the second and third quarters combined..
(13) A somewhat more rapid longer-run rate of growth in M1 than
adopted by the Committee at its last meeting, such as envisioned under
alternative A, appears necessary if money market conditions are not to
tighten further. Under alternative A, the staff would expect the Federal
funds rate to trade most frequently around 11-11 per cent..
(14) The funds rate has been subject to upward pressure, in
part because of a shift of bank borrowing preferences from the window to
the funds market. We have assumed that member banks
will want to increase their borrowing (apart from special borrowing) to
about $2 billion per week on average under alternative A, given the roughly 3
percentage point spread of the Federal funds rate over the current 8 per
cent discount rate. Special borrowing by a problem bank may add another
$1 billion or so to borrowing levels..
(16) With the money market conditions assumed under alternative
A, the staff would expect M1 growth in May-June to be in a 5-7 per cent
range. We would expect this tendency
to continue even under alternative A, so that M2 growth over the second and
third quarters would be expected to slow to around 6.5 per cent, and in
M3 to about 5.0 per cent--on the order of 4 percentage points below the
average annual rate of expansion in the fourth and first quarters..
(18) Restraining M1 growth to a 5 per cent annual rate over
the second and third quarters--as under alternative B-- would be
expected to put somewhat more pressure on the money market, with the
Federal funds rate rising to around 12 per cent between now and the
next Committee meeting. The
time and savings deposits experience at banks and thrift institutions
would be expected to deteriorate further--with deposit flows at thrift
institutions probably negative as the Treasury bill rate adjusted
sharply upward, perhaps to near 10 per cent..

borrowing fairly heavily through CD's, and to obtain funds in the Euro-

growth for M1 in alternative C has been set to compensate for this
upward revision. This relationship

(19) To achieve the even greater restraint on monetary ex-
pansion called for under alternative C, the Federal funds rate would be
expected to rise to around 13 per cent over the next few weeks. If, as seems
quite possible, such resistance intensifies, CD growth could be substantially
less than projected, bank credit expansion could be constrained, and
strains in other financial markets (including the Euro-dollar market) could
be exacerbated..
(21) Under alternative C and possibly also B, sharply higher
interest rates would erode asset values and bring the adequacy of bank
liquidity into question. Alternative C has the greatest potential for such a pattern,
and might well bring about a severe wrenching of market conditions. In alternative C, it is proposed to give special emphasis to that

be in a 4-6 per cent annual rate range under alternative B. Given the
small rise in September, the 5 per cent growth rate from August to March
implies a 6 per cent rate from September to March--i.e. over the fourth
and first quarters..

alternative B may involve a further easing in the 3-month commercial paper

The 3-month Treasury bill should continue to fluctuate very widely--say,
in a 6-8 per cent range--and may average a bit below 7 per cent, although
very large additions to the supply of bills in the days immediately ahead

is indicated to be in a 7-9 per cent annual rate range under this
alternative, reflecting the cumulative impact of the monetary easing
that has already occurred and an expected sharp, temporary spurt in M1
growth late in the year when U.S. Government deposits are projected to
decline substantially (after seasonal adjustment)..
(9) Alternative A provides for the greater easing in money
market conditions over the near term that would be needed if the Committee
were to adopt higher longer-run targets for the monetary aggregates,
indexed by a 6 per cent growth rate for M1 . Mortgage markets would ease at a more rapid pace
under alternative A, since there would be a more substantial rebound
in deposit inflows at thrift institutions as market interest rates
dropped further..
(12) Bank credit growth over the months ahead is likely to
be moderate. While the prime loan rate could be expected to decline further under
either alternative A or B, it would still probably remain high relative
to market rates in the weeks ahead. Banks may, however, show more interest in
security acquisitions in the period ahead than they have most recently,
particularly under alternative A but also to some extent under
alternative B, to take advantage of the apparent opportunity for
capital gains. Alternative A

for M1 previously adopted by the Committee. The funds rate range for
this alternative centers on 8 per cent. Alternative C provides for the
tightening of money market conditions that would be required if the
Committee were to lower its longer-run target for M 1 to 5 per cent..
(11) Under alternative B, net inflows at banks of time and
savings deposits other than money market CD's would probably remain
fairly substantial. Banks may, however, show more interest in

December-January period under both alternatives may be on the low side
of longer-run growth rates, but growth would be expected to increase
somewhat later on as a result of the lagged impact on money demand of
the further interest rate declines..
(12) Alternative A encompasses a higher 7 per cent annual rate
of growth in M1 between now and mid-year. Market expectations of a further decline in the discount rate might
begin to develop, but they would become much more pronounced if the
funds rate were to drop as much as is implied under alternative A.
(14) Net inflows of time and savings deposits (other than
money market CD's) at banks are likely to continue to be relatively strong
under each of the alternatives presented, with growth highest, of course,
under the easiest alternative. Alternative A

by extending the 5 per cent August-March growth path to June. Between now and the
next Committee meeting, alternative C would appear to entail a Federal
funds rate of around 8-3/8 per cent, and alternative B around 8 per cent--

extend into the fall..
(11) Because of the further weakening in GNP growth, pro-
jected by the staff, some further decline in interest rates over the
next few months now appears to be required to achieve the monetary
aggregate objectives of either alternatives C or B. Between now and the

should be noted that the lower interest rates are not assumed to persist
throughout the whole first half of the year, as will be explained below..
(8) Alternative A encompasses the 6 per cent longer-run annual
rate of growth for M1 (over the seven-month November '74-June '75 period)
that was preferred by the Committee at its last meeting, the achievement
of which would now require a 6 per cent growth rate over the first half
of this year. (9) Interest rate declines under alternative A may begin to be
reversed as spring progresses. Assuming the Committee were to wish
to hold monetary growth to around a 6-7 per cent annual rate in
the second half of the year, this would appear to require an upward
adjustment of the funds rate, as well as other short-term market
interest rates, at a fairly early stage..
(10) The specifications of alternative B contemplate a smaller
decline in the Federal funds rate over the next few weeks than under
alternative A. Because alternative B puts in place a lesser degree of monetary stimula-
tion over the near-term, it would appear that any reversal of the interest
rate decline would be delayed more than under alternative A. Similarly, over the
longer-run, growth rates for money supply would be slower; for example,
over the first half of 1975 M1 growth might be at around a 5 per cent
annual rate..
(13) The net inflow at banks of time and savings deposits
(other than money market CD's) is expected to continue at about the
pace of the fourth quarter of 1974 under alternative C. Greater
inflows of consumer-type time and savings deposits are assumed under
alternatives A and B in the months immediately ahead, but under
alternative A the rate of inflow is assumed to drop back somewhat in
the spring as interest rates begin to rise. Given the apparently weak mortgage demand, downward pressures on mortgage
interest rates might be expected in the months ahead under all three
alternatives, with declines in mortgage rates the largest, of course,
under alternative A. Alternative A

begin rising in spring in anticipation of continued exceptionally large
Treasury cash needs in the second half of the year combined with a pick-up
of total private credit demands (assuming that an economic recovery in
the second half is still anticipated at that time)..

by a Federal funds rate centering around 7 per cent. M1 growth in
the January-February period under this alternative would be expected to

last meeting in its longer-run targets for the first half of '75. The projected
relationship between M 1 and M2 is changed because a further decline in
market interest rates is now assumed to be necessary if the indicated
M1 growth rate is to be attained by mid-year, and that should result
in larger inflows of consumer-type time and savings deposits..
(10) Given the January shortfall in M1 and the sharply weaker
economy now projected by the staff for the first and second quarters
of this year, we would expect it to be necessary for the Federal funds
rate to decline to around the middle of a 4-5 per cent range between now
and mid-March if the growth in the aggregates as shown under alternative
A were to be attained. Alternative A

reserve and money market conditions consistent with more rapid
growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead than has
occurred in recent months.",3,"Some further decline in the funds rate might be
needed by early spring..
(12) The specifications of alternative B involve attainment
of a 6 per cent rate of growth in M1 by September, rather than by mid-
year. The
annual growth rate for M1 over the first half of this year under
this alternative would be around 4 per cent, while M2 would expand
at about a 7 per cent rate..
(13) Alternative B contemplates a further decline in the
Federal funds rate over the next few weeks to about the middle of a
in the spring may not prove necessary, assuming that GNP is no weaker
than projected for the first half of this year and that the sharp
expansion in economic activity projected for the third quarter develops..
(14) Private short-term credit demands are expected to remain
weak into early spring, but the Treasury is likely to borrow an additional
$15-$18 billion of new cash between now and mid-April. The provision of
bank reserves and easing of money market conditions needed to sustain
growth in the monetary aggregates, as specified in alternative B, should,
at least over the near-term, permit the new Treasury debt to be absorbed
at declining interest rates, though the reductions may be modest. (15) Alternative C contemplates a smaller reduction in the
funds rate than alternative B and hence a less rapid growth in the
monetary aggregates between now and the end of summer. Alternative B

out to be as strong as projected in the Green Book..

closely approximates the longer-run growth rates that accompanied the
specifications chosen by the Committee at its last meeting. Growth rates in
the other monetary aggregates are somewhat larger than the earlier speci-
fications because of shifting relationships among the various forms of
liquid assets..
(10) Under alternative A, a further decline in the Federal
funds rate to around 5 per cent--the mid-point of the 4-5 per cent
range shown--would be anticipated over the next few weeks. Given the rapid summer growth needed to attain a 6 per cent
rate over the nine month period, the funds rate and other interest rates
would likely need to rise fairly sharply in the late summer and fall if
the Committee wishes to maintain M1 growth in the period after September
at around the 6 per cent annual rate..
(11) Consumer-type time and savings deposits at banks and
thrift institutions would also be likely to expand somewhat more rapidly
than in recent months under alternative A, given the further decline in
market interest rates that is assumed. The Federal funds rate range centers
on 5 per cent. Growth rates in key monetary aggregates would, of course,
be slower than under alternative A--as indexed by a 7 per cent annual
growth rate in M1 over the seven month February-September period and
a 5 per cent growth rate over the first nine months of the year..
(13) Market interest rates probably would rise somewhat over
the weeks ahead under alternative B. And with the
change in prospects for savings inflows, mortgage market conditions would
not be likely to ease much, if any, further..
(16) Turning to the behavior of M1 in the March-April period,
expansion is indicated to be in a 4-6 per cent range, given prevailing
money market conditions (typified by a 5 per cent funds rate) as called
for by alternative B. Near-term growth, of course, would be somewhat more
rapid under the easier money market conditions of alternative A and some-
what less rapid under the tighter conditions of alternative C. Money growth
rates, in general, are expected to accelerate by early summer when tax
rebates are added to the public's cash and time deposit holdings (assuming
prompt passage of a tax reduction bill). Alternative A

that would be associated with little change in money market conditions
from those recently prevailing. The Federal funds rate range centers
on 5 per cent. Growth rates in key monetary aggregates would, of course,
be slower than under alternative A--as indexed by a 7 per cent annual
growth rate in M1 over the seven month February-September period and
a 5 per cent growth rate over the first nine months of the year..

projected, the weight of Treasury and corporate long-term credit demands
would tend to exert upward pressure on market rates..
(15) Alternative C indicates growth paths for the monetary
aggregates intended to be consistent with some tightening of money market
conditions over the weeks ahead, A rise in the funds rate back above
initiate a sharp upward adjustment in yields on Treasury securities and
a turn-around, though perhaps less marked, in other market rates. And with the

of interest-bearing deposits, growth in broader measures of money would
be moderated, relative to alternative A. Bank credit expansion would be
reduced somewhat, but with business and consumer loan demands expected
to be weak at least over the next month or two, banks would still be in
a position to participate heavily in Treasury financings..

been adopted by the Committee for the March '75--March '76 period at
its April meeting. (8) The longer-run path for M1 in alternative B does imply
a somewhat more rapid rate of growth from March '75 to March '76 than
contemplated by the mid-point of the 5-7 per cent range adopted by the
Committee at its previous meetings. The
growth rate from March '75 to March '76 implicit in the currently pro-
posed alternative B is around 7 per cent (based on mid-points). This is,
of course, within the adopted range, though toward the upper end..
(10) As an operating guide for the intermeeting period under
alternative B, the short-run specifications include a rise in the Federal
funds rate to a range centered on 6 per cent. Maintenance over the weeks immediately
ahead of prevailing money market conditions (as shown for the short-run
specifications of alternative A) would probably not be inconsistent with
the longer-run objectives of alternative B, but such an approach would
appear to entail the need for a more substantial constraint on monetary
growth later on, and hence a larger rise in the Federal funds rate later
in the summer. Tightening of the money market over the intermeeting period, as con-
templated under alternative B, would work to lower these growth rates
slightly, but most of the effect of higher interest rates on the monetary
aggregates would develop later on..
(15) A significant rise in the Federal funds rate--for example,
to the 6 per cent mid-point of the alternative B range--would, however,
alter market expectations and lead to upward adjustments in interest
rates. Adjustments in longer-term rates might be moderated by market
expectations of a continued slowing in the rate of inflation, a gradual
reduction in the prospective volume of new offerings, and by the
relatively substantial upward slope to the yield curve that now exists..

maintenance of prevailing money market conditions between now and the
next Committee meeting. (9) While alternative B calls for maintenance of prevailing
money market conditions in the short-run, given the temporary slowing
expected in M1 growth, it appears likely that money market conditions will
need to be tightened further later on in order to achieve growth in the
aggregates as indexed by expansion in M1 over the next year at around
the center of the 5-7 per cent range adopted by the Committee at its
last meeting. On that assumption we would expect
M1 growth in the second half of 1975 to be at about a 7 per cent annual
rate; a lower growth rate in the first half of 1976 would hence be
required if the Committee's longer-run M1 target is to be achieved..
(10) In the table on p. 6a, under alternative B, the one-year
growth rate for M1 from June '75 to June '76 is shown as 5 per cent--
which is  point below the mid-point of the 5-7 per cent target range. The staff used such a rate in the alternative B calculations because
the substantial overshoot in M1 growth during June raised the base
level for that month by about $1.7 billion above the estimate made
at the previous FOMC meeting. The long-run growth rate under
alternative B measured on a quarterly average basis--that is, from the
average level for M1 in the second quarter of 1975 to the average level in the
second quarter of 1976--is around 6 per cent, as is also shown in the table..
(11) The same one-year growth rates are shown for alternative C
as for alternative B--with alternative C implying a somewhat different pattern
of monetary growth rates and interest rate movements over the two six month
periods, as will be noted below. Adoption of this alternative would introduce an increased monetary restraint
earlier than under alternative B. Over the July-August period M1 growth under this
alternative would be expected to be at about a 3-5 per cent annual rate,
with growth over the last half of 1975 at around a 6 per cent annual
rate, or one percentage point less than under alternative B..
(13) If the Federal funds rate were to rise in coming weeks
to the 6 per cent mid-point of the alternative C range, a very sub-
stantial upward adjustment in other short-term rates would likely ensue. However, if the Federal funds
rate were stabilized at around 6 per cent, as is contemplated under
alternative B, no more than minor upward market rate adjustments, if
any, would seem likely in the weeks immediately ahead. Alternative B

(12) The short-run specifications for alternative C contemplate
some further near-term tightening of the money market, involving a Federal
funds rate range of 6-7 per cent for the period until the next meeting. Over the July-August period M1 growth under this

the unchanged money market conditions contemplated for alternative

of 5-1/4 per cent..

more rapid growth in nominal GNP proves correct, we believe that
efforts to hold M1 expansion to the 6-1/4 per cent long-run target
will require further substantial increases in the Federal funds rate
during the fall and early winter--perhaps to 10 per cent or more
by early 1976..
(9) Alternative B--which contemplates a rise in the Federal
funds rate during the intermeeting period to 6-3/4 per cent (the
mid-point of the 6--7-1/2 per cent range presented)--is thought
to be consistent with the first stage of a possible longer-run
strategy that would hold M1 growth within the Committee's 5--7-1/2 per
cent target range--but near the top end of that range. Therefore, the staff
believes that this strategy would imply somewhat higher money market
rates early in 1976 than under alternative B..
(11) During the immediate August-September period, growth
in the monetary aggregates is expected to pick up from the depressed
July pace. Under alternative B, the average 50 basis
point advance in the funds rate would probably exert only a small
dampening influence on the aggregates during the two month projection
period; the average M1 growth rate for August-September might be reduced
to nearly 5-3/4 per cent. The market appears to have
made its adjustment to the higher funds rate now prevailing, and the
Treasury announcement of its somewhat increased third quarter needs
has already been taken into account by market participants..

contemplated under alternative B would probably trigger roughly
commensurate advances in other short-term rates, and long-term

ahead--would be expected to exert a more pronounced restraint on near-
term monetary growth. Market
repercussions from the rise in the Federal funds rate of 100 basis points
or more contemplated under alternative C, of course, would be more
extreme. Increasingly,
however, higher market interest rates will come to impinge on savings
inflows to the intermediaries, and under alternative C this impact
would probably be quite pronounced by the fourth quarter. This assumption reduces, but does not eliminate, the marked slowing
that would otherwise have been projected in the rate of expansion
of consumer-type time deposits and the more broadly defined measures
of money supply..

However, growth in consumer-type time and savings deposits also is
expected to strengthen a little, at least temporarily, from its reduced
August rate..
(12) Given the large amount of Treasury borrowing that is
being compressed into the next month or so, as well as the still sensitive
state of the municipal market, a significant rise in the Federal funds
rate--for example, toward the upper end of the 5-3/4--7 per cent range
of alternative A--would likely lead to substantial further yield advances. Interest rate increases would be accentuated if strengthening credit
demands on banks from businesses and consumers were at the same time
reducing bank willingness to add to Treasury security holdings..

in the Federal funds rate between now and the next meeting, the staff
believes the funds rate would have to rise later in the fall if the

period ahead in lagged reaction to earlier declines in short-term interest
rates and corporate bond yields, and in light of a continued relatively
comfortable inflow of savings funds to thrift institutions..

the Federal funds rate between now and the next Committee meeting, to the
mid-point of a 4 -5 per cent range. We
would expect that such a reduction in the funds rate would have to be reversed
at least by early next year in order to keep longer-run growth in M1 at
around the mid-point of the 5-7 per cent range, and that by Spring the funds
rate would be around 7 per cent..

in an arithmetic sense, for the shortfall in M1 growth relative to expecta-

level of M1 in the third quarter 1976(using mid-points of the ranges) would
be the same as that implied by a 6 per cent growth rate measured from the
third quarter of 1975. For the one year QIII '75-QIII '76 period,
the path contained in alternative B involves M1 growth of 5.3 per cent..
(12) Alternative A involves a decline in the Federal funds rate
from the 4 per cent level recently prevailing to the mid-point of a 3-4

recent behavior reflects mainly staff expectations that the projected
continuing rise in nominal GNP will be accompanied by resumed expansion
in money demand--given the unusual, and probably unsustainable, rise in the
velocity of money that has already occurred in the current cyclical expansion..

by the mid-point of the range stipulated for alternative B, M1 would
expand at only about a 3 per cent annual rate from the fourth quarter of

in store--as would be consistent with a further downward shift in the demand
for money. The funds rate under alternative B is expected to reach
an average level of around 6 per cent by the fourth quarter of this year. Appendix Table IV shows Federal funds rates
expected over the course of the year for each of the alternatives..

money market over the next four weeks to the mid-point of a 4-5 per cent
funds rate range in the process of moving toward lower longer-run growth
rates for the aggregates. This would tend to drop
the rate of growth in M2 toward the bottom of the indicated April-May range..

have to rise considerably further to achieve a 5 per cent M1 growth from

pace, though remaining stronger than in the latter part of 1975 and early

some further upward adjustment in longer-term, as well as short-term inter-

the June-July period, M2 growth may be in a 6-10 per cent annual rate
range under alternative B..
(11) Over the longer run, the outlook is still for upward
pressures on interest rates, particularly short-term rates. As may be

Federal funds rate of around 8 per cent by early next year, given a growth
rate in M1 from QI '76 to QI '77 of 5 per cent..

of the funds rate over the next few weeks to the mid-point of a 5-6

well be accompanied, at least temporarily, by significant declines in
long-term rates. In order to achieve growth rates in M-1
at the mid-point of the Committee's one-year range, however, the Federal
funds rate would have to begin to rise relatively soon and to reach a
level above those envisioned under alternatives B and C. Thus, under
alternative A, the Federal funds rate would be expected to average around
Directive language",2,"(8) Under alternative B growth in M-2 over June-July would
be expected to pick up somewhat, due mainly to the anticipated
strengthening in M-1. The stimulative effects on time and savings deposit
inflows of a continued rise in personal income and advances in offering
rates at some banks are expected to be about counterbalanced by the
delayed impact of earlier increases in short-term market rates..
(10) Given this background, and assuming that Federal funds
continue to trade at around 5-3/8 per cent as contemplated under
alternative B, it seems probable that short-term rates will remain
close to current levels in the near term. However, there might well be
some backup in long-term rates in the aftermath of the recent rally that
carried corporate and municipal yields to around their lowest levels in
several years..
(12) The staff projections suggest that under alternative B
the Federal funds rate would have to advance to an average of about 6
per cent in the first quarter of next year if M-1 growth in the QI '77-

growth of the aggregates than projected then and the slightly slower
growth of nominal GNP now expected in late 1977 and early 1978. Because short-term market interest rates also would be expected to be

cent annual rate--the midpoint of the M-1 range adopted by the Committee
in April for the QI '77-QI '78 period.1/ M-2 growth over the five quarter
period under this alternative would be at about an 8 per cent annual rate,
however, a shade below the midpoint of the current M-2 range..

is the same as that adopted by the Committee at its previous meeting. Growth in M-2 is
expected to be in a 7-11 per cent annual rate range during the July-August
period, as the time and savings deposit component of that aggregate continues
to expand at near its recent pace..

late this year and in the first half of next year if the midpoints of the

achieved. (The

(14) As noted earlier, both alternatives C and D contemplate
lower longer-run growth ranges for the monetary aggregates than alternative
B. Given the degree
of near-term ease assumed, the funds rate by spring may have to be at or
slightly above the level assumed at that time under alternative B in order
to constrain monetary growth in the first half of next year to the indicated
rate. Meanwhile, however, for most of the one-year period ahead, short-
term rates would have been lower than under alternative B, with consequent

funds involved in maturing ""wild card"" certificates. (16) The rise in market rates of interest over the next few weeks
accompanying short-run alternative C (or D) would probably carry the 3-month
Treasury bill rate above the 5 per cent ceiling rate on thrift institution
savings deposits. Under alternative C we would expect that thrifts
would become less willing to commit funds to the mortgage market at near
the recent pace. In any event, upward pressures
on corporate and tax exempt bond yields are likely to be relatively modest,

other institutional investors..

in either case the Committee may wish to consider a rise in the funds rate

(18) An easing in the Federal funds rate to 6 per cent, as
envisioned under alternative A, could stimulate a substantial downward
adjustment in short-term market rates. Under alternative A, M-1 is likely to expand at a 6 per cent average

in the second and third quarters of 1978 to about a 4 per cent annual
rate.",2,"Given the Federal funds rate assump-

to be in a 6-10 per cent annual rate range under alternative B.
Commercial bank savings deposits, after contracting in November, are
likely to resume modest growth over the period, even though market
yields will remain above rate ceilings on such deposits, as the most
interest sensitive holders have probably shifted to other instruments. As in October-November, however, most of the expansion
in the interest bearing component of M-2 is likely to occur in large
denomination time deposits not subject to interest rate ceilings..
(14) If the Federal funds rate remains near its present
alternative B, short-term rates probably will remain fairly
near their current levels. With additional monetary restraint in place sooner,
the staff would expect growth in the monetary aggregates to be some-
what slower over the next few months than under alternative B. Con-

aggregates adopted by the Committee in October for the QIII '77-

that growth in M-1 at around the 5-1/4 per cent mid-point of the pro-
posed alternative B range would lead to a 5.6 per cent annual rate of
expansion over the 15-month period starting with QIII '77 and to a 6.3
per cent annual rate of growth over the 18-month period beginning with
QII '77--in both cases within the current FOMC range, but above the mid-
point. However, the staff expects that further increases
in market interest rates will be required relatively soon in order to
limit growth in this aggregate over the QIV '77 to QIV '78 period to
the mid-point of the longer-run 4 to 6 per cent range associated with
alternative B. Money demand can be expected to be relatively strong over
the year. C

order to constrain M-1 growth, the Federal funds rate under alternative
B begins to rise next month and reaches an average of 8 per cent in the
fourth quarter, as shown in Appendix I.1/. (11) Under alternative B, growth in M-2 over the January-
February period is likely to be in a 5 to 9 per cent annual rate
range. But
relatively strong growth in large denomination time deposits included
in M-2 can be expected as banks offer these instruments aggressively
to offset slow growth of deposits subject to Regulation Q.
(13) If the Federal Funds rate remains near its present
alternative B, short-term market interest rates will probably remain
near current higher levels. However, on January 25,
the Treasury will announce terms for refunding more than $5 billion of
publicly-held issues maturing in mid-February; the Treasury may also
take the occasion to raise $1 to $2 billion of new money..

reversal of the early January rise in short-term interest rates. Meanwhile, the dollar would probably tend to soften in international
exchange markets..
(22) The approach of alternative A appears most consistent
with a monetary policy that encourages more rapid growth in the monetary
aggregates over the longer-run than under either alternatives B or C.
Nevertheless, given the strength projected for economic activity, the
near-term decline in the funds rate under A would probably soon have to
be reversed to restrain growth in the aggregates to rates consistent
with the mid-points of longer-run ranges for alternative A.",2,"(8) Alternative B continues the ranges for M-1 and M-2

(12) A Federal funds rate centered on the recently prevailing
level of 6-3/4 per cent, as contemplated under alternative B, is likely
to be associated with M-1 growth over February-March in a 1 to 6 per cent
annual rate range. In addition, the restraining impact on money demand from the relatively
sharp 1-3/4 percentage point increase in short-term interest rates that
took place between the spring and fall of last year will be exhausted
relatively soon; since October short-rates have risen only about another
in money demand relative to income, the Federal funds rate would probably
have to begin rising again in April and reach 8 per cent by fall in order
to constrain M-1 growth for the QIV '77-QIV '78 period to the mid-point
of the 4 to 6-1/2 per cent alternative B range.1/. (14) Growth in M-2 over the February-March period is likely
to be in a 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 per cent annual rate range under alternative B.",4,"Since around year end, net
inflows of deposits to thrift institutions have persisted at a rate
considerably lower than previously anticipated, and, as a result, the
staff has reduced its projections of such inflows over the year ahead..
(9) Each of the alternatives presupposes an upward adjustment
in deposit ceiling rates at banks and thrift institutions of 50 basis
points on small-denomination time deposits; the adjustments in ceiling
rates are assumed to occur in April under alternative C, in May under
B, and in June under A. M-1 growth at around the 5 per cent
mid-point of the proposed alternative C range would nearly compensate
for the slight fourth quarter overshoot but not for the larger third
quarter overshoot. (18) Under alternative C the Federal funds rate would rise
over the intermeeting period to the mid-point of a 7 to 7-1/2 per cent
range, and the February-March annual rate of growth of M-1 and M-2 would
likely be in 1/2 to 5-1/2 and 4 to 8 per cent annual rate ranges, respec-
tively. At the same time,
the rise in short-term interest rates associated with this alternative
would tend to strengthen the dollar on international exchange markets..
(19) The tightening of money market conditions contemplated
under alternative C would further slow the net inflow of deposits sub-
ject to rate ceilings in the weeks immediately ahead and thus would
increase the need for an adjustment in deposit ceiling rates. However, given the projected strength of money demand,

(16) An easing of the Federal funds rate to around 6
per cent, as contemplated under alternative A, would be very
surprising to the market in light of the weakness of the dollar
in foreign exchange markets and recent indications of acceleration in
the rise of wholesale and retail prices.",2,"Under alternative B, the Federal
funds rate would be expected to remain unchanged over the inter-
meeting period and then begin rising thereafter, reaching about 8
per cent by fall. Given the Federal funds rate assump-
tion of alternative B--with the rate centered at the 6 per cent
level prevailing since early January--M-1 growth over March-April
is likely to be in a 4 to 9 per cent annual rate range..
(11) The modest pace of inflows to thrift institutions
can be expected to persist in March-April under alternative B.
Growth of deposits at mutual savings banks and savings and loan
associations, combined, may be around a 6 to 7 per cent annual rate. Moreover, further
reductions in new commitment activity and in spot purchases of
mortgages from mortgage bankers and others can be expected..
(12) If the Federal funds rate remains at the 6 per
cent level contemplated under alternative B, short- and intermediate-
term interest rates over the intermeeting period are likely to
remain near their current levels. Moreover, rates on shorter-term Treasury securities could remain
low relative to other market rates, should foreign central banks
continue to acquire large amounts of such securities as a result
of their intervention activities in foreign exchange markets..
(13) Under alternative B, mortgage rates might rise
somewhat further in the intermeeting period as thrifts adjust
lending policies in response to sustained weak deposit inflows.",4,"Under alternative C, restraint would
begin earlier; thus the required upward adjustments in the funds
rate over 1978 would be somewhat less.1/ The levels of interest
rates consistent with each alternative imply continued relatively
slow growth of interest-bearing deposits subject to rate ceilings
at banks and thrift institutions, even though the projections of
deposit aggregates assume a 50 basis point increase in time deposit
ceiling rates in the months ahead..
(9) Against this background, M-1 growth is expected to
accelerate in the weeks ahead. Furthermore, the forward calendar for
tax-exempt offerings continues below the exceptional 1977 level and
interest in such issues by fire and casualty insurance companies,
commercial banks, and individuals are projected to remain sizable..
(14) Alternative C contemplates an increase in the Federal
funds rate to the mid-point of a 7 to 7-1/2 per cent range between now
and mid-April. Such borrowing has been relatively low recently, and no banks are under
administrative pressure at the window..
(15) The sizable increase in short-term rates likely to
develop under alternative C would probably be accompanied by only
modest upward pressure on bond yields in the intermeeting period. By contributing to
slower deposit inflows, however, alternative C would add to near-term
upward pressure on mortgage rates and increase the need for an
adjustment in deposit ceiling rates..
(16) An easing of the Federal funds rate to around 6

encourage more rapid growth in the aggregates over the longer-run.",2,"Alternative B would continue the ranges for M-1 and M-2 adopted
by the Committee in February for the QIV '77 to QIV '78 period. To hold M-1 growth
over the coming year to a rate around the mid-point of the 4 to 6
per cent range of alternative B would, under the circumstances, require
a larger increase in interest rates than the staff had earlier
expected. As indicated in Appendix I, we would anticipate a Federal
funds rate averaging around 8 per cent by early next year if the mid-
points of the longer-run ranges of alternative B are to be attained. Assuming M-1 growth at the 5 per
cent mid-point of the alternative B range, V-1 would be projected
to rise by about 7 per cent over the coming four quarters, more than
twice the average rate of the past two years. As contemplated under alternative B, a Federal funds
rate centered on the recently prevailing 6-3/4 per cent level is likely
to be associated with M-1 growth over the two-month period at an annual
rate in a 6 to 10 per cent range. However, growth would be more
rapid over the course of the second quarter--with M-1 expansion at
about an 7 per cent rate from March to June..
(13) Growth in M-2 over the April-May period is likely to
be in a 6 to 10 per cent annual rate range under alternative B.
Savings deposits at commercial banks are expected to show very small
growth at best, though larger-than-seasonal tax refunds to individuals
may temporarily strengthen flows into these deposits in coming weeks. Since a
major portion of these deposits is included in M-2, the interest-bear-
ing component of this aggregate is expected to continue at near its
recent pace..

and other mortgage lending policies of thrift institutions are likely
to be tightened further..

quarters. As can be seen from the lower
panel of appendix table III-1, the 6 per cent M-1 growth contemplated

whole M-1 growth may be around a 7-1/4 to 7-1/2 per cent annual rate--

M-1 growth over the QIII '78-QIII '79 period is to be at around the
upper end of a 4 to 6 per cent range, abstracting from the effects of
ATS.1/ This represents an upward adjustment in the level of interest
rates forecast by the staff. The interest rate forecast might have
been expected to decline because alternative B in effect forgives
the ""overshoot"" in M-1 growth during the third quarter and, hence,
does not imply as low a rate of monetary growth over the next few
quarters as it did earlier. There has been no evidence of such a shift in recent quarters,
and without the restraint of even higher interest rates than earlier
projected it appears that growth in M-1 (or M-1+) would run above the
alternative B range. Thus, under alternative B, M-2 growth for
the year ahead is expected to be in a 7 to 9 per cent range and
M-3 growth in an 8 to 11 per cent range,  and 1 percentage point
higher than current longer-run ranges. It would also be
consistent with the longer-run policy stance indexed by alternative B,
as well as with near-term efforts to support the dollar in exchange
markets. The tightening of the funds market over the weeks ahead
envisaged by alternative II would--by introducing restraint earlier--
increase the likelihood that the funds rate would not have to rise
into the upper part of the 9 to 10 per cent range projected for next
year under alternative B.",7,"Of course, net inflows of
deposits to thrifts should slow from its recent pace in the months
ahead, as rising interest rates further moderate inflows of deposits
subject to fixed rate-ceilings, the effects of the stock adjustment
from other financial assets wane, and depository institutions perhaps
become less aggressive in offering the new certificates as the spread
continues to narrow between their deposit costs and mortgage rates..
(13) The longer-run alternative C ranges encompass growth
rates for M-2 and M-3 nearer to those currently in place. In addition,
alternative C calls for a slower longer-run growth in M-1--in a
upper end of that range would tend to compensate for the ""overshoot""
in M-1 expansion over the first three quarters of this year and would
lead to about a 6 per cent annual rate of growth from the end of
line of appendix III-1..
(20) Alternative II calls for an increase in the Federal
funds rate to around the mid-point of a 9 to 9 per cent range during
the intermeeting period. This alternative appears particularly
appropriate if the Committee opts for the slower longer-run growth
in the aggregates encompassed by alternative C.",3,"No Sentences Alternative D",0

in a 6 to 10 per cent annual rate range over the November-December

to depress M-1 growth over the two-month period by 2 to 4 percentage
points, a bit less than previously assumed..
(13) Under alternative A, M-2 is projected to expand in a
more rapid pace than in recent weeks. Growth in the
interest-bearing component of M-2 is expected to be at about a 9 to
expansion in large time deposits that are not subject to interest
rate ceilings..
(16) If the Federal funds rate remains within the 9 to 10
per cent range over the intermeeting period, as envisioned under
alternative A, interest rates on short-term market instruments will
likely fluctuate within a narrow range. M-1 growth would likely be in a 2 to 7 per cent annual rate range over
December-January, and M-1+ and M-2, respectively, in a  to 4 and
rates of interest would further slow the growth of deposits subject
to fixed rate ceilings, induce more aggressive offerings of MMC's
and large denomination time deposits, and a tightening of bank lending
terms--with the prime loan rate moving up to 11 or 12 per cent.
Long-term yields would also probably move up, but the light financing
calendar and further evidence of the System's determination to con-
strain monetary growth would tend to limit such movement..
(19) If M-1, as expected, expands at a 4 per cent annual
rate in the fourth quarter, the longer-run growth range for this
aggregate implies an M-1 growth over the first three quarters of 1979
at a 2 per cent annual rate.1/ Assuming the staff's current GNP
projections and some downward shift in money demand, the staff believes
that such growth in M-1 is generally consistent with the Federal funds
rate ranges shown in Appendix I. Reflecting monetary restraint already
in train, the midpoint of alternative A would call for no further rise
in the funds rate over the longer-run policy period. This additional restraint on monetary
expansion would imply that the funds rate could be lower than the

expectation that M-1 growth over the QIII '78 to QIII '79 period
would be around the upper limit of a 4 to 6 per cent range in the
absence of new transactions accounts, such as ATS. Given
that assumption, alternative B proposes a 1-1/2 to 4-1/2 per cent
range for M-1; this range assumes--unlike recent M-1 ranges--that
the more likely growth of M-1 is at the mid-point rather than near
the upper end.1/ The range is narrower than that adopted in October
but remains a little wider than earlier M-1 ranges to reflect some
continued uncertainty about ATS effects. However, the staff expects that the demand for M-1 will not be so
strong over the year, on average, as to require a significant change
in the prevailing Federal funds rate if M-1 growth at the midpoint of
the alternative B range is to be achieved over the year 1979. The staff projection of the quarterly pattern of the funds rate for
each alternative is shown in Appendix I..

is expected to be in a 4 to 7 per cent range and M-3 growth in a

would be consistent with both the alternative B and C longer-run
ranges. The

As shown by the middle column of the table, M-1 would have to grow
at a 8-1/4 per cent annual rate from January--and M-2 by a 10-1/4
per cent annual rate--to reach the level in March that is implied
by growth along the midpoint path of the longer-run QIV '78 - QIV '79
range. Growth for M-1 would have to be about 3 percentage points
lower to reach the low end of the alternative B range of growth,
and 3 points higher to reach the upper end. C

are the same because the lower interest rates under alternative A more
promptly open the ceiling rate differential on MMCs favoring thrift

to thrift deposits. Such a move

proposed alternative B range plus the revised, lower ATS effect also is equal
to an M-1 growth adjusted for ATS effects of about 6 percent..
(12) Alternatives A and C, respectively, represent somewhat
easier and tighter policies with regard to the aggregates. Thus, alternative B' essentially repre-
sents continuation of growth in M-1 at about 6 percent: the midpoint of
the alternative B' range is 5 per cent, and we have assumed that ATS
effects retard M-1 growth by only about 1 percent. Thus, they assume that alternative B for 1979 is followed by
B/B'--an unchanged policy with respect to the aggregates--the Federal
funds rate is expected to decline somewhat by early 1980 (to a level
of around 9-1/2 percent), assuming economic activity weakens about as
projected. The lower panel of the chart compares
the projected July-August expansion with the proposed alternative B
longer-run range. The dotted line in the chart also
shows annual growth rates needed from the actual June level to reach
targeted midpoint levels by the fourth quarter of 1979 under the
current longer-run range and proposed alternative B; these growth rates
2/
are 2 percent and 5-1/2 percent, respectively. Growth at the
midpoint of the alternative II range would bring M-2 to about the mid-
point of its current (and also proposed alternative B) longer-run
growth range by August..
(19) Virtually all of the expected slowing in M-2 in July-
August, relative to May-June, reflects the more modest growth of M-1. As in other recent months, large-
denomination time deposits are not expected to contribute to growth
in M-2 as banks continue to supplement their demand and small denomination
time deposits growth with Eurodollars and RPs.

moderate the expected recession in economic activity and tend to increase
the quantity of money demanded in early 1980.",4,"Of the
alternatives shown below for Committee consideration, alternative B involves
a November-December growth rate for M-1 that achieves a 4 percent rate of
expansion from September to December, but with an accompanying M-2 growth
above the Committee's earlier target. (12) Alternative B involves acceleration in money growth rates
over the balance of the year from their recent pace, with M-1 expanding
at a 5 percent annual rate on average in November and December and M-2
at a 9 percent rate. This would probably be reflected mainly
in a rapid December growth rate..
(13) The staff would expect that expansion in the aggregates
as specified under alternative B could be attained by growth (at annual
rates) in the family of reserve measures over November and December as
follows: monetary base, 7 percent; total reserves,7 percent; and non-
borrowed reserves, 15 percent. For purposes of constructing the nonborrowed
reserve path, given the current discount rate, member bank borrowings
were assumed to average $1 billion, the same initial assumption as
adopted by the Committee in early October..
(16) Pressures on thrift institutions are unlikely to ease over
the next few weeks under alternative B. It is not likely,
though, that mortgage market conditions will improve markedly unless
short-term market rates drop significantly and/or adjustments favorable
to thrift institutions are made in deposit ceiling rates..
(17) The specifications of alternative C involve slower growth
in the monetary aggregates than alternative B, as indicated in the table
in paragraph (11). On the assumption that adoption of this
alternative would mean that the Committee desires greater assurance that
growth rates for the aggregates will not be excessive, the upper limit of
the proposed funds rate range has been raised slightly from that of
alternative B. Consistent with such an approach, the nonborrowed reserve
path for this alternative has been constructed on the assumption that
borrowings average a shade under $2 billion, implying growth in nonborrowed
reserves of around 8 percent over November and December--considerably
less than the alternative B pace. Pressures on thrift institutions would
be somewhat more intense than under alternative B, mortgage rates would
probably rise a little further, and the bank prime rate would also be under
further upward pressure. Nevertheless, the higher rate levels than under alternative B would tend
to hold down money demanded in early 1980, implying a decline of
interest rates early in the new year if the Committee wishes to provide
the reserves needed to keep M-1 in the first quarter of next year on the
midpoint of its longer-run growth path--assumed for these purposes to be
a 6 percent rate of growth.1/. The growth in the
monetary base and total reserves over November and December implied by
that alternative--at 7 and 7 percent, annual rates, respectively--are
only slightly more rapid than under alternative B. The funds rate range proposed for this alternative is 10 to 15 percent,

the discount rate were raised, in light of a continuing relatively wide gap
between the discount and federal funds rates, additional nonborrowed reserves
would have to be provided unless the Committee wished to tolerate further
upward pressures on market rates--a decision that might depend in part
on the behavior at the time of monetary aggregates, total reserves, and
the monetary base..

growth rate for M-1 over the first quarter in alternative A--which appears to
involve increases of about 8 and 3 percent in the monetary base and total
reserves, respectively--may be accompanied by relatively substantial
declines of interest rates from current levels..
(18) The federal funds rate may drop to, or conceivably below,
the bottom of the 10 to 15 percent range specified for alternative A
over the next few weeks, and the 3-month bill rate could be in a 9 to 10
percent area. Of course, if the discount rate were reduced
significantly under the circumstances, member bank borrowing would be
somewhat higher..
(20) The substantial decline in short rates that appear to
be implied by alternative A probably would be accompanied by significant
downward pressures on the international value of the dollar, especially
if the dollar also remains under pressure because of the crises in the
mid-East. Net inflows of funds
to thrift institutions are likely to pick up only modestly from their
second half of 1979 pace, and costs of such funds would not decline as
much as under alternative A. The exchange value of the dollar under
alternative B is likely to decline somewhat as market participants focus
on the decline of interest rates, but there would be less downward pressure
than under alternative A, in part because any interest rate declines under
alternative B would be associated with slower money growth..
(24) The more modest money growth over the next few months under
alternative B provides more scope for expansion in M-1 in the second half
of 1980 than does alternative A. Moreover, the smaller reduction of interest
rates, as compared with alternative A, would provide less stimulus to nominal
GNP and money demand later this year.",4,"Downward pressures would be strongest if market participants
come to expect a further decline in U.S. interest rates and interpret the
decline of interest rates as a sign that the Fed's resolve to combat
inflation has weakened..
(22) In order to achieve the 5 percent rate of growth of M-1
in the first quarter specified under alternative B, a decline in interest
rates from current levels would also be likely. (23) Even the more modest decline in money market rates
associated with alternative B is likely to induce a rally in bond markets
as it becomes clear that interest rates have peaked. The exchange value of the dollar under

longer-run policy of alternative II, interest rates would probably begin
rising by spring as the quantity of money demanded tended to expand more
rapidly than the supply that would be provided consistent with the 4 percent
midpoint of the alternative II path..
(25) Alternative C contemplates a rate of growth of M-1 of
about 4 percent in the first three months of 1980, which, given the
staff's GNP outlook, would probably involve little, if any, decline in
interest rates from current levels in that period. Alternative C would tend to help support the exchange
value of the dollar since it would be associated with maintenance of a
relatively high level of interest rates..

targets for the current and next quarter, implying a step-up in M-1A growth
from January to March to about a 5 percent rate, with more rapid expansion
in the second quarter. (20) The more rapid rate of growth in money of alternative A
would, as shown in the charts following page 13, cause aggregates growth
to rise by March to levels above the mid-point paths of alternative II;
by June the aggregates would be further above mid-point paths.",2,"Alternative B is indexed by growth in M-A
of 4 percent from December to March, and, for all practical purposes,
can be considered to be equivalent to the 4 percent M-1 target for that
period adopted at the last meeting. (16) Given a GNP projection in which the economy is not as weak
as earlier anticipated, alternative B may be accompanied by little change
in the funds rate over the next few weeks. Under such circumstances, there
may be little if any reduction in the demand for borrowing under alternative
B from around the $1 billion average level of January. On that assumption,
nonborrowed reserves, like total reserves, would change little from
January to March..
(17) The easing of money and credit demands in the second
quarter, when the economy is projected to weaken more substantially than
in the first, enhances the probability of some decline of interest rates
at that time, particularly if the Committee were to opt for the slight
acceleration in M-1A growth over the March to June period to the 5 percent
annual rate proposed in alternative B. Consequently,
in order to achieve longer-run targets, policy would have to be more
expansive in the second half of the year, leading to more substantial
downward pressures on short rates at that time than under alternative B.",5,"Thus, if
monetary growth over 1980 is to be kept around the mid-point of the
alternative II range, reserve supply would have to be more restrained
in the second half of the year--with the federal funds rate probably rising
at a time when the economy is projected to be weakening even further..

M-1A targeted to expand at a 3 percent rate over that period. As shown in the charts, the more rapid rates of growth of
aggregates anticipated under alternative A would carry them to levels in
June above their midpoint paths. Nonborrowed reserves would expand at about a 6
percent annual rate in the February to June period..

develop under alternative A might be viewed by the markets as inconsistent
with the new anti-inflation program.",3,"The funds range
currently in effect is shown under alternative B. If the Committee wished to return to a narrower range, the staff
would suggest that a 13 or 14 to 18 percent range would be generally con-
sistent with alternative B under present market circumstances (and similar
adjustments would need to be made to alternatives A and C). (8) Alternative B extends through June the FOMC's previous
target rates of growth of M-1A and M-1B for the December to March period
of 4 and 5 percent annual rates, respectively. With a significant weakening in these
aggregates recently, and with nominal GNP growth projected by the staff
to decelerate in the spring quarter, such average rates of growth might be
consistent with a federal funds rate over the next few weeks not far from
the 16 to 17 percent level that has prevailed recently.1/ Restraints on
use of credit cards and check overdraft facilities in the new anti-inflation
program could tend to increase the demand for money (or more particularly
currency), but probably by no more than a minor amount, if at all, since
a certain amount of spending might be curtailed and some spenders may simply
write more checks on existing demand deposit holdings..
(9) The staff expects that under alternative B M-2 for the
December-June period would grow around 7 percent and by 7 percent from
February to June. However,
The specified growth for February-June represents a significant slowing
from the February pace, and as shown in chart 2, such growth would place
M-2 in June at the midpoint of its longer-run range..
(11) The specifications of alternative B imply an annual rate of
growth from February to June of the monetary base and of total reserves of
about 7 percent and 5 percent, at annual rates, respectively. Thrifts and mortgage

increase in M-IA over the next two months. As indicated in the charts, M-1A

implying less rapid growth of the narrow money stock (and higher interest
rates) in the second half of 1980 than the other two alternatives..
(19) To achieve alternative A targets, total reserves might have
to expand at an annual rate of 5 percent in the March to June period. Such growth of
reserves probably would be associated with a fairly substantial drop in the
federal funds rate in the intermeeting period, perhaps into the lower half
of the 12 to 19 percent range suggested for this alternative..

Alt. (10) Alternative B retains the December to June target rates
of growth for M-1A and M-1B adopted by the Committee in March. Even though real GNP is expected to decline
significantly this quarter, the rate of increase in nominal GNP is still
projected at over an 8 percent annual rate, suggesting a need for appreciable
growth in transactions balances.1/ However, given the restraining effects
on money demanded of past increases in interest rates, and with real economic
activity apparently slowing significantly, the May-June increases in M-1A
and M-1B required under alternative B may lead to a decline in the federal
funds rate to the 16 to 17 percent area, or perhaps even lower, over the
intermeeting period..
(11) The specifications for alternative B call for a 6 percent
rate of growth of M-2 for the December-June period, and a 6 percent rate
from March to June. M-3 growth under alternative B
is projected at a 6 percent annual rate over the March-June span,
considerably slower than in the first three months of the year..
(13) Growth in the aggregates at the rates specified under
alternative B implies an annual rate of growth from March to June of the

borrowing as it develops would be considered to be economically equivalent
to nonborrowed reserves and therefore the nonborrowed reserve path would be
automatically adjusted to offset fluctuations in such credit..

percent annual rate between April and September, and continuation of that
growth rate over the remainder of the year. The federal funds rate range
suggested for alternative A is 10 to 14 percent. Thus, although
nominal GNP is projected to rise at only a 5 percent annual rate in the
second half of the year, our econometric models would suggest that, at
current interest rates, money would tend to grow much more rapidly than
that, and probably somewhat in excess of the 7 percent alternative A path,
as the public attempts to restore recently depleted cash balances. This
would generate upward rate pressures at a time when income velocity of M-1A
would be declining, a reversal of the normal situation.1/ If, however,
the recent evident weakness in M-1A should prove largely to represent a
lasting shift in the public's liquidity preferences, then upward rate
pressures might be minimal, or indeed there could be some further downward
drift in rates..
(13) The specifications for alternative A call for a considerable
pick-up in growth of M-2 for the May-June period, to about a 7 percent
annual rate. A return to MMMF growth after the decline
associated with the March 14 actions appears already to have begun, and with
market rates far below their recent peaks, growth of small time and savings
deposits, especially the 2 year variable ceiling certificates, is expected
to pick up..
(14) With the federal funds rate essentially unchanged in the
near term, as contemplated under alternative A, other market interest rates
probably would hold near current levels or edge upward a bit, especially
if and as monetary growth strengthened perceptibly. But even so loan growth at banks could pick up, particularly if
recent loan weakness makes banks a bit more sanguine about their ability
to remain within loan restraint guidelines..

a 1 percent annual rate if the level of adjustment borrowing is around
required reserves associated with the substantial reduction of weekend
Eurodollar arbitrage activities. Thus, there is more than usual uncertainty about the demand for
borrowing, and therefore about the level of the nonborrowed reserve path
consistent with money supply and total reserve targets of alternative B..
(11) Under alternative B, a funds rate in the 15 to 16 percent
range is likely to emerge over the weeks immediately ahead, and possibly
higher before the year is out. Finally, continued intervention by the U.S.
to slow the appreciation in the foreign exchange value of the dollar--which
is likely to continue rising under alternative B--could generate additional
pressure on Treasury yields as the Federal Reserve or Treasury offers
securities to the market to finance foreign currency purchases..
(12) The further increase in interest rates under alternative
Deposit flows are projected to decelerate, but to remain relatively ample. With mortgage rates already at levels that have begun
to choke off demand, new commitment activity for longer-term residential

around the current 8-1/2 percent discount rate, assuming adjustment (includ-
ing seasonal) borrowing at the discount window of around $200 million.",1,"Nonetheless, judging
from recent behavior, we would expect demand to be sufficiently strong
so that an effort to bring M2 growth down to the pace of alternative C
might be associated with rising interest rates. Longer-term rates may also decline, but the declines may be limited by
a resultant step-up in corporate bond offerings..

likely to be held down by CD run-offs at banks, as loan demand--particu-
larly from businesses--remains soft, and by declines in the assets of
institution-only money market funds, though at a slower pace than in
recent months..
(18) Alternative A envisions an easing in bank reserve positions
that would help move the broader aggregates more in the direction of the
short-run path expected at the last Committee meeting, but at the same time
would probably cause M1 to move even further above the Committee's
previously held expectations for the second quarter. A
similar easing of money market conditions could be attained with a drop
in the discount rate to 8 percent, and borrowing to about $200 million..
(19) The approach of alternative A, particularly if it also
involved a cut in the discount rate, could lead to fairly sizable declines
in short-term interest rates, partly because it would tend to confirm that
the Committee was discounting the recent behavior of M1. (20) Over the longer run, looking toward the year as a whole,
alternative A would, with greater probability, involve M1 growth above
the FOMC's longer-run range, unless interest rates moved up again in the
second half of the year.",3,"(14) While estimates of the relationship between the aggregates
and bank reserve positions are subject to considerable uncertainty, the
money supply specifications of alternative B are expected to be consistent
with little change in the current degree of restraint on bank reserve
positions--that is, with borrowing at the discount window fluctuating
around $250 million, associated with a federal funds rate generally just
above the current 8 percent discount rate. Nonborrowed reserves in June
would be expected to expand at about a 9 percent annual rate, and total
reserves by about 6 percent..
(15) Under alternative B, there is little reason to believe
that interest rates in general would change much from current levels, given
the recent back-up in interest rates. Given the moderate
June growth expected under alternative B, M1 on a quarterly average
basis would expand at about an 11 percent annual rate, which would imply
a 2 percent decline in its income velocity--a much smaller decline than
in the first quarter but still in sharp contrast to the increases that
have usually been registered in the early stages of business cycle upturns..
(17) M2 growth under alternative B is anticipated to be around
a 9 percent annual rate over May and June on average.",3,"Since
the contemplated interest rate declines are small,a substantial impact on
spending would seem to be contingent on whether the easing engendered a
significant improvement in business and consumer confidence..

funds rate to the 9 to 9 percent area, would imply a level of adjustment

tightening of money market conditions over the next few months. From June to September, nonborrowed and total
reserves would be expected to expand at annual rates of about 5 and 4
percent, respectively..
(20) Under alternative A, M1 growth is anticipated to slow much
more substantially than growth in the other aggregates. On the other
hand, the large build-up in M1 balances of the past several quarters could
well support a rapid expansion in GNP without much further increase in M1
should confidence generated by continuing favorable economic news entail
a substantial reduction in demand for liquidity..
(21) Given recent market rate adjustments, it would seem most
likely that interest rates would generally remain near current levels
under alternative A or decline some. While thrift deposit flows might be
about the same as under alternative A, higher deposit costs would once
again begin to eliminate the earnings of a large number of S&Ls and MSBs,
exerting upward pressure on mortgage rates..
(26) Alternative C involves an approach that would exert
relatively strong restraint on the aggregates and credit markets over the
near-term.",4,"If and as short-term interest rates tend to stabilize, long-term rates
may tend to decline from current levels..
(23) Alternative B encompasses a further increase in pressures
on bank reserve positions in an effort to increase the-odds that growth
in the broad monetary aggregates will remain within their longer-run
target ranges and to exert even more restraint on growth of M1. Nonborrowed reserves would be about
flat if the level of borrowing rose to the range specified..
(25) M1 growth could be expected to slow to about 6 percent
from June to September under this approach and, assuming the market pressures
of alternative B were maintained through year-end, to expand at a somewhat
slower pace in the final months of the year. With the
level of borrowing at the discount window expanding to about $1 billion
and market interest rates rising, the current level of the discount rate
would be called into question, as indeed it also would under alternative B.
Total reserves would change little from June to September, and nonborrowed
reserves would drop by about 5 percent at an annual rate if borrowing
rose as specified..

ing declining to the $400-$600 million range. In foreign exchange markets, the dollar would tend to weaken, probably
falling below levels prevailing around the time of the July FOMC meeting..
(16) While growth in the monetary aggregates in the June-to-

correspond to the specifications for the third quarter adopted at the

is now behind, specified money growth rates over the June-to-September
period do not differ greatly from alternative B, but the emerging differ-
ence in money market conditions would more significantly affect develop-
ments in the fourth quarter..
(11) Under alternative B, the federal funds rate would be
expected to trade around 9-1/2 per cent (the 6 to 10 per cent funds rate
range shown for that alternative retains the specification of the current
directive). In foreign exchange markets, the dollar would tend to weaken, probably

(17) Alternative C contemplates a near-term tightening in
money market conditions with a view to gaining greater assurance that
all of the aggregates, including Ml, would end 1983 within their longer-
run ranges. The federal funds rate under alternative C might trade in
the 10 to 10-1/2 per cent range through the end of the quarter. Assuming no discount rate change, nonborrowed reserves
might decline at about a 6 per cent annual rate from July to September..
(18) The size and speed of the tightening in money market
conditions contemplated under alternative C is probably not currently
anticipated in the market. The dollar would come under considerable upward pressure on foreign ex-
change markets, especially if foreign central banks continued to demonstrate
a reluctance to raise their domestic interest rates..
(19) Under alternative C, M2 and M3 growth over the June-to-
September period might be somewhat below objectives specified at the
last Committee meeting, though M1 growth may be close to its 7 per cent
third-quarter objective. The probable dampening effect of these higher interest
rates on growth in money and income as the year progresses suggests the
likelihood that attaining longer-run money and credit targets for 1984

(10) The specifications of alternative B are expected to be
consistent with little change in bank reserve positions and money market
conditions from those recently prevailing. De-
spite a pickup in growth of transactions deposits, nonborrowed reserves
would probably change little under this alternative over the two-month
November-December period, owing primarily to the impact of lagged reserve
accounting and changes in the deposit mix..
(11) M2 growth is expected to slow a little in November and
December under alternative B from its rate in October, when its nontrans-
actions component was probably boosted slightly by the October 1 deregula-
tion. Should the decline in the Treasury cash balance be
exaggerated because of debt ceiling problems, growth in M2 and M3 may be
somewhat stronger as banks seek additional deposit funds to support
credit expansion in the absence of their usual Treasury balances..
(14) Market interest rates might tend to rise a bit under
alternative B, although the likelihood or extent of any such upward
pressure would depend in part on whether reserve paths led to federal
funds trading more consistently near 9-1/2 percent than has been the
case recently.",4,"The reaction of bond yields may be more muted, espe-

cent for M1 and M2 respectively over the March-to-June period--would
probably involve a little less pressure on reserve positions over the
intermeeting period than has been evident most recently..

would be around $550 to $650 million, and nonborrowed reserves would
increase at about a 10 percent annual rate. Moreover, a
tendency for growth in the monetary aggregates to be relatively strong,
as is anticipated in this alternative, particularly for M1 and M3, would
probably lead to market expectations that any moderation in the degree
of pressure on bank reserve positions was not sustainable..
(16) The approach of alternative A would probably lead to
more rapid GNP growth over the spring and summer than in the staff's
current forecast. Alternative A would be
consistent with language to ""maintain"" the existing degree of reserve
restraint (interpreted as borrowing averaging over time on the order of
$650 million).",4,"(9) The specifications of alternative B, which are those
considered most consistent with the staff's GNP outlook, call for some
slowing of M1 growth from the pace of the December-to-March period,
although this aggregate would remain above the midpoint of its longer-
run range in June. While M1 would
still be well in the upper part of its range by June, its expansion
would be expected to moderate further toward the middle of the range
over the second half of the year partly in lagged response to further
interest rate increases and also reflecting a slowdown in GNP growth..
(10) The expansion of M2 is expected to accelerate from its
unusually slow pace of recent months under alternative B--and the other
alternatives as well--after the extraordinary 5-1/2 percent rise in
its velocity in the first quarter. (11) Borrowing at the discount window of around $1 billion,
or perhaps a bit more, probably would be associated with the monetary
aggregate specifications of alternative B, and nonborrowed and total re-
serves could be expected to increase at annual rates of 3 and 6 percent,
respectively. While immediate
transitional adjustments to CRR seem to be behind us, it should be
lasting impact of CRR and the lengthening of the reserve period on bank
reserve management policies..
(12) The market has probably not entirely discounted the
degree of reserve restraint implied by alternative B, and interest rates
generally would be expected to increase somewhat further, with the Trea-
sury bill rate possibly moving up about 1/4 percentage point to around

of such pressure could be construed as consistent with the approach of
alternative B or an approach between A and B.

any, further rise of interest rates over the summer, assuming nominal GNP
grows no faster than the 9-1/2 percent annual rate currently projected
for the third quarter and given the rise of interest rates that has already
taken place..
(18) The deceleration of M1 growth under alternative B is
not expected to be accompanied by any significant slowing of M2 from its
rate of growth of the previous three months. Even so, with the economy and underlying credit demands

to its long-run range..
(20) Expansion in the aggregates as specified in alternative B
would probably entail growth of nonborrowed reserves at about an 8 percent
annual rate from June to September, with borrowing continuing to average
around $1 billion. If that occurred, it might entail greater expansion over
time in nonborrowed reserves--as banks more willingly lend and add to
deposits-and hence more money growth than assumed for this alternative..
(21) Interest rates generally might show little net change
under alternative B, though probably edging higher from the most recent
levels if funds traded consistently around 11-1/4 percent. Thus, alternative B may be consistent with growth in M1 over
the year 1984 in the area of 6-1/2 percent with only a little further
upward movement of interest rates.",5,"Borrowing in that area might involve

broader monetary aggregates under alternative B. Weakness in inflows to
MMMFs is already evident in the most recent data, as yields on these
assets have declined into fairly close alignment with the lower level

their offering rates continue to drop in response to previous declines in
other yields. However, M2 velocity in the first quarter

faster M1 growth over the three-month March-to-June period than adopted

alternative B, with nonborrowed reserves (including extended credit)

period as the expansion of transaction deposits moderates..
(20) In part, the slowing of M1 growth under alternative B is
expected to result from a substantial weakening in the demand deposit
component, working off a portion of its recent unusually large bulge. On a quarterly average basis, M1 would be expected to
increase at around a 10 percent annual rate, implying another appreciable
decline in velocity of more than 3-3/4 percent at an annual rate given
the Greenbook GNP forecast..
(21) Under alternative B, M1 by September would be about 10
percent at an annual rate above the fourth-quarter 1984 long-run target

(12) Growth of M2 and M3 is also expected to slow in the

such liabilities, however, should they decide to enlarge their securities
portfolios greatly given the unusually heavy fourth-quarter issuance of
Treasury debt and tax-exempt securities..

cations of a rapid drop in the dollar occurring in tandem with an easing of

tentative 1986 range. In

A to around 9 percent over March to June, noving this aggregate further
above the upper end of its long-run range, though within its parallel band. Under those circumstances, and particularly if transactions-
related demands were also on the strong side, greater restraint on reserve
positions and an increase in interest rates might be needed at some point
later in the year if M1 were to be constrained within its longer-run
range for 1986..
(15) Under alternative A, the stronger growth of M2--bolstered
by inflows from market instruments mainly into MMMFs and MMDAs--would move
this aggregate up into its longer-run range by June.",3,"(8) Under alternative B, which assumes maintenance of about
the current degree of pressure on bank reserve positions as indexed by $300
million in borrowing, M1 would be expected to grow at about a 7-1/2 percent
annual rate from March to June. (9) With reserve conditions unchanged under alternative B,
federal funds would be expected generally to trade in the 7-1/4 to 7-3/8
percent area. 1 On a
quarterly average basis, M1 would be expected to expand at a 9 percent
annual rate in the second quarter under alternative B, implying a drop in
velocity at around a 4 percent annual rate, given the staff GNP forecast..
(11) M2 under alternative B would be expected to increase
considerably more rapidly from March to June than its relatively sluggish
rate of growth in the first quarter, partly as shifts to bond and stock
investment vehicles moderate as portfolio adjustments to the recent surge
in securities prices abate.",3,"Bank credit growth through the second
quarter would be further restrained by softness in business loans as
corporations rely more heavily on bond financing in response to a further
drop in long-term rates..

March-to-June period. This could entail some rise in interest rates over the second half,
especially if economic activity strengthens as expected..
(9) M2 growth under alternative B also would slow over the rest
of the second quarter--though still recording a much faster advance than
during the first three months of the year. As
growth of core deposits ebbs, banks should resume issuance of large CDs to
help finance some pickup in bank credit growth from its recent depressed
pace, and thus M3 is expected to slow relatively little in June..

fluctuate near recent levels in coming weeks, with the 3-month Treasury

million and the federal funds rate averaging a little below 6-1/2 percent. (Alternative A would also be consistent with a combination of a 6 percent
discount rate and maintenance of borrowing at the current $300 million
level.)",2,"(19) M1 growth under alternative B, which assumes reserve pres-
sures remain unchanged, would average 8 percent at an annual rate over the
next three months. M1 growth on a quarterly average

under alternative B, owing to the arithmetic carryover effect of the
rapid buildup of cash balances in recent months. Such an increase in M1,
given the 4-3/4 percent growth in nominal GNP projected in the third
quarter, implies a decline in M1 velocity somewhat in excess of 6 percent--
about the same as the average pace over the past year and a half..
(20) M2 growth under alternative B would slow further from
June, remaining close to the midpoint of its longer-run range through
September. M3 would grow at
around its pace of both May and June under alternative B, also keeping it
close to the midpoint of its longer-run range. Overall debt growth, however,
is likely to remain in line with the pace of recent months..

a decline in the discount rate presumably would not be validated under
alternative B, and some edging up of rates from their most recent lows
could be expected, especially should economic activity begin to show signs
of the moderate strengthening as anticipated in the greenbook forecast.",5,"M3 growth, though, would not be expected to
accelerate as much since some of the pickup in core deposits would be

tion to the usual economic news, financial markets may be confronted with
important developments in tax reform and federal budget policy that could
significantly affect investor sentiment during the weeks ahead..
(14) Alternative A involves an easing of pressures on reserve
positions, either through a reduction in regular adjustment plus seasonal
borrowing to a frictional level of perhaps $150 million or so, or a cut in
the discount rate by 1/2 percentage point with discount borrowing maintained
at the current specification of $300 million. M1 would be expected to increase at a 16 percent rate
between June and September under this alternative, moving even further above
the upper end of its range by the end of the quarter..
(15) Short-term rates would decline appreciably, with the 3-month
Treasury bill rate falling toward 5-1/4 percent under alternative A. Bond
yields probably would also decline, but any sustained sizable drop likely
would require signs of continuing sluggishness in the economy and lack of
price pressures, as well as the absence of substantial weakness in the dollar.",3,"Even so, with
reserve conditions about unchanged as assumed for alternative B, growth of

velocity of M1 would be at an 11 percent rate in the third quarter, nearly as
large as the 12 percent drop in the second quarter..
(11) The money growth specifications of alternative B imply
increases in both M2 and M3 from their fourth-quarter base to September of
around 8-1/2 percent at an annual rate, with growth in M1 at nearly a 14 per-

circumstances, both M2 and M3 are likely to remain fairly high in their
long-run ranges, growing perhaps around 8-1/2 percent from QIV 1985 to QIV
registering a record postwar decline..
(13) Short- and long-term interest rates are expected to remain
around their current levels under alternative B, at least initially, though
with federal funds continuing to trade in a 6-1/4 to 6-3/8 area some modest
upward pressures on interest rates could emerge as market participants begin
to reassess the odds on a near-term easing in policy.",5,"Growth within that range would seem to require a moderate increase in pres-
sures on reserve positions, as embodied in alternative C. The dollar could come under heavy selling pressure with this alternative,
unless key foreign central banks were also to take easing steps..

ings to a near-frictional level of $150 million or a one-half percentage
point cut in the discount rate with borrowings kept at $300 million. Absent monetary easing abroad,
lower short-term rates would tend to lessen the attractiveness of dollar
assets, and any heightening of inflationary concerns in this environment
could place the foreign exchange value of the dollar under considerable down-
ward pressure..

December.",2,"(8) Under Alternative B, which assumes continuation of the cur-
rent degree of pressure on reserve positions, growth in M2 and M3 expected
over the next four months would leave these aggregates at the 9 percent
upper ends of their annual ranges. M1 growth for the year under all the alternatives
is projected to be not far from the 14-1/2 pace registered so far this year..
(9) Under alternative B, reserve paths would continue to be
constructed assuming $300 million of adjustment plus seasonal borrowing at
the discount window. While forthcoming inflation indicators may suggest only a moderate
uptick in price pressures, as in the staff forecast, strength in near-term
data on economic activity, expansion of broad money measures along the upper
bounds of their ranges, and the continued downtrend in the dollar in foreign
exchange markets expected under this alternative would tend to limit the
potential for retracing the recent climb in bond yields..
(10) M2 growth under alternative B is expected to average around
below its average pace in July and August, but still well in excess of in-
come growth. With
money market rates staying around current levels under alternative B, in-
flows from market instruments to liquid retail accounts should continue to
be stimulated by their relatively attractive returns, though flows would
tend to be somewhat smaller than in recent months, reflecting the diminishing
impacts of earlier declines in market rates. Growth in M2 also may be restrained by further ebbing in the expansion in
overnight RPs as net purchases of Treasury securities by banks continue to
abate as interest rates stabilize..

sociated with the federal funds rate dropping to appreciably below 6-1/2
percent. Moreover, the staff expects
the dollar to remain under downward pressure with alternative B, in light of
slow progress in the adjustment of nominal external imbalances, arising in
part from weak growth in our major trading partners. Under these conditions,
markets are likely to continue to anticipate a firming in monetary policy
before very long..
(10) Under alternative B, M2 growth is expected to be held down
in May, in part by the unwinding of tax payment effects. While an increase in velocity
would be expected with the further rise in the average opportunity cost on
M2, under alternative B this increase would be somewhat greater than predicted
by most available models of M2 demand. M2 growth in the second quarter
apparently is being depressed by special factors, perhaps related to a draw-
down of balances accumulated late in 1986 when capital gains were realized,
and to shifting preferences for financing consumer purchases out of liquid
assets rather than with credit..
(11) M3 growth is expected to average around 6 percent in May and
June under alternative B, keeping this aggregate near the lower end of its

May, M1 likely will be flat in May on a monthly average basis before rebound-

growth would represent a moderation from the average pace since the fourth
quarter of last year, in response to the upward movement of market interest
rates. Under alternative B, quarterly average growth

to developments in the Persian Gulf and other factors bearing on the
inflation outlook and the dollar..
(10) Under alternative B, and the other alternatives as well, M2
growth is projected to strengthen in August and September relative to the
weak expansion of recent months. Given the staff's greenbook projection for nominal
GNP, M2 velocity would be expected to increase at a 3 percent rate, around
the pace of the first half of the year..
(11) M3 growth over August and September would be expected to
accelerate substantially from its unusually depressed July pace, to a rate
of 7 percent under alternative B. Bank credit should resume its expansion,
boosting issuance of large CDs. Since mid-July, growth of
both demand deposit balances and NOW accounts has resumed, and expansion of
M1 at a 5-1/4 percent rate is expected on average over August and September
under alternative B. (13) With respect to the long-run ranges, M2 growth from the
fourth quarter to September is expected to come to only 4-1/4 percent under
alternative B. Expansion at around an 11-1/2 percent rate over September to
December would be required to hit the lower end of the long-run range in the
fourth quarter; 9-1/2 percent growth would be needed to bring this aggregate
to the lower end of its growth cone in December. M3 growth from its fourth-quarter
base would be at a 5-1/4 percent rate by September under alternative B. Growth of M1 from the fourth quarter of 1986 to
September is projected at 6-1/2 percent under alternative B; with rates re-
maining close to current levels under this alternative through the third
quarter, M1 growth for the year is not likely to differ very much from its
growth through September..
(14) Alternative A assumes adjustment plus seasonal borrowing of
$300 million would be used to construct reserve paths.",8,"Prospects
would be good that the aggregate would move well within its range in the
fourth quarter; the steeper yield curve expected under this alternative would
provide additional incentives for businesses to focus credit demands on banks
and for home mortgage credit to be met through ARMs at thrifts..
(16) Alternative C assumes an increase in the reserve path allow-
ance for discount window borrowing to $700 million. The dollar's recent firmness in exchange markets
would be more likely to persist, at least for a time..

bond yields..

would accelerate from their pace of recent months, bringing M3 to the lower
bound of its long-run range.",2,"(9) Under alternative B, reserve paths would continue to be drawn
with adjustment plus seasonal borrowing at the $600 million level that has
been specified since early September. In light of the higher federal funds rate
compared with its level expected at the last FOMC meeting, the federal funds
range associated with alternative B, given in the last line of the table, is
suggested at 5 to 9 percent; this would be 1 percentage point above the range
now in the directive, and more nearly centered on the federal funds rates
thought likely to prevail under this alternative..
(10) The slight further firming of short-term rates likely under
alternative B would tend to support trading of the dollar on foreign exchange
markets at around current levels for a while. (11) The monetary aggregate specifications of alternative B assume
that the reserve pressures of this alternative are maintained through year-
end. Given its relatively large interest sensitivity,
M1 would be expected to grow at only a 3 percent rate over August to December,
implying quarterly average growth of 3-1/4 percent in the fourth quarter and
a 2-1/4 percent rate of velocity expansion..
(12) Growth in M3 from August to December is anticipated at a 6
percent rate under alternative B.",4,"For the
year, debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors is expected to rise by 9-1/2
percent on a quarterly average basis, in the middle of the annual range for
this aggregate..
(13) Under alternative C, the borrowing assumption would be raised
to $800 million. Bond yields probably would move higher, although if the mar-
kets were to view this measure as forestalling future inflationary pressures,
any rise in long-term rates could be rather small..
(14) Under alternative C, M2 growth over the August-to-December
period would slow to about a 3-1/2 percent pace, as opportunity costs of
holding M2 balances widened substantially further.",2,"No Sentences Alternative D",0

the funds rate would be likely to fall to, or a little below, the 6-1/2
percent area. But if pressures on the dollar are accentuated
by disappointing progress in federal deficit reduction or if U.S. economic
activity remains robust, an inverse relationship between the dollar and
bond yields could reemerge..
(16) Under alternative A, the further easing of the funds rate
could help allay investor concerns about immediate financial strains. M2 would be expected to increase at a
picked up noticeably from September when inflows had been damped by pre-
vious increases in interest rates..

that have come to prevail recently; the assumption for adjustment and sea-
sonal borrowing would remain at $450 million, with federal funds trading
expected to center at 7 percent or a bit below. (13) Under alternative B, persistence of the federal funds rate
near 7 percent implies that a substantial rise of Treasury bill rates would
accompany a partial restoration of normal interest rate relationships. Growth of
its M1 component would be expected to slow substantially following its
October bulge, with growth at 8 percent over the September to December
period and about 7 percent for the year..
(14) M3 growth over the fourth quarter at around 7 percent is
expected under alternative B, bringing growth for the year to 5-3/4 per-
cent, just within its annual range. Overall, the
debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors is projected to grow at around an
from the fourth quarter of 1986 to the fourth quarter of 1987..
(15) Under the reserve market conditions of alternative B, most
bond yields might edge higher as the increased preference for fixed-income
securities subsides and the possibility of further near-term monetary ease
is seen as diminishing.",4,"Alternative C would involve some slight firming of reserve
conditions, with borrowing being increased to $550 million and the funds
rate probably moving back to around 7-1/4 percent..
(12) The table below presents outcomes for money growth from
September to December that might be expected to accompany each of these
alternatives.1/ The margin of uncertainty surrounding these point estimates
is considerably larger than usual. While downward pressure on the dollar
could well intensify under this alternative, foreign central banks might
be more likely to ease monetary policies as the outlook for their export
industries weakens further..
(18) Alternative C calls for a slight firming of reserve pres-
sures, indexed by an increase in borrowing of only $100 million, and a rise
in the federal funds rate to 7-1/4 percent. Even so, the choice of alternative C before any dollar
decline were generally linked with renewed inflation concerns would risk
further disquieting domestic financial markets. Growth
in the aggregates under alternative C would be retarded a little over the
rest of the quarter by the renewed upward movement in opportunity costs
on monetary assets. This variant is shown with

current reserve and money market conditions, or seeking somewhat easier
(alternative A) or somewhat tighter (alternative C) conditions. Even so, the monthly pattern of M1 growth is expected to
produce an increase in velocity of 2 percent in the first quarter..
(14) The 1/2 percentage point lowering of the federal funds rate
under alternative A would bring it to the 6-1/4 to 6-3/8 percent area. (15) Lower short-term market rates relative to deposit offering
rates under alternative A would prompt more rapid inflows into M2-type
accounts.",3,"(9) Alternative B would involve federal funds trading continuing
to center around 6-3/4 to 6-7/8 percent. Private
short-term rates should decline once year-end pressures have passed,
while Treasury bill yields could edge higher, with the 3-month bill rate
rising to above 6 percent under alternative B. Should dollar weakness abate, and eco-
nomic indicators point to a softer economy along the lines of the staff
forecast, bond yields could drop somewhat from the elevated levels of
recent days..
(11) Under the unchanged reserve market conditions of alternative
B, M2 growth from November to March likely would pick up from the 3-1/2
percent average pace of October and November, placing this aggregate
just below the 5 percent lower bound of the growth cone associated with
its tentative 1988 range by March. This compares with
an increase in V2 that averaged 3 percent at an annual rate over the
first three quarters of this year..
(12) M3 is expected to grow at a 6 percent annual rate from Novem-
ber to March under alternative B, about the same pace as in recent
months; such growth would keep this aggregate through March well within
its tentative range for 1988. In all, the debt of
domestic nonfinancial sectors in March is expected to stand 9 percent at
an annual rate above its fourth-quarter base--the midpoint of its 7-1/2

around 9 percent above its fourth-quarter base, also in the middle of its
tentative range..
(19) Although some easing of reserve conditions is now thought by
market participants to be in train or at least in prospect, the reserve
specifications of alternative A embody a larger move by the Federal Reserve
than has been anticipated in market rates. The easier
conditions of alternative A are likely to put considerable downward pressure
on the dollar, though the extent to which this would show through in dollar
declines over the near-term would be affected by the incoming trade data. Under alternative A, growth of the

economic growth, broadly consistent with the staff forecast; consequently,
long-term rates are expected to vary around current levels, absent renewed
substantial downward pressure on the dollar..
(17) Under the specifications of alternative B, M2 would be
expected to grow in February and March at nearly a 7 percent annual rate, a
little above the average pace of December and January. From the fourth quarter, M1 by March
would rise at a 5-3/4 percent rate..
(18) M3, under alternative B, would advance at a 6 percent annual
rate from November to March as growth over February and March strengthens
somewhat from the 5 percent average of December and January.",5,"Alternative C would be associated with an increase in the
borrowing objective to about $450 million and a rise in the federal funds
rate of approximately 1/2 percentage point..
(15) Expected growth rates of the monetary aggregates from
November to March under each alternative are shown in the table below, along
with associated federal funds rate ranges. If economic conditions were thought to be quite soft--
weaker than consistent with the staff forecast--and incoming price data
suggested no more inflationary pressures, the drop in the dollar would be
less likely to adversely affect the bond market, which could register
further substantial gains..
(20) The tightening of conditions under alternative C would be
entirely unexpected, and probably would result in substantial increases in
both short- and, at least initially, long-term interest rates. Under the tighter reserve conditions of
alternative C, the broad aggregates would remain within the lower halves of
their tentative ranges through March. By reversing most of the interest
rate declines since October, Alternative C would tend to keep money growth
on a fairly slow path over coming months, dropping further below the
midpoint of the tentative ranges, and might be most consistent with the

which, in this context, would be likely to contribute to some increases in
U.S. interest rates..
(11) Given the financial conditions associated with alternative
B, M2 and M3 are expected to grow at 7 and 6-1/2 percent annual rates,
respectively, from March to June, leaving them well into the upper halves
of their 4 to 8 percent annual ranges. On a March-to-June basis, M1 is expected to increase
at a rate of about 4-1/2 percent under alternative B. Demand deposits are
anticipated to strengthen only a little on balance over the next three

borrowing objective would be raised to $400 million and the funds rate
would move up to the vicinity of 7 percent. M1 velocity would continue to
increase, but at a slower rate than in the first quarter..
(14) The more restrictive monetary posture of alternative C, at
least at this time, would come as some surprise to financial markets. But, an upward movement in U.S. interest rates, especially if
viewed as reflecting Federal Reserve resolve to avoid inflation and faster
external adjustment by containing domestic demand, would help to support
the dollar in the near term, and over time the net increase in bond yields
could be limited..

relatively little to the decline in reserve pressures.",1,"The assumption for adjustment

than anticipated at the last FOMC meeting are offset by upward revisions to
income, and the growth rates of M2 and M3, respectively, are projected to be
at the upper end and in the middle of the Committee's current 6 to 7 percent
short-run specifications. (9) Market interest rates now appear to incorporate the policy
stance of alternative B. Thus, with federal funds continuing to trade
around 7 percent, the three-month Treasury bill rate could remain in the

restraint in the face of the maintenance of the reserve conditions of alter-
native B, could result in a decline in the dollar..
(10) Under alternative B, opportunity costs of holding liquid
retail accounts would remain higher through midyear than in recent months,
given the likely very gradual response of offering rates on such accounts to
the recent rise in market rates. (11) M3 growth should moderate to around a 6-1/4 percent rate over
May and June under alternative B. Money market mutual funds in M3 probably
will decline further for a while as returns lag behind recently elevated

interest in refunding outstanding debt..
(14) Although market rates incorporate some near-term firming of
policy, an immediate rise in federal funds to the 8-7/8 to 9 percent area
associated with alternative C likely would elicit some further increase in
short-term market interest rates. Any upward pressure on the dollar would likely be mitigated
by firmer policy abroad, as foreign monetary authorities took advantage of
this opportunity to respond to the potential for inflation pressures in

income tax payments prove to be larger than anticipated, leading to a
sharper advance in required reserves and a larger drain in bank reserves..

decline in market rates over the intermeeting period, as well as a common
catch-up factor. As a consequence, this aggregate
through June should remain below the 3 percent lower bound of its target
cone, even under the reduced interest rates of alternative A. However, if
money market conditions of either alternative A or B were maintained
through the summer, the waning effects of earlier increases in market

the third quarter, assuming spending and income growth close to the green-

subject to further upward pressure, unless monetary authorities were to

money demand, given the interest rates of the three alternatives and
greenbook GNP, reflecting in part the depressing effect of the tax-related
drawdown on quarterly average M2..

current levels under alternative B, but could firm a notch if U.S.
interest rates were to back up..
(10) The 1/2 percentage point drop in the funds rate con-
templated under alternative A is larger than the easing of policy
currently anticipated in the markets; thus, short-term rates are
likely to move down under this alternative--but not by as much as the
cut in the funds rate--with the three-month bill rate drifting to near
operations alone, bringing the funds rate well below the discount
rate, market participants might speculate about the need for a dis-
count rate cut, and whether such a cut would be accompanied by an
additional easing. The dollar would decline on
foreign exchange markets..

would tend to trade around 4-3/4 percent, which could be fostered
either by lowering the borrowing specification by $50 million to $275
million or by lowering the discount rate by a further 1/2 point to
the present spread of the funds rate over the discount rate and thus
the current degree of cushioning of transitory shocks to the supply
and demand for reserves..
(8) Market participants in recent days appear to have built
in some prospects for additional easing of monetary policy in the
period ahead. With elevated federal borrowing needs over the intermeet-
ing period continuing to place upward pressure on Treasury yields,
rate spreads on private instruments over Treasury securities also
would be anticipated to stay relatively narrow..
(9) The size and timing of the 1/2 percentage point drop in
the federal funds rate of alternative A would tend to catch financial
markets unawares, inducing almost as large a drop in other short-term
interest rates. Large time deposits
would still run off, albeit at a slower pace than over recent months,
and M3 expansion would continue to be lower than growth of M2..
(15) The 1/2 percentage point decline in the federal funds
rate under alternative A would promote faster money growth than under
alternative B, improving the odds that the aggregates would end up in
the ranges. This reasoning yields projected M2 growth over the
next three months under alternative A of 4 percent at an annual rate.",4,"Under alternative B, the federal funds
rate would be expected to remain centered on 5-1/4 percent, in as-
sociation with an initial specification for adjustment plus seasonal
borrowing of $325 million. Nonetheless, the unchanged federal funds rate associ-
ated with alternative B is unlikely to engender a marked backup in
yields in financial markets over the intermeeting period, so long as
incoming nonfinancial and monetary data are mixed, as would be the
case under the staff's forecast. The value of
the dollar on exchange markets would ratchet lower in response to the
downward movement of interest rates in the United States relative to
those abroad..

rate would move down to 4-1/2 percent, achieved either through a 1/2
percentage point cut in the discount rate with the same level of bor-
rowing as under alternative B or through open market operations that
lowered the borrowing level to $125 million. Overall debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors is expected to
register a 5 percent rate of expansion over the September-to-December
period, placing growth for the year about 1/2 percentage point above
the bottom of the FOMC's 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent monitoring range for
this aggregate..
(12) The easing contemplated in alternative A exceeds that
now envisioned by the markets and thus money market interest rates
would decline, perhaps by at least 1/4 percentage point. The dollar likely would fall somewhat on
foreign exchange markets..
(13) M2 is projected to strengthen to a 4 percent rate by
December under alternative A and would be entering the new year well
into its tentative range. Tending to
limit the pickup in M2, though, would be declines in rates on retail
CDs and money funds in relation to expected returns on capital market
instruments; also, cost pressures might induce more banks to overcome
their hesitancy to lower rates on passbook and NOW accounts, which
could prompt established customers to reconsider investment options
and move account balances to market instruments..

volatility in the federal funds rate would be implied as the discount
window becomes a little less effective buffer to disturbances in the
reserves market..

of a further easing move in the period just ahead, and thus with the
unchanged funds rate of alternative B, other market interest rates may
tend to firm. (10) M2 would be expected to continue to expand at a 3 per-
cent rate in the November and December period under alternative B, the
same as expected at the October FOMC meeting. Under this policy alternative, M2 would be on a trajectory to enter

involves funds trading 1/2 percentage point below the discount rate,
would be technically possible, it likely would be associated with
somewhat greater day-to-day volatility in the funds rate. Announcement of a significant shift in Treasury
auctions away from longer-term notes and bonds and toward bills would
precipitate some decline in bond rates and rise in bill rates--judging
from recent market reactions to such proposals..
(12) Under alternative A, the 1/2 percentage point fall in the
funds rate to 4 percent would foster a smaller drop in other short-term
interest rates, given the expectations of near-term policy easing al-
ready incorporated in current market quotes. Unless data
were clear-cut in pointing to continuing weakness in the economy, the
half-point easing of alternative A--closely following the quarter-point
decline in the funds rate last week--would be seen as signalling a
priority on encouraging a strong recovery. Even under the lower short-term inter-
est rates associated with alternative A, these aggregates probably would
remain noticeably below the midpoints of their ranges. Restraint
on M3 growth will be exerted not only by heavier RTC activity but also
by a moderation in the expansion of bank credit and funding needs with
the fading of special factors that have boosted bank lending recently..
(17) The lower short-term interest rates associated with
alternative A would put M2 on a path that would carry it toward the
middle portion of its range later in 1992. While deposit rates will be
reduced further--perhaps appreciably at some institutions, if lower
market rates jolt them into reassessing long-standing rates on NOW
accounts and passbook savings--they are not likely to drop enough to
eliminate the additional stimulus to money growth of the lower interest
rates in alternative A. The faster M2 growth under alternative A
will show through to M3, though in muted form, since bank and thrift
credit growth will accelerate by less than M2 in the short run.",7,"Under alternative B, the federal funds rate would continue to

and others perceiving a signal that monetary easing in this economic
cycle was over..

Federal Reserve, leading to a significant downward revision in the
expected course of short-term interest rates for the next year or so. Federal debt, in contrast,
will accelerate noticeably, boosting overall debt growth to a 6 percent
pace over the second quarter and lifting the debt aggregate to within
its 1992 monitoring range at quarter-end..

required reserves on transaction deposits; but even after this bulge
abates, the total of required reserves plus required clearing balances
should be above the level needed for clearing purposes..

intermeeting period, and thus interest rates should remain close to
current levels under alternative B. Nevertheless, there could be a
downward bias to rate movements over coming months. Under the unchanged reserve conditions
of alternative B, M2 growth is projected to moderate to a 3-1/2 percent

(14) Under alternative B, the projected turnaround in M2 over
May and June should show through to M3, which is expected to register an
annual growth rate of 1-3/4 percent; from March to June, M3 would be
about unchanged. While growth of M3 for the year of 2 percent
is expected under the constant funds rate of alternative B, this projec-
tion would have to be shaded up or down by perhaps 1/4 point if alterna-
tive A or C were chosen at this FOMC meeting and sustained for the rest
of the year. This alternative would stress the Committee's expectation of a resump-
tion of growth in broad money over May and June, in contrast to the
traditional three-month specification, which would show little if any
monetary growth (for example, 1 percent for M2 and zero for M3 under
alternative B).",7,"Under the policy tightening of

tightening, no immediate policy change seems to remain the predominant
view. With interest rates on dollar-denomi-
nated securities becoming less attractive relative to returns abroad,
the exchange value of the dollar would adjust downward..

likely to fall well short of the rates envisioned at the time of the

this month and to grow at a 2-1/4 percent pace on balance over the
remainder of the year. This projec-
tion assumes the unchanged federal funds rate of alternative B ex-
tended through year-end and the Greenbook economic forecast. With the assumed income and interest
rates, standard money demand models predict velocity decreases through
this period; experimental models that embody yield-curve effects and
other alternative measures of opportunity costs are predicting veloc-
ity increases in the second half of the year, though not as large as
embodied in the staff forecast..

constraints on more expansive monetary policies in a few other coun-
tries, but with many countries, especially in Europe, highly unlikely to
follow suit, the dollar would tend to depreciate significantly further..
(9) A reversal of the July easing would take market partici-
pants completely by surprise and short-term interest rates would rise by
at least 1/2 percentage point under alternative C. Bond rates, too,
would retrace some of their recent declines under this alternative, at
least initially, and quality spreads on private debt could widen if such
a tightening were seen as placing the recovery at risk. The slightly faster growth in M2 deposits would feed through partly to
M3, as would relatively more attractive rates on M3 money funds,
leading to a resumption of 1 percent expansion in this aggregate over
the balance of the year..

(10) The spate of weak incoming economic information since
late last week has reestablished market expectations that another
easing of reserve conditions may well be imminent, involving an an-
ticipated further decline in the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage
point. Bank lending terms and standards will probably remain quite restric-
tive, possibly easing only a little, and demands for business and
consumer credit at banks seem likely to remain very subdued..

move still lower, pulled down by the weight of a reduced expected path
for short-term rates over at least the intermediate term..
(15) Under alternative A, M2 and M3 likely would grow at
rates of 2-3/4 and 1-1/4 percent over the September-to-December
interval. In addition to the
limited stimulus to M2 demands arising from the reduction in oppor-

trade around 3 percent, in association with an initial assumption for

conditions of alternative B would initially induce some backup in
interest rates across the maturity spectrum and some rise in the ex-
change value of the dollar. In any event, a decline in long-term rates
could eventually develop even at an unchanged funds rate as evidence
of disinflation takes firm enough hold to offset skittishness about
fiscal policy; indeed, failing to meet market expectations about
policy easing could well strengthen perceptions that the disinflation
trend will be sustained..

(16) The absence of System action over the current intermeet-
ing period and the flow of data releases pointing more clearly to sus-
tained expansion in economic activity have solidified the notion that
monetary policy will remain unchanged for some time. This
upward tilt to M2 velocity over the two quarters reflects a continuation
of those forces that have been boosting velocity for some time--the
ongoing process of balance-sheet restructuring and deleveraging that
makes investors less willing to acquire monetary assets and depository
institutions less willing to compete aggressively for funds..
(20) Against a backdrop of public readings that suggested
some firming in economic activity, market participants would be sur-
prised by the 1/2 point decline in the funds rate under alternative A. (21) While the impetus to the monetary aggregates imparted by
choosing alternative A would be barely discernible in 1992, the lower

M3 to the lower end of their current tentative ranges for 1993 by March.",4,"Under alternative B, the trading range for the federal
funds rate would remain centered at 3 percent, in conjunction with an

of alternative B, especially if incoming data conform to the Greenbook
assessment of moderately expanding real activity in the fourth quarter. At the same time, concerns about the prospects for fiscal stimulus and
uncertainties about the economic policies of the new administration more
generally, which may not be resolved for some time, will continue to

M3 under alternative B is projected to bottom out in August and to edge

little more assurance that the broad aggregates would finish the year at

market conditions, alternative C might be preferred if the Committee
saw significant risks of greater inflation going forward. Under alternative C, M2 would grow at a

alternative D as indicating a steeper trajectory of future policy
actions, and perhaps the need for greater cumulative tightening. Bond
yields could still back up somewhat in the aftermath of an announce-

structure of market interest rates, and neither interest nor exchange

alternative D would pass through to other short-term rates. The path for
the aggregates under alternative D assumes that the funds rate moves
up to 5-1/4 percent at this meeting and stays there for the balance of

up a bit over the remainder of 1994, reflecting somewhat reduced
reliance of banks on nondeposit sources of funding..

expansion offsetting a probable cessation of the runoff of state and

strength in employment and a pickup in inflation--both of which are
expected over the near term in the Greenbook forecast..
(28) Concern about the possibility of an adverse market
reaction, combined with a view that the economic situation still
pointed to significant risk of accelerating inflation, would argue for
the 50 basis point firming in the federal funds rate associated with
alternative C. Even if slower real
GDP growth emerges than in the staff economic forecast, which assumes
unchanged short-term interest rates, such an outcome would aid in
bringing resource use over time back to less potentially inflationary
and, hence, more sustainable levels..
(29) The 1/2 percentage point rise in the federal funds rate
embodied in alternative C, by matching current financial market expec-
tations, would have few initial repercussions on market interest rates

persistence of the slowdown in economic growth not yet firmly estab-
lished, more insurance should be taken out against a serious deterior-
ation in inflation trends. Judging from the
alternative simulations in the Greenbook, even a 50 basis point in-
crease in the federal funds rate would leave the core CPI inflation
rate in 1996 above that in 1994 and might not be sufficient to restore
a downward tilt in subsequent years..
(11) With financial markets having built in no near-term
monetary policy tightening, choice of alternative C would come as a
surprise. Somewhat slower growth in the monetary aggre-
gates would result from the higher opportunity costs of alternative C,
while somewhat faster growth would occur under alternative A.",4,"No Sentences Alternative D",0

closely in line with income.",5,"Under alternative C,
the federal funds rate would be boosted 1/2 percentage point, to 6-1/2

favored by the Committee if it wished to provide more assurance that
pressures on resources would soon diminish, so as not to perpetuate
the recently elevated rate of inflation and, over time, to return the
economy toward a disinflationary path. Markets seem to have reacted
strongly to what could prove to be only a moderate downshift in
underlying demand conditions, and current financial conditions may
therefore provide excessive stimulus to an economy already operating
around its potential..
(11) With markets apparently having concluded that rates are
unlikely to rise significantly further, the response in the financial
markets to the 50 basis point increase of alternative C could be sub-
stantial. Nonetheless, M3 is projected to remain above

Committee viewed the staff inflation forecast as too pessimistic--
either because spending would be weaker or because the price-output
relationship would be more favorable than the staff assessment. (10) Earlier expectations of the possibility of easing at the
November FOMC meeting have largely been erased and, thus, the choice
of alternative B should have little impact on market interest rates. The dollar would tend to strengthen on foreign

seen as attractive if the Committee concurred with this outlook and
found the results acceptable, but it also might have appeal as a ""wait
and see"" strategy because delays in data have curtailed the new infor-
mation available to the Committee since it eased policy in December. Thus, rates could edge
higher under alternative B.16 However, the extent of any rise in
such rates likely would be tempered in the near term by the perception
that the Committee had merely postponed easing pending the availabi-
lity of more information. With the direction of interest rates here and abroad
beginning to diverge, the dollar could well strengthen further on
foreign exchange markets..

alternative A would boost the economy marginally further beyond its
potential and tilt the inflation rate up a bit more noticeably. With
the latter outcome apparently inconsistent with the Committee's
strategy for achieving its long-run goals, adopting alternative A
would seem to require that, relative to the staff, Committee members
expect somewhat weaker spending or better inflation. For example,
policy relaxation might be seen as buying further insurance against

parent strengthening in activity this year or as attaching weight to
the possibility that the NAIRU is lower..

disruptions and distortions to economic activity in the last few
months and the difficulties in understanding the implications of the
recent movements of stock and bond prices, a pause might be favored to
allow sufficient time to establish a firmer bearing on the likely
course of spending and inflation, even if the Committee saw the risks

less generous provision of nonborrowed reserves or a hike in the discount rate..
(22) Financial markets currently are not anticipating a change in policy at the
February meeting, and thus the choice of alternative B should initially have little impact on
interest rates or the foreign exchange value of the dollar. While
inflation does not deteriorate appreciably in the near term, given the lags in the effect of
policy, the sooner the Committee begins to tighten--as under alternative C--the lower the odds
that higher inflation will become embedded in price and wage setting. (24) The tightening of policy under alternative C would surprise market participants,
and short-term interest rates, including the prime rate, would rise by the half-point hike in the
federal funds rate.",3,"No Sentences Alternative D",0

(8) With market participants apparently placing high odds on a 25 basis point
tightening in the federal funds rate at the March meeting, interest rates probably would fall
somewhat if the unchanged policy of alternative B were adopted. Indeed, if data in the weeks ahead come in as the staff
projects -- strong real GDP growth and the unemployment rate declining -- both short- and
long-term interest rates would back up, with long-term rates possibly more than reversing any
initial rally..
(12) Under alternative B and the staff forecast, debt is expected to continue to grow
around its recent pace in the months ahead, while money growth tends to moderate as the
expansion of nominal GDP slows. For households, although credit is likely to become somewhat harder to
obtain for marginal borrowers, overall consumer debt should remain on its recent moderate
growth path..

building, the Committee may find reasons to leave its policy stance unchanged, at least for
the time being, as incorporated in alternative B, which keeps the intended federal funds rate
at 5-1/2 percent. However, in recent weeks, markets appear to have removed all but modest odds of
any action, and the choice of alternative B should trigger a relatively minor decline in rates. In these circumstances, upward revisions to expected future interest rates
would be appreciably smaller, and the selloff at the longer end of the maturity spectrum
considerably more limited..
(14) The runoff of the tax-related deposit surge of April should be completed in
May, after which the monthly growth of M2 and M3 under alternative B is expected to
stabilize at annual rates of 4-1/2 and 6 percent, respectively, through September--somewhat
below the pace of the first five months of the year.",3,"The exchange

it thinks that chances are that the staff has not gone far enough to incorporate a more
favorable tradeoff between resource use and inflation into the outlook. No change in the stance of monetary policy at this FOMC meeting is built
into the structure of market interest rates, so financial market prices would react little to the
Committee's choice of alternative B. A 50 basis point firming would, of course, represent an even greater surprise to
market participants and would induce a still sharper backup in interest rates and drop in
equity prices..

anticipated acceleration of prices. The Committee might well view it as a favorable outcome if the economic
expansion were to proceed at a slightly slower-than-projected pace but with a declining path
for inflation that better conformed to the Federal Reserve's long-run goal of stable prices..

guard, inducing an immediate selloff in securities markets and an appreciation of the dollar in

is in order at some point to check an upcreep in inflation, but the Committee may,
nonetheless, prefer to hold the federal funds rate at its current level of 5-1/2 percent at this

strains on resources may show through more forcefully to the prices of goods and services
than in the staff forecast, perhaps more in line with traditional relationships..
(8) Virtually no one in the market anticipates action at this meeting, so that yields
across the term structure are not likely to budge much and the dollar should continue to trade
around its current level on foreign exchange markets immediately following the adoption of
the unchanged policy stance of alternative B. Treasury bill rates have been depressed of late
by low issuance, and the turnaround in bill sales in the fourth quarter prompted by the
seasonal bulge in the federal deficit may roll back some of the decline in rates on those
securities. In these circumstances, incoming data bearing on the
strength of spending and inflation pressure would be especially scrutinized, and large swings
in financial prices might become even more common..

that inflation would pick up, or wanted some greater assurance of further progress toward
price stability, it would likely favor raising the federal funds rate promptly, perhaps at this

would likely edge higher, with both their real and inflation compensation components rising,

financial markets have become more resilient, or, more positively, as a justifiable policy

federal funds rate 1/4 percentage point, as in alternative A. Inflation has declined by
more than the Committee or the staff had expected, raising the prospect that, should those
disinflationary forces persist and be overlaid by an unexpected shortfall in aggregate demand,
inflation could fall farther than the Committee would find desirable..

either side of the staff forecast as about equal at the current federal funds rate. Conversely, in the event of greater drag from Asia
than anticipated in the staff forecast, the underlying strength of domestic demand appears to
be strong enough to sustain economic expansion for a while until an easier policy is adopted

labor markets remain quite tight, that tilt is gradual and starts from a lower inflation rate in
tendencies of members' CPI projections in February. 2 Even if the Committee were troubled

annual rate, bringing its average advance from the fourth quarter to 5-1/2 percent, somewhat
above the midpoint of its annual range..
(14) Under alternative B, M2 growth is expected to slow significantly to a 3 percent
average rate over the April-to-September period, with a little more than 1 percentage point of
the slowdown from the first four months of 1998 representing the projected unwinding of the
previous artificial boost related to special tax and mortgage-refinancing factors. Looking a little further out, the staff now

M2 and M3 will grow at rates of about 4-1/4 percent and 7 percent respectively over the third

domestic interest rates or dollar exchange rates. Indeed, market participants implicitly appear to be putting
some weight on these demand and price risks in that they continue to factor into market quotes

the unchanged policy stance of alternative B at this meeting. Indeed, the Committee may be of the opinion that the staff has built in too large an uptick
to inflation, perhaps by placing too little emphasis on the disinflationary force of ample industrial
capacity and the market discipline now exerted on the ability of firms to pass along price
increases, or by giving too much credence to the power of oil producers to enforce their recent
curbs on supply..

match the expectations currently embodied in financial market prices.",2,"With the economic environment remaining benign and concerns about near-term
monetary policy tightening mostly quiescent, major equity price indexes are likely to be little
changed on net, despite pressure on corporate profit margins..

path, as in the staff forecast, it might favor the 1/4 percentage point tightening in the intended

some time, it might prefer to keep the federal funds rate unchanged at this meeting, as in
alternative B. The Committee might also be encouraged by the
behavior of bond rates over recent weeks, which suggests that investors respond promptly to
signs the economy might begin to overheat and, by anticipating future monetary policy
firming, impart some restraint to spending before the Federal Reserve takes action..
(9) The response of financial markets to the continuation of an unchanged policy
stance, as under alternative B, would depend importantly on whether the Committee
announces a change in the tilt of the directive. Some of the fall-off in
M2 growth has likely been temporary, reflecting the recovery of financial markets and the
unwinding of the general buildup of liquidity that occurred in the last several months of
projected to pick up in the months ahead under alternative B, extending the trend decline in
velocity evident since mid-1997, and leaving growth of this aggregate for the year at about 6
percent, somewhat above its annual range of 1 to 5 percent.",3,"Also, with the Committee seen as more inclined to act, markets could well
become more sensitive to information bearing on the price outlook..
(10) If the Committee saw a pickup in underlying inflation as likely, it might favor
the 25 basis point firming of alternative C. Even with what would seem to be a generous
allowance for expected productivity growth and with relatively restrained pressures on
nominal and real wages at projected labor resource utilization rates, the staff still foresees a
gradual uptrend in core inflation. As a consequence, the immediate 25 basis point increase in the funds rate of
alternative C would trigger a similar rise in short-term interest rates.",2,"No Sentences Alternative D",0

want to see more concrete evidence that the economy was growing faster than its potential

(24) The Committee might choose the 25 basis-point increase in the federal funds
rate under alternative C if it agreed with the staffs forecast that the risks were decidedly on
the side of an upward tilt to inflation and wished to take preemptive action now. The fluctuations in yields of the past few

come as a considerable surprise in the market, triggering a rally in capital markets and
putting further downward pressure on the foreign exchange value of the dollar. Under alternative B, M2 is expected to grow at a 6-1/4
percent pace over the five months from July to December.",3,"If the Committee shares these concerns, it might see little to be gained
from delaying policy action and choose the 1/4 percentage point firming of alternative C
as an appropriate down payment. The former could be alleviated
by immediate action combined with an announcement suggesting little likelihood of
subsequent policy moves, while the latter might suggest that--because the Committee may
feel increasingly uncomfortable in tightening as the year wears on--action delayed now may
wind up being delayed for some time to come..
(11) Given the high odds market participants put on action at this meeting, the
announcement that the Committee was raising the intended federal funds rate 1/4

prices if no surprises are in store from the wording of the press release. The firming in policy under alternative C occurs late enough
this year to impart only slight restraint on the aggregates in 1999.",3,"No Sentences Alternative D",0

risk spreads on some corporate bonds seem to have reflected a heightened investor
edginess; in these circumstances, the Committee may be more inclined to keep policy on
hold so as not to add to market unease through an unexpected policy tightening..
(8) An unchanged intended federal funds rate, as under alternative B, along with
retention of a symmetric directive, would foster the sense that the Committee probably will
not act over the remainder of this year, especially given Y2K-related uncertainties. The choice of

tend to increase the perceived chances of a near-term firming, causing interest rates to back

inflation over time, it may be sufficiently uncertain about that outcome that it still would
wish to leave the intended funds rate unchanged at this meeting at 5-1/4 percent, as under
alternative B, and to retain the tilt toward firming to convey a sense of the risks. (15) Under alternative B, the staff expects that M2 will grow 6 percent this year
and M3 7-1/4 percent, compared with the 5 and 6 percent upper bounds of their respective
annual ranges.",2,"(11) The Committee instead may favor a 25 basis point increase in its intended
federal funds rate, as under alternative C. Although the staff has adopted the view that
structural productivity is growing along a higher and steeper trajectory over the forecast
period than previously thought, it still predicts an increase in core inflation over the next
two years that the Committee may find both likely and unacceptable. To offset
these external forces, firmer financial conditions in the United States would be necessary to
damp domestic demand so as to prevent an intensification of pressures on resources..
(12) The choice of the 1/4 percentage point rise in the funds rate under alternative
C may incline the Committee to return to a symmetric directive. If the Committee wanted to be sure that market
uncertainties about near-term policy action did not unduly contribute to strains in the runup
to year end, the announcement could convey a disinclination to act in December..
(13) While financial markets are somewhat illiquid, confidence about Y2K
preparedness and procedures to contain systemic problems has been growing, suggesting
that the 1/4 percentage point firming at this meeting under alternative C--although a bit of a

dislocation at this time as sufficient reason to keep policy on hold at this meeting, choosing

would pose some risk of prompting financial market disruptions..

developments over year-end, some further abatement of the unusual risk aversion and

prompt 50 basis point adjustment had a reasonable chance of being sufficient to contain
inflation to a satisfactory level, at least for some time, it presumably would indicate, under

alternative B. Growth rates of M2 in coming months are likely to be erratic, owing to the
effects of the shifting timing of tax refunds and the likely surge in payments, but on average
this aggregate is projected to expand at a rate of 6-1/4 percent over the February-to-June
period under alternative B.",2,"In these
circumstances, the Committee's assessment of the inflation risks may be such that it favors
an immediate tightening of policy, perhaps by raising the federal funds rate another 1/4

considerably more policy firming will be needed eventually to contain inflation pressures, it
may still favor the gradual approach embodied in alternative C in light of the considerable
uncertainty about aggregate supply and about the effect of the substantial run-up in short-
and long-term interest rates in recent quarters on aggregate demand. Such gradualism also
may hold appeal because financial markets have been edgy and are potentially vulnerable to
an unexpectedly large policy move..

still may favor a continued gradual approach, as under alternative C. Signs of an actual
acceleration in prices are quite recent, and the Committee may require further evidence that
inflation is on the upswing before firming policy more aggressively. (9) The 25 basis point move of alternative C would be somewhat smaller than is
incorporated in financial market prices.",3,"If a sense that the Committee had fallen
behind the curve of requisite policy firming became prevalent, which would be made more
likely by a disquieting CPI release, longer-term rates could back up, equity prices weaken, and
the dollar come under downward pressure..
(10) If the Committee were persuaded by recent data that the financial conditions
produced by continuing its gradual approach would be insufficient to keep underlying
inflation contained, it might well support the 50 basis point increase in the intended federal
funds rate of alternative D. Further gradual moves might be seen as likely allowing
aggregate demand to grow more rapidly than potential supply for long enough to induce an
intensification of pressures on resources that would noticeably boost underlying inflation. Such an increase in nominal interest rates would be more likely to contain
inflation expectations going forward and thereby diminish slightly the amount of cumulative
tightening ultimately needed to keep inflation in check..
(11) The reaction of asset prices to the adoption of alternative D would probably
depend on the Committee's decision about the balance of risks. The increase in rates on Treasury securities, however, could be more limited if
demands for safety and liquidity were to increase in an environment of more aggressive
policy tightening..

The Federal Open Market Committee
decided today to raise its target for the

current situation in part by indicating more definitively than previously that hiring has

interpretation of recent events..
(13) If the Committee finds the staff analysis in the Greenbook compelling
and the forecasted outcome about the best available in current circumstances, it might
implement the 25 basis point firming of Alternative B. Such a modest move would also be favored if the Committee, like the staff,
sees underlying inflation as still low and a considerable degree of slack remaining in
resource markets..
(14) In announcing implementation of Alternative B, the Committee would
presumably want to modify its existing indication that the accommodative stance of
policy is providing important support to economic activity but could retain the
associated point regarding the impetus given by productivity. If the
Committees goal is to keep the bias-adjusted consumer price level unchanged on
average, roughly consistent with measured core PCE inflation of 1 percent, the
simulations reported earlier suggest that a somewhat firmer near-term path of policy
than in the baseline would be desirable..

its target for the federal funds rate
at 1-1/4 percent. However, if the
report is again on the soft side, as in June, the Committee might wish to cite some
slowing in the pace of improvement in labor market conditions, as in Alternative A..
(9) Although the recent pace of economic growth has been less vigorous
than projected in the June Greenbook, the Committee may still judge that the
economy is poised for significant expansion going forward, as in the current staff
forecast. The Committee might again wish to communicate a view of
the likely pace of policy adjustment by stating that, With underlying inflation still expected
to be relatively low . . . policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured,
while also retaining the indication that it would tighten at a faster pace if necessary to
maintain price stability..
(12) If the Committee is concerned by the slow pace of progress in reducing
resource slack projected in the Greenbook or is worried that the forecasted rebound
in growth could fail to materialize, it may prefer the unchanged policy stance of
Alternative A. Consistent with
its motivation for selecting Alternative A, the Committee might also wish to note that
policy will be adjusted as appropriate to promote sustainable growth as well as price
stability in the last sentence of the risk assessment section..

likely to be transitory but suspects that the pickup in core inflation could well be more
durable than the staff anticipates, it might choose to raise the funds rate 50 basis

Committee decided today to keep
its target for the federal funds rate
at 1-1/4 percent. If the Committee subscribes
to such an outlook, it may find it appropriate to continue paring the degree of
monetary policy accommodation and thus be attracted to the 25-basis-point firming at
this meeting of Alternative B. Estimated policy rules generally suggest that a such a tightening at this
meeting would be consistent with the Committees past policy conduct (Chart 6)..
(10) In announcing implementation of Alternative B, the Committee would
presumably want to modify its previous statement that output is continuing to expand at a
solid pace to acknowledge both the softness in economic activity in the past few
months and the potential effects on economic prospects of energy price
developments. The
inflation sentence could well be similar to that under Alternative B. Market interest rates would likely increase sharply, while stock
prices would drop and the foreign exchange value of the dollar would rise..
(18) If the Committee favors only a modest firming in policy at this time but
wishes to move away from the measured pace language before long, it might wish
to combine the 25-basis-point firming action and rationale of Alternative B
with the conditional assessment of upside risks proposed for Alternative C.",5,"Alternative B would raise the target for the federal funds rate 25 basis points to

Decision
The Federal Open Market
Committee decided today to keep
its target for the federal funds rate
at 1-1/4 percent. Alternative C, however, offers a substantial departure
from the form and substance of recent announcements. Paragraph 18 discusses a hybrid of Alternatives B and C in
which the funds rate would be increased 25 basis points while some of the language
proposed for Alternative C would be incorporated in the announcement. Consistent with
its motivation for selecting Alternative A, the Committee might also wish to note that
policy will be adjusted as appropriate to promote sustainable growth as well as price
stability in the last sentence of the risk assessment section..
(15) If the Committee sees the recent slower growth of aggregate demand as
likely to be transitory but suspects that the pickup in core inflation could well be more
durable than the staff anticipates, it might choose to raise the funds rate 50 basis
points at this meeting, as in Alternative C. (16) With market participants interpreting a measured pace as implying at
most 25-basis-point moves, policymakers probably would want to alter that phrase
significantly or drop it from an announcement of Alternative C. To underscore its concerns
about the effect of energy price increases on the inflation outlook, the Committee
might want to say: Although a portion of the rise in inflation this year appears to have been due
to transitory factors, continuing and substantial increases in energy prices are putting persistent
upward pressure on costs and overall prices..
(17) Unless the employment report for July turns out to be exceptionally
strong, market participants would be quite surprised by the combination of a 50-basis-
point move and the announcement proposed under Alternative C. Market interest rates would likely increase sharply, while stock
prices would drop and the foreign exchange value of the dollar would rise..
(18) If the Committee favors only a modest firming in policy at this time but
wishes to move away from the measured pace language before long, it might wish
to combine the 25-basis-point firming action and rationale of Alternative B
with the conditional assessment of upside risks proposed for Alternative C. If that
language were dropped on Tuesday, the market reaction to the announcement of
conditional upside risks could be fairly sharp, approaching that expected under
Alternative C, as market participants would probably conclude that the FOMC no
longer believed that policy tightening was likely to be gradual.",8,"No Sentences Alternative D",0

recent news on spending for high-tech equipment has been less upbeat..
(9) With regard to the announcement of Alternative B, the Committee could
again repeat the themes that the stance of policy remains accommodative even after
the policy move and that this stance, combined with strong trend productivity growth,
is supporting economic activity. Accordingly, an
action and an announcement along the lines of that proposed in Alternative B should
have little immediate effect in financial markets. This wording is broadly
similar to that proposed for Alternative B but puts more stress on the limited
improvement in labor market conditions and less stress on energy price movements as
the source of earlier economic weakness. As part of the rationale for leaving rates
unchanged, the Committee could employ the language for describing inflation
developments that is proposed for Alternative B, that is, Despite the rise in energy prices,
inflation and inflation expectations have eased in recent months.",7,"Under Alternative C, the funds rate
would similarly be raised 25 basis points, but the language of the statement would be

the statement, as is considered in Alternative C. The appropriate risk
assessment under Alternative C poses a difficult issue. However,
members might be concerned that such an approach would lead to a sharp upward
revision in market participants expectations for the path of policy..

about possible downside risks to the forecast from high oil prices and the potential
for a deceleration in consumer spending similar to that in the faltering expansion

three alternatives, it seems likely that the Committee would view the risks to growth
and price stability as about balanced after the policy announcement..
(10) Regarding the announcement of Alternative B, the Committee might signal
the possibility of a pause by noting that the firming brings the cumulative increase
in the target rate over the past several months to 1 percentage point. The sense that the Committee was inclined to pause for a time might
be reinforced by characterizing the stance of policy as remaining somewhat
accommodative, rather than accommodative as in the September announcement, and
would seem to parallel the Committees decision in January 2002 when it first
characterized policy as accommodative when the funds rate was at 1-3/4 percent..
(11) The market reaction to the announcement for Alternative B is difficult to
gauge precisely. Given the
actual pause in policy adjustment, the cumulative increase wording employed in
Alternative B would not seem necessary. The revised table eliminates alternative A and

minutes of the December meeting, however, may have led analysts to expect a sign of
heightened worries about the inflation outlook, which is missing from the draft
statement provided in Table 1, and its release probably would be accompanied by an
edging lower of yields, a bit of a rally in equity markets, and a small decline in the
exchange value of the dollar..
(17) If the Committee believes that a more rapid return to a neutral policy stance
is needed to prevent output overshooting its potential and putting upward pressures
on inflation down the road, it may choose one or all of the components included in
the statement under Alternative C. (18) Even if the Committee prefers a 25 basis point tightening at this meeting, it
may wish to couple such a move with some of the changes in the announcement
listed under Alternative C in Table 1. If the Committee did choose to firm 50 basis points at this
meeting, the draft language in Table 1 would serve to clarify that the larger move was
not intended to presage a pause..
(19) A 50 basis point policy firming and an announcement like that indicated
under Alternative C would lead to a sharp rise in short-term interest rates and a
decline in bond and stock prices. The direction of the market moves would be the same, but the amounts

transitory, it may wish to firm policy by a quarter point at this meeting and issue a
statement like that described under Alternative A. (15) Under either Alternative A or C, the Committee may judge that the
measured-pace language is no longer consistent with the likely future course of policy. Under Alternative A, the rationale paragraph would suggest that the
Committee sees the stance of monetary policy as somewhat accommodative and
regards the recent uptick in inflation readings as transitory, with underlying inflation
and inflation expectations remaining well-contained. The market reaction to adoption of Alternative A is more difficult to
gauge, but the mention of cumulative firming, upbeat assessment of inflation

B, the funds rate would be raised 25 basis points at this meeting. Alternative B makes the balance-of-risks assessment explicitly

as in Alternative B, will probably limit the usefulness of this form of the risk assessment in

thinks that somewhat higher federal funds rates are likely to prove necessary to limit
pressures on resources and promote price stability but also believes that this
tightening phase could be ending fairly soon. (12) The rationale portion of the statement for Alternative B notes that the
expansion in economic activity appears solid despite elevated energy prices and
disruptions related to the hurricanes. However, given the apparent
underlying strength of aggregate demand, members may want to note that possible
increases in resource utilization as well as elevated energy prices have the potential to
add to inflation pressures..
(13) The assessment of risks portion of the statement for Alternative B resolves
some of the complications and tensions that have arisen in the current language. Given the extent of the changes proposed for
Alternative B, it is difficult to be confident of how the new statement will be
interpreted by investors. The
reference to the relatively high levels of resource utilization, in contrast to the
concerns about possible increases in resource utilization expressed in Alternative B,
would indicate greater concern about pressures on inflation arising from this source
and might suggest that monetary policy now would be oriented particularly toward
slowing growth in aggregate demand to a pace at or below that of potential output.",8,"Given the absence

(14) Under Alternative B, the rationale paragraph could indicate that spending is
likely to slow because of a cooling of the housing market and the restraint imparted by
increases in energy prices and interest rates. The
statement accompanying Alternative B would likely maintain or slightly increase these
odds. Reasserting that inflation expectations
are contained might be problematic, and, as in Alternative B, rising inflation
expectations could be cited as a factor that could add to inflation pressures. For instance, the Committee could combine the
rationale paragraphs of Alternative C with the risk assessment of Alternative B. To
make it more likely that market participants price in an additional move, the
Committee could strike the sentence characterizing additional firming as likely to be
modest in row 4 of Alternative B. With national

growth and inflation as balanced, while Alternative B would repeat the indication
from August that the Committee is concerned predominantly with inflation risks. Under Alternative C, the Committee would firm policy 25 basis points and, as in

tighten than ease by repeating the sentiment of the August statement. Moreover, recent data on labor compensation
and productivity, while not fully congruent with other indicators of labor costs, may
also be seen as pointing to potentially substantial inflation risks, as in the greater

the staff (a possibility suggested by the lower NAIRU alternative Greenbook
scenario), or because it is more optimistic about the disinflationary impetus from
lower energy and other commodity prices and the stronger foreign exchange value of
the dollar..
(19) The rationale portion of Alternative A reflects the improved readings on
economic growth but notes that the substantial cooling of the housing market remains
a drag on the expansion. To indicate the Committees overall assessment of balanced risks, the

The Federal Open Market Committee
decided today to lower its target for the

5 percent. If so, members might prefer the quarter-point policy easing in
Alternative A. Members who consider 2 percent inflation an
appropriate goal might note that most of the policy rules shown in Chart 7 point to a
reduction in the target funds rate in the second quarter..
(21) The rationale for Alternative A points to sluggish business investment and
ongoing weakness in housing as likely to exert a drag on growth, thus supporting a
judgment that risks to growth remain tilted to the downside even after a quarter-
point rate cut. By also pointing to remaining inflation risks and adopting a symmetric
characterization of possible future adjustments in the policy rate, the assessment of
risk in Alternative A is meant to convey that this policy action will not necessarily
commence a sequence of rate cuts..
(22) Although investors apparently expect the Committee to begin easing by
mid-year, the immediate quarter-point rate cut envisioned in Alternative A would be a
considerable surprise and likely would lead to a significant easing of financial
conditions. But markets might read an announcement
along the lines of Alternative A as an indication that the Committee is willing to
forego a medium-term moderation in inflation in order to sustain economic growth.",8,"Alternative B would leave the target for the federal funds rate unchanged. Alternative B, too, notes factors that suggest
downside risks to growth as well as factors that suggest upside risks to inflation, but
states explicitly that the risk that inflation will fail to moderate remains the
Committees principal concern. Alternative B also adopts more symmetric language
regarding future policy adjustments. With the
report on consumer prices in February to be released on Friday, after the Bluebook
closes, the rationale portion of Alternative B includes language in brackets that may be
appropriate if inflation is disappointingly high..
(17) In the staffs analysis, the real federal funds rate is essentially equal to the
Greenbook-consistent estimate of its equilibrium value (Chart 5), suggesting that the
current stance of policy likely would be consistent with closing the small estimated
output gap over the next several years. Moreover, the current target for the funds rate
is very close to prescriptions for near-term policy from the optimal policy path

Committee sees the combination of gradual convergence to potential output and a
given current conditions, it might favor no change in policy, as in Alternative B. Given these
potentially offsetting forces, the Committee may be inclined to wait for more
information on consumer spending and housing demand before adjusting the stance
of policy..
(18) The language associated with Alternative B could point to gains in personal
income and consumer spending as helping to sustain output in the face of weakness
in housing and business investment. The assessment of risk language for Alternative B contains no explicit
judgment about the balance of risks. The proposed wording in Alternative
B replaces the reference to additional firming that was in the January statement with
a balanced characterization of future policy adjustments, thereby removing the
presumption that the next change in policy will be a tightening and providing greater
policy flexibility going forward..
(19) Although economic and financial news during the intermeeting period
increased the perceived probability of a cut in the funds rate later this year, market
participants continue to see no chance of easing at this meeting. On balance, the language for Alternative B seems likely to elicit little
reaction, but with markets apparently skittish, this judgment should be viewed as
more tentative than usual..
(20) In contrast to the fairly benign scenario described in the staff forecast, the
Committee might be concerned that widening disruptions in the subprime market
point to greater weakness in housing and that lower equity prices will slow the growth
of consumer spending. This alternative offers an explicit judgment that risks to growth would
remain tilted to the downside even after this policy action, thereby conveying greater
concern about those risks than Alternative B.",11,"Under
Alternative C, the Committee would tighten policy 25 basis points, bringing the target

concern, it does not mention downside risks to growth and retains directional

Alternative C. A judgment that tighter policy is appropriate might be buttressed by
concerns about the extent to which the labor market currently is stretched thin and
the slow pace at which those pressures lessen in the staff forecast..

fundamentally unchanged outlook for growth by stating that the economy appears to
be expanding at a moderate pace and likely will continue to do so in coming quarters,
supported by solid growth in consumer spending without mentioning areas of
weakness. If the Committee wished to make clear that the 25 basis point increase in
the funds rate did not entirely assuage its concern about inflation risks, the Committee
could replace the first sentence of Januarys assessment of risk with language stating
that the Committees predominant policy concern remains the risk that inflation will
fail to moderate as expected while retaining the second sentence..

foster sustainable growth and an acceptable trajectory for inflation, then it may wish
to choose Alternative B, under which its target for the federal funds rate would
remain at 5 percent for the time being. (19) The draft statement for Alternative B reiterates the view that the economy is
likely to continue expanding at a moderate pace over coming quarters. Taken as a whole, the language in Alternative B is slightly
softer than the June statement, but it also suggests that the Committee does not
expect the less accommodative conditions in credit markets to have a significant
adverse effect on the economic expansion..
(20) Market participants see substantial odds of an easing of monetary policy in
coming months but little chance of a rate cut at this meeting. Alternative
B seems generally consistent with those expectations, so a sizable market reaction to a

Alternative B. Should such fears ultimately prove to be unfounded, and financial
markets and the outlook for the economy improve, the Committee might believe that
it could act quickly to take back some or all of the easing..
(21) The draft language of Alternative B repeats the observation from the
August 7 FOMC statement that economic growth was moderate in the first half of
the year. Alternative B refrains from making any explicit characterization of the balance of
risks, stating that The Committee will continue to closely follow timely indicators of
economic prospects and will act as needed to attain its dual objectives. If members find Alternative B attractive, but wish to adopt an
explicit statement of balanced risks, then they might insert the sentence After todays
action, the Committee judges that the downside risks to economic growth are now
roughly balanced by the upside risks to inflation at the start of the assessment of risk. With
Alternative B putting 50 basis points of easing in place and suggesting at least some

The Federal Open Market Committee
decided today to lower its target for
the federal funds rate 50 basis points
to 3 percent. Moreover, given the highly skittish attitudes of investors and relatively illiquid trading
conditions in some markets, policy surprises might well generate unusually large
reactions in financial markets..
(26) In view of policy actions to date, policymakers might prefer to wait
for additional economic and financial information before taking any further policy
action, as in Alternative D. This approach might also be appealing to policymakers who prefer a more distinct
downward tilt of the trajectory for inflation over the next few years than in the staff
forecast, as in the optimal-control simulation with an inflation goal of 1 percent..
(27) The statement under Alternative D reiterates several elements of the
rationale portion of the January 22 statementincluding references to considerable
stress in financial markets, tightened credit conditions, and deepening of the
housing contractionbut does not cite recent developments in labor markets. Moreover, with no change
in policy and few economic data releases on the calendar between January 22
and January 30, the assessment of risks in Alternative D is identical to that of
the January 22 statement..
(28) Alternative D could surprise and confuse market participants, who
are virtually certain that the funds rate target will be cut at least 25 basis points
at this meeting.",5

generate an outsized reaction in financial markets..
(30) The two paragraphs in the rationale portion of the statement associated with
Alternative A are identical to those in Alternative B. Alternative A also indicates that the Committee judges that the downside risks
to growth outweigh the upside risks to inflation and that the FOMC is prepared to act in
a timely manner as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability..
(31) With market participants putting significant odds on both 50 basis point and 75
basis point cuts at this meeting, selection of Alternative A would likely leave short- and
intermediate-term interest rates a little lower.",4,"Alternative A cuts the federal funds rate target 75 basis points to 2

one policy alternative with portions of the statement from more than one alternative..

shaping the economy and judge that the monetary stimulus already in the pipeline is
inadequate to foster a sufficiently timely resumption of moderate economic growth, it may

The Federal Open Market Committee
decided today to lower its target for

concerns, the Committee might believe that more than 50 basis points of easing before
long may be warranted but might be reluctant to make that full adjustment at this meeting..
(27) The rationale section of the statement accompanying Alternative B would
begin by noting the deterioration in the outlook for economic activity, pointing specifically
to the softening in consumer expenditures and labor markets. As a result, adoption of
Alternative B would likely cause near-term policy expectations to move somewhat higher. However, in light of impaired trading conditions in many markets and

The Federal Open Market Committee
decided today to lower its target for
the federal funds rate 50 basis points
to 2-1/2 percent. However, longer-term yields might move
higher if market participants became concerned that the Committee was underestimating
inflation risks or was more willing to tolerate higher rates of inflation going forward than
earlier anticipated..
(32) If the Committee believes that the economic outlook has weakened but is
concerned that aggressive further policy easing amid unfavorable inflation readings could
increase the likelihood of a rise in longer-term inflation expectations, it may wish to lower
the funds rate target by just 25 basis points at this meeting, as in Alternative C. The difficulty of reliably detecting shifts in inflation
Class I FOMC - Restricted-Controlled (FR) 31 of 39
expectations may bolster the case for this alternative, especially if the Committee perceives
an upward drift of such expectations as being very costly to unwind..
(33) The statement accompanying Alternative C would explicitly acknowledge that
the upside risks to inflation have increased by pointing to recent unfavorable readings on
inflation and by emphasizing the factors that could potentially exert upward pressure on
inflation going forward. (34) A decision to adopt Alternative C would come as a significant surprise to the
financial markets. The rationale portion pertaining to the outlook for inflation would be

The Federal Open Market Committee

credit spreads on corporate debt would widen, strains in financial markets would intensify,
and the foreign exchange value of the dollar could rise..
(35) If the Committee believes that economic growth is likely to resume an
acceptable pace before long and that inflation is on a higher trajectory than in the
Greenbook, it might prefer to leave the stance of policy unchanged, as in
Alternative D. A pause at
this juncture might be particularly appealing to policymakers who prefer a more distinct
downward tilt to the trajectory for inflation over the next few years than that shown in the
Greenbook, such as that illustrated by the optimal-control simulation with an inflation goal
of 1 percent..
(36) The first paragraph of the rationale portion of the statement associated with
Alternative D would acknowledge that economic activity has been weak and that financial
markets remain under considerable stress. The risk assessment section in Alternative D would
stress that the Committee will act in a timely manner as needed to promote price stability
and sustainable economic growth..
(37) Given the expectations embedded in financial market prices of further
substantial policy easing at this meeting, a decision to adopt Alternative D would stun
market participants, leading to a sharp upward revision of their short-term outlook for the

(29) In contrast, if the Committee continues to view the outlook for
economic activity as unacceptably weak, it may prefer to reduce the target funds

would appropriately balance the risks to its dual objectives of fostering maximum
employment and price stability, it may wish to reduce the target federal funds rate

those taken over the past several months. Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 26 of 38

another substantial reduction in the funds rate would increase the likelihood of a
steep decline in the foreign exchange value of the dollar or possibly even a further

FOMC statement. Nonetheless, the statement concludes by noting that
the Committee remains prepared to act as needed to promote economic growth

(25) Alternative B would likely be viewed by market participants as being
broadly consistent with their expectations. Taken at face value, these financial market quotes suggest that
the reaction of financial asset prices to Alternative B is likely to be relatively
muted. However, respondents to the Desks survey of primary dealers expected a
notably lower path for the federal funds rate than that implied by futures prices,
and this divergence makes the reaction to Alternative B somewhat harder to

Committee may consider it prudent to leave policy unchanged while waiting for more
information bearing on the outlook for economic activity and inflation..
(24) In the statement under Alternative B, the rationale begins by noting that
Incoming information suggests that growth in economic activity has slowed in recent
months, which is changed from Economic activity expanded in the second quarter
to shift the discussion to the current quarter and reflect the significant, albeit
expected, deceleration that appears to be under way. The remainder of the statement under Alternative B
is unchanged from that released by the Committee in August, indicating that the
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 30 of 41
substantial easing of monetary policy will promote economic growth; that the
Committee expects inflation to moderate, but the outlook is uncertain; and that,
although downside risks to growth remain, upside risks to inflation are also of
significant concern..
(25) Futures and options quotes as well as the Desks survey of primary dealers
suggest that market participants do not expect any change in policy until the third
quarter of next year. Investors read the statement released in August as consistent
with an outlook for unchanged policy, so Alternative B, which is very similar, would
probably not lead them to revise their views. In sum, short- and longer-term interest rates, equity
prices, and the exchange value of the dollar would probably be little changed in
response to an announcement along the lines of Alternative B..

responding to the continued high levels of inflation and has fairly high confidence in
the resilience of financial markets and economic activity, it may prefer to tighten
policy by 25 basis points at this meeting as in Alternative C. As a
result, the Committee may see the slowdown in growth as transitory, along the lines
of the Financial rebound Greenbook alternative scenario, and be concerned that
holding the federal funds rate at its current level would impart excessive momentum
to the economy going forward, undercutting efforts to bring inflation down..

policy by 25 basis points at this meeting as in Alternative C. As a
result, the Committee may see the slowdown in growth as transitory, along the lines
of the Financial rebound Greenbook alternative scenario, and be concerned that
holding the federal funds rate at its current level would impart excessive momentum
to the economy going forward, undercutting efforts to bring inflation down..
(27) The discussion of economic activity in the statement proposed in
Alternative C is similar to that in Alternative B. However, Alternative C cites the
accommodative stance of monetary policy rather than past policy easings as a factor
that should support growth in the future because policy would be tightened under this
alternative. The inflation paragraph in Alternative C indicates that inflation has
remained high. This indication that the
move was taken as a type of anti-inflation insurance, along with the earlier discussion
of the current period of economic weakness, may suggest that the tightening would
not necessarily be followed by a series of upward adjustments to the funds rate..

Decision
The Federal Open Market Committee
decided today to lower its target for
the federal funds rate 50 basis points
to 1 percent. Alternatively, should the Committee share the staffs downbeat
economic outlook but see a near-term reversal of policy as costly, members might
view a series of gradual steps as more prudent than one or two large moves because
there is considerable uncertainty surrounding the outlook, particularly concerning the
effects of the many official actions recently implemented..
(35) The rationale section of the statement accompanying Alternative B would
begin by noting the deterioration in the outlook for economic activity, pointing
specifically to the softening in consumer spending. The change in wording, from reduced
upside risks in the October 8 statement to an expected moderation of inflation in the
language for Alternative B, suggests that Committee members have become much
more confident that inflation will decline. As a result, our best estimate is that adoption of
Alternative B would have only small effects on prices of financial assets..
(37) If the Committee, like the staff, has marked down significantly its
assessment of economic prospects and now sees an immediate and substantial policy
response as appropriate, it may want to reduce the target federal funds rate 50 basis
points at this meeting, as in Alternative A. As under Alternative B, the section also points out the likely future
spending restraint implied by the further tightening of financial conditions. The
discussion of inflation would be identical to that under Alternative B, noting the
reasons to expect a moderation of inflation to levels consistent with price stability.",8,"Under Alternative A

The Federal Open Market Committee
decided today to lower its target for

moderate as expected, it might prefer to leave the stance of policy unchanged, as in
Alternative C. (41) The first part of the rationale portion of the statement associated with
Alternative C would acknowledge the recent deterioration in economic and financial
conditions. Finally, the risk assessment under Alternative C begins by stating that
the balance of risks has shifted toward downside risks to growth. The section
concludes with a modification of the risk assessment of the October 8 statement,
pointing to the possible effects of past policy actions as something the Committee will
be watching particularly closely..
(42) Given the high odds embedded in financial market prices of at least a 25
basis point cut at this meeting, a decision to adopt Alternative C would surprise
market participants, leading to an appreciable upward revision of their short-term
outlook for the path of policy and probably an increase in short-and intermediate-

alternatives point to the recent announcements that the Federal Reserve will purchase
large volumes of agency debt and mortgage-backed securities and will implement the
Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF). (29) If the Committee agrees that the economic outlook has deteriorated
significantly since the October meeting and thinks that substantial monetary stimulus
will be needed to support a recovery in economic activity, it may be inclined to favor
Alternative A or Alternative B. In these circumstances, Committee members may thus wish to take a
bold action at this meeting to counter the risk of deflation, and they may also want to
presage further expansions of the Federal Reserves balance sheet..
(30) Against this backdrop, the Committee may decide not to announce a target
for the federal funds rate at this meeting and signal instead that its focus has shifted to
the use of the Federal Reserves balance sheet as an especially important policy tool
going forward, as in Alternative A. As incorporated in the third paragraph of
Alternative A, the Committee could explicitly state that it anticipates that short-term
interest rates will remain low for some time. To
mitigate this concern, the Committee could phrase the commitment in implicitly
conditional terms by indicating its anticipation that weak economic conditions are
likely to warrant federal funds rates near zero for some time, as suggested in the
statement accompanying Alternative A.10 In addition, if members were concerned
that even increased use of the Federal Reserves balance sheet as a policy tool and a
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 40 of 60
commitment to keep interest rates low for some time might not be sufficient to
counter deflationary pressures, the Committee could explicitly state, as indicated in
the bracketed sentence, that it will seek to achieve a rate of inflation of about
inflation expectations, in turn, would reduce real interest rates and so support
economic activity..
(32) The statement suggested for Alternative A begins by acknowledging the
further weakening of the outlook for economic activity rather than with a sentence
about the federal funds rate. As in Alternative A,
the Committee may also be concerned that the sharp contraction in economic activity
and the steep declines in the prices of energy and other commodities may cause
inflation to fall to an uncomfortably low level. (51) If the Committee decides not to set a target at all, as in Alternative A, it
could specify to the Desk that it has suspended setting a target and that it anticipates
that the reserve conditions associated with its open market operations and the
liquidity programs put in place by the Federal Reserve will result in federal funds rates
near zero. Directive Wording

alternatives point to the recent announcements that the Federal Reserve will purchase
large volumes of agency debt and mortgage-backed securities and will implement the
Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF). (29) If the Committee agrees that the economic outlook has deteriorated
significantly since the October meeting and thinks that substantial monetary stimulus
will be needed to support a recovery in economic activity, it may be inclined to favor
Alternative A or Alternative B. The intention to continue to actively
consider policies that employ the Federal Reserves balance sheet is also explicitly
stated in order to clarify that other tools could also be used if needed to support credit
markets and economic activity..
(34) If the Committee shares the staff view that the economic outlook has
deteriorated markedly and thinks that, given the circumstances, moving the federal
funds rate near the zero bound on nominal interest rates is desirable, but it wants to
continue to provide an explicit target for the federal funds rate, then it might choose
to establish a target range of 0 to  percent as in Alternative B. In such circumstances, conditional on
their desire to maintain a federal funds rate target, Committee members may prefer to
make that target as low as possible immediately, rather than making a more gradual
adjustment, to counter the risk of further severe deterioration in economic and
financial conditions..
(36) The rationale section of the statement under Alternative B begins by noting
the recent deterioration in economic conditions and in the outlook for economic
activity. As in Alternative B, market participants may also be surprised by the
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 44 of 60
reference to unconventional policy measures, and medium- and long-term Treasury
yields might edge lower..
(38) The Committee may prefer Alternative C for a number of reasons. As in Alternative B,
longer-term interest rates may decline a little, but probably not by much, because
investors may be somewhat surprised by the language on the use of the Federal
Reserves balance sheet as a means of further supporting credit markets and economic. (50) Under Alternative B, the Committee would direct the Desk to seek
conditions in reserve markets consistent with federal funds trading in a range of 0 to
 percent. It may also direct the desk to purchase GSE debt and agency-guaranteed
MBS over the next intermeeting period, as under Alternative B, and subject to the
same limits..

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 44 of 60
reference to unconventional policy measures, and medium- and long-term Treasury
yields might edge lower..
(38) The Committee may prefer Alternative C for a number of reasons. Even so, the Committee may still want to set a target of  percent to
signal where it would want federal funds to trade once financial conditions begin to
improve, some Federal Reserve programs are unwound, and the amount of excess
reserves in the system returns to a more normal level..
(40) As a third motivation for favoring Alternative C, members may view a
decision to reduce the target rate by 50 basis points as an intermediate step towards
reaching a level of rates closer to the zero bound at a later date. Finally, an inclination to ease
policy 50 basis points at this meeting might be reinforced by the fact that most market
participants appear to expect a 50 basis point reduction in the target rate, and
Committee members might be reluctant to inject further uncertainty into financial
markets at a time when markets remain extremely fragile..
(41) The rationale section of the statement accompanying Alternative C begins
by acknowledging that economic activity is contracting in the fourth quarter and by
pointing to deterioration in labor markets, household and business spending, and
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 46 of 60
industrial production. If the Committee viewed Alternative C
as a stepping stone to an even lower target federal funds rate, it may wish to add a
sentence to signal more clearly to market participants that a further reduction in the
target rate may be forthcoming. (42) Since most primary dealers see a 50 basis point policy easing as the most
likely outcome at this meeting, and since a majority see  percent as the trough for
the target federal funds rate this cycle, the market reaction to an announcement like
that for Alternative C is likely to be muted, with short-term interest rates, equity
prices, and the foreign exchange value of the dollar all changing little. The language on inflation remains unchanged from the
October meeting, and the last paragraph acknowledges, as in Alternative C, that
federal funds may continue to trade below the target for some time. That
declaration, together with the indication of downside risks to the outlook, would likely
be seen as signaling that the Committee is open to further reduction in the target rate
at upcoming meetings if conditions warrant..
(49) If the Committee wants to keep a target for the federal funds rate of either
 percent as in Alternative C or 1 percent as in Alternative D, and agrees that the
options available to drain reserves from the system and enable the Desk to meet the
target are either unlikely to materialize or are likely to be otherwise undesirable, it may
wish to change the wording of its directive to the Desk to recognize that it does not
expect the target to be consistently met given the circumstances. If it were to choose
Alternative C, the Committee may also want to direct the Desk to purchase
$100 billion in housing-related GSE debt and up to $500 billion in agency-guaranteed
MBS, as already announced, and to do so by the end of the second quarter of next
year to provide a more specific time frame than the several quarters indicated in the
November 25 press release. Alternative C: The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and
financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable
growth in output.",12,"Under Alternative D, the federal funds rate target is left unchanged at
economic growth over time; as in Alternative C, the possibility of future policy easing
is left open. Alternatives A, B, and C note that the Committee expects inflation
to moderate in coming months and even sees some risk that inflation could drop
below levels consistent with price stability; Alternative D uses the same language on
inflation as the October statement. To make clear that adjusting the funds rate is not

optimistic than the staffs, and, in particular, if members believe that past policy
actions, along with those announced but not yet implemented, will be sufficient to
return the economy to a path of moderate economic growth before too long, the
Committee may wish to leave the target rate unchanged at this meeting as in
Alternative D. Members may also want to preserve some room to
lower the target rate at a later date in order to bolster confidence should further
negative shocks hit the economy..
(44) The rationale portion of the statement accompanying Alternative D
acknowledges that the pace of economic activity appears to have slowed further and
that the near-term outlook has deteriorated. That
declaration, together with the indication of downside risks to the outlook, would likely
be seen as signaling that the Committee is open to further reduction in the target rate

wish to change the wording of its directive to the Desk to recognize that it does not
expect the target to be consistently met given the circumstances. Such a directive is not included under Alternative D

alternative, it might not want the desk to complete the full amount of the announced. Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 56 of 60

(44) If policymakers judge that the economy is undergoing a severe economic
contraction and that the subsequent recovery is likely to be feeble, and if they believe
that a further increase in the size of the Federal Reserves balance sheet would
provide additional monetary stimulus and thereby improve the economic outlook,
the Committee could decide at this meeting to expand its purchases of agency
MBS and to reiterate the possibility of purchasing longer-term Treasury securities
depending on evolving circumstances, as in Alternative B. The Case for Alternative A.
(48) If policymakers judge that a substantially greater degree of monetary
stimulus is warranted to help promote a resumption of sustainable economic growth,
the Committee could decide at this meeting to initiate large-scale purchases of
$500 billion in longer-term Treasury securities and to expand purchases of
agency MBS, as in Alternative A. Moreover, participants projections
for economic activity and inflation might be considerably worse than that of the
Greenbook if they anticipate that credit market frictions are likely to generate
further sharp declines in spending and employment in coming quarters, as in the
Greenbooks Intensifying Financial Strains scenario, and hence they might see an
even stronger rationale for providing additional monetary stimulus to the economy..
(51) In an environment of exceptionally high uncertainty, policymakers may
judge that Alternative A provides the most appropriate balance between downside
risks to the economic outlook over the next several years and the risk that excessive
expansion of the Federal Reserves balance sheet could hamper the conduct of
monetary policy at longer horizons. Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 50 of 60

Alternative C characterizes the incoming information as indicating that economic

but the alternatives differ regarding which new policy measures, if any, should be
initiated at this meeting. Under Alternative C,
no new policy actions would be taken at this meeting; instead, as in January, this
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 36 of 60
alternative states that the Federal Reserve stands ready to expand its purchases of
agency debt and MBS and is prepared to purchase longer-term Treasury securities
in light of evolving circumstances. Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 38 of 60

The Case for Alternative B.
(44) If policymakers judge that the economy is undergoing a severe economic
contraction and that the subsequent recovery is likely to be feeble, and if they believe
that a further increase in the size of the Federal Reserves balance sheet would
provide additional monetary stimulus and thereby improve the economic outlook,
the Committee could decide at this meeting to expand its purchases of agency
MBS and to reiterate the possibility of purchasing longer-term Treasury securities
depending on evolving circumstances, as in Alternative B. The Case for Alternative C.
(52) If policymakers anticipate a more robust economic recovery than in the
staff outlook and perceive that further expansion in the size of the Federal Reserves
balance sheet would be associated with substantial risks to the future conduct of
monetary policy, they may prefer not to initiate any new policy measures at this
meeting, as in Alternative C. (53) The draft statements for Alternatives A and B begin by characterizing
the outlook for economic activity and inflation, and the draft statement for
Alternative C starts by indicating the Committees decision to maintain the target
range for the federal funds rate. However, participants may instead prefer that
the FOMC statement begin by pointing to new policy measures that the Committee
has approved, as illustrated in Alternatives A' and B' below, or to reaffirm the existing
policy strategy, as in Alternative C'. Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 50 of 60
