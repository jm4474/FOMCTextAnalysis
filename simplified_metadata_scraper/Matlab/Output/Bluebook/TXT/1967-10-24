of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 
Please note that some material may have been redacted from this document if that

1  In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic 
format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Please note that the numbers and text in charts and

MONEY MARKET AND RESERVE RELATIONSHIPS
Recent developments
Thus far in October Treasury bill yields have fluctuated
fairly widely, and on balance have risen somewhat further along with
most other short-term rates. The 3-month bill reached a peak of 4.70
per cent and declined to just under 4.60 per cent recently, up almost 20
basis points since the beginning of the month, but much of this net rise
reflects the change in the maturity date of the bill from December to
January. Longer-term bill yields have risen a few basis points since
early October.
In bond markets, both Treasury and private, upward yield
adjustments were more marked, as expectations of a tax increase waned
and the corporate calendar began to build up again. In the corporate
market, distribution of a number of new issues was slow, and syndicates
were terminated with substantial concessions in yield. Interest rates
in the intermediate-term sector of the Treasury market also rose in
anticipation of the mid-November refunding. Very recently, the re-
appearance of investor demand, particularly for corporate issues, has led
to some declines in yields in both the corporate and Treasury markets.
Market absorption of the recent $4.5 billion tax bill financing
was the principal influence on bill rates during the past three weeks,
but anticipations of a rise in British bank rate were also a factor.
(Bank rate was increased from 5½ to 6 per cent on October 19.) Relatively
favorable financing costs to dealers moderated upward bill rate pressures

as dealers took into position sizable commercial bank sales of the new
tax bills. In the process, average dealer bill holdings rose by about
$750 million to almost $2.7 billion during the two weeks ending October 18.
The System did not make any outright bill purchases in the
market after early October, as reserve projections indicated that no
sustained reserve supply was needed, but the Desk did make sizable
repurchase agreements in the first half of October to counteract day-
to-day tendencies toward market tightness. The amounts of such agree-
ments outstanding averaged around $400 million per day in the two
statement weeks ending October 18. New RP's were made on all but three
business days during that period as the Federal funds market showed a
tendency to tighten, with trading as high as 4k per cent. During the
first two statement weeks of October, the Federal funds rate averaged
slightly more expensive.
On the demand side of the Federal funds market, Government
security dealer financing demands pressed on the market and the major
banks in New York had a greater need for funds as their basic reserve
position worsened after early October. This change in position of
major banks was in part a seasonal phenomenon, and most recently their
position has improved. On the supply side, the availability of funds
may have been held back by the somewhat larger than expected expansion
in required reserves during recent weeks, particularly at country banks.
CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -3- October 20, 1967.
With the Federal funds rate drifting up, member banks,
particularly large banks, appeared to show a greater inclination to
borrow from the System. Member bank borrowings averaged $145 million
during the first two statement weeks of October and rose to $215 million
in the latest statement week. In addition large banks also increased
their borrowings in the Euro-dollar market and raised CD rates particularly
on longer maturities.
Free reserves averaged $205 million in those first two weeks,
but rose to $378 million in the week of October 18 when country banks
added large amounts to their excess reserves, as they have in the past
during the third week of October. This excess reserve build-up led
to some easing of money market rates as these funds moved into the central
money market.
Prospective developments
Setting aside the extremes of recent fluctuations, prevailing
money market conditions might be thought of as including a Federal funds
rate ranging around 4 per cent; member bank borrowings averaging around
$100 million; and free reserves in a $150 - $300 million range. Given
these money market conditions, the 3-month Treasury bill rate is expected
to remain in a 4.40 - 4.70 per cent range over the balace of October and
into the first half of November. Relatively low dealer financing costs
should continue to exert some moderating effect on the bill market. In
CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -4- October 20, 1967.
addition, in the current uncertain financial environment liquidity
demands from corporations and others will probably relieve the current
market supply of bills. Finally, the Federal Reserve is projected to
supply about $700 million of reserves through open market operations
during the three statement weeks ending November 16.
With prevailing conditions in money and short-term markets,
and in light of recent developments affecting the demand for reserve
funds by banks, earlier projections for October of the bank credit proxy
need to be revised up a bit--from the 10 - 13 per cent average annual
rate range of the last Blue Book to a 12 - 15 per cent range (13 - 16
per cent after including the $200 million increase in Euro-dollar
borrowings by U.S. banks thus far in October). In addition to Governmental
and security dealer credit demands, the expansion in bank credit also
reflects a relatively moderate growth in business loans at weekly reporting
banks after mid-September following sizable net repayments in earlier
weeks. This business loan growth was in good part related to corporate
payments of their income taxes and transfers of withheld personal income
taxes to the Treasury. Time and savings deposits are anticipated to grow
a little more rapidly than earlier expected, perhaps in a 12 - 14 per
cent range, and the money supply much more rapidly, in a 7 - 9 per cent
In November, the rate of growth in the bank credit proxy may
be somewhat lower than in October, given the money market conditions
specified above, some moderation in over-all credit demands from the
October pace (largely because of lower Federal Government borrowing on
CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -5- October 20, 1967.
average), and banks' continued ability to attract the public's savings.
The most likely growth rate at the moment appears to be in a 7 - 10
per cent range, but there are major uncertainties with respect to the
magnitude of business credit demands and how much will fall on banks as
well as with respect to the amount of new cash the Treasury will raise in
the mid-November refunding.
Our best guess is that business loans will not show more
than moderate strength in the period ahead, but they could spurt if the
recent somewhat unsettled conditions in financial markets continue and
lead borrowers to anticipate their needs for bank financing as well as
for capital market funds. The Treasury may wish to raise as much cash
as possible in connection with the mid-November refunding (in which the
maturing issues in the hands of the public total only $2.6 billion),
perhaps $2 billion or so if market conditions warrant. Our projections
allow for $2 billion of new cash, with banks holding part of the net
new issues in portfolio and providing security loans to help finance
distribution of the other securities.
Time and savings deposits are expected to continue to be a
principal source of bank credit expansion despite the recent rise in
market rates, and may continue to grow in a 12 - 14 per cent annual
rate range. However, any further rise in interest rates on competitive
instruments, including new attractive issues in the Treasury financing
would divert some flows from institutions. While growth in large CD's
CONFIDENTIAL (FR)
outstanding at banks is expected to continue at the moderate October
pace, when they are projected to increase by $300 million, banks are
likely to have to pay ceiling rates for large blocs of funds with
maturities of 6 months or more.
Government demand deposits are expected to decline on
average, seasonally adjusted, in November, partly reversing their
sizable October increase. With Government deposits declining in
November, private demand deposits are expected to rise in a 5 - 7 per
cent annual rate range, with the money supply growing by 4 - 6 per
Expansion of banks' total reserves in November is expected
to be in a 6 - 9 per cent range, down sharply from October, as time
deposits come to account for the great bulk of the November expansion.
The recent apparently greater inclination for banks to borrow, given
the widening spread of other short-term rates above the discount rate,
may tend to support a somewhat more rapid reserve expansion than
would otherwise be the case as the System attempts to keep the level
of borrowings from rising. The projections for October and November,
and for the two months together, can be summarized as follows:

The projected reserve and bank credit expansion is likely
to be accompanied by some further rise in intermediate- and long-term
rates in the weeks ahead if the Treasury raises substantial amounts of
cash in mid-November partly through an issue in the intermediate-term
area, unless prospects for fiscal restraint wax instead of wane. While
a diversion of funds to new Treasury issues by institutional investors
and possibly individuals will exert over-all pressure on capital
markets, the sharp recent rise in corporate and municipal bond yields
may have brought them to levels already sufficiently high so that they
could be partly sheltered from such developments. However, bond markets
remain very sensitive, and could be adversely affected by further
announcements of large new private issues. Long-term markets could also
be put under further pressure as the investors begin to focus on the
possibility that the U.S. Government might soon announce an issue of
participation certificates to raise further cash.
