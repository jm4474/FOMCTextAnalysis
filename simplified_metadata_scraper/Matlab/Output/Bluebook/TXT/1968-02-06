MONEY MARKET AND RESERVE RELATIONSHIPS
Recent developments
Key monetary variables have behaved in disparate ways since
the last meeting of the Committee--some in line with expectations,
some at the outer edge of expectations, and some unexpectedly.
During the last three statement weeks in January, the Federal funds
rate averaged a shade above 4-5/8 per cent, member bank borrowings
averaged $233 million, and new dealer loan rates were around 4-3/4--
firmer money market conditions associated in part with the rise in
reserve requirements effective mid-January. Consistent with these
conditions, net free reserves were noticeably lower than in the weeks
before the previous meeting, and averaged $35 million over the period,
near the lower end of the anticipated zero to $100 million range.
This average included a net borrowed reserve figure of $70 million
published for the statement week ended January 17, when country bank
excess reserves dropped very sharply from the previous week's seasonally
high level (which is not included in the average above).
On the other hand, Treasury bill rates (except for the 1-month
bill) have generally ranged down to and in the past week below the low
end of the 4.90 - 5.20 per cent range of expectations expressed in the pre-
ceding Blue Book, as investment demand for bills proved large, as the
worst market fears about a crunch in the weeks around year-end were not
realized, and as dealers became more willing to position bills. The

yield on the 3-month bill was quoted 4.86 per cent bid at the close
on Friday. The 6-month bill also declined further, and has at times
been quoted just below 5 per cent.
Along with the decline in bill rates, yields on other money
market paper dropped, and major banks reduced their offering rates on
CD's maturing in less than 6 months to levels below the 5-1/2 per cent
ceiling that had come to prevail on all maturities in the weeks around
year-end. The sharpest rate declines were for shortest-term CD's, as
banks preferred to lengthen CD maturities in anticipation of spring
loan demands. Interacting with such interest rate declines in the U.S.,
Euro-dollar rates also declined--with the 3-month Euro-dollars recently
quoted below pre-devaluation levels--even though U.S. banks increased
their takings in that market during most of January by what would
appear to be somewhat more than seasonal amounts.
Contrary to expectations, the decline in bill rates did not
lead to a rebound in growth of banks' time and savings deposits. The
bulge in demand for business and security loans at banks in late 1967
and early 1968 appeared temporary to banks, and they made relatively
little effort--as indicated by the sharp decline in CD rates--to compete
for the sizable pool of short-term funds seeking investment that appeared
in recent weeks. Nevertheless, outstanding CD's did rise by about $600
million in January, recovering about three-fourths of their December
decline. On the other hand, consumer-type time deposits at banks
were quite a bit weaker than staff expectations.
CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -3- February 2, 1968.
On average in January, total time and savings deposits declined
slightly, still reflecting in good part the sharp drop in outstanding
CD's that materialized during the latter half of December. From the
end of December to the end of January, total time and savings deposits
rose at a reduced 4 per cent annual rate.
The absence of aggressive bank competition for time deposits
reflected abatement of loan demands after early January and also perhaps
the fact that private demand deposits did not decline in the course of
the month as rapidly as would have been expected on seasonal grounds.
Contributing to the maintenance of private demand deposits was a
smaller than projected build-up in the Treasury cash balance over the
month, mainly because tax receipts were lower than originally allowed
for in our projections.
For the month of January on average, the money supply rose at
an 8 per cent annual rate, contrary to earlier staff expectations for
only a minor change. However, the money supply did show a sharp decline
late in the month, and from the week ending December 27 to the last week
of January there was little net change in the level of cash balances.
In sum, a peculiar pattern of deposit flows within the months
of December and January resulted in changes in the monthly averages quite
different from those projected in the last Blue Book. The data from
month-end to month-end, however, appear to indicate an unfolding
pattern more in line with what might logically have been expected on
the basis of the public's incentives to hold particular financial assets.
February 2, 1968.
Despite the unexpected shifts in the composition of deposit
growth in January, total deposits and bank credit rose, on average,
about in line with anticipations. Following a slight decline in
December, the bank credit proxy increased at a little less than a 9
per cent annual rate, over half of which appears to reflect the $2.5
billion tax bill financing at mid-month. The rise in Euro-dollar
borrowings abroad by banks would add less than 1/2 percentage point
to that rate.
The announcement on Wednesday of two Treasury financings--a
refunding and pre-refunding for settlement on February 15 involving
$12 billion of eligible publicly held issues, and a cash offering of
$4 billion expected to be paid for on February 20 or 21--seemed well
received by the market. In the pre-refunding, holders of outstanding
issues are being offered a 5-3/4 per cent 7-year note. In the cash
offering, a 15-month note will be offered, to be priced on February 8.
Bill rates adjusted somewhat further downwards in wake of this announce-
ment, as the market anticipated some added demand for bills from
sellers of the "rights".
The offering of a 7-year note was followed by only minor
yield increases in the intermediate- and long-term sectors of the U.S.
Government securities market, where interest rates had already risen
somewhat from their mid-January lows. In corporate and municipal bond
markets, yields have shown little change in recent weeks, although
aggressively priced new issues have moved slowly over the past several
CONFIDENTIAL (FR)
Looking back over the interval since the last meeting of the
Committee, it appears that the atmosphere in short- and long-term
markets has become somewhat more relaxed than was anticipated, even
though most of the key flow and rate variables averaged within the
ranges specified. Our analysis in the previous Blue Book probably did
not make sufficient allowance for such a development for two reasons.
The first relates to disintermediation prospects and liquidity
pressures on banks. The staff assumed that disintermediation around the
interest-crediting period would be less severe than the market and
banks had feared. In the event, it was less severe, and loan demands
were not so large as to unduly absorb bank liquidity. But the analysis
in the previous Blue Book did not anticipate the shift toward more
optimistic market attitudes that developed when their worst fears
were not realized.
The second reason relates to the Euro-dollar market. It
had been expected that the new balance of payments program might tend
to put upward pressure on Euro-dollar rates, with some feedback on
our short-term rate structure. But, as it turned out, both our bill
rates and Euro-dollar rates declined.
Prospective developments
With Treasury financings remaining a major expansionary influence
on bank credit demands, the bank credit proxy is expected to rise in a
the January pace. This projection assumes that monay market conditions

CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -6- February 2, 1968.
will be about as have prevailed on average since the preceding meeting
of the Committee--namely, member bank borrowings in a $200 - $300 million
range; the Federal funds rate in a 4-5/8--4-3/4 per cent range; new
dealer loan rates in New York frequently 4-7/8--5 per cent; and net
free reserves averaging in a zero to $100 million range, but becoming
negative at times. Under these conditions, the 3-month bill rate may
be in a 4-3/4--5-1/8 per cent range.
Upward pressures on these money market variables might
develop out of heavy financing demands in connection with current
and anticipated Treasury financings, or as a result of less conservative
management of money positions by major banks than has been apparent
during recent weeks. During the last half of January major New York
banks worked into a basic reserve surplus--considerably more comfortable
than usual--in a period when country banks were adjusting to the new
higher reserve requirement. A more usual basic reserve deficit might
be expected to develop at major banks in February, which would put up-
ward pressure particularly on the Federal funds and dealer loan rates.
Such pressures, as they persisted, could be communicated to the bill
market, given currently relatively high dealer bill positions and also
large dealer finance needs partly connected with current Treasury
financing operations.
Bill rates normally show some seasonal decline at this time,
and reinvestment demands coming out of the large Treasury refunding may
add to downward pressures. However, bill yields would be likely to move
CONFIDENTIAL (FR)
up significantly from current levels if there were a shift in sentiment
by market participants, who now generally seem to believe that they
overestimated the extent of private credit demands and of the tightening
effects of Federal Reserve actions.
Another factor that would tend to exert upward pressure on
bill rates would be a greater desire on the part of banks to attract
CD funds. This, in turn, would appear to depend on the appearance of
substantially stronger business loan demands. We have projected a
further growth in outstanding CD's similar to January's, on the
assumption that business loan growth does not show any marked upsurge
but remains above the proportions of last fall in view of the greater
business need to finance inventories.
The sharp shift in deposit mix in January is not expected to
persist in February. A large part of the demand deposit expansion in
late December and early January was reversed in the latest two weeks,
perhaps related in part to lagged asset adjustments by deposit holders
in a period of some uncertainty as to the impact of such developments
as the new balance of payments program and prospects for the mix of
fiscal and monetary policies. On the other hand, with December-January
interest-crediting period passed, and with short-term interest rates
somewhat lower relative to CD ceiling rates, time and savings deposits
are expected to show more strength than they did last month.
Over-all, one might expect the money supply to show little
change on average in February, and quite possibly decline somewhat,
but time and savings deposits might rise at a 7 - 9 per cent annual
February 2, 1968.
CONFIDENTIAL (FR)
rate. U.S. Government deposits are expected to rise rather sharply
during the month, but with the greatest increase, of course, at the
time of the cash financing after mid-month.
Interest rates in intermediate- and long-term markets may
tend to drift upwards from current levels as the new Treasury 7-year
positions of dealers, whose current net position in "rights" less "when
issued" sales is $400 million. As a result dealer holdings of securities
maturing in more than 5 years will shift markedly from their current
net short position to a net long position. This should make the
market more vulnerable to any adverse news, or to any continued sluggish-
ness in sales of new corporate and municipal issues. The volume of
such issues is not expected to pick up from its recent pace, but the
supply of investment funds may taper off at current yield levels.
Investment demand in January was probably enlarged by accumulations
of funds for securities held over from the lull in new issues in
December, and by rumors of peace negotiations.
