MONEY MARKET AND RESERVE RELATIONSHIPS
Recent developments
(1) Widespread expectations of significant further declines
in interest rates have played a dominant role in determining money
market relationships and the movement of related financial variables
since the last meeting of the Committee. Reports suggesting that the
slowing in
expected/economic expansion had already begun late in the second quarter,
and the reduction in the System's RP rate to 5-1/2 per cent, reinforced
expectations of further easing in financial market conditions. Dealers
and investors--particularly commercial banks--moved aggressively to
enlarge their holdings of fixed income securities. In response, yield
declines in bond markets ranged to nearly 25 basis points and bank
credit expanded rapidly.
(2) In the Treasury bill market, where the unexpected Treasury
decision to offer no short-term anchor issue in the August financing
reinforced downward rate pressures, yield declines ranged to about
of 4.89 per cent on August 5.
(3) With day-to-day demands on banks for security financing
very high, the Federal funds rate has consistently remained at or above

cent. Rates on new loans to dealers at New York banks have continued
generally between 6-1/4 to 6-5/8 per cent, and measures of marginal
reserve availability have become firmer. Net borrowed reserves have
averaged$295 million since mid-July, and were $380 million in the
latest week. Member bank borrowings have averaged $660 million,
somewhat above the high end of the range specified in the last blue
book, largely because of the $737 million figure in the latest week.
(4) Most recently, as the initial impact of the Treasury's
financing decision has faded, persistent firmness in money market
conditions has created increasing sensitivity among dealers to the high
cost of position financing and concern about the timing of any further
easing in monetary policy. In consequence, yields on Treasury bills
have erased a small part of their earlier declines.
(5) Spurred by the earlier general decline of market rates
and by expectations of even lower rates over the longer run, CD inflows
to banks in July topped $2 billion, about twice as much as projected.
Banks began to shave CD offering rates, and at the largest banks all
maturities from 90-days outward now carry rates in a 5-5/8 to 5-3/4
per cent range.
(6) Government deposits at banks declined on average about
as projected in July. But private demand deposits rose even faster than
anticipated, possibly reflecting the surge in security market trans-
actions engendered by changed interest rate expectations. As a result
the money supply for July is now estimated to have grown at about a
previously projected.
(7) Outside of the dramatic growth in large CD's already
as projected, close to the moderate pace of recent months but with a
noticeable shift from passbook accounts to higher yielding time deposits.
At other depositary-type intermediaries, savings flows were not so
severely affected by the June-July reinvestment period as was generally
feared before the tax increase. Nonetheless, the seasonally adjusted
rate of growth in these flows during July was well below that of the
second quarter.
(8) Largely because the shift in market expectations pro-
duced a larger than anticipated decline in interest rates and, in
consequence, a larger than projected growth in CD's, the credit proxy
for July expanded much more rapidly than indicated in the last blue
book. It is now estimated at an annual rate of about 9 per cent for
the month. Allowing for the rapid rise in Euro-dollar borrowing from
foreign branches in June and early July, the rate of growth in the
adjusted credit proxy amounts to 11 per cent, much above the rate
projected at the time of the last meeting.
(9) The expansion of bank credit took the form chiefly of
bank investment in U.S. and State and local government securities and
of security loans--the latter apparently largely to finance expanded
professional inventories in these same markets. The bulk of the increase
in bank holdings of U.S. Government securities occurred in connection
with the tax financing early in the month. While business loans also
rose more than seasonally in July, their growth was less than expected
in view of the recent increases in corporate tax liabilities.

of growth for major financial flows over several recent periods.

Prospective developments
(11) The unusually large spread that has opened up recently
between day-to-day money market rates and the 3-month bill rate reflects
currently prevailing expectations that money market conditions will soon
be eased. If, on the other hand, day-to-day rates and marginal reserve
measures in the weeks ahead should be maintained at levels close to
those recently prevailing, market expectations could shift and Treasury
bill rates would very likely tend to rise. As has been indicated, a
little of this tendency has already been evident, with the 3-month bill
rising nearly 10 basis points from its early August low.
(12) Even with day-to-day rates at levels somewhat below those
recently prevailing, some back-up in bill rates cannot be ruled out, par-
ticularly if market expectations shift.
While bill dealers have recently been quite successful in rolling over
their positions profitably, any tendency for market demands to slacken
would quickly encourage them to try to reduce inventories unless financing
costs began to decline. If upward pressures on bill rates became too
great, yield increases could spread in some degree to other securities
markets--particularly those for longer-term U.S. and State and local
government notes and bonds where positions presently held by market
professionals are also large.
(13) Events that have already transpired assure a rapid
increase in the bank credit proxy on average during August. The
increase is now projected at an annual rate of 16-18 per cent. Nearly
three-fourths of the estimated growth is accounted for by the rise in
the average of Government deposits from July to August resulting from
heavy Treasury cash borrowings. Much of the remainder reflects time
deposit growth that occurred over the course of July--principally in
large CD's, although some further net growth in time deposits and CD's
is also projected during August.
(14) The effect on the credit proxy of Euro-dollar borrowings
by U.S. banks in August is uncertain. Such borrowings have fluctuated
widely in recent weeks, and most recently have been back close to their
July peaks. If reserve pressures continue strong on money market banks,
the decline in August expected earlier by the staff may not occur.
(15) Since present relationships between bill rates, on the
one hand, and other money market and marginal reserve variables, on the
other, are not likely to be sustainable in the period ahead, maintenance
of the "present stance of policy" would appear to require permitting some
flexibility in operating targets. In particular, to avoid an overly-
rapid snapback in bill rates that would trigger a more general reversal
of recent interest rate declines, it may be necessary at some juncture
to permit some easing of other money market conditions, particularly
in the funds rate and member bank borrowings.
(16) If bill rates were to remain relatively close to recent
levels--say, fluctuating between 4.90 and 5.10 per cent--the Federal
funds rate could be maintained in the 6- 6-1/8 per cent range of recent
weeks. These conditions would likely be associated with average
borrowings of $500 to $650 million, and average net borrowed reserves
of $200 to $400 million. If, However, bill rates were to approach
or exceed the top of this range, and particularly if they were rising
rapidly, the Federal funds rate could be permitted to drift down, perhaps
into the 5-3/4 to 6 per cent range. Such easing in the cost of reserve
funds would likely be associated with marginal reserve measures about
$100 million lower. This general approach to operations would, of
course, be conditioned by bank credit developments if a bank credit
proviso were included in the directive.
(17) Looking beyond the immediate credit bulge, and assuming
that the operating approach outlined above is implemented, growth in
the bank credit proxy in September is expected to drop to, perhaps,
a 5-7 per cent range. Several factors account for the expectation of
slower growth: The Federal Government will not be a cash borrower
again until the latter part of October; business borrowing at banks
is expected to slacken; security loans should recede somewhat from
their unusually high recent levels, as borrowings in securities
markets by the Federal government and business corporations drop-off;
and growth of large bank CD's is likely to recede from the accelerated
July pace. In the early stages of past periods of interest rate
declines, growth of large bank CD's has typically mushroomed, but
the change has been of a one-shot character reflecting bank efforts to
restore liquidity and add to security investments while yields were still
attractive. With the sharp reductions in outstanding CD's that occurred
earlier this year now fully restored, and with bank needs for liquidity
less pressing than in some earlier periods of interest rate reversal,
it seems reasonable to expect a slower growth of CD's in the weeks
ahead. In fact, many large city banks already appear to have dropped
their aggressive approach to bidding for CD's.
(18) Growth in total time and savings deposits is projected
at a rate of about 14 per cent in August and around 10 per cent in
September. Net shrinkage of savings deposits at banks is projected
to persist in August and September, with savers continuing to switch to
higher yielding consumer-type time account alternatives. Growth in the
latter should continue to exceed net withdrawals from savings accounts
despite the new Federal surtax. With private demand deposits at member
banks expected to decline in August, the money supply for that month
is likely to show little or no growth. In September, on the other hand,
as Government deposits decline again, on average, the money supply is
projected to expand, but at a much slower rate than in recent months.
(19) Policy alternative. It may be that, in light of the
emerging economic situation, the Committee would wish to guard against
the possibility of any further rise in short-term interest rates, and
to accommodate any renewal of downward pressures on these rates that
might develop. These objectives might be accomplished by acting, as
soon as even keel considerations permit, to reduce the present degree
of tautness in money market conditions. The complex of relationships
appropriate to this end would seem to be a Federal funds rate ranging
from 5-1/2 to 5-3/4 per cent, net borrowed reserves averaging from
$0 to $200 million, and member bank borrowings of $250 to $450 million.
These conditions would likely be associated with a 3-month bill rate at
or below 5 per cent.
(20) Since this approach would maintain rates on competitive
market instruments well below CD ceilings, it probably would provide
some stimulus to bank credit growth. But since banks have already
begun to back away from the CD market, that stimulus is not likely to
be great. On balance, there would probably be little effect on the
proxy for August, but the proxy in September could be in the 7 to 9 per
cent range, about two percentage points higher than under the course of
operations described in paragraph 16.
