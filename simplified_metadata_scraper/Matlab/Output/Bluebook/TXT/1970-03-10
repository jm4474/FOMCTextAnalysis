MONEY MARKET AND RESERVE RELATIONSHIPS
Recent developments
(1) Preliminary estimates indicate that the adjusted bank
credit proxy for February declined in the magnitude projected at the
time of the last Committee meeting, but that estimated changes in the
deposit components which make up the proxy differed substantially from
projections. Private demand deposits declined much more steeply, on
average, than anticipated, and contributed to a commensurately larger
than projected drop in the money supply; whereas time deposits, instead
of continuing to decline sharply as expected, showed virtually no decline
at all. The table shows how projections of changes in these variables
for February were revised as the inter-meeting period progressed.

" ''I
(2) Over the same interval, the projected March increases in
these aggregates were strengthened, mainly for time deposits, partly in
recognition of the change in policy that was voted. The March projection
for the money supply, though raised somewhat in the month of February,
did not become strong enough to achieve the previous bluebook money
supply projection for the quarter. Revised projections of the adjusted
credit proxy for the quarter, however, did strengthen relative to the
previous bluebook.
(3) While the staff had expected some gradual improvement
in time deposit performance under the less restrictive alternative a opted
by the Committee, the improvement developed more rapidly than projected
partly because of an earlier and larger decline in bill rates than
anticipated. Much of the improved performance of time deposits was
attributable to consumer-type deposits at banks outside major money
centers. In addition, the attrition of domestic large negotiable CD's
came to a halt in early February, and inflows of foreign official funds
into time deposits were larger than expected.
(4) After the last Committee meeting, bill rates declined
a further 45 to 60 basis points, bringing the total decline from
year-end peaks to the neighborhood of 125 basis points. The 3-month
bill was most recently quoted at 6.85 per cent, and the 1 year bill at
not with other money market instruments). The decline in bill rates was
part of a general downward move in interest rates in both short- and
long-term securities markets and appears to have reflected mainly
changing investor attitudes generated by weakening business indicators
and expectations of an easing in monetary policy.
(5) While Treasury bill rates dropped sharply in the first
week after the last Committee meeting, the average effective rate on
Federal funds remained in the 9--9-1/2 per cent range of the previous
four weeks. Subsequently, however, as bill rates started to bottom out,
the Federal funds rate dropped by about a percentage point and averaged
between 8 and 8-1/2 per cent in the past two statement weeks, with a
range of trading generally between 7-1/2 and 9 per cent in the week just
past. Dealer financing costs at New York banks have also declined
recently, with the average in the latest statement week dropping to just
below 9 per cent. Net borrowed reserves averaged $900 million in the
two statement weeks ended February 25, but they declined sharply to
$694 million in the most recent statement week ending March 4. Similarly,
member bank borrowings, which had averaged about $1.1 billion in
February, dropped to $833 million in the statement week just past.
(6) The following table summarizes the annual rates of
growth in major deposit, reserve, and credit aggregates for 1969, and,
on a preliminary basis, for the first two months of 1970.

Prospective developments
(7) If the Committee wishes to continue on the growth path
of monetary aggregates (taken together),and associated money market
conditions, that are implicit in the policy stance adopted at the
last meeting, it may wish to consider the following second paragraph
for the directive (alternative A):
To implement this policy, while taking account of [DEL: the
current Treasury refundin possibble bank regulatory changes
and] the Committee's desire to see moderate growth in money and
bank credit over the months ahead, System open market operations
until the next meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with
a view to MAINTAINING THE SOMEWHAT LESS [DEL: moving gradually toward
somewhat less] firm conditions THAT HAVE BEEN ATTAINED in the
money market; provided, however, that operations shall be
modified promptly to resist any tendency for money and bank credit
to deviate significantly from a moderate growth pattern.
(8) Less restraint in the money markets developed gradually
over the past few weeks, and less firm money market conditions may now
be taken to encompass a Federal Funds rate generally averaging in
an 8--8-1/2 per cent range, net borrowed reserves generally in a
$650-$850 million range, and member bank borrowings averaging
$800-$900 million. If money market conditions are held quite close
to those prevailing in the statement week just past, the 3-month
bill rate might be expected to move downward within a 6-5/8--7 per
cent range as the market's expectations of somewhat less restraint
in money market conditions appear to be confirmed. It is quite possible
that the bill rate could drop below the bottom of this range if market
expectations of more easing develop, or if behavior of the monetary
aggregates indicates to the Account Manager that he should shade money
market conditions toward the lower end of the specifications (for example,
having a Federal funds rate most frequently at 8 per cent or a little
(9) The Treasury will need to raise about $1-3/4 billion of
new cash by late March or early April, in addition to the already
announced ongoing increments to regular weekly and monthly bill auctions.
It appears likely that additional bills will be offered, possibly for
payment in early April. But there is some possibility the Treasury may
raise the cash in the coupon area (in which case the announcement would
come within the next few days so as to obtain payment before the start of
the quarterly grace period at thrift institutions). A coupon issue for
cash could well attract speculative interest in the current market environ-
ment. But the offering is small enough in any event so as to minimize
the need for "even keel".
(10) Any modest additional bill offering seems unlikely to
offset the expected downward tendency in bill rates. Not only may
monetary policy and signs of economic weakness work toward lower bill
rates, but there is also some tendency for bill rates to drop seasonally
in early spring, reflecting retirement of tax bills (amounting to $1.8
billion in March and $4.8 billion in April). As bill rates drift down,
it is likely that private short-term rates (such as on commercial paper,
finance company paper, and bankers' acceptances) will move down further.
In recent weeks declines in private short-term rates have lagged
substantially behind the drop in bill rates and the marked widening in
these rate spreads may not be sustainable, although continuing sales of
bank-related paper could tend to moderate declines in short-term rates
generally. Long-term interest rates, too, may move down further,
reflecting business news and the expected easing in short-term markets,
although offerings in corporate, municipal, and Federal agency markets
are likely to remain large. However, all these markets are susceptible
to some technical upward readjustment in yields, given the extent and
rapidity of the recent rate declines.
(11) In view of the more favorable relationship between
Regulation Q ceilings and short-term market rates that is posited above,
and taking account of the recent upward trend in time deposits, the staff
expects a sizable rebound in time deposits during March and April. In
March such deposits may rise in a 10-13 per cent annual rate, range, even
assuming foreign time deposits grow a little more slowly on average
than in February. The growth rate might be somewhat larger in April,
as banks become more successful in attracting back large negotiable CD
funds at declining short-term market interest rates, although it is most
difficult to evaluate how aggressive banks will be in the CD market
relative to the commercial paper and Euro-dollar markets.
(12) The money supply, which has varied sharply in recent
months, seems likely to expand in a 4-7 per cent annual rate range on
average in March. The money supply, while dropping sharply on average
from January to February, did grow over the past few weeks and in early
March was above its February average. Little net change from the
current level would be anticipated over the balance of March, on the
assumption that transactions demands for cash will remain relatively
weak, However, in the last few days of March a temporary bulge is likely
to develop, reflecting in part a temporary reduction in cash items
stemming from the changed pattern of foreign transactions that could be
associated with the 4-day Easter holiday abroad. In April, a slower
growth, on average, in the money supply is anticipated, unless economic
activity should turn out to be stronger or interest rates significantly
lower than projected.
(13) The adjusted bank credit proxy in March may grow in a
deposits stemming from Treasury cash financing, but in April growth in
the adjusted proxy is expected to drop to a 5-8 per cent range as the
rise in private demand deposits diminishes and U.S. Government deposits
decline some. These projections allow for continued growth in commercial
paper at about $100 million per week and assume no change in Euro-dollar
takings from current levels.
(14) The table below summarizes expected first quarter annual
rates of increase for key monetary variables. Second quarter projections
are also shown, assuming the money market conditions of paragraph (8),
but with the expectation that short-term rates will be dropping further,
partly for seasonal reasons, in late spring. The projections also
assume that the sharp rise anticipated for time deposits will be partly
offset by further repayment of Euro-dollars and/or declining bank
interest in selling commercial paper, and that a sizable drop in
seasonally adjusted U.S. Government deposits from the March average
to the June average will provide a temporary fillip to the money
supply. It should be recognized, of course, that the projections are
subject to a considerable range of estimating error, and that they
depend importantly on realization of staff projections of the level
of economic activity as presented in the greenbook.

Policy alternative
(15) If it is the Committee's desire to encourage somewhat
more growth in the monetary aggregates, and to move further toward less
firm money market conditions, it may wish to consider the following
second paragraph for the directive (alternative B):
To implement this policy, while taking account of
[DEL: the current Treasury refunding possible bank regulatory
changes and] the Committee's desire to see moderate growth
in money and bank credit over the months ahead, System
open market operations until the next meeting of the
Committee shall be conducted with a view to CONTINUING
TO MOVE moving gradually toward somewhat less firm condi-
tions in the money market; provided, however, that opera-
tions shall be modified promptly to resist any tendency for
money and bank credit to deviate significantly from THE
ANTICIPATED [DEL: a moderate ] growth pattern.
(16) A continuing move toward less firm money market condi-
tions might entail a Federal funds rate averaging between 7 and 8 per
cent, member bank borrowings dropping to around $700 million, and net
borrowed reserves of $500-$700 million. Under these conditions, the
few weeks, and could move even lower as the spring progresses.
(17) The anticipated weakness of the economy through the
second quarter suggests that it will be difficult to generate much more
growth in the money supply than indicated in alternative A without a
substantially lower level of interest rates. At the same time, the
continuing tight position of banks generally suggests that there would
be a sharp expansion in bank credit if market interest rates dropped
well below Regulation Q constraints, and banks thereby had the opportunity
to regain their market position through time deposits. As best we can
estimate the further easing in money market conditions specified in
paragraph (16) might be associated with a March growth rate of 12-15
per cent, annual rate, in total time deposits, and possibly with an
even further rebound in the spring quarter. The money supply might show
only a little more strength, with most of that later in the spring as
lower interest rates make it marginally more attractive to rebuild cash
balances. Mainly because of the rise in time deposits, the adjusted
bank credit proxy would also be stronger than under alternative A,
rising in an 8-11 per cent annual rate range in March and April together.
It is assumed that the additional time deposits obtained by banks would
substitute in part for funds now obtained through nondeposit sources.
(18) Staff guesses as to how the monetary aggregates might
develop under alternative B are shown in the table below (with figures
representing percentage annual rates of change):
