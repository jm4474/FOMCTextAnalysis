MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES
Recent Developments
(1) Throughout the intermeeting period, the federal funds
rate has averaged close to the Committee's expectation of 3 percent.
Many other interest rates moved up some when the Chairman's Humphrey-
Hawkins testimony was interpreted as raising the odds of a tightening of
monetary policy over the medium term, but they retreated later in
response to weaker-than-expected economic news, passage of the deficit
reduction package, and, most recently, favorable price readings for
July. On balance over the intermeeting period, money market rates are
unchanged and intermediate-term yields are down about 5 basis points,
while yields on long-term Treasury and corporate bonds have fallen as
much as 35 basis points. Stock prices have increased 1-1/2 to
intermediate-term Treasuries, are down 6 basis points from around the
time of the July FOMC meeting.
(2) The dollar's weighted average exchange value rose 1-1/4
percent, on balance, over the intermeeting period. The dollar strength-
ened slightly against the German mark, but rose more against most other
ERM currencies after the allowed margins of fluctuation were greatly
widened in response to massive selling pressures on the French franc and
several other currencies at the end of July. The prospect of more ex-
pansionary monetary policies after the bands were widened, especially by
non-German ERM monetary authorities, not only weakened those currencies
but also resulted in strong rallies in the domestic bond and stock mar-
kets of those countries. Since the widening, however, monetary authori-
ties have been cautious in relaxing policies, and short-term rates out-
side of Germany are generally still above their levels at the time of
the last FOMC meeting. In Germany, by contrast, three-month interest
rates declined 85 basis points over the intermeeting period, reflecting
some actual and further anticipated easings, despite the Bundesbank's
decision not to cut its discount rate in late July; long-term rates
decreased 30 basis points. With continued focus on Japan's trade sur-
plus, the dollar depreciated 5-1/4 percent against the yen, reaching a
new record low below Y102; the change in the Japanese government had
only a temporary depressing effect on the yen. Japanese short-term
rates declined 15 basis points, while long rates fell 30 basis points.
The Desk did not intervene in exchange markets during the period;
(3) The growth rates of M2 in June and July averaged 1-3/4
percent, leaving this aggregate a shade under the 1 percent lower bound
of its downward-revised annual range. Although growth was only a bit
below the subdued pace foreseen in the last bluebook, it was supported
to a greater degree than anticipated by identifiable special factors.
These included surprisingly robust mortgage refinancings, which boosted
demand deposits, and the purchase of Chicago Research and Trading (CRT),
a nonbank primary dealer, by NationsBank, which boosted the level of
bank RPs. Underlying growth in M2 thus was somewhat weaker than fore-
seen. Nominal income during the second quarter expanded more slowly
than the staff had forecast; moreover, flows to bond and stock mutual
funds strengthened in June and anecdotal evidence suggests they remained
brisk in July.3  M1 growth averaged 10-1/2 percent over the two
months, with each of its components posting average growth rates in the
low double digits. 4
(4) M3 contracted at a 1-3/4 percent rate over June and July,
compared with the modest increase predicted in the last bluebook. Since
the fourth quarter of last year, M3 has declined at about a 1/2 percent
rate, leaving it below the lower edge of its newly reduced 0 to 4 per-
cent annual growth rate range. The weakness in M3 over June and July
partly reflected a substantial drop in institution-only money market
mutual funds, whose returns had not kept pace with the increase in money
market rates in late spring. Also damping M3 growth, depositories in-
creased their reliance on various nondeposit sources of funds, including
borrowings from abroad, equity, and subordinated debt. Bank credit
edged down from a 9-1/2 percent growth rate in June to an 8-1/2 percent
rate in July. The expansion in July would have been only half as rapid
had not NationsBank's purchase of CRT boosted the U.S. government
securities and security loans components of bank credit.
(5) Credit flows to nonfederal sectors have strengthened a bit
in recent months. In the household sector, consumer credit picked up
somewhat in June, and consumer loans at banks in July--the only data
available--continued to grow briskly. With a strengthening of home
sales and some equity extraction involved in heightened mortgage re-
financing activity, net mortgage borrowing by households likely also
firmed in June. Net borrowing by businesses evidently has been
moderate. Responding to lower long-term yields and elevated equity
prices, corporations offered a substantial volume of bonds, including
some 50- and 100-year issues, and equity. Much of the proceeds of this
activity was earmarked for repaying previously issued high-cost bonds as
well as bank loans, which dropped last month after two months of expan-
sion. Businesses are apparently finding securities markets quite recep-
tive: Quality spreads, already low, have narrowed further, reflecting
firms' improved financial conditions and perhaps also a willingness of
investors to take on more risk in their attempt to improve on available
deposit returns and to replace higher-yielding securities that matured
or were retired. In addition, banks have shown a greater willingness to
lend to businesses: A larger fraction of domestic bank respondents to
the August lending practices survey reported some easing of standards
and terms on business loans over the preceding three months than did so
in May. Overall debt of nonfederal nonfinancial sectors grew at a 4
percent rate again in June, bringing its rate of expansion since the
fourth quarter to 3-1/4 percent. With federal debt increasing at a
debt rose at a 5 percent rate from its fourth quarter base through June,
in the lower half of its newly specified 4 to 8 percent annual monitor-
ing range.

Policy Alternatives
(6) Three alternatives are presented below for consideration
by the Committee. Under alternative B, federal funds would continue to
trade around 3 percent in association with an allowance for adjustment
plus seasonal borrowing of $250 million.5 Under alternative A, the
federal funds rate would decline to 2-1/2 percent, either through a drop
in the borrowing allowance to $225 million or a cut in the discount rate
of 50 basis points in combination with an unchanged level of borrowing.
Under alternative C, the federal funds rate would rise to 3-1/2 percent
accompanying a boost in adjustment plus seasonal borrowing to $275 mil-
(7) Market participants are not expecting a change in policy
over the relatively short upcoming intermeeting period. Thus, under
alternative B, short-term interest rates should remain around current
levels in the weeks ahead. The prime rate, at 6 percent, is unlikely to
move, as banks' increased willingness to lend will probably take the
form of narrower spreads relative to benchmark rates and more attractive
nonprice terms. Although the passage of the deficit reduction package
has removed one element of uncertainty, questions remain about its
effects, suggesting that rates could be quite sensitive to information
bearing on household and business spending. Currently, market partici-
pants appear to be anticipating a tightening of monetary policy by early
next year, on the presumption that short-term rates will have to move up
to forestall any incipient buildup of inflation pressures. Given these
expectations, intermediate- and perhaps long-term rates could drift
lower if, in line with the staff economic forecast, incoming indicators
point to more subdued spending and inflationary pressures than now seem
built into market expectations; in such circumstances, market partici-
pants would likely see tightening actions as being pushed further into
the future. The dollar should trade around recent levels on foreign
exchange markets, with any downward pressure from possible declines in
U.S. interest rates being balanced by projected reductions in rates
(8) The interest rates under alternative B are consistent with
those of the staff Greenbook forecast, which has the federal funds rate
around current levels through 1994 and long-term rates edging lower. In
that forecast, persistent low levels of real short-term interest rates
are needed to counter fiscal drag and other impediments to economic
growth. Under these circumstances, the unemployment rate does not de-
cline from its current level, while core inflation slows only modestly.
With this configuration of income and interest rates, broad money ag-
gregates are projected to expand sluggishly while total nonfinancial
debt increases around the pace of nominal GDP.
(9) Over the balance of 1993, M2 is projected to grow at about
a 1-1/2 percent pace under alternative B, and, as shown in the table
below, to finish the year around the lower bound of its new annual
range. Although special factors that have boosted M2 growth in
recent months are seen as fading somewhat, underlying growth in this
aggregate is boosted by a little faster growth in nominal income. The
lure of capital market instruments--from the still fairly steep yield
curve and reported capital gains on securities to date--is expected to
remain strong, and inflows to mutual funds probably will stay near the
record pace of the year thus far. As a consequence, the velocity of M2
is expected to increase at a 3 percent rate in the second half of the
year, only a little less than the 4 percent rate of the first half.7
M3 under alternative B is projected to bottom out in August and to edge
higher over the remainder of the year. Although bank credit growth
should slow a bit, more of it is expected to be funded by deposits,
given the very comfortable capital levels of many banks. Still, M3
would finish the year a little below its fourth-quarter 1992 base and
the lower bound of its range.

continue to ease. Nonetheless, borrowing is expected to remain con-
centrated in longer-term markets, where credit-risk premiums should
remain unusually low. In contrast, a pause in rapid federal debt growth
is anticipated in the months just ahead, as the Treasury draws on its
large cash balance before returning to the debt markets in volume later
in the year. As a consequence, growth of the total debt of domestic
nonfinancial sectors is projected to slow slightly from the first half
of the year to 4-1/2 percent over the second half, implying an increase
of 4-3/4 percent for the year as a whole.
(11) The easing under alternative A would come as a surprise
to market participants, and short-term rates would decline by the full
decrease noticeably, and longer-term rates also would move lower, at
least in the immediate aftermath of the easing action. The fall in
longer-term nominal interest rates might be limited if inflation expec-
tations were worsened by a sense that the Federal Reserve was putting
less weight on its longer-run price stability objective. Even if
longer-term nominal rates were little affected, real rates across the
maturity structure would fall. However, unless the easing itself
prompted a more downbeat market assessment of the underlying strength of
spending, the drop in real capital market rates might be muted to some
extent by questions about how long the reduced federal funds rate could
be sustained, given its already low level in real terms.
(12) In light of the likelihood of some decline in an array of
real interest rates, as well as the real foreign exchange value of the
dollar, alternative A might be favored if economic growth in the staff
forecast were seen to be unsatisfactory and the Committee were willing
to accept little or no further disinflation. Or this option might
appear attractive if the risks to the staff forecast were seen to be
tilted significantly toward the downside, especially in view of con-
tinued fiscal drag. The lower interest rates of this alternative would
tend to boost money growth relative to alternative B and, under the
spending propensities incorporated in the staff forecast, would give a
little more assurance that the broad aggregates would finish the year at
or above the lower bounds of their ranges for 1993. Faster growth in M2
under alternative A owes both to more growth in nominal income later in
the year than under alternative B and to the improvement in the attrac-
tiveness of assets in M2 relative to money market instruments. However,
the strengthening of M2 would be only modest, because the elasticity of
this aggregate with respect to short-term interest rates now seems to be
quite small. M3 under alternative A would expand slowly over the final
four months of the year as bank credit growth remained damped in the
context of continued heavy financing in the securities markets.
(13) The tightening of policy under alternative C would come
much sooner than is now envisioned by market participants. As a conse-
quence, rates at the short end would increase by the half-point boost in
the federal funds rate. The prime rate would rise, likely by one-half
point, although a quarter-point increase in the federal funds rate might
not elicit any change in the prime rate. Intermediate-term rates, both
nominal and real, would move higher, with the extent of the increase
depending on whether market participants viewed the action as merely
moving forward the current trajectory of expected rate increases or as a
fundamentally more aggressive posture that was more certain to achieve
price stability. Perceptions of a firmer stance against inflation would
put some downward pressure on more distant forward rates, muting the
likely rise in bond yields. In any case, the dollar would move higher
on foreign exchange markets.
(14) Alternative C might be favored if the Committee saw a
need to move sooner, rather than later, to contain or reduce future
inflationary pressures. An outlook for economic growth and inflation
stronger than in the staff forecast would bolster the rationale for a
policy firming action. Such an outlook might follow from a view that
the more aggressive posture being adopted by banks and other lenders
would provide, with lags, considerable stimulus to the economy and
prices. With the staff's outlook for spending propensities, M2 would
expand at only a 1 percent pace over the final five months of this year
under alternative C, ending the year about 3/4 percent above its fourth-
quarter 1992 level. Growth in this aggregate would be restrained not
only by larger opportunity costs but also by slower income growth as
year-end approached. Weaker M2 would show through to M3 which would be
about flat over the remainder of the year.
