MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES
Recent Developments
(1) Over the intermeeting period, the federal funds rate averaged 5-1/2 percent, its
intended level since March, while most other market interest rates declined (Chart 1). Pri-
vate short-term rates fell by as much as 10 basis points.1 Futures rates for federal funds and
Eurodollars continue to suggest that markets expect policy to remain on hold for several
months and see relatively low odds on a tightening thereafter. Longer-term nominal yields
were down 15 to 25 basis points, but yields on indexed debt were about unchanged, suggest-
ing that a slight reduction in long-term inflation compensation accounted for the drop in
nominal yields. Earlier in the period, optimism about inflation apparently had become even
greater--sparked by favorable price and labor cost data, along with the market's take on the
Chairman's Humphrey-Hawkins testimony--and by late July nominal note and bond yields had
fallen almost 1/2 percentage point. Since then, bond prices and the foreign exchange value of
the dollar have partly reversed their earlier increases; prompted initially by reports of large
gains in employment in July and of strength in manufacturing output and price pressures in
the July NAPM survey results, market participants seem to have been reassessing whether
they hadn't become a little too optimistic about structural changes damping cyclical inflation
pressures. With less certainty about the inflation outlook, market reactions to incoming data
have been especially pronounced, and volatility in financial markets has risen considerably.
Stock prices also have slipped in recent weeks and dropped sharply today, erasing most of the
large advances registered earlier in the period.
(2) The trade-weighted value of the dollar has gained about 3-1/2 percent on
balance over the intermeeting period. This appreciation occurred even though interest rate
differentials between dollar and foreign currency assets were little changed, averaging across
countries. In part, the dollar's increase reflected concerns about developments in Continental
Europe, where a variety of policy decisions raised new doubts about potential EMU members'
longer-term commitment to sound macroeconomic policies. The dollar has appreciated 4-1/2
percent against the DM despite the fact that German interest rates fell somewhat less than
U.S. rates; as the fall in the DM deepened, market participants came to the view that the
Bundesbank might soon raise rates to stem the decline. Elsewhere, the Bank of England
increased its repo rate twice over the intermeeting period, but indicated that this cycle of
tightening may be at or near its end, thereby weakening the pound, which fell 3 percent
relative to the dollar. New data suggesting that the Japanese economy is not rebounding
quickly from the recent consumption tax increase put downward pressure on the yen over the
intermeeting period. This tendency was offset to some extent by concerns about divergent
trends in U.S. and Japanese current account positions. For the period as a whole, the yen is
down 2-1/2 percent against the dollar. Financial turmoil in Thailand spilled over to several
other developing countries, primarily in Southeast Asia. The currencies of a number of
Southeast Asian countries have fallen 5 to 30 percent relative to the dollar since the beginning
of July as several central banks have been forced to abandon arrangements aimed at limiting
exchange rate fluctuations. A package of financial assistance and policy actions for the Thai
economy has been announced.
; the Desk did not intervene.
(3) Growth of M2 in July, at a 4-1/2 percent rate, remained near the moderate
pace of June. Data for early August suggest a pickup in M2 growth, owing particularly to
inflows to retail money funds, which may be related to the recent jitters in the stock market.
From the fourth quarter of last year through July, this aggregate expanded at a 5 percent pace,
a shade faster than expected at the time of the last Committee meeting. The velocity of M2
edged down in the second quarter, owing to a slight narrowing of opportunity costs, ending
the sequence of upticks seen over the previous four quarters.2 M3 growth surged to a 10-3/4
percent rate in July, even though adjusted bank credit growth slowed; issuance of large time
deposits was particularly strong, replacing overseas sources of funding at foreign banks and a
runoff of government deposits at domestic banks. Moreover, institution-only money funds
posted another month of rapid growth, as their yields lagged the decline in private short-term
interest rates and they evidently continued to substitute for in-house cash management by
businesses. From the fourth quarter of 1996 through July, M3 grew at a 7-1/2 percent rate,
substantially faster than the staff had anticipated.
(4) Private debt growth appears to have slowed a little from its brisk pace earlier
in the year, owing largely to a softening in household borrowing. Business borrowing has
risen in recent months, reflecting strength in capital spending. Financing conditions for the
business sector remain quite favorable; indeed, quality spreads on junk bonds have edged
lower recently, and in survey responses a sizable fraction of banks reported a further decrease
in loan rate spreads from already narrow levels. Although banks, on balance, have continued
to tighten standards on consumer credit, the proportion doing so declined in the most recent
survey. A high level of tax receipts enabled the Treasury to pay down debt in May and June,
appreciably slowing the growth of total nonfinancial debt. From the fourth quarter of last
year through June, domestic nonfinancial debt grew at a 4-1/2 percent annual rate, just below
the middle of its annual range.

Policy Alternatives
(5) In the staff forecast, near-term growth has been revised down considerably
because inventory investment is expected to downshift from its surprisingly fast pace in the
first half. At the same time, the staff has revised up slightly its assessment of trend growth in
productivity and potential GDP. Still, the basic picture remains one of an economy that will
continue to operate above its potential, generating a gradual rise in inflation. Next year, final
demand growth is expected to slow, owing partly to the lagged effects of the recent strength
in the dollar, some rise in interest rates, and accelerator effects on business and household
capital expenditures. But this slowdown is not sufficient to relieve pressures on resources,
and both total and core consumer price inflation are forecast to edge up to 2-3/4 percent by
the end of 1998. The staff projections of output growth and inflation in both 1997 and 1998
are near the lower ends of the central tendencies of FOMC members' projections made last
(6) With the risks apparently still tilted toward higher inflation, this document
presents the two basic policy options discussed in recent bluebooks: no change and tighter.
Under alternative B, the intended federal funds rate would be kept at its current level of 5-1/2
percent. Under alternative C, it would be boosted to 5-3/4 percent, either through reduced
provision of nonborrowed reserves or a hike in the discount rate.
(7) Despite the updrift in inflation projected by the staff, the Committee may
elect to maintain the current stance of monetary policy for the time being by choosing alter-
native B. Regardless of any longer-term risks, any likelihood of losing substantial ground
against inflation in the period just ahead appears to be remote: Inflation expectations seem to
have declined in recent months, which should help to moderate for a time any turnaround in
actual price increases; and, at this stage of the investment cycle and with consumers already
having responded to their increased wealth, the odds on a marked upside surprise in final
demand would seem to be lower than they might have appeared earlier. Moreover, the real
federal funds rate has been rising this year from an already high level, owing to the
Committee's firming of policy in March and the apparent decline in inflation expectations
since then, providing some assurance that policy is not substantially too accommodative.
Financial aggregates could be read in the same light, with both M2 and debt, the two
aggregates most closely related to nominal GDP, expanding moderately.3 In the staff forecast,
the rise in inflation is gradual, so that once the potential for an upswing in inflation became
more clearly evident, the Committee should have time to act before the economy's long-run
health were seriously threatened. Indeed, whether the structure of the economy has changed
in ways that make it somewhat less inflation-prone, at least for a time, than allowed for by
the staff projection remains an open question.
(8) Market participants uniformly do not expect a near-term policy move by the
Federal Reserve, and selection of alternative B by the Committee should elicit little imme-
diate market reaction. Thus, short-term interest rates generally would remain close to current
levels, as would the foreign exchange value of the dollar, though Treasury bill rates could
continue to edge up as supply constraints ease further with the seasonal widening of the
federal deficit. In longer-term markets, prices are likely to remain more volatile than over the
spring and early summer as participants assess incoming data for clues about whether the
recent exceptional confluence of strong growth, high levels of resource utilization, and low
inflation can persist. However, data over the intermeeting period consistent with the staff
forecast would likely prove somewhat reassuring in this regard, because they would show the
economy growing at a moderate pace and inflation remaining damped. In these circum-
stances, long-term yields could move lower over the weeks ahead.
(9) Moderating growth in output will still leave utilization in the labor market
substantially above levels that in the past have been associated with accelerating prices. If
the Committee wants more insurance against the possibility that inflation will begin to pick
up, and especially if it wishes to tilt the odds a little in the direction of further progress
toward price stability over coming years, it may wish to raise the intended federal funds rate
at this meeting, perhaps by the 25 basis points of alternative C. With strong demand over
the past year and a half propelling the economy beyond the level of its estimated potential,
real short-term rates might be seen as having been below their equilibriums. One reason for
this situation may be that, despite a high real federal funds rate relative to its historical
average, financial market conditions evidently have been supportive of spending--spreads
faced by private borrowers are quite narrow and equity prices remain at a high level.
Although inflation performance has been surprisingly good of late, the effects of a stronger
dollar have played an important role that is not likely to be repeated in the next few years,
and signs of resurgent labor militancy may indicate reduced worker insecurity. Although
inflation expectations have fallen, the recent volatility in financial markets suggests that in
those markets such expectations may not be firmly anchored, and could turn around reason-
ably quickly once inflation begins to pick up. In those circumstances, delaying policy action
ultimately could turn out to be costly in terms of economic performance.
(10) With no near-term tightening expected, the market response to implementation
of alternative C could be sharp. Short-term market rates would jump by the full 25 basis
point increase in the funds rate; the prime rate likely would be lifted by an equivalent
amount. Bond markets would sell off as well. Investors would have difficulty interpreting
such an action in light of developments over the intermeeting period, and their response might
be shaped in part by the Federal Reserve's announcement. Participants might well think that
the action represented a one-time adjustment to rebalance risks, in which case the response
would tend to be muted. But more pronounced decreases in bond prices can not be ruled out
because investors might interpret the action as signifying that the Federal Reserve had
reassessed its fundamental outlook and now saw a more serious and sustained inflation threat
that would call for further tightening actions. If so, the value of the dollar on foreign
exchange markets probably would strengthen considerably. In either case, equity prices
almost certainly would fall, as real interest rates rose, and the decline could be considerable if
capital losses spurred investors to reexamine their assumptions regarding the risks of equity
(11) Under the unchanged federal funds rate of alternative B, M2 is projected to
grow at a moderate 4-1/2 percent rate on average over the remaining months of the year,
around the expected rate of expansion of nominal GDP, leaving this aggregate a little below
the upper limit of its 1 to 5 percent growth range for the year. The increase in M3 is likely
to slow somewhat, as factors that have temporarily been boosting managed liabilities in that
aggregate dissipate, but M3 growth will probably continue to be fueled by a shift in institu-
tional cash management toward money market funds. This aggregate is expected to finish the
year more than a percentage point higher than its 2 to 6 percent annual range, somewhat
above the staffs projection in the July bluebook. Although the federal government will shift
to being a net borrower in credit markets over the balance of the year, the growth of its debt
will be restrained by the narrow deficit. At the same time, the level and pattern of borrowing
by private sectors is not anticipated to change significantly, producing moderate growth in the
debt of all nonfinancial sectors--near the middle of its 3 to 7 percent range and in line with
nominal GDP.
