MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES
Recent Developments
(1) On February 4, the Federal Reserve moved to a less
accommodative stance in reserve markets to reduce the likelihood that
inflationary pressures would increase in the future, a decision
announced by Chairman Greenspan. The availability of nonborrowed
reserves was decreased slightly, with the allowance for adjustment and
seasonal borrowing boosted from $50 million to $75 million and federal
funds expected to trade around 3-1/4 percent. 1/4 percentage point
above the previous level. For the intermeeting period as a whole, the
federal funds rate averaged close to its intended level.
(2) Over the intermeeting period, other market interest
rates rose considerably more than the federal funds rate in frequently
volatile markets. Although money market interest rates before Febru-
ary 4 had partly incorporated expectations of a tightening, the Com-
mittee's action came sooner than most market participants apparently
had been expecting and was seen by some as suggesting that the Federal
Reserve would move more quickly than had been anticipated to "policy
neutrality" in order to head off potential inflationary pressures.
Against this background, investors became especially sensitive to news
that aggregate demand retained considerable forward momentum into the
first quarter and that manufacturers were paying higher prices for
inputs. Moreover, trade frictions with Japan and political develop-
ments at home appeared at times to increase uncertainty about future
movements in the prices of dollar-denominated assets, putting downward
pressure on the foreign exchange value of the dollar as well as upward
pressure on interest rates. Anecdotal information suggests that a
number of institutional fund managers--some faced with appreciable
trading losses in the United States and abroad and seeing interest
rates now to be on an upward trend--slashed their long positions,
possibly exacerbating the downswing in market prices.
(3) On balance, money market interest rates have risen 40 to
tions of a 1/4 percentage point tightening in the very near term and
strong odds on yet another firming not long thereafter.1 Inter-
mediate- and long-term rates have jumped 60 to 75 basis points.
Implied forward rates moved up especially sharply at intermediate
maturities, reflecting the sense that cyclical pressures on credit
demands and inflation would be greater than expected. Somewhat more
surprising was the substantial increase in forward rates at longer
horizons, perhaps indicating greater uncertainty premiums as well as
the effects of heavy selling of bonds by some portfolio managers. In
sometimes volatile trading, stock prices were unchanged to down 3
percent over the intermeeting period: this relatively small change
suggests that the effects of higher interest rates were partly offset
by a stronger outlook for output and earnings.
(4) Despite the rise in U.S. interest rates, the dollar's
weighted-average exchange value declined 1-1/2 percent, on balance,
since the February FOMC. The dollar depreciated 2-1/2 percent against
the mark and 2 percent against the yen, but appreciated 3 percent
against the Canadian dollar. The mark and associated ERM currencies
strengthened with the perception that the Bundesbank would be slower
to ease than previously had been thought, a perception reflected in a
sharp backup of Euro-mark deposit futures rates. Trade frictions
between the United States and Japan appeared to be the dominant in-
fluence on yen/dollar exchange rates. Bond yields abroad rose sharply
through early March, with rates increasing 30 to 110 basis points on
(5) The monetary aggregates were considerably weaker in
February than projected. M2 and M3 contracted at 1 and 7-3/4 percent
annual rates, respectively. These declines left M2 on a monthly aver-
age basis in February just a bit above the lower bound of its 1-to-5
percent range for 1994 and M3 below the lower end of its 0-to-4 per-
cent range. Data for early March suggest some rebound in both
aggregates, bringing growth of M2 since January back to its projected
rate. The velocities of the broader aggregates are forecast to in-
crease strongly in the current quarter, although not as rapidly as in
the fourth quarter.
(6) The weakness in the monetary aggregates in February
reflected several factors. With regard to M2, the System's tightening
action may have played a small role, but the bulk of any influence
should not occur for several months. A sharp decline in mortgage
refinancings since late last year has depressed demand deposits and,
to a lesser extent, savings deposits.4 Finally, distortions in
Total reserves expanded at a
3-1/2 percent rate in February, while the monetary base increased at a
13-1/4 percent pace.
seasonal factors related to the timing of changes in monetary policy
earlier in the 1990s may have artificially held down money growth in
February.5 While sales of long-term mutual funds apparently con-
tinued strong on average in February, there have been sizable net
redemptions of bond funds in recent weeks, and inflows to stock funds
seem to have been on the weak side. These developments may have
contributed to a sharp boost in money funds and M2 in early March.
At the M3 level, institution-only money funds dropped off precipi-
tously in the wake of the System's tightening, as shareholders moved
to take advantage of higher yields available in the open markets.
Large time deposits also contracted, with the declines concentrated at
foreign banks; credit at branches and agencies surged last month, but
these institutions substituted borrowing from abroad for domestic CDs.
After adjusting for a change in accounting that boosted reported
securities holdings, the expansion of total bank credit was modest in
February, with holdings of government securities flat on the month
after several months of healthy increases.7
(7) So far in 1994, the growth of nonfederal sector debt
is estimated to have about maintained the brisker pace of the fourth
quarter of last year, but with the backup in yields borrowing has
shifted a little toward shorter-term sources. Business loans have
expanded at a somewhat stronger pace than in 1993, abetted by the
easing in terms and standards that has been underway over the past
year. Nonfinancial corporations have trimmed offerings of bonds in
public markets over the past few weeks and have reduced maturities of
the bonds and commercial paper sold. Issuance of bonds in the tax-
exempt sector also has been running well below last year's pace.
Borrowing by households appears to have moderated a little from its
rapid fourth-quarter rate, though it still remains brisk. Consumer
credit expanded at a 9 percent rate in January, and consumer loans at
banks (adjusted for securitization) increased at a 12 percent rate
last month. Although refinancing activity has declined, mortgage
growth likely has remained strong, reflecting robust home sales late
last year and some cashing out of equity. Applications for adjust-
able-rate mortgage loans have picked up noticeably, as fixed-rate
mortgage rates have moved well above their recent lows. The overall
debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors is estimated to have expanded at
a 5 percent rate in February, leaving this aggregate near the middle
of its 4-to-8 percent annual range.

Policy Alternatives
(8) Two monetary policy alternatives are presented below for
consideration by the Committee. Under alternative B, federal funds
would continue to trade around 3-1/4 percent in association with ad-
justment plus seasonal borrowing of $75 million. Under alterna-
tive C, the federal funds rate would increase 50 basis points, to
to $100 million.
(9) With market participants expecting appreciable increases
in the federal funds rate in coming months, including 25 basis points
at the March FOMC meeting, interest rates could tend to drift lower
under the unchanged reserve conditions of alternative B. Rate de-
clines would be quite small initially if market participants still
believed that the next tightening step was imminent but had merely
been delayed, perhaps by the unsettled market conditions of late. As
the intermeeting period unfolds, economic data in line with the Green-
book projection should suggest moderate economic growth and no inten-
sification of inflation pressures, and interest rates could fall
noticeably under this alternative as markets reassessed the trajectory
of Federal Reserve tightening. The scope for any rate decreases,
especially at the long end of the market, could be quite limited,
however, if the hiatus in tightening were to call into question the
Federal Reserve's anti-inflationary resolve.
(10) Alternative B might be favored if most of the increase
in intermediate- and long-term real rates over recent months were
thought likely to persist and be sufficient to restrain demand and
head off additional inflationary pressures. The staff economic fore-
cast assumes that policy needs to tighten eventually to maintain high
enough real rates to avoid an overheating of the economy. However,
that forecast does not necessarily assume a move as soon as the March
meeting. Even if long-term rates were expected to decline appreci-
ably, alternative B might be selected were the economy nevertheless
seen as remaining below its long-term potential and inflation pres-
sures contained. Such an assessment could be based on a sense that
recent data suggested less momentum in the economy or on a judgment
that the behavior of costs and broad price indexes has been indicating
a greater degree of slack in the economy than embodied in the staff
(11) Alternative C involves a larger immediate tightening
than now built into the structure of market rates. As a consequence,
money market interest rates would rise, though by much less than the
Banks would probably take this opportunity to boost the prime rate.
Long-term rates likely would also move up some. Another major bond
market sell-off cannot be ruled out, but seems less likely now. Port-
folios have been adjusted to an environment of rising short-term
interest rates; moreover, if such a decisive action were seen as
leaving the funds rate reasonably close to policy neutrality, uncer-
tainty about the magnitude and timing of future tightening actions
might be reduced.
(12) In addition to possibly contributing to more settled
market conditions, alternative C might be preferred if the Committee
saw significant risks of greater inflation going forward. To fore-
stall this possibility, the Committee may wish to take prompter action
than assumed in the staff forecast. The 50 basis point increase in
the funds rate under this alternative would tend to sustain the backup
in real intermediate- and long-term rates, which may be seen as needed
to restrain inflation pressures, especially in the context of a con-
siderably more accommodative lending posture of intermediaries.
(13) Instead of tightening to the degree contained in alter-
native C, the Committee could firm reserve conditions by enough to
raise the federal funds rate 25 basis points. Such an action would
validate market expectations for the outcome of the meeting, and the
effect on most interest rates would be small. This alternative might
be favored if the Committee were not certain that the strength of
demands in the economy and credit markets required a 1/2 percentage
point hike in the funds rate at this time. However, such a smaller
action could leave market participants with a sense that another
tightening might be forthcoming fairly soon, perhaps contributing to
continued market skittishness.
(14) Under the staff economic forecast, private credit de-
mands should remain near the firmer pace of recent months. Business
borrowing is projected to edge up in keeping with expansion of capital
outlays, and these borrowing needs are expected to be focused largely
on the bond market, especially if market conditions become more set-
tled and some of the recent increase in bond rates is reversed. None-
theless, bank loans to businesses will continue to expand in response
to more favorable terms on such credits and growing financing needs of
those without access to open markets. Household borrowing in both
mortgage and consumer credit markets is expected to remain brisk,
drifting downward as growth in outlays on housing and durables stays
below the pace of late last year. Expansion of federal debt is pro-
jected to be around that of nonfederal sectors, in sharp contrast to
recent years, as fiscal restraint and solid economic growth shrink the
deficit. The growth rate of total debt of domestic nonfinancial sec-
tors is expected to average 5-1/4 percent over February to June, plac-
ing this aggregate 5-1/2 percent at an annual rate above its fourth-
quarter base, broadly in line with nominal spending, and a little
below the midpoint of its monitoring range for 1994.
(15) Projections for growth of the monetary aggregates are
summarized in the table below (and more detail is provided on the
table and charts that follow). Under both alternatives, the broader
monetary aggregates are expected to be stronger in coming months than
over January and February, though still quite subdued. Growth in M1
is projected to be close to or a bit faster than the reduced pace of
January and February.9

only 3/4 percent over January and February, even as growth in nominal
income continues to slow. A resumption of inflows to M2 money market
mutual funds, owing in part to the lessened appeal of bond funds,

provides some of the lift to M2. Nonetheless, M2 velocity would con-
tinue to rise in the second quarter under alternative B, but its
two previous quarters. Under alternative C, M2 would grow at a
weaker inflows to liquid components as opportunity costs widen more.
Still, by June, M2 would have grown at a 1-3/4 percent rate from its
fourth-quarter 1993 base under alternative C, above the lower end of
its 1994 annual range.
(17) The pickup in M2 is projected to show through to M3.
Under alternative B, this aggregate would expand at a 1-1/2 percent
pace over the February-to-June period. Bank credit is forecast to
grow at the moderate pace of recent months, but less should be funded
through non-M3 sources. Moreover, the drag on M3 from large outflows
of institution-only money market mutual funds would end and small
inflows resume as money market rates decline some. Under alternative
C, M3 would pick up by less, expanding at a 1-1/4 percent rate over
February to June, restrained by some further outflows from M3-type
money market funds. By June, M3 would stand 1/4 percent at an annual
rate above its fourth-quarter base under alternative C, only a little
above the lower end of its annual growth cone.
Directive Language
(18) Presented below is draft wording for the operational
paragraph that includes the usual options for Committee consideration.
OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH
In the implementation of policy for the immediate future,
the Committee seeks to increase slightly (SOMEWHAT)/maintain/
DECREASE SLIGHTLY (SOMEWHAT) the existing degree of pressure on
reserve positions. In the context of the Committee's long-run
objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth,
and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and
monetary developments, slightly (SOMEWHAT) greater reserve
restraint MIGHT/WOULD, or slightly (SOMEWHAT) lesser reserve
restraint might (WOULD) be acceptable in the intermeeting period.
The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent
with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over the first half of 1994.
