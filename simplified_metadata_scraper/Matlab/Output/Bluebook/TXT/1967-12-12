MONEY MARKET AND RESERVE RELATIONSHIPS
Recent developments
Treasury bill rates have changed little, on balance, since
the interim meeting of the FOMC on November 27, but some other short-
term rates, including yields on bankers' acceptances and finance company
paper, have adjusted up somewhat further. Since the mid-November
devaluation of sterling and U.K. and U.S. discount rate increases,
short-term market rates in general have moved up 1/8 to ½ of a percentage
point. The 3-month Treasury bill has recently been trading around 4.90
per cent--compared with 4.67 per cent on November 17--while yields on
the 6-month and 1-year bills were recently around 5.45 and 5.65 per
cent respectively. In long-term markets, municipal yields have risen
since devaluation; yields on prime corporates have shown little net
change on balance; and yields on longer-term U.S. Government bonds
have dropped somewhat.
The structure of short-term market rates has still permitted
major banks to compete for CD's,but they have had to offer increasingly
shorter maturities at the 5-1/2 per cent ceiling. Banks sold, net,
about $1 billion of new CD's in November, with about half of the sales
in the second half of the month after the rise in discount rate. The
extent of bank activity in the CD market probably reflects in part
efforts to hedge against any reduced availability of Euro-dollars, as

well as the continued desire to obtain whatever funds are available
under prevailing ceiling rates and thus to maintain short-term invest-
ment portfolios in the event of some near-term pick-up in loan demand.
With sales of CD's maturing in less than 3 months during November
continuing to account for an increasing share of total sales, the
volume of maturities in December has reached a new high monthly total of
$5.9 billion. January maturities have already risen to $4.5 billion,
and are likely to rise further.
The availability of Euro-dollars does not appear thus far to
have been seriously constrained since devaluation, although banks appear
generally unwilling to pay the higher rates that have emerged for
longer-term maturities. Any more than seasonal tendency for foreign
funds to flow out of the Euro-dollar market following devaluation
appears to have been cushioned by official operations that have
encouraged a continued availability of dollars from continental com-
mercial banks. Daily average liabilities to foreign branches of major
New York banks declined only about $200 million from the statement week
prior to devaluation to the latest week ending December 6.
With CD's building up and Euro-dollars relatively well main-
tained, major New York banks moved into a small basic reserve surplus
in the last half of November and remained close to balance in early
December. As a result, demand pressures on the Federal funds market
were relatively moderate. The funds rate had averaged a shade under

week. Dealer financing costs at New York banks followed the same
pattern, retaining their normal, small spread above the Federal funds
rate. As the new statement week opened, the Federal funds and dealer
loan rates moved up into a somewhat higher range.
Free reserves have averaged around $240 million and member
bank borrowings $105 million in the two latest statement weeks. This
compares with average free reserves of $210 million and member bank
borrowings of $125 million in the preceding 4 weeks.
In November, total reserves rose at a 7 per cent annual rate,
supporting an 8.5 per cent growth in the bank credit proxy (9.5 per
cent after including Euro-dollar borrowings). Expansion in the proxy
last month was down from a growth rate averaging 11 per cent in the
previous two months and 13.5 per cent in the first eight months of the
year, as loan demands remained moderate and banks reduced holdings of
U.S. Government securities while maintaining purchases of municipals.
The slower rate of growth in total deposits includes a
decline during November in U.S. Government deposits, which had increased
substantially in the preceding two months in reflection of the sizable
late August and early October cash financings. With Government deposits
declining in November, growth in private demand deposits and money
supply accelerated to 8.5 per cent and 7.5 per cent annual rates,
respectively. Despite the large November increase in outstanding CD's,
growth in total time and savings deposits, at a 12 per cent annual rate,

remained near the September-October average, as inflows of other time
and savings deposits slowed appreciably, especially following the issue
of attractive new Treasury notes at mid-month.
Prospective developments
The slowing in the rate of bank credit expansion which has been
evident since late summer is expected to continue through December,
assuming no significant change in money market conditions or credit
demands from those currently prevailing. Such conditions include a
Federal funds rate around the discount rate, net free reserves in a
$100 - $300 million range, and member bank borrowings in a $75 - $150
million range. Wide fluctuations in money market variables could
develop in light of mid-month tax date pressures and year-end fund
movements related to domestic and foreign window-dressing operations.
The money market impact of these basically seasonal factors could be
accentuated if high interest rates in the U.K. and restoration of
confidence in sterling result in an accelerated reduction in Euro-
dollar borrowings by U.S. banks, who, in turn, would be led either to
bid even more aggressively for CD's and Federal funds or to liquidate
Treasury bills and other short-term assets.
Barring a sharp constriction in Euro-dollar funds, the 3-
month Treasury bill rate is likely to remain in a 4.80 - 5.10 per
cent range over the next four weeks. While money market adjustments
by banks could put upward pressure on bill rates, demands for liquid
CONFIDENTIAL(FR) -5- December 8, 1967.
assets by investors and by borrowers reinvesting capital market proceeds
have been relatively strong in recent days, and may continue to exert a
moderating impact on bill rates. The Treasury is likely to announce,
in either late December or early January, a tax bill financing of around
$2 billion for payment in mid-January.
Given these short-term market conditions, the bank credit proxy
in December is expected to rise in a 2-5 per cent annual rate range.
Business loan expansion may well be expected to be stronger in the
weeks ahead than in recent months, as the pick-up in business activity
following the settlement of major strikes continues. But given the
relatively large $1.2 billion of CD's that mature on the tax date, it
is expected that banks will not be able to avoid an attrition in out-
standings of at least $500 million over the month, and some market
participants appear to be braced for a considerably larger attrition.
Moreover, it would appear that outstanding Euro-dollar borrowings through
foreign branches may well decline further, at least through year-end
on seasonal grounds. The recent reduction in domestic banks' liabili-
ties to overseas branches would be equivalent to a one percentage point
cut in bank credit expansion in December (reducing growth in the bank
credit proxy, adjusted for such borrowings, to a 1-4 per cent, annual
rate, range).
In January, bank credit expansion is likely to be larger than
in December, as banks help underwrite the anticipated sale by the Treasury
of June tax bills and as increased business inventory accumulation raises
CONFIDENTIAL(FR) -6- December 8, 1967.
loan demands. Moreover, if the current structure of short-term market
rates continues to prevail, it is assumed that banks will not lose
CD's on balance in January when they may find a fairly ready market
on the part of corporations for March and April tax period maturities.
But it should be recognized that both the December and January bank
credit outlook are subject to considerable uncertainty because the
closeness of key short-term market rates to Regulation Q ceilings
means that year-end or other temporary influences on money markets
have the potential for marked impacts on bank deposits and credit.
In December, total time and savings deposits are projected
to rise in an 8-11 per cent annual rate range, somewhat lower than
in November because of the CD attrition assumed. Time and savings
deposits other than CD's are expected to increase in December at a
slightly faster rate than in November, when these deposit inflows were
moderated by competition from the attractively priced Treasury notes
issued then at yields well above the various ceiling rates on time and
savings deposits. Such flows, however, might be retarded further in
January if consumers take advantage of the interest-crediting period
to move into higher yielding market instruments, or to make down pay-
ments on consumer durables.
The money supply in December is expected to rise in a 4-7
per cent range, largely in reflection of a drop in U.S. Government
deposits. With growth in private demand deposits not quite offsetting
the sharp reduction in Government deposits, and with time deposit

growth moderating, total and required reserves are projected to show
little or no growth this month. These deposit and reserve flows are
expected to be associated with little further change in long-term
rates over the weeks immediately ahead in view of the lull in the
calendar of new bond issues over that period, but a resumption of the
updrift in yields could occur on the basis of a further flow of more
buoyant economic news, or increased anticipations of a tightening
in monetary policy.
Policy alternatives. A firming of money market conditions
might include Federal funds averaging 4-5/8 per cent, and sometimes
trading above that rate, member bank borrowings generally in a $150 -
$250 million range, and the net free reserve position of banks in a
zero to $150 million range. The attainment of such conditions is likely
to be associated with a further upward movement in bill rates, as
dealer financing becomes more expensive and especially if expectations
of a further rise in the discount rate become prevalent. The 3-month
bill might move into a 5 -- 5-3/8 per cent range, with market attitudes
about the direction of monetary and fiscal policies and regulatory
actions on rate ceilings a key factor in determining emerging rate
levels. Long-term rates are also likely to rise somewhat further,
particularly if convictions grow that banks will be unable to remain
active in municipal and mortgage markets and that nonbank intermediaries
will become less able to compete effectively for savings flows.
CONFIDENTIAL(FR) -8- December 8, 1967.
With a firming of money market conditions such as described
above, commercial banks would find it more difficult to replace
maturing CD's with even shortest-term issues. Over-all, the attrition
of CD's in December may become larger and would be likely to continue
into January. There would also be further reductions in net inflows
of other time and savings deposits at banks--and also at nonbank
financial intermediaries. The reduced availability of domestic time
deposit funds to banks, given existing Regulation Q ceilings, would tend
to increase the aggressiveness with which U.S. banks compete for Euro-
dollar funds, thus amplifying rate pressures in that market.
If a move toward greater firmness in money markets is
achieved gradually, the December bank credit expansion might be only
a little lower than projections of expansion under present money
market conditions. In January, however, one would not expect much,
if any, rebound from the relatively low December bank credit expansion.
The expansionary effect on bank credit from bank participation in the
January Treasury financing would probably be offset by pressures on
banks to withdraw from securities markets as their ability to expand
liabilities is further curtailed.
