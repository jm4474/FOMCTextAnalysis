MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES
Recent Developments
(1) With market participants expecting no change in the stance of monetary policy,
the Committee's decision at the November meeting to leave the federal funds rate at 5-1/4
percent elicited no reaction in financial markets.1 Longer-term interest rates drifted down
over the next few weeks as incoming data generally confirmed the view that economic growth
would remain moderate and inflation subdued, and equity prices moved higher (chart).
Longer-term interest rates subsequently backed up. While the rise occurred against a back-
drop of firmer economic data, the reasons are not entirely clear. Over the past week or so,
fixed income, equity, and foreign exchange markets here and abroad have become more
volatile as investors have questioned the sustainability of current asset price levels, prompted
to a degree by Chairman Greenspan's recent comments on that issue. 2 On balance, long-term
yields have risen about 15 basis points over the intermeeting period, and broad stock price

indexes have gained 1 to 3 percent despite a sell off in recent days. Most short-term rates
have shown small mixed changes. However, the three-month bill rate dropped 20 basis
points, reflecting reduced supply and, more recently, heightened demands for safety and
liquidity, and yields on one-month private instruments rose 15 to 20 basis points as their
maturities crossed year-end, consistent with reports of premiums of 2 to 3 percentage points
on forward transactions in federal funds over the year-end. Making some allowance for term
premiums and year-end effects, futures quotes appear to imply that investors continue to
expect no change in the stance of monetary policy in the next few months.
(2) Long-term rates are now about 50 basis points below the peaks of this summer,
having retraced about half of the run-up over the first half of the year (chart). With measures
of long-term inflation expectations little changed, real bond yields appear to have followed a
pattern similar to that of nominal rates. Most short-term rates have fallen about 1/4 percent-
age point on balance over the year, in line with the policy easing in January. Broad equity
price indexes generally have risen 15 to 25 percent during 1996 on the heels of even larger
gains in 1995, leaving prices well above standard valuations based on moderate growth of
earnings going forward and historical discount factors. Some market participants, however,
apparently see relatively low earnings-price ratios as fully justified in a continued low-
inflation environment.
(3) The dollar's exchange value appreciated 2 percent on a weighted-average basis
over the intermeeting period. Against the DM, the dollar's appreciation was even greater,
nearly 3 percent. Part of the dollar's rise against European currencies was probably
attributable to an increase in market apprehension that the euro will not be as strong a
currency as the mark, a notion bolstered by market perceptions of improved odds that Italy
will be an early member of the EMU and by comments from various European officials who
appeared to be talking down their currencies against the dollar. Foreign long-term rates
ended the period little changed on balance after having been down as much as 25 basis
points, partly in response to further steps toward fiscal consolidation in Europe.

(4) Total borrowing by private nonfinancial sectors appears to have moderated from
the pace earlier in the year as the growth of consumer credit has slowed appreciably. Con-
sumer credit recorded only a small net increase in September and October and, based on bank
data, in November as well. The falloff in consumer credit growth probably reflects a more
cautious approach to borrowing, perhaps in response to elevated household debt burdens.
Supply conditions in this market also have tightened, with banks reporting some firming of
terms and standards for consumer loans over recent months. In the nonfinancial business
sector, debt growth, after bulging late in the third quarter, has moderated in recent weeks and
has shifted to some extent to the bond market. Market conditions remain attractive for
business finance, and banks continue to be willing lenders. Net federal borrowing has stayed
modest in the fourth quarter. From the fourth quarter of 1995 through November, domestic
nonfinancial sector debt expanded at a 5 percent rate, leaving that aggregate in the middle of
its 3 to 7 percent range for 1996. As a consequence, the ratio of nonfinancial debt to
nominal income was about flat for the sixth year in a row.
(5) Growth of the broad monetary aggregates was strong in November. M2
expanded at a 7-1/4 percent annual rate last month, and partial data for early December
suggest that rapid expansion has continued. However, the pickup follows several months of
sluggish increases, and the staff does not think it signals a substantial pickup in the under-
lying trend of moderate growth. The surge last month was due in part to demand deposits,
which showed surprising, and probably temporary, strength. Banks continued to implement
retail sweep accounts, although at a considerably slower rate than the record pace in October.3
Liquid deposits rebounded after contracting in October, and money market mutual funds again
advanced at a double-digit rate. M3 slowed in November but, at a 6-3/4 percent annual rate,
still grew comparatively rapidly.
(6) From the fourth quarter of 1995 through November, M2 expanded at a 4-1/4
percent annual rate, leaving this aggregate in the upper half of its 1 to 5 percent range.4 M2
growth was about a percentage point slower in 1996 than forecast by the staff in February,
even though nominal income growth and short-term opportunity costs came in close to
projections. The staff had anticipated that a flat yield curve would lead households to prefer
deposits to longer-term investments; in the event, the yield curve steepened and returns on
equity funds were unexpectedly robust, evidently attracting funds from deposits to capital
market mutual funds.5 Nonetheless, M2 growth came in only a little below that predicted
by the standard staff econometric model. M3 grew 6-1/4 percent during 1996 through
November, slightly above the upper end of its 2 to 6 percent range. As expected, expansion
of M3 outpaced that of bank credit adjusted for mark-to-market accounting effects. The
rapid growth owed partly to money market mutual funds shares, which expanded at about a
increased their reliance on deposit funding and paid down their borrowings from foreign
offices, perhaps partly in response to the earlier reduction in deposit insurance premiums.

Policy Alternatives
(7) The staff forecasts that the economy will expand over the next two years
at a rate in line with the growth of potential, assuming an unchanged federal funds
rate. Over the forecast period, the dollar remains steady, stock prices show little net
change, and long-term rates edge lower as fiscal policy becomes more restrictive. In
the staffs assessment, the economy is already operating at a level a little beyond its
potential, however, and would continue to do so in the forecast. The resulting price
pressures are evident in an upward drift in core inflation, especially once account is
taken of technical adjustments to the CPI.
(8) Nonetheless, the need for an immediate policy tightening could be
questioned. The estimated output gap and underlying inflation pressures in 1997 and
uncertain that there would be any deterioration in inflation, in light of the relatively
good behavior of prices recently in the face of both a drop in the unemployment rate
below most estimates of NAIRU and adverse supply side shocks in food and energy
prices. Moreover, levels of key financial variables going forward may seem especially
uncertain, given the exceptional volatility in bond, stock, and foreign exchange mar-
kets recently. Such skittish market conditions may make responses to policy actions
particularly hard to predict. In these circumstances, the Committee may wish to keep
policy unchanged (alternative B), awaiting more information to assess how markets
may evolve and how the other uncertainties may be resolved.
(9) With market participants almost universally expecting policy to be on hold
for a time, the Committee's selection of alternative B would prompt little response in
financial markets. Expectations about the economy built into credit markets appear to
be similar to those of the staff, and new information in agreement with that outlook
over the intermeeting period should be associated with both interest rates and the
exchange rate of the dollar averaging near recent levels. However, signs of significant
progress in the political process in resolving budget and entitlement controversies
probably would spark a rally in bond and stock markets.
(10) A 50 basis point firming of the funds rate (alternative C) might be
favored if the Committee wished to move promptly to stem the rise in underlying
inflation in the staff forecast and increase the odds on making some headway on its
longer-run objective of price stability. With persistent indications of tightness in labor
markets, some firming in wages, and disappointing news on reported productivity, the
Committee may see significant risks of a resurgence of inflation that could elevate
inflation expectations and ultimately prove costly to wring out of the economy. Such
concerns might be accentuated if the Committee saw the run-up in share prices as
likely to persist, boosting spending above that in the staff forecast, and as indicative
of an accommodative monetary policy that would eventually show through to the
prices of other assets and goods and services.
(11) The choice of alternative C would surprise market participants and perhaps
lead them to reconsider their view on the Federal Reserve's longer-term objectives.
Real interest rates would rise, but participants might see the Federal Reserve as more
determined to reduce inflation, with beneficial effects on inflation expectations. Given
the events of the last several days, however, the market could interpret the move also
as importantly motivated by efforts to cap or even drive share prices lower. The
resulting drop in equity values would be an important channel for reducing the
excessive aggregate demand that presumably would motivate policy tightening.
(12) A 50 basis point reduction in the federal funds rate (alternative A) would
seem to require a judgment that the upward pressure on prices is less than in the staff
forecast at current interest rate levels. For example, the staff might have underesti-
mated the extent to which forces such as job insecurity are pulling down the natural
rate of unemployment. If so, lower short rates might be consistent with the same
inflation outlook. Essentially, policy easing would reflect the implied drop in the
equilibrium natural real rate of interest and the narrower output gap and reduced price
pressures associated with higher potential. In addition, the extraordinary slowing in
consumer credit growth could be interpreted as indicating a developing problem in
credit markets that will have greater implications for consumer spending than the staff
has allowed, despite the recent uptrend in retail sales and favorable anecdotal reports
on Christmas spending.
(13) Because the market is not expecting a change in policy, a 50 basis point
funds rate reduction, as in alternative A, would show through completely to other
short-term rates. The market would probably interpret the action as signaling that the
Committee saw inflation risks as considerably less pressing than previously thought.
This view would have credence given the Federal Reserve's current reputation for
anticipating economic developments, and hence real and nominal interest rates likely
would decline along the maturity spectrum, the exchange rate would drop, and the
stock market would move higher, providing an impetus for spending over the inter-
mediate run. The decline in nominal yields on longer-term instruments might be
somewhat muted, or ultimately even reversed, were incoming data to turn out more
consistent with the staff outlook.
(14) Under alternative B and the staff forecast, both debt and money should
expand at moderate rates in coming months, in line with projected nominal GDP. For
the debt of nonfinancial sectors, the outlook implies a slight pickup in growth from the
pace of recent months to a 4-3/4 percent rate from November to March. The contri-
bution by governments at all levels should remain relatively modest, as state and local
governments retire debt out of the proceeds of advanced refundings and the federal
government continues to pare its budget. But somewhat stronger borrowing is
expected by nonfinancial firms facing a widening financing gap, and household sector
borrowing should bounce back somewhat, with debt growth more consistent with
moderate increases in spending and income.
(15) M2 growth should slow a little from its elevated pace of November and
early December, but remain above the rate of earlier in 1996. Offering rates on M2
deposits are likely to stay at about current levels, maintaining the opportunity cost of
holding this aggregate. M2 is projected to grow at a 5-1/2 percent annual rate from
November to March reflecting some near-term firming in nominal spending. Over
the same period, the growth of M3 is expected to expand at a 7-1/4 percent annual

OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH
In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks
to DECREASE (SLIGHTLY/SOMEWHAT)/maintain/INCREASE (SLIGHTLY/
SOMEWHAT) the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. In the context
of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic
growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary
developments, somewhat (SLIGHTLY) greater reserve restraint would (MIGHT) or
(SOMEWHAT) slightly lesser reserve restraint (WOULD) might be acceptable in the
intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent
with [DEL: moderate growth in M2 and] relatively strong expansion in M2 AND M3 over
coming months.
