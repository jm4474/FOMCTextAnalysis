MONEY MARKET AND RESERVE RELATIONSHIPS
Recent developments
There have been relatively wide interest rate fluctuations
in the Government securities market since the last meeting of the
Committee. After declining in the latter part of May, yields rose
again in the first half of June,and in the note and bond sector moved
into new high ground for the year to date; the rise in yields was most
pronounced in the long bill and intermediate-term coupon areas. Outside
the Treasury market, yields rose on a variety of short-term debt instru-
ments, including finance company paper, bankers acceptances, short-term
Federal agency securities, and negotiable CD's, including longer
maturities of the latter. Yields on new corporate bonds have drifted
further upwards, while municipal bond yields have remained relatively
Treasury bill rates turned up sharply in early June following
earlier persistent declines and the 3-month bill has recently been bid
around 3.60 per cent, up from a low of 3.37 per cent on June 5, while
the 1-year bill rate was up to 4.20 per cent. In part, the rise in
short-term rates may have reflected market preparations for the mid-June
tax and dividend period, but expectations of an imminent Treasury cash
financing in the short-term maturity area have given added impetus to
the yield increases most recently. In addition all sectors of the financial
market were affected by uncertainties associated with the Mid-East crisis.

By way of contrast, rates on day-to-day money, including Federal
funds and dealer loan rates, have not shown any trend recently. Federal
funds have continued to trade close to the discount rate, with the
effective rate averaging just below 4 per cent in recent weeks. Rates
on new loans to dealers posted by major New York City banks have
centered around 4-1/8 to 4-3/8 per cent and financing from outside New
York sources have continued to be available at close to the Federal
funds rate.
Free reserves rose to $324 million in the statement week ended
June 14, which included the dividend date and pre-tax date preparations.
In the three previous statement weeks, and indeed since the week ending
May 3, free reserves had held in the unusually narrow range of $266 to
$273 million. Member bank borrowings have continued to move lower,
averaging only $68 million in the last four statement weeks compared
with $105 million in the previous four weeks.
With a few of the major banks experiencing sizable net CD
inflows and increases in other time and savings deposits continuing
strong at all commercial banks, total time and savings deposits appear
to be growing at an annual rate of around 16 per cent in June, a some-
what faster rate of expansion than was projected in the previous blue
book. And with U.S. Government deposits at commercial banks declining
sharply on average in June, money supply is also expanding at an 11 - 12
per cent annual rate in June, a little faster than anticipated earlier.
Mainly because of the faster growth in time and savings deposits,

expansion in the bank credit proxy appears to have risen to a 7 - 8 per
cent annual rate in June, slightly above the 4 - 7 per cent range
previously projected, and well above the small May growth rate.
With bank credit generated mainly by time deposits (since changes
in U.S. Government and private demand deposits seem virtually offsetting),
only a small increase in the reserve base of banks is occurring. Total
and nonborrowed reserves are increasing at only about a 1 - 3 per cent
annual rate this month, continuing the relatively slow growth of the
previous month. But even with the low growth rate for aggregate reserves,
the large inflows of time deposits and the apparent moderation of loan
demand have led to continued relatively large bank investments in
securities at the high yields generally available. Such investments had
been a factor in keeping municipal yields generally stable over recent
weeks and had helped to cushion the market for U.S. Government securities;
most recently there have been signs that bank interest in such securities
may be waning.
Almost half of the reserves that were supplied by the System
had a direct effect in moderating pressures in intermediate- and long-
term credit markets. From May 23 through June 7, the Account Management
purchased $222 million of coupon issues (including $88 million maturing
in over 5 years) while acquiring, net, only $167 million of bills out-
right; about $60 million of reserves on average were also provided through
repurchase agreements. In the week of June 14, there was a need to absorb
reserves,partly because of a decline in the Treasury balance, and the
System was a net seller of $566 million of bills (about 75 per cent of which
were sales to foreign accounts).
CONFIDENTIAL FR)
For the 7 month December 1966 - June 1967 period, the bank
credit proxy is now estimated to rise at about a 12 per cent annual
rate (10.5 per cent after including the change in Euro-dollar borrow-
ings). Time deposits may rise by about 17 per cent and money supply
about 6-1/2 per cent. U.S. Government deposits are estimated to decline
at a 40 per cent annual rate from their already low average level in
November of last year.
Prospective developments
Prospective movements in interest rates, bank credit, and
money over the next four weeks will be strongly influenced by sizable
Treasury cash financing operations, as well as by continued heavy
corporate and state and local government borrowing in the capital
market.1/ The recent interest rate increases have reflected some
anticipation of such developments, but additional upward rate pressures
could well be generated as the large security market flotations take
place. The extent to which upward rate pressures actually develop,
however, will be importantly influenced by the attitudes of banks toward
further acquisitions of securities. This, in turn, will depend in
large measure on how rapidly their reserve base expands and on the
relative cost to banks of obtaining short-term funds.
June 16, 1967.
CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -5- June 16, 1967.
Loan demands from business and consumers are expected to
remain quite modest in summer, but comparative yield relationships may
continue to encourage banks to employ time deposit money to invest in
state and local government securities. The yield incentive to move
funds into the Government market is less, although liquidity consider-
ations are still a factor influencing banks toward short-dated Governments.
Thus, if banks are to acquire and hold a substantial share of the new
Treasury issues, they will need to be offered the option of paying for
such issues with credits to tax and loan accounts, and the subsequent
tendency for such newly created deposits to contract will need to be
countered by System action to avoid contraction in aggregate reserves.
There will be a need for additional reserves over the weeks immediately
ahead if banks are also to be encouraged to provide reasonably priced
financing to dealers during the Treasury financing.
Assuming a $4 billion Treasury cash financing (with full tax
and loan credit) and assuming the System provides reserves to accommodate
bank underwriting, it appears likely that nonborrowed reserves in July
will increase,at an annual rate, in a 11 - 14 per cent range. The
projected reserve growth would, of course, be lower if the financing
were not so large. The exact timing, the precise amount, and the types
of securities issues in such financing are uncertain because of the fluid
market conditions and because of the long delay in approval by Congress
of the proposed debt ceiling legislation. For projection purposes, we
have assumed the financing takes place shortly after mid-month.
CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -6- June 16, 1967.
The rate of growth in reserves noted above would support a July
bank credit expansion,on average, in a 10 - 12 per cent range (considerably
larger from the last week in June to the last week in July ), and appears
to be required to keep money market conditions within the range that
has prevailed over the past four weeks. These conditions can be
characterized to include a Federal funds rate averaging a little below
per cent, and member bank borrowings in a $50 - $100 million range.
Apart from a brief seasonal rise that usually occurs in the second week
of July, excess reserves may continue around the $350 million level
around which they have recently ranged.
It is possible, however, that excess reserves may rise above
such levels around the time of the Treasury financing if the System
finds it necessary to provide a rather substantial amount of reserves
in a short period in order to keep over-all money market conditions
comfortable, to hold down credit market pressures that could develop
in the wake of the financing, and to forestall any worsening market
In the bill market, between now and the end of June, some
additional demand for bills may develop, including mid-year statement
date buying by banks, re-investment demand from the large portion of the
June tax bills turned in for cash, and the return of the System to the
buying side of the market. Factors that would tend to keep rate declines
minimal over the very near-term include the current large size of dealer
bill positions and the recent evidence of banks' willingness to bid for
CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -7- June 16, 1967.
CD funds. And as we enter the new fiscal year, bill rates are likely
to be under upward pressure in light of the Treasury cash borrowing.
All in all, assuming the Treasury issues longer-term bills in its
cash financing, a rate range for the 3-month bill of 3.50 - 3.80 per
cent seems reasonable between now and the next meeting of the Committee.
We are projecting that banks will make efforts to recover
CD funds lost around the tax date, and that negotiable CD's outstanding
will rise about $500 million over the month of July. Continued sizable
inflows of other time and savings deposits are assumed, although a more
buoyant economy is likely to lead to some abatement in the flow of
consumer savings over time. For July on average, total time and savings
deposits are expected to rise by about 12 - 14 per cent, annual rate.
Little change in U.S. Government deposits is expected on
average between June and July, as the anticipated large cash borrowing
would just about offset the anticipated Treasury cash drain. But private
demand deposits and the money supply are expected to rise on average
in July, by perhaps a 10 - 15 per cent annual rate. The increase for
the monthly average is in large part a carry-over of the rise in deposits
in late June. The inflow of funds to the Government from the July
financing is not expected to absorb much private demand deposits in the
period immediately ahead, since the projections assume that reserves
will be supplied in sufficient amount so that banks will sell off the
Government securities they acquire only gradually.
CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -8- June 16, 1967.
The relatively large reserve, bank credit, and money supply
expansion--if it develops--is likely to moderate upward interest rate
pressures in intermediate- and long-term credit markets. Such assistance
to these markets would be enhanced by continued System purchases of
coupon issues. Over the three-week period ending July 12, current
projections indicate a reserve need of roughly $1.5 billion, although
market factors will partly reverse that need in the following week.
Thus, there is scope for sizable coupon purchases in the course of
regular reserve-supplying operations. The Treasury's July financing
program will impose some even-keel considerations on the conduct of
System operations. Inclusion of a coupon issues in the program--
apparently only a remote possibility at the moment--would limit the
ability of the System to buy coupon issues around the time of such
financing, particularly issues in the maturity range of the offering.
