MONEY MARKET AND RESERVE RELATIONSHIPS
Recent developments
The past four weeks were marked first by a sharp upward
movement of long-term bond yields and a tightening of short-term
markets, and then later in the period by a return to easier money
market conditions and some downward re-adjustment in long-term rates.
Expectational as well as supply-demand factors had an important
bearing on the rate movements. Concern about the viability of
prevailing interest rate levels developed early in the period as
many narket observers concluded that monetary policy had stopped
trending toward ease, as a large and continuing build-up in bond
issues came to market, and as security dealers made efforts to
lighten inventories. In consequence, the yield on new high grade
corporate issues rose from a little over 5 per cent at the time of
the last FOMC meeting to around 5.50 per cent, while outstanding
Toward the end of February, bearish bond market expectations
were moderated byTreasury trust account purchases of coupon issues for
debt limit purposes and by System open market operations, leading to
the development of a Federal funds rate fluctuating below 5 per cent,
with trading most frequently in a 4-1/2 - 4-3/4 per cent range. And

a more bullish market psychology materialized with the announcement
of a reduction in reserve requirements on savings deposits and on the
first $5 million of time deposits. Government bond yields appear to
have retraced about half their previous rise, but the response in the
corporate market has been more sluggish.
As open market operations attempted to moderate rising
interest rates in February, nonborrowed reserves rose by an 18.5 per
cent annual rate on average. Banks used part of these funds to
reduce borrowings from the Federal Reserve. Required reserves did
grow rapidly, however, and supported a 15 per cent rate of expansion
in total member bank deposits (the bank credit proxy), with most of
the rise occurring early in the month. Inclusion of repayments of
member bank borrowings from abroad would reduce the bank credit
proxy expansion to about 13-14 per cent on average last month.
Despite the rapid aggregate reserve expansion and even
with the net reserve position of banks averaging just about zero
during the four weeks ending March 1, the money market remained
relatively taut for much of the period. Member bank borrowings from
the Federal Reserve averaged $360 million. Federal funds traded at
an average rate of around 5-1/8 per cent until the last few days.
The vicissitudes of the Federal funds market were reflected in the
and then dropped to 4.54 per cent on February 28. Following the
reserve requirement reduction announcement, the rate fell to a new
CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -3- March 3, 1967.
The tautness of the Federal funds market over the first
three weeks of February partly reflected the development of somewhat
larger basic reserve deficiencies at major New York City banks than
is usual for this time of year. At the same time, funds supplied
to the Federal funds market turned out to be smaller than in recent
months. Banks were holding on to larger amounts of excess reserves
in the middle weeks of February, and the volume of Federal funds
transactions reported through the New York market declined from
the over $5 billion daily average of the past few months to $4.4
billion during the three weeks ending February 22.
The willingness of large banks to pay up for Federal funds
appears consistent with the reduced interest that these banks showed
in selling negotiable CD's last month, especially those maturing in
in outstanding CD's declined to around $600 million (measured from
the week ending February 1 to an estimate for the week ending
March 1). Gross CD sales declined to $4.8 billion in February from
$7.4 billion in January. It would appear that banks early in
February may have come to prefer to borrow at short-term, including
day to day in the Federal funds market, in the expectation at that
time that market interest rates were going to decline further or
simply because credit demands were not burgeoning. In any event,
this behavior tended to put upward pressure on the Federal funds
rate, which in turn, as it persisted, contributed to the fading of
declining rate expectations.
CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -4- March 3, 1967.
The growth rate of time deposits was 20 per cent on
average in February, but the rate of growth dropped considerably as
the month progressed and banks became less active in the CD market.
Private demand deposits and the money supply also rose in February
on average--at annual rates of 6.2 per cent and 6.4 per cent
respectively--and the increases were sharper from month-end to
month-end. Private deposit expansion reflected the active buying
by banks of U.S. Government and State and local government securities
during the month. U.S. Government deposits showed little net change
on average during the month.
Looking at bank deposits and bank credit from the perspective
of the past three months (December-February), the daily average series
for total member bank deposits has risen at an annual rate of 11.8
per cent (and 10.5 per cent after inclusion of borrowing from abroad).
At the same time, the end of month series for outstanding credit of
all commercial banks has risen by a 10.8 per cent annual rate (on
the basis of preliminary estimates).
Most of this expansion has been based on time deposits,
of course. In terms of relative shares, time and savings deposits
account for 75 per cent of total member bank deposit growth during
the 3-month period. Using a rough and ready seasonal adjustment,
negotiable CD's accounted for 35 per cent of such total deposit
growth. Private demand deposits account for about 10 per cent of
the growth, and U.S. Government deposits 15 per cent.
CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -5- March 3, 1967.
Prospective developments
The easier conditions in the money market that have recently
prevailed (excluding the unusually easy conditions related specifically
to the end of a double reserve settlement period) can be characterized
as including a Federal funds rate in the 4-1/2 - 5 per cent range, but
averaging a little below 4-3/4 per cent, and a 3-month Treasury bill
rate in a 4.30 - 4.50 per cent range. The difficulties in specifying
consistent money market relationships are compounded by the uncertain
effects of the reserve requirement reduction. The reserves released
will be widely distributed throughout the country, and, in particular,
will affect a great many smaller banks who may be sluggish in utilizing
the funds. Thus, over the next few weeks it is probable that a
fairly substantial level of net free reserves (possibly rising into
the $100-$200 million range) will at times be needed in order to
maintain the more comfortable over-all money market conditions that
have developed.
Factors that would tend to tighten the money market in the
weeks ahead include: (a) the auction of $2.7 billion of June tax
bills on March 7 (with only 50 per cent tax and loan credit); (b)
the CD maturities and loan demand associated with March dividend and
tax dates; (c) the reduction in the usual seasonal System bill
purchases in the open market in view of the reserve requirement
reduction and of the expected temporary decline in the Treasury's
balance at the Federal Reserve (and perhaps direct borrowing by the
CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -6- March 3, 1967.
Treasury) prior to mid-March; and (d) the possibility that part of
the expected $600-$900 million of publicly offered FNMA PC's may
be in the relatively short-term area. However, over the coming
period as a whole, bill demand from the public is likely to be
fairly strong, including re-investment of proceeds from large capital
market issues, and will provide an offset to such upward market pressures.
Money market pressures are most likely to develop in
connection with the March tax date. The corporate income tax
payments themselves in March, at an estimated $6.8 billion, are
slightly lower than last year, but they are funded to a relatively
lesser extent by maturing tax bills; however, the regular weekly bill
matures the day after the tax date and the proceeds may be used by
some corporations to finance tax payments. CD's maturing on the
tax date, at $760 million this year, are little changed from last
year. It might also be noted that corporations will not have to
remit withheld individual income taxes on the corporate tax date
this year, but will make these payments in two instalments on March 5
and March 20. Thus, one might not expect the tax date, taken alone,
to be associated with exceptional money market pressure, but normal
seasonal stresses may be augmented by other factors noted in the
previous paragraph, and in particular by the market's need to
absorb the new tax bills.
CONFIDENTIAL (FR)
With respect to long-term market rates, it
appears likely that they will not back up significantly over the period
ahead in view of the recent abatement of bearish expectations about the
course of bond prices. But the very large March corporate and State
and local government calendar, plus the longer-term portion of the
PC's, will probably tend to forestall any very significant rate
declines--unless investors and borrowers come strongly to expect
further market easing because of additional monetary policy actions
and/or mounting signs of economic weakness.
On the bank credit and deposit side, the easier money market
conditions that have developed appear consistent with a 6-8 per cent
increase in the bank credit proxy during March on average. This
reflects mainly a continuation of the slower pattern of time
deposit growth, especially of CD's. For the month on average time
deposits are expected to rise by 8-10 per cent. While banks have
the potential for increasing their outstanding CD's sharply, they
no longer appear so interested, given the rebuilding they have already
accomplished and the uncertain outlook for loan demands, especially
beyond the coming March and April tax dates.
The current bank credit projection, which we believe
consistent with developments in the real economy projected in the
green book, assumes that business loan growth at banks will be moderate
in March and that banks will not repeat the unusually rapid February
restocking of security portfolios. However, the June tax bill

which will be paid for on March 13, will have an expansive effect on
bank credit in the latter part of the month. Partly for that reason
the bank credit proxy is projected to expand at a 10-12 per cent
annual rate from the beginning to the end of the month, as compared
with about a 7.5 per cent annual rate from the beginning to the
end of February.
The money supply is expected to rise sharply in March at
a 9-11 per cent annual rate on average, mainly reflecting the sharp
increases of late February which carry over to affect the March
average. Payments for the tax bill (with 50 per cent coming
directly from the public) are likely to hold down growth later in
March. And from the end of February to the end of March, little net
change in money supply is projected. U.S. Government deposits are
expected to decline slightly on average in March, but will build up
after mid-month.
To encourage a continued downward trend in interest rates,
a further easing of money market conditions would appear to be
required. This could involve a Federal funds rate fluctuating around
the discount rate and a level of net free reserves perhaps as high
as $200-$300 million, depending on bank reactions to the reserve
requirement reduction. This would undoubtedly keep the bill rate
below the present discount rate, perhaps in a 4.15-4.40 per cent
range. Under such conditions, expectations could develop that would
CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -9- March 3, 1967.
contribute to downward yield movement throughout the market structure.
But it would still be unlikely that corporate rates would move the
entire way back to or through their late January early February
In a period such as that ahead, it is very difficult to
gauge the likely bank credit expansion consistent with easing market
rates. Reportedly, there is still substantial business financing
demand for such activities as restructuring financial positions,
financing take-overs, providing for spring tax payments and other
needs not directly linked to current GNP spending. Some of the
recent bulge in capital market financing has been for such purposes--
perhaps a substantial part--and some of these demands might move back
to banks if bank reserve pressures were eased further and bank rates
reduced. To accommodate these demands and also the financing of
expenditures directly generating industrial activity and employment
might result in substantial reserve provision and bank credit
expansion, associated with further interest rate declines. Under
these circumstances, bank credit expansion might be at an annual
rate of 10 per cent or more. On the other hand, if loan demands were
weak--either because widespread business inventory adjustments are
in process or because earlier backlogs of pending loans are worked
off--bank credit expansion might tend to fall short of these
expectations unless banks continued to expand security holdings
sharply further.
