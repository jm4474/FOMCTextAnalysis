through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain.

1  In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic 
format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Please note that the numbers and text in charts and

MONEY MARKET AND RESERVE RELATIONSHIPS
Recent developments
(1) The rise in credit market yields in process around mid-
August wasconsiderablymoderated, though not entirely averted, by the
discount rate reduction to 5-1/4 per cent initiated on August 15.
Credit markets were also calmed by the concurrent reduction in the
repurchase agreement rate and modest easing of day-to-day money market
rates. In the municipal bond market, however, yields continued to rise
rather sharply under pressure from heavy new issue volume. The 3-month
Treasury bill rate, which had backed up to 5.17 per cent at mid-August,
following its share decline early in the month, for the most part
stayed close to its mid-month level, but most recently has traded
above 5.20 per cent.
(2) Before the discount rate action, Federal funds traded
most frequently at an effective rate of 6-1/8 per cent; since then,
however, the cost of Federal funds has tended downward to a 5-7/8 per
cent level, although a fair amount of trading has taken place at both
the Federal funds market, dealer loan rates have also moved a little
lower, despite the persistence of large daily basic reserve deficits
on the order of $1 to $1-1/4 billion at the major New York banks.

Rates to dealers have most recently ranged around 6-1/2 per cent for
new loans, compared with rates more frequently around 6-5/8--6-7/8
per cent earlier in August.
(3) With a modest lowering of day-to-day money costs, and
with the rise of bill yields from their early August lows, the
disparities among short-term rates have lessened. None-
theless, dealer financing costs remain generally in excess of Treasury
bill yields. Moreover, dealer positions in bills and coupon issues
combined still total over $5 billion, down only slightly from mid-
August levels, and daily financing needs are running high.
(4) Partly because of the pressure of dealer financing needs,
but also partly because of expectations of lower interest rates in the
months ahead, major money market banks have remained relatively heavy
borrowers of short-term funds in the Federal funds and Euro-dollar
markets. While these banks have run deep basic reserve deficits, the
net borrowed reserve position of all member banks eased somewhat during
the past four statement weeks, averaging $205 million, as compared with
$260 million during the preceding four statement weeks. Member bank
borrowings averaged $505 million and $610 million during the two periods.
(5) With banks eager to expand investments--including
investments in municipals and in the new Treasury 5-5/8 per cent
proxy grew in August at an average annual rate of about 21 per cent
(and 1/2 percentage point more with Euro-dollar borrowings included).
This growth rate compares with a 16-18 per cent range projected for
the month at the time of the last (telephone) Committee meeting. Time
and savings deposits expanded at a 21 per cent annual rate, and the
money supply by about 5 per cent.
(6) The average annual rates of growth of key monetary
variables for the past two months following the increase in fiscal
restraint and the relaxation of pressure on the banking system are
shown in the table below, in comparison with other recent periods. The
recent rapid rates of increase in reserve and most other monetary
aggregates reflect the combined impact of Treasury credit demands, banks'
initial response of quickly rebuilding outstanding negotiable CD's,
and the desires of banks and other investors to build up investment
portfolios in the expectation that interest rates would decline later.

Prospective developments
(7) Assuming no change from around levels prevailing since
the discount rate cut in the cost of one day money, the 3-month Treasury
bill rate may fluctuate in a 5.05--5.35 per cent range between now
and the next meeting of the Committee. Bill rates may rise into
about the third week in September, and then decline, for reasons
explained in paragraphs (9) and (10) below. These wide swings in
bill rates,should they develop, may also be accompanied by fairly
broad movements in other money market rates and conditions.
(8) Prevailing levels of 1-day money rates center around
dealer new loan rates. These rates may be consistent with member bank
borrowings in a $400-$600 million range. Excess reserves of banks in
this period may vary from their usual pattern as banks begin to adapt
themselves to the new lagged reserve requirements, weekly country bank
settlements, and permission to carry over reserve excesses into the
next statement week--which become effective in the week beginning
September 12. Over the long-run, one might expect excess reserves to
be reduced further as a result of these innovations, but in the transition
period excess reserves could rise as banks cautiously appraise the
effects of the new provisions. As a result, there is condiderable
uncertainty about the level of net borrowed reserves that is likely
to be consistent with other money market conditions.
(9) The greatest upward pressures on the bill rate are
likely to develop in the period around the mid-September tax date.
While corporate tax payments are expected to be much larger than a
year ago, the Treasury is expected to have to keep its balance at the
Federal Reserve at very low levels before these payments are received
(with some direct Treasury borrowing from the Fed quite possible).
This lower balance, and possible foreign transactions, will add to the
need for System absorption of reserves in the two statement weeks
ending September 18; in this period the System may have to sell more
than $1 billion of securities.
(10) The bill market may be especially sensitive to large
System bill sales, as well as any further sales by foreign accounts
that may develop, because the level of bill inventories in dealer
hands remains relatively large, particularly longer-term bills. In
addition, financing costs remain above current bill yields. Under
these conditions, it may turn out that banks' reserve position would
have to be eased temporarily to keep the expected rise in the bill rate
from cumulating and, through expectational changes, spreading to other
financial markets. However, as the Treasury balance is restored
after the mid-month tax date and the System returns to the buy side of
the market in the latter part of September, upward yield pressures
in the bill market may be relaxed, even with day-to-day money rates
and marginal reserve measures returning closer to currently prevailing
(11) The absence of aggressive bank issuance of CD's in
the past week or two has been one factor tending to moderate upward
bill rate pressures. Banks are not expected to add substantially
further to the already advanced level of outstanding CD's, although
they might be spurred to do so if September loan demand proves larger
than many banks now expect. The Euro-dollar market may continue to be
a relatively attractive alternative source of funds for banks, partic-
ularly if the recent speculative flow of funds into Germany is reversed.
(12) Even with only modest growth in negotiable CD's after
allowing for the usual seasonal decline in September, total time and
savings deposits are expected to rise in a 15-18 per cent, annual rate,
range in September on average. This rate of growth in part reflects
the carry-over effect on the September average of a fairly rapid
expansion in time deposits other than large CD's in the second half of
August, perhaps partly bolstered by re-investment of cash from redemption
of maturing issues in the August refunding. Growth in such time and
savings deposits during the course of September, and also October, is
expected to be closer to the more moderate July-early August pace.
(13) Private demand deposits may show little change on
average during the next two months, but continued growth in currency
is likely to produce a small increase in the money supply. U.S.
Government deposits may show relatively little change on average over
the two months. We have assumed a $3 billion Treasury tax bill financing
in the latter part of October.
(14) Given the money and short-term credit market conditions
discussed in paragraphs (7) through (10), the bank credit proxy in
September is expected to rise in a 7-10 per cent, annual rate, range
(and perhaps about 1/2 percentage point more if the figures are
adjusted to include liabilities to foreign branches and if these
liabilities remain at their end of August level). In October, the
bank credit growth rate is not expected to be very different, though
perhaps on the high side of the range; obviously, the timing, amount,
and character of the Treasury's projected cash financing will influence
that month's bank credit growth.
(15) As compared with the July-August average, the expecta-
tion of more moderate bank credit growth over the next two months is
based on the reduced Treasury cash need, some repayment of the current
very high level of security loans, and a lessening of business loan
demand particularly after the September tax date. At the same time,
banksare projected to be large buyers of state and local government
securities, given the continued heavy volume of offerings and the
recent back-up in yields. The projected moderation in the pace of
bank credit growth is not itself expected to contribute to significantly
higher long-term interest rates, in part because the reduced growth
reflects a reduction in credit demands.
