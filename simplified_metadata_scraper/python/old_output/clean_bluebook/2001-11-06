MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES
Recent D evelopments
(1) Interest rates fell markedly over the intermeeting period.1, 2  Although the
Committee’s decision to reduce the target level of the federal funds ra te 50 basis
points at the October meeting was largely foreseen by market participants, short- and
intermediate-term market interest rates declined somewhat that afternoon, as
investors apparently interpreted the announcement as raising the likelihood of
additional policy easings.  Economic data subsequently released had a weaker-than-
expected cast and helped to bring the net declines in short-term interest rates to 30 to
40 basis points.  Judging by futures market pr ices, investors are confident of at least a
25 basis point cu t in the funds rate  target at the November meeting and pu t roughly
even odds on a 50 basis po int move.  These quotes also suggest that the funds rate is
expected to drop to 1-3/4 percent by early next year (chart).  Markets have priced in
about 1 percentage point of monetary policy tightening over the subsequent twelve
months, likely in  the expectation that the economy will be rebounding rather quickly

points over the intermeeting period, partly reflecting the weaker tone to the

Market Functioning
Brokers and  dealers in money and capital markets generally have returned to
more normal operations since September 11, though some are still at contingency
sites, and the hardest-hit firms have not regained their market shares.  Bottlenecks
in clearance and settlement systems have mostly been resolved, and fails to deliver
government securities are gradually diminishing from the elevated levels of recent
weeks, owing  in part to the reopening of the  on-the-run ten-year Treasury issue in
early October.  The limits on the Desk’s securities lending program that had been
relaxed after September 11 to  enhance the availability of securities in short supply
were reinstituted on October 18.  In the financing market, however, repo rates on
on-the-run five-year and ten-year notes remain well below the rate on general
collateral.  Market liquidity also has been largely restored, though bid-asked spreads
in some markets still tend to widen temporarily on large trades, perhaps reflecting
heightened economic uncertainty more than the effects of any lingering problems
with market infrastructure.
economic outlook and the associated marking down of policy expectations.  In
addition, the market had to digest considerable news on the volume and composition
of Treasury issuance going forward.  As to  the volume of issuance, market participants
apparently now expect a fiscal package implying a larger deterioration in the budget
balance than previously anticipated.  As to the composition of issuance, just yesterday,
the Treasury announced  the suspension  of future sales of thirty -year securities (both
nominal and indexed  to inflation) and hinted that it would scale back its buy-back
program.3  Yields on private securities also moved sharply lower over the intermeeting
period, particularly in the past two days (although it has been d ifficult to get firm
readings of late given volatile market conditions).  Despite the sense of a weaker near-
term outlook, investors seemed to become somewhat more confident about longer-
term economic prospects and more willing to take on risk:  Yield spreads on
speculative-grade bonds fell substantially over the period, albeit to levels well above
those in early September.  Moreover, even without much in the way of encouraging
news regard ing third-quarter and prospective earnings, the W ilshire index rose about 5
percent over the intermeeting period and the Nasdaq rebounded 18  percent.
(3) The dollar’s exchange value has risen modestly against other major
currencies on balance since the October meeting.  With data for foreign industrial
economies also coming  in on the weak side of expectations, market interest rates
abroad declined about as much as in the United States.  Policy interest rates were
lowered 75 basis points in Canada and 25 basis points in  the United K ingdom.  While
the ECB did not adjust its policy stance during the intermeeting period, near-dated
euribor futures appear to embed  expectations of some easing by year-end and  further
moves in early 2002.  Major equity indexes rose 4 to 8 percent over the intermeeting
period in Germany, the United Kingdom, and Japan, more than reversing declines
recorded in September.  Over the intermeeting period,
U.S. monetary
authorities did not intervene.
(4) The dollar’s average exchange value against the currencies of our other
important trading partners changed little on net over the intermeeting period.  The
Mexican peso strengthened 2-1/2 percent against the dollar, more than rolling back its
declines in the aftermath of the September 11 terrorist attacks.  The recent
announcement that the Argentine government would seek to restructure its debt
further intensified fears of a default, widening Argentina’s EMBI+ spread  by 600 basis
points, on balance, over the intermeeting period.  Reflecting some spillover from
Argentina, the Brazilian real depreciated against the dollar, but only modestly as the
authorities offset som e of that pressure  by sales of dollar-indexed debt.  In  general,
risk spreads for most other emerging market economies increased only slightly, on
net, and share prices showed mixed changes .
(5) Despite the slowing of the economy and the disruptions in financial
markets associated with the September 11 attacks, the debt of households and
businesses has apparently continued to expand at a moderate rate.  The bond market
absorbed a substantial amount of issuance  by investment-grade firms in both
September and October.  Better-rated speculative-grade firms were able to tap the
market in October after a near shutdown of junk issuance in September.  Net issuance
of commercial paper also resumed in October, after a fall-off the prior month, in part
to repay backup lines at banks that had been  drawn upon in September.  Banks report
a further tightening of terms and standards on business loans, but the extent of the
tightening did  not exceed that reported earlier  in the year, and no widespread cut-off
of credit supply seems in train.  Household mortgage borrowing has maintained a
fairly brisk pace, aided by a further reduction in mortgage interest rates that has
triggered another wave of mortgage refinancings.  Consumer credit, in contrast, likely
continued to expand sluggishly through September, restrained in part by the
redirection of some cash extracted from mortgage refinancing to debt consolidation.
In part boosted by a sizable expansion of federal debt to finance the last round of tax
rebate checks, the to tal debt of the nonfinancial sectors grew at a 7 percent pace in
September .
(6) After a surge in September that owed importantly to the temporary
buildup of deposits when securities trades failed to settle, the level of M2 declined
slightly in October.  Nevertheless, this monetary aggregate grew at an average rate of
12 percent over the past two months, reflecting the sharp drop in market interest rates
and perhaps a fillip from the deposit of some tax rebates.  The velocity of M2 declined
at a 7-1/4 percen t rate through the first three quar ters of the year, in response mainly
to the substantial reduction in opportunity costs associated with policy easings and
perhaps as well to some effects on money demand of mortgage refinancings, tax
rebates, and the d isenchantment of household investors w ith the stock market.

Policy Alternatives
(7) The staff has read incoming economic information as suggesting a more
pronounced near-term contraction than projected in  the last Greenbook, owing to
weaker capital spending and more aggressive inventory liquidation.  The Greenbook
forecast now assumes that the federal funds rate will be cut an additional
1/4 percentage point, to 2-1/4 percent, by year-end, and will remain at this level
through 2002 before rising modestly.  Yields on long-term Treasury securities and
mortgages are expected to change little from their current levels, but those on
investment-grade corporate bonds are projected to decline somewhat as risk
premiums unwind further.  The dollar is assumed to hold near current levels on
foreign exchange markets.  After some near-term softening related to disappointing
corporate earn ings, equity prices should trend up gradually, albe it on an appreciably
higher track than expected in the September Greenbook.  The impetus from fiscal
policy is now expected to provide a b igger boost to activity in 2002 and 2003.  Against
this policy and financial backdrop, the staff expects real GDP to turn  up noticeab ly in
the spring.  Although output growth begins to outpace that of its potential in the
second half of next year, the typical lag in  the response of the unemployment rate
explains why it continues to edge higher until mid 2002 and only slips off later in the
forecast period.  With the emergence of some labor market slack, core PCE inflation
edges lower to 1-1/4 percent in 2003.
(8) The Com mittee might choose to leave the federal funds rate unchanged
if it were of the view that action at this meeting would be unlikely to affect the
contours of the near-term economic downturn and that past monetary policy easing,
probable new fiscal measures, and the natural resiliency of private  demand should
provide enough stimulus to underpin a solid economic recovery before long.  In
effect, the Committee would implicitly be making the judgment that the gap between
the current real funds rate and its likely equilibrium value provides a sufficient amount
of impetus to economic activity over time (see chart and table).  Indeed, the
Committee may be especially reluctant to ease policy if it thinks the equilibrium real
funds rate is likely to r ise in the future–as risk and equ ity premiums narrow, as is
seemingly consistent with recent stock price gains, but also as the thrust of fiscal
policy intensifies.  With the budget package still working its way through the legislative
process, considerable uncertainty surrounds the magnitude of the coming fiscal
stimulus.  Because this uncertainty should be resolved relatively promptly, the
Committee may prefer to  keep policy unchanged at th is meeting so as to be able to
calibrate better its policy action to the size and composition of what becomes law.  If
the Committee saw easing as a close call, with the federal funds rate as low as 2-1/2
percent, it might be argued that action should be deferred at this meeting so that the
Committee would have more scope to respond to potential adverse shocks down the
road.  As described in the box on the zero bound to nominal interest rates on page 9,
this tactic of “saving your ammunition” would follow from the judgment that policy
action in a narrow window following an adverse shock would be more effective in
bolstering activity over time than lowering rates more aggressively now so that any
future shock falls on a stronger economy.
(9) Committee inaction at this meeting, even if combined with a statement
reaffirming the assessment of predominant downside risks, would surprise market
participants.  Considerable doubts would be created about whether the federal funds
rate would go as low as 1-3/4 percent by the early months of next year as market
participants currently expect.  In consequence, other short-term in terest rates would
move noticeably higher.  The likely upward movement of bond yields would be
tempered by an immediate selloff of equities.  To the extent that the outlook for
spending and income tu rned gloomier, the exchange value of the dollar might fail to
appreciate despite the tighter-than-anticipated policy stance.

The Zero Bound  to the Nom inal Interest Rate
With the overnight interest rate at 2-1/2 percent, the zero bound to the nominal
interest rate may loom larger now in the Committee’s deliberations than at any time in the
past four decades.  The experience of Japan, in which the po licy rate has flirted with zero
for five years and economic performance has been dismal, serves as a cautionary note for
monetary policy makers.  Of course, the short-term rate in the United States is still some
distance away from zero, and intermediate- and longer-term rates here remain far above
levels seen in Japan.  Even if Committee members were to consider the zero bound as
potentia lly relevan t, observers have  put forward two quite different approaches to
avoiding a situation in which the economy is weak and further reductions in the nominal
policy rate are not possible.
Staff analysis of the zero bound tends to support the latter view:  Avoiding the
zero bound counsels m ore aggressive action in advance of zero in  response to adverse
shocks  than is the  norm.  Moreover, timely policy  actions taken sooner wou ld work  to
put the economy on a stronger footing when adverse shocks subsequently hit.  But that
determination would be less persuasive if the Committee’s view, as opposed to the
mechanisms embodied in most econometric models, was that its action could have a
greater effect on confidence, and hence  the econom y, if taken on the  heels of an adverse
shock or that monetary policy operations could still adequately stimulate the economy
even if the nominal short-term  interest rate were ze ro.
(10) The Committee may consider the staff forecast to be both probable and,
under the circumstances, a satisfac tory outcome, and it may judge that an immediate
cut in the federal funds rate of 25 basis points is justified.  With investors skittish and
risks predominately skewed to  the downside, the Committee may be reluctant to
adopt a policy stance that is appreciably tighter than financial markets expect, which
could further  adversely affect household and business sentiment.  The small
disappointment of market expectations implied by the adoption of this alternative
might actually be viewed favorably by the Committee if it wished to slow the current
pace of easing from its recent trajectory to help forestall financial markets from
building in the expectation of considerably more easing than appropriate to achieve
the Committee’s objectives.  In effect, a modest disappointment now may pose less of
a strain  on markets  than a  more  sizable one later on .
(11) The Committee may judge that a 50 basis point policy move is
warranted on the grounds that the path of output is likely to fall short of that in the
staff forecast–either because the contraction will be greater or the subsequent pickup
less robust.  The C ommittee  might anticipate the near-term outcomes for spending to
be weaker than in the staff outlook if, for example, it suspected that the ongoing
contraction of foreign economic activity and the stresses in financial markets of
developing countries may portend greater-than-anticipated adverse feedbacks on U.S.
production.  The Committee may also have doubts that household and business
spending w ill respond as vigorously to likely fiscal in itiatives as embedded in the staff
forecast.  Even if the Committee viewed a 50 basis point move as a bit larger than
necessary given its current assessment of the economic situation, the more substantial
move might be favored if some weight were placed on the possibility of shocks that
would be sufficiently adverse to make the zero bound to nominal interest rates a real
constraint on the effectiveness of monetary policy at some point in the future .
(12) As already noted, market participants are about evenly split between
expecting 1/4 percentage point and 1/2 percentage point of easing at th is meeting.
Thus , some portion of them would be disappointed by the cho ice of ei ther action.
Working to temper any reaction, though, would be the sense that it is more likely that
the timing of the easing they are expecting–in the neighborhood of 3/4 percentage
points over the next half year–had changed, not the cumulative amount.  Market
participants universally expect that the balance of risks will remain tilted toward
economic weakness, so not much would be read in its retention.  A 25 basis point
easing would prompt some backup in short- and intermediate-term rates and a decline
in equity prices.  A half point ease, in contrast, would pull short-term rates lower and,
unless countered by a clear sense in the statement that the Committee had viewed its
action as likely bringing this easing phase to a close, would lead market participants  to
mark down the entire expected path of policy rates.  The implied support to spending
would likely bolster equity markets and offset to a considerab le extent any downward
pressure on the exchange value of the do llar directly emanating from lower interest
(13) Given the funds rate assumption in the staff forecast, M2 growth over
the October-to-March interval is expected to fall appreciably, to about a 7-1/2 percent
annual rate.  The effects on opportunity costs of the previous easings, as well as that
of the further 25 basis point cut in the s taff pro jection , should abate over  time.
Together with the Greenbook’s forecast for nominal GDP, the implied rate of decline
in M2 velocity lessens from about 10-1/2 percent in the current quarter to
5-1/2 percent in the first quarter.
(14) Over the six months from September to March, the staff projects that
growth of the total debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors will slip to a 4-1/2 percent
rate, reflecting a slowing in the expansion of household debt.  Consumer  credit
borrowing is expected to  be especially  light, owing to depressed spending on durab les.
Even the growth of home mortgage debt, which has been exceptionally robust in
keeping with the decline in mortgage rates, is seen as tailing off a little as refinancings
diminish and housing activity slows.  Business borrowing is likely to stay around its
third-quarter pace, concentrated in the corporate bond market.  Neither banks, which
have been tightening terms and standards on C&I loans, nor the commercial paper
market, which also has become more selective, are anticipated to be major sources of
funds.  Federal debt should be rising at only a 1/2 percent annual rate, as the budget is
foreseen to be in a modest deficit position on average over this six months.
