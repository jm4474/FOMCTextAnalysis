The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain.

format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Please note that the numbers and text in charts and

Recent developments
(1) M-1 growth was at a 4.9 per cent annual rate in June and,
reflecting the expected effect of the early disbursement of social security
checks, appears to have accelerated in July. For the June-July period, M-1
growth is now projected at about a 6.2 per cent annual rate, just below the
upper end of the Committee's desired range. M-2 appears to be increasing
at about a 9¼ per cent annual rate over June and July, somewhat above the
midpoint of the Committee's range. Growth in the time and savings deposit
component of M-2 in recent weeks has accelerated from its April-May pace,
as sharp increases in large denomination non-negotiable CD's have more
than offset weakness in savings accounts. Nonborrowed reserves increased
at a 3.3 per cent annual rate in June but are expected to grow much more
rapidly in July, primarily in lagged response to the pickup in deposit
growth in late June and early July.

(2) Throughout the period since the last Committee meeting, growth
of both M-1 and M-2 remained within the Committee's desired ranges, and the Account
Management accordingly sought to maintain the funds rate at about 5-3/8 per
cent. With the funds rate remaining slightly above the discount rate, member
bank borrowings from the discount window averaged $257 million, little dif-
ferent from the preceding four weeks, but above the average level of $80
million during the first four months of the year.
(3) Demands on credit markets strengthened in June. Both financial
and nonfinancial corporations substantially increased their issuance of com-
mercial paper over the month. Nonfinancial corporations also stepped up their
short-term borrowing at commercial banks, and the volume of publicly offered
bonds of domestic financial corporations, public utilities, and foreign issuers
expanded significantly. At the same time, State and local governments marketed
a record volume of long-term securities. The Treasury auctioned $1.5 billion
of 15-year bonds near the end of the month but paid down a roughly equal
amount of short-term bills over the month.
(4) Despite the strengthening in short-term credit demands, rates
on private short-term debt instruments have shown essentially no change since
the June FOMC meeting. Treasury bill rates, however, have moved up about 10
to 20 basis points as the market has begun to adjust to the ending of the
period of large cash redemptions of Treasury bills. In addition, this up-
ward rate adjustment may reflect a slight shift in the market's interest
rate outlook in response to recent strengthening in published monetary
aggregates data.
(5) Since the June FOMC meeting yields on corporate and
municipal securities and also on intermediate-term Treasury coupon issues,
have advanced 5 to 15 basis points. Dealers in Treasury securities have
made substantial net sales of coupon issues in recent weeks. As a result,
they now have large net short positions in issues in the one- to ten-year
maturity category and only a modest long position in issues with maturities
over 10 years--the latter reflecting mainly the remainder of dealer awards
in the recent 15-year bond auction.
(6) Inflows into deposit accounts at nonbank thrift institutions
in June were maintained at about the moderate pace of other recent months,
but there appears to have been a pick-up in growth at savings and loan
associations in early July. With demands for mortgages remaining strong,
primary mortgage rates edged higher on balance in recent weeks.

annual rates of change) related monetary and financial flows over various
time periods.

Prospective developments
(8) Shown below for the Committee's consideration are four
alternative sets of longer-run ranges for the monetary aggregates--
alternatives A through D--that pertain to the one year period, QII '77-
QII '78. In the last column are shown the ranges adopted at the April
Committee meeting for the QI '77-QI '78 period. The growth rates for bank
credit shown under A through D relate to total loans and investments of all
1/commercial banks.rather than to the bank credit proxy.-
Alt. A Alt. B Alt. C Alt. D Current
M1 4½-7 4½-6½ 4-6½ 3½-6 4½-6½
M2  7-10 7-9½ 6½-9½ 6-9 7-9½
M3  8-11 8-10½ 7½-10½ 7-10 8½-11
Bank credit 7½-10½ 7½-10½ 7-10 6½-9½ 7-10
(9) Under alternative B, the one year growth ranges for M-1
and M-2 are the same as those adopted by the Committee in April. The growth
range for M-3, however, is lower by ½ percentage point. This lower M-3
range now appears more consistent with the ranges shown for M-1 and M-2,
given the staff's current projection of deposit flows at thrift institu-
tions over the next four quarters. Alternative A encompasses a little more
1/ Growth in the bank credit proxy--the sum of all deposits and certain
borrowings of member banks--has been consistently below the targets
adopted by the Committee, and has in the past year diverged increasingly
from bank credit, as may be seen from the table on p. 4. With the
relatively rapid growth of nonmember deposits and the greater use by banks
of reserve-free borrowings as a source of funds the bank credit proxy
(i.e. essentially total member bank deposits) has become a much more
imperfect statistical series. Bank credit, as measured by the end-of-
month series for loans and investments or by a new average series for the
month developed by the Board staff, has been closer to the Committee's
longer-run ranges for bank credit. The Committee might therefore wish to
consider substituting an all commercial bank credit measure for the proxy.
The issues are discussed in more detail in Appendix III.
rapid growth in all of the monetary aggregates than B, and alternative C
a little slower growth. The differences among these alternatives are in
line with the size of changes in longer-run ranges that the Committee has
actually made in its quarterly reviews of the one-year ranges. The specifi-
cations of alternative D, however, involve a larger adjustment in the
ranges, with the midpoint of the growth range for M-1 reduced to 4¾ per
cent over the QII '77-QII '78 period. This alternative would compensate
for the second quarter overshoot in growth of M-1; that is, it would result
in expansion of M-1 over the five quarters, QI '77-QII '78, at a 5½ per
cent annual rate--the midpoint of the M-1 range adopted by the Committee
in April for the QI '77-QI '78 period.1/ M-2 growth over the five quarter
period under this alternative would be at about an 8 per cent annual rate,
however, a shade below the midpoint of the current M-2 range.

the Federal funds rate that are thought to be consistent with the various
long-run ranges are presented below. (Detailed data are shown in the

(11) Under alternative B, the proposed Federal funds rate range
is the same as that adopted by the Committee at its previous meeting. If
the funds rate remains near the recently prevailing 5-3/8 per cent level,
the staff would expect M-1 growth for the July-August period to be at about
a 6 per cent annual rate. With the public's adjustment to the April bulge
in M-1 now completed, the transactions demand for money is expected to rise
more in line with the continued growth in nominal GNP. Growth in M-2 is
expected to be in a 7-11 per cent annual rate range during the July-August
period, as the time and savings deposit component of that aggregate continues
to expand at near its recent pace.
(12) Credit demands may remain substantial over the weeks ahead,
although State and local government and business demands may slacken from
their exceptional June pace. While the Treasury is expected to raise about
$3-1/2--4 billionof new money before the next meeting, mainly in conjunction
with its mid-August refunding of $3.3 billion of maturing publicly held coupon
issues, the Treasury securities market appears to be in a technically strong
position. Thus, there is likely to be little upward interest rate pressure
generated by market demand forces over the next few weeks. However, in the
late summer and early fall, with Treasury borrowing expanding considerably
further and demands for money and liquidity pressing against the available
supply, upward pressures on interest rates are likely to develop.
(13) Further increases in interest rates are likely to develop
late this year and in the first half of next year if the midpoints of the
longer-run growth ranges contemplated under alternative B are to be
achieved. The funds rate might need to rise to about 6 per cent by year-
end and to about 6¼ per cent by the second quarter of 1978. This would
be an appreciably smaller rise in interest rates than the staff thought
likely last month. It allows for the higher average level of the money stock
over the next year that results from applying an unchanged growth rate to a
new base period in which there has been a substantial overshoot. (The
Federal funds rate projections four quarters ahead are shown in Appendix II).
(14) As noted earlier, both alternatives C and D contemplate
lower longer-run growth ranges for the monetary aggregates than alternative
B. While the reduction is substantially larger in the case of alternative D,
in either case the Committee may wish to consider a rise in the funds rate
between now and the next meeting to around 5-7/8 per cent, the midpoint of
a 5½-6¼ per cent range. Such a funds rate increase is likely to be
accompanied by an increase in short-term rates of interest generally of
about ½ percentage point. Member bank borrowings from the discount window
may rise $50-100 million further, and markets may come to anticipate a rise
in the discount rate from its current 5¼ per cent level.
(15) With the funds rate rising over the next few weeks as
specified above, we would expect M-1 in the July-August period to expand
in a 3½-7½ per cent annual rate range and M-2 in a 6½-10½ per cent range.
Net inflows of shorter-term small denomination time deposits
to banks and thrift institutions may slow at the higher interest
levels, and there may also be a further outflow of interest-sensitive
savings deposits of individuals, businesses, and State and local governments.
Banks may be expected to adapt to such developments by more aggressively
offering large denomination time deposits; except for negotiable deposits
offered by large banks, these deposits are included in M-2. Even under the
short-run specifications of alternative C, there would appear to be sufficient
leeway between ceiling rates in time certificates maturing in four years
or more and yields on market instruments to enable banks to retain the
funds involved in maturing "wild card" certificates. They could, however,
lose some funds to thrift institutions, which can offer somewhat higher
(16) The rise in market rates of interest over the next few weeks
accompanying short-run alternative C (or D) would probably carry the 3-month
Treasury bill rate above the 5¼ per cent ceiling rate on thrift institution
savings deposits. This may trigger an increased diversion of these deposits
to market instruments. Under alternative C we would expect that thrifts
would become less willing to commit funds to the mortgage market at near
the recent pace. In addition, given the substantial mortgage takedowns
in train, these institutions would have to draw down their liquid assets
and borrow more heavily from the FHL Banks; the need for secondary mortgage
market support by FNMA would also increase. But the rise in mortgage rates
may be limited if insurance companies, for example, become more active
in the mortgage market as a result of the continuing favorable spread of
mortgage rates over corporate bond yields. In any event, upward pressures
on corporate and tax exempt bond yields are likely to be relatively modest,
given the substantial supply of investible funds at insurance companies and
other institutional investors.
(17) If the Committee wishes to achieve the midpoints of the
longer-run growth ranges for alternative C--indexed by an M-1 range of
4-6 per cent--the staff expects that the funds rate would need to rise
only a little further and would top out at around 6¼ per cent in the first
quarter of 1978. The greater restraint on growth of the monetary aggregates
over the longer-run under alternative D would require a larger rise of interest
rates to levels closer to those projected at the previous FOMC meeting.
The funds rate may rise to around 6½ per cent in the first quarter of next
year and probably further to a level of 6¾ per cent by the second quarter.
(18) Alternative A contemplates an easing of money market
conditions between now and the next Committee meeting. Interest rates
may tend to decline rather substantially as the funds rate begins to drop,
particularly in the intermediate-term Treasury area where dealers have a
net short position. But assuming that incoming economic news does not
cast doubt on the fundamental strength of the economy, interest rate declines
may be limited over the next month or so as corporations and State and local
governments increase market borrowing in anticipation of higher interest
rates later on and as the market focuses on the Treasury's large fall cash
(19) We would expect the funds rate to begin rising in the fall
under alternative A if growth in the aggregates is to remain around the
midpoints of the longer-run ranges for this alternative. Given the degree
of near-term ease assumed, the funds rate by spring may have to be at or
slightly above the level assumed at that time under alternative B in order
to constrain monetary growth in the first half of next year to the indicated
rate. Meanwhile, however, for most of the one-year period ahead, short-
term rates would have been lower than under alternative B, with consequent
relatively easier credit and liquidity conditions at banks and other
Directive language
(20) Given below are alternatives for the operational paragraphs
of the directive. The first formulation places main emphasis on near-term
rates of growth in monetary aggregates. The second formulation, like the
directive adopted at the last meeting, places main emphasis on money market
conditions; it shows--in strike-through form--the specifications adopted at
the last meeting. As suggested below, the particular language needed in
the opening lines of the money market formulation would depend on the specific
conditions sought; the three alternatives shown--calling, respectively, for
somewhat easier, prevailing, and somewhat firmer money market conditions--
are intended to be associated with the specifications discussed in the pre-
ceding section under alternatives A, B, and C.
"Monetary Aggregates" Formulation
The Committee seeks to encourage near-term rates of growth
in M-1 and M-2 on a path believed to be reasonably consistent with
the longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates cited in the preceding
paragraph. Specifically, at present, it expects the annual growth
rates over the July-August period to be within the ranges of ____
to ____ per cent for M-1 and ____ to ____ per cent for M-2.
In the judgment of the Committee such growth rates are likely to be
associated with a weekly-average Federal funds rate of about ____
per cent. If, giving approximately equal weight to M-1 and M-2, it
appears that growth rates over the 2-month period will deviate
significantly from the midpoints of the indicated ranges, the
operational objective for the Federal funds rate shall be modified
in an orderly fashion within a range of ____ to ____ per cent.
If it appears during the period before the next meeting that
the operating constraints specified above are proving to be signif-
icantly inconsistent, the Manager is promptly to notify the Chair-
man who will then decide whether the situation calls for supple-
mentary instructions from the Committee.
"Money Market" Formulation
At this time, the Committee seeks to maintain about the
prevailing money market conditions (OR TO ACHIEVE SOMEWHAT EASIER
OR SOMEWHAT FIRMER MONEY MARKET CONDITIONS) during the period
immediately ahead, provided that monetary aggregates appear to
be growing at approximately the rates currently expected, which
are believed to be on a path reasonably consistent with the longer-
run ranges for monetary aggregates cited in the preceding paragraph.
Specifically, the Committee seeks to maintain the weekly-average
Federal funds rate at about [DEL: 5-3/8] _____ per cent, so long as M-1
and M-2 appear to be growing over the [DEL: June-July] JULY-AUGUST period
at annual rates with ranges of [DEL: 2-1/2 to 6-1/2] ____ TO ____
per cent and [DEL: 6-to-10] ____ TO ____ per cent, respectively.
If, giving approximately equal weight to M-1 and M-2, it appears
that growth rates over the 2-month period are approaching or moving
beyond the limits of the indicated ranges, the operational
objective for the weekly-average Federal funds rate shall be
modified in an orderly fashion within a range of [DEL: 5-1/4 to 5-3/4]
____ TO ____ per cent.
If it appears during the period before the next meeting that
the operating constraints specified above are proving to be signif-
icantly inconsistent, the Manager is promptly to notify the Chair-
man who will then decide whether the situation calls for supplemen-
tary instructions from the Committee.
