Prefatory Note 
</p>
<p> 
 
</p>
<p>The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 
</p>
<p>Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redacted passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    
</p>

<p>                                                 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked 
and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff. </p>

<p>MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES
</p>
<p>Recent Developments
</p>
<p>(1) In the days immediately after the December FOMC meeting, the Trading
</p>
<p>Desk continued to conduct a large volume of open market operations, particularly forward
</p>
<p>and term repurchase agreements, that brought total repurchase agreements outstanding to
</p>
<p>$141 billion by the end of the year. These operations were necessary to offset reserve drains
</p>
<p>induced by buildups in currency in circulation, the Treasury's balance at the Federal Reserve,
</p>
<p>and the pool of temporary investment orders from foreign central banks. On several days
</p>
<p>before year-end, the federal funds rate was below target when the Desk entered the market,
</p>
<p>leading some observers to conjecture that the Federal Reserve was "flooding the market with
</p>
<p>liquidity" as insurance against potential Y2K problems. On these days, the funds rate tended
</p>
<p>to firm in late trading when aggregate reserve supply proved to be less plentiful than market
</p>
<p>participants had thought. Since the turn of the year, a bit more than three-quarters of the
</p>
<p>Y2K bulge in currency has flowed back to the Federal Reserve and other factors have
</p>
<p>returned to more typical levels. The Desk mopped up these additions to reserves by allowing
</p>
<p>repurchase agreements to mature without replacement and by arranging several matched
</p>
<p>sale-purchase transactions. Operating balances reached very low levels on some days, and
</p>
<p>funds rate volatility was elevated, but, in general, the effective rate has been close to the
</p>
<p>target since the turn of the year.1 Borrowing from the Special Liquidity Facility was
</p>
<p>1. Over the entire intermeeting period, the effective funds rate averaged 5.29 percent.</p>

<p>-2-
</p>
<p>substantial on only two days over the intermeeting period, and none of the options auctioned
</p>
<p>under the Special Financing Facility was exercised. In general, financial markets weathered
</p>
<p>the turn of the year well, reflecting in part the cumulative effect of Federal Reserve initiatives
</p>
<p>to stave off potential Y2K dislocations. Although the RP rate on Treasury collateral dipped
</p>
<p>well below the funds rate and bid-asked spreads in the RP and funds market spiked around
</p>
<p>year-end, they quickly returned to more normal configurations. Activity in the markets for
</p>
<p>Treasury and corporate securities dropped as year-end approached and subsequently
</p>
<p>recovered, but the magnitude of the swings did not differ much from other year-end periods.
</p>
<p>(2) Market participants generally anticipated both the FOMC's decision at the
</p>
<p>December meeting to leave the stance of policy unchanged and the announcement's
</p>
<p>implication that the Committee would be inclined to tighten in February; hence, yields on
</p>
<p>coupon securities showed little change that day. Against the background of the Federal
</p>
<p>Reserve's expression of concern about the unsustainable pace of economic expansion and
</p>
<p>the uneventful passing of the century date change, evidence that aggregate demand retained
</p>
<p>considerable momentum pressured market interest rates higher over most of the
</p>
<p>intermeeting period. Today, after publication of unexpectedly high readings on
</p>
<p>compensation and GDP inflation, most Treasury yields initially rose and private security
</p>
<p>prices tumbled. However, as risk spreads widened, the dollar strengthened, and equity prices
</p>
<p>fell, something of a flight to quality ensued and Treasury yields reversed course. On balance,
</p>
<p>yields on Treasury notes have risen 30 to 40 basis points since the last FOMC meeting, while
</p>
<p>the yield on the thirty-year bond is unchanged, and the yield curve now slopes downward</p>
<p />
</div>
<div class="page"><p />
<p>-3-
</p>
<p>past the five-year maturity. Expectations of changes in relative supplies associated with
</p>
<p>agency issuance and the Treasury buyback program and technical factors relating to efforts to
</p>
<p>rebalance portfolios contributed to the pivoting of the yield curve. Even with today's
</p>
<p>widening of risk spreads, yields on investment grade corporate bonds rose less than Treasury
</p>
<p>yields, especially after market participants saw that the century date change had passed
</p>
<p>without serious dislocations. Most risk spreads have now more than reversed their runup
</p>
<p>last summer, though they generally remain well above their levels prior to autumn of 1998. 2
</p>
<p>Stock prices were quite volatile over the intermeeting period, with tech stocks and other
</p>
<p>shares often exhibiting disparate movements day-by-day. Reflecting the countervailing
</p>
<p>influences of stronger-than-expected earnings but generally rising interest rates, broad stock
</p>
<p>price indexes fell slightly on balance while tech-heavy indexes rose sharply.
</p>
<p>(3) The foreign exchange value of the dollar had shown little net change over the
</p>
<p>intermeeting period against indexes of both major foreign currencies and those of other
</p>
<p>important trading partners. Today, however, the dollar appreciated 1-1/2 percent against
</p>
<p>major foreign currencies, as expectations built for more substantial Federal Reserve
</p>
<p>tightening. On net over the intermeeting period, the dollar gained 4-1/4 percent against the
</p>
<p>yen and 3 percent relative to the euro, but it depreciated around 1 percent vis-a-vis the
</p>
<p>British pound and 2 percent against the Canadian dollar. Long-term interest rates in
</p>
<p>industrial countries-with the notable exception of Japan-rose appreciably, boosted by
</p>
<p>2. However, banks report continued net tightening in terms and standards for business
loans.</p>
<p />
</div>
<div class="page"><p />
<p>-4-
</p>
<p>evidence that the economic expansion in Europe had found firmer footing. Against that
</p>
<p>backdrop, market participants became increasingly confident that policy tightening would be
</p>
<p>forthcoming. Indeed, judging by money market futures, expectations are for official rate
</p>
<p>hikes by the European Central Bank of about 1 percentage point over the next year, only a
</p>
<p>little less than for the United States. The Bank of England actually tightened, citing
</p>
<p>concerns about inflation pressures as justification for a 1/4 percentage point increase in its
</p>
<p>repurchase rate on January 13. In Japan, in sharp contrast, market participants apparently
</p>
<p>saw little news in recent weeks to lead them to believe that the Bank of Japan will change its
</p>
<p>zero-interest-rate policy any time soon as economic recovery there continues to proceed in
</p>
<p>fits and starts. Japanese long-term yields edged lower over the intermeeting period,
</p>
<p>supporting the dollar. Japanese monetary authorities intervened to weaken the yen on two
</p>
<p>days early in the period.
</p>
<p>; U.S. monetary authorities
</p>
<p>did not intervene. Financial market conditions in emerging market economies generally
</p>
<p>improved further over the intermeeting period, with sovereign debt spreads narrowing and
</p>
<p>equity prices rising.
</p>
<p>(4) M2 growth rose to a 7-1/4 percent annual rate in December and edged up
</p>
<p>further to an 8-1/4 percent pace in January.3 Growth over the two months was above that
</p>
<p>expected at the time of the December Committee meeting. Extra demands for liquidity and

<div class="page"><p />
<p>-5-
</p>
<p>safety may have added a little to M2 growth in December and, through the monthly
</p>
<p>averaging process, to January as well. However, there were more substantial, though largely
</p>
<p>offsetting, influences on M2 components. Currency in the hands of the public expanded
</p>
<p>rapidly in the second half of December, and, as depositors exchanged money in the bank for
</p>
<p>money in their pockets, liquid deposits in M2 weakened. In January, the public ran down its
</p>
<p>currency holdings, but at a gradual rate, and liquid deposits have rebounded in recent weeks.
</p>
<p>(5) M3 was more affected by Y2K positioning than M2. Issuance of large time
</p>
<p>deposits exploded in the fourth quarter of 1999 for several reasons: Banks wanted to build
</p>
<p>up their liquid assets, many faced very high credit demands that needed to be funded, and
</p>
<p>institutional depositors saw banks as safe harbors in which to ride out the century date
</p>
<p>change. In addition, institutional money funds surged because firms viewed them as
</p>
<p>convenient parking places for some of their extra precautionary liquid balances. Overall, M3
</p>
<p>growth reached an annual rate of 16-1/2 percent in December. A pronounced deceleration
</p>
<p>in large time deposits helped bring the growth of M3 in January down to 8-3/4 percent.
</p>
<p>Banks have seen demands for credit ease considerably in January, especially in the
</p>
<p>components (business and security loans) most likely to have been affected by Y2K.4
</p>
<p>(6) Total domestic nonfinancial debt is estimated to have grown 6-1/4 percent in
</p>
<p>the fourth quarter of 1999, including a growth rate of 7 percent in December. To some
</p>
<p>4. Responses to the January Senior Loan Officer Survey suggest that the buildup in
security loans in late 1999 was the result of securities dealers turning to banks as the cost of
issuing commercial paper climbed and as other institutional lenders pulled back from this
market temporarily. For business loans, respondent banks tended to downweight Y2K as a
reason for the strength late last year, referring instead to merger and acquisition financing
and investment expenditures.</p>
<p />
</div>
<div class="page"><p />
<p>-6-
</p>
<p>extent, borrowing was boosted late in the year by desires to build liquid assets. This was
</p>
<p>clearly the case for the federal sector, as the runoff in debt came to a temporary halt in
</p>
<p>December to allow the Treasury to build up its cash balance. Paydowns resumed in January
</p>
<p>and included the redemption of $54 billion in cash management bills. Nonfederal debt is
</p>
<p>estimated to have increased at an 8-1/2 percent annual rate in December, in line with its rate
</p>
<p>of growth over the second half of 1999. Thus far this year, nonfinancial businesses have
</p>
<p>returned to credit markets albeit somewhat tentatively to bond markets, as issuers have
</p>
<p>pulled back in response to the rise in bond yields. Households appear to have taken on
</p>
<p>consumer debt at a more rapid pace in December, in line with reports of exceptionally strong
</p>
<p>holiday sales, and commercial bank data for January indicate that consumer loans are still
</p>
<p>expanding briskly. Home mortgage debt apparently has continued to grow rapidly in recent
</p>
<p>months despite an increase of more than a percentage point in mortgage interest rates over
</p>
<p>the past year. Responses to the January Senior Loan Officer Survey, however, provided
</p>
<p>some evidence of slowing demand for home mortgages.</p>

<p>Longer-Term Strategies
</p>
<p>(7) This section considers alternative longer-term strategies for monetary policy
</p>
<p>and examines some aspects of conducting monetary policy in a setting of elevated
</p>
<p>uncertainty about the supply side of the economy.
</p>
<p>(8) The first set of scenarios, presented in Chart 3, starts with a baseline that
</p>
<p>judgmentally extends the Greenbook forecast. Then, the FRB/US model is used to
</p>
<p>examine policies designed to achieve alternative rates of inflation over the longer run.5 On
</p>
<p>the supply side of the economy, in all three scenarios the long-run NAIRU is about 5-1/4
</p>
<p>percent and growth of potential output is initially around 4 percent, as in the Greenbook.
</p>
<p>However, labor productivity growth begins to slow at mid-decade as the pace of capital
</p>
<p>accumulation (and the rate of increase in services that capital provides) moderates.6
</p>
<p>(9) Among the factors affecting aggregate demand, the federal budget surplus as a
</p>
<p>percent of nominal GDP is assumed to decline slowly on a NIPA basis from a peak of a bit
</p>
<p>5. In the version of the model used for these simulations, expectations of inflation and
other variables are formed in a forward-looking manner, but with incomplete knowledge of
the structure of the model. Under this expectational mechanism, the model has a long-run
sacrifice ratio of about 3-3/4. That is, the equivalent of a 3-3/4 percentage point increase in
the unemployment rate sustained over a year would eventually yield a 1 percentage point
lower rate of inflation.
</p>
<p>6. The standard growth theory embodied in the staff model implies that the long-run
sustainable growth rate of the capital stock depends on the growth rates of three
factors-the working-age population, total factor productivity, and the relative price of
capital goods. The capital stock, in turn, provides a flow of capital services that helps to
determine labor productivity. Extrapolating recent trends of the key factors implies that
growth in capital services is likely to slow from the 7 percent rate projected for the near term
to a figure closer to 5 percent in the long run.</p>

</p>
<p>Household demand is affected importantly by a projected decrease in the ratio of household
</p>
<p>wealth to GDP. In part, this occurs because the personal saving rate is currently too low to
</p>
<p>maintain wealth-to-income ratios absent rising asset prices. In addition, the value of
</p>
<p>corporate equity falls relative to GDP owing to higher real interest rates, slowing
</p>
<p>productivity growth, and a decline in the profit share of output. Ultimately, as household
</p>
<p>wealth declines relative to income, the personal saving rate rebounds to 4 percent by the end
</p>
<p>of the decade. Growth of foreign activity is about in line with that of the U.S. economy.
</p>
<p>Because the income elasticity of imports in the United States is much higher than in its
</p>
<p>trading partners, the U.S. current account deficit would continue to widen without
</p>
<p>significant dollar depreciation. As a result, portfolio balance considerations are assumed to
</p>
<p>lead to a modest secular depreciation of the real foreign exchange value of the dollar over
</p>
<p>the remainder of the decade, at about the same annual rate built into the Greenbook for
</p>
<p>2001. This depreciation damps but does not halt the widening of the deficit.
</p>
<p>(10) Although dollar depreciation and the decline in the federal budget surplus put
</p>
<p>upward pressure on equilibrium interest rates, those effects are more than offset by a rising
</p>
<p>personal saving rate and slowing productivity growth in the last half of the decade. Over
</p>
<p>the next few years, however, the equilibrium rate remains at an exceptionally high level,
</p>
<p>7. Given the prospects for productivity growth embodied in the baseline, this path for
declining government saving seems reasonable in that it is consistent with both eliminating
the federal debt early in the next decade, in line with the Administration's announced goals,
and addressing concerns about the long-range financing of Social Security.</p>

</p>
<p>having been elevated by the acceleration in productivity and wealth-induced declines in the
</p>
<p>saving rate in recent years.
</p>
<p>(11) In the baseline scenario, shown by the solid lines in Chart 3, core PCE
</p>
<p>inflation continues to rise beyond the Greenbook horizon, as the unemployment rate is a
</p>
<p>percentage point below the NAIRU at the beginning of 2002. The Committee is assumed
</p>
<p>to lean against this upward drift in inflation by tightening policy further to slowly push the
</p>
<p>unemployment rate up to the NAIRU by mid-decade. This policy entails raising the
</p>
<p>nominal federal funds rate to 8 percent by the end of 2004, an action that pushes the real
</p>
<p>funds rate up to 5-1/4 percent-a little beyond the 5 percent equilibrium real rate.8
</p>
<p>Consequently, the unemployment rate increases to the NAIRU in 2006, allowing inflation to
</p>
<p>stabilize at just under 3 percent.
</p>
<p>(12) In the stable inflation scenario, shown by the dot-dashed lines, the
</p>
<p>Committee seeks to maintain core PCE inflation close to its current rate of 2 percent.
</p>
<p>Continuing to increase the funds rate in 2001 by almost a further percentage point-rather
</p>
<p>than leaving it unchanged, as in the Greenbook forecast-accomplishes this objective. This
</p>
<p>preemptive action raises the real rate and weakens aggregate spending enough to boost the
</p>
<p>unemployment rate somewhat above the long-run NAIRU. Such slack is needed for a while
</p>
<p>to offset the inflationary impetus of the initial leveling off, and later moderation, in
</p>
<p>productivity growth.
</p>
<p>8. In the charts, inflation is measured by the four-quarter change in the core PCE chain-
weight price index, and past movements in this index are used to proxy for inflation
expectations in the calculations of the real federal funds rate.</p>
<p />
</div>
<div class="page"><p />
<p>-11 -
</p>
<p>(13) The price stability scenario, shown by the dotted lines, brings core PCE
</p>
<p>inflation down to 3/4 percent - close to the estimated measurement bias in this price index.
</p>
<p>To achieve price stability, the Committee is seen to start raising the nominal funds rate
</p>
<p>immediately, to a peak of about 7-3/4 percent by late next year. This policy yields a much
</p>
<p>steeper and higher trajectory of real interest rates, pushing the unemployment rate up to
</p>
<p>6-1/2 percent by the middle of the decade. Although GDP growth slows to below trend,
</p>
<p>the economy does not come close to falling into recession in this scenario; the faster growth
</p>
<p>of potential that has developed in recent years means that a substantial rise in the
</p>
<p>unemployment rate can occur even with a significantly positive pace of economic
</p>
<p>expansion. As inflation approaches its target, policy eases and real interest rates drift back
</p>
<p>down to their equilibrium level, leading to a drift down in unemployment back to the
</p>
<p>NAIRU.
</p>
<p>(14) In the stable-inflation and price-stability scenarios, the Committee is assumed
</p>
<p>to choose a smooth trajectory for the nominal federal funds rate that minimizes the squared
</p>
<p>deviations of the expected paths of future inflation from its target rate and of
</p>
<p>unemployment from the NAIRU. In this process, the current funds rate is set based on
</p>
<p>estimates of the NAIRU and productivity growth going forward (as well as on forecasts of
</p>
<p>other factors). However, given the experience of the past several years, both of these
</p>
<p>supply-side estimates are subject to outsized uncertainty. The Committee might respond to
</p>
<p>this heightened uncertainty by placing less emphasis on forecasts and by downweighting the
</p>
<p>importance of economic indicators whose interpretation is contingent on knowledge of the
</p>
<p>NAIRU or trend productivity growth.</p>
<p />
</div>
<div class="page"><p />
<p>-12-
</p>
<p>(15) Chart 4 shows that under the circumstances portrayed in the Greenbook, a
</p>
<p>policy looking only at recent inflation developments can do reasonably well at stabilizing the
</p>
<p>economy, although not as well as one using forecasts of economic conditions based on
</p>
<p>accurate assessments of the supply side. With the realized-inflation rule (shown by the
</p>
<p>dotted lines), the Committee is seen as changing the nominal federal funds rate in response
</p>
<p>to the realized change in inflation and to deviations of current inflation from a long-run
</p>
<p>target of 2 percent.9 The forecast-based strategy (the solid lines) is the same as the "stable
</p>
<p>inflation" scenario of Chart 3, and is re-labeled to highlight its dependence on forecasts of
</p>
<p>future conditions that in addition are assumed to be accurate. Because under the realized-
</p>
<p>inflation rule the policymaker does not use as much information about the state of the
</p>
<p>economy, that rule produces greater fluctuations in inflation and unemployment, but the
</p>
<p>differences are contained and do not persist. To do even this well, however, the funds rate
</p>
<p>must react very strongly to inflation data. In the rule shown, the nominal funds rate is more
</p>
<p>than twice as sensitive in the short run to a change in inflation as it is in the standard Taylor
</p>
<p>rule.
</p>
<p>(16) It is also useful to examine how such a strategy performs in a variety of
</p>
<p>situations in which developments do not conform with expectations. Charts 5, 6, and 7
</p>
<p>9. Specifically, the funds rate is set according to the rule Ar = 3 At , + .2 (7r - 7t*), where
Ar is the quarterly change in the nominal funds rate, 71 is the four-quarter rate of core PCE
price inflation, and 7I* is the target rate of inflation. The change in the inflation rate is
included in the rule so that, for example, when inflation is above target and rising the
nominal funds rate will rise by more than if inflation were at the same level but falling.
Unlike the Taylor rule, this rule determines the change in, not the level of, the federal funds
rate-a feature that frees the policymaker from needing to know the real equilibrium funds
rate.</p>

</p>
<p>compare the behavior of the economy in three such situations under the realized-inflation
</p>
<p>rule and under the Taylor rule. The Taylor rule also relies on current inflation data, but in
</p>
<p>addition includes responses to the perceived current value of the output gap and the
</p>
<p>estimated equilibrium real interest rate.
</p>
<p>(17) Chart 5 portrays a situation in which the current NAIRU is, and for some
</p>
<p>time has been, 4 percent. A policymaker who knew the true values of the NAIRU and
</p>
<p>potential GDP could do quite well by responding to movements in both output and
</p>
<p>inflation, as indicated by the solid lines showing the performance of the Taylor rule without
</p>
<p>measurement error. In contrast, the dot-dashed lines illustrate a situation in which the
</p>
<p>policymaker incorrectly estimates the NAIRU to be 5-1/4 percent, but gradually lowers this
</p>
<p>estimate to 4 percent as inflation persistently comes in below expectations.10 Initially, owing
</p>
<p>to the misestimation of the NAIRU, the policymaker tightens inappropriately to raise real
</p>
<p>interest rates and unemployment to their perceived equilibrium levels. The resultant
</p>
<p>overshoot in unemployment and undershoot in inflation is only slowly eliminated. As
</p>
<p>indicated by the dotted line, the realized-inflation rule also would prescribe a substantial
</p>
<p>increase in the funds rate this year, because of the 1/2 percentage point pickup in core
</p>
<p>inflation. However, as time passes and inflation declines, responding to actual inflation
</p>
<p>would lead to a fairly prompt reversal of policy, and the unemployment rate could thereby
</p>
<p>be kept much closer to 4 percent and inflation held more tightly in the vicinity of 2 percent
</p>
<p>compared to the Taylor rule with error.
</p>
<p>10. Such a policymaker also would begin with an estimate of the equilibrium real funds
rate that is too high. As with the NAIRU, the estimated equilibrium real rate would be
revised down over time as inflation came in lower than expected.</p>
<p />
</div>
<div class="page"><p />
<p>-14-
</p>
<p>(18) Aside from questions about the sustainable level of unemployment, the
</p>
<p>Committee also must wrestle with how best to discern and respond to changes in potential
</p>
<p>growth. Chart 6 considers a situation in which productivity growth turns out to be a
</p>
<p>percentage point faster than the staffs projection; results are reported as deviations from
</p>
<p>the baseline scenario of Chart 3, in order to better illustrate the effects of the productivity
</p>
<p>surprise. The realized-inflation rule (the dotted lines) allows the gains of the productivity
</p>
<p>acceleration to be taken in the form of lower unemployment for several years. With time,
</p>
<p>however, tighter labor market conditions cause inflation to begin to rise, and these
</p>
<p>developments lead in turn to higher interest rates." By contrast, when policy is based on
</p>
<p>the Taylor rule and the increase in productivity growth is perceived only gradually (the solid
</p>
<p>lines), policymakers misjudge the inflation implications of the strength in aggregate demand
</p>
<p>spurred by the higher growth of productivity and they raise the funds rate more quickly
</p>
<p>(particularly in real terms). The Taylor rule causes the initial productivity surprise to
</p>
<p>primarily lower inflation rather than the unemployment rate. Only as policymakers gradually
</p>
<p>learn that the acceleration in productivity is permanent and adjust their estimates of the
</p>
<p>output gap are they able to bring inflation back to its desired level.12 ,13
</p>
<p>11. According to a wide variety of models, an increase in the trend growth rate of the
economy eventually leads to an upward shift in the equilibrium real interest rate. This shift is
greater than one-for-one in the FRB/US model; the exact magnitude of the shift depends on
a variety of factors, including the response of government spending to the change in
potential output, and the degree to which foreign economies also experience a pick-up in
growth.
</p>
<p>12. Thus, targeting only inflation, and not also the deviation of output from potential (or
unemployment from the NAIRU) looks attractive in the case of a beneficial supply shock.
With an adverse supply shock, targeting inflation would cause the shock to have more of its
effect on lowering output, relative to a rule that tried to stabilize both inflation and</p>
<p />
</div>
<div class="page"><p />
<p>-15-
</p>
<p>(19) Of course, not all the uncertainty about the outlook concerns the supply side;
</p>
<p>the Committee is also likely to face swings in aggregate demand not associated with
</p>
<p>productivity shocks. In Chart 7, we consider a gradual but prolonged slide in the stock
</p>
<p>market.14 As indicated by the dotted lines, the realized-inflation rule does not lead to as
</p>
<p>quick a response of interest rates to the downturn in aggregate demand as does the Taylor
</p>
<p>rule; instead, policymakers wait until the weakness in output shows up as lower inflation.
</p>
<p>As a result, unemployment rises almost a percentage point relative to baseline, leading to a
</p>
<p>shortfall of inflation with respect to the target rate. By contrast, the Taylor rule (the solid
</p>
<p>lines) prompts a response to the weakness in output, and therefore more quickly stabilizes
</p>
<p>both unemployment and inflation.
</p>
<p>output-such as the Taylor rule.
</p>
<p>13. Despite the length of time required for policymakers to gauge fully the extent of the
productivity acceleration (seven years), errors in the measurement of the output gap are
relatively small, and peak at less than 3 percentage points.
</p>
<p>14. The shock is a 2 percentage point rise in the equity premium, spread over this year
and next. On an ex ante basis, such a shock would produce a 40 percent decline in equity
prices. However, associated changes in the long-run level of real interest rates reduce the ex
post fall in the stock market to 25 percent.</p>

<p>noticeably, and M2 strengthened relative to income, perhaps reflecting some portfolio
</p>
<p>rebalancing by households.15 Whatever the causes, as shown in the lower panel, those
</p>
<p>departures of velocity from what would be predicted by opportunity costs are much smaller
</p>
<p>than in the early 1990s. As regards M3, growth for the year came to 7-1/2 percent boosted
</p>
<p>to some extent by a Y2K-related surge in institutional money funds and large time deposits.
</p>
<p>(22) M2 growth is expected to moderate substantially in 2000--to 4-3/4percent--
</p>
<p>despite projected growth of nominal GDP remaining at about 6 percent. The slowing in
</p>
<p>M2 growth owes importantly to the staffs assumption of an increase in the federal funds
</p>
<p>rate of 1-1/4 percentage point over this year, which should help to induce a rise in M2 velocity
</p>
<p>of about 1-1/4 percent. The increase in M2 is a little more than would be predicted by
</p>
<p>historical relationships between opportunity costs and velocity; the forecast assumes a little
</p>
<p>support for M2 demand owing to disappointing returns for investors in the stock market
</p>
<p>this year, which could prompt some shifts to M2 assets.
</p>
<p>(23) M3 is expected to decelerate more than M2 and post 6-1/4 percent growth in
</p>
<p>2000, reflecting in part the unwinding of the Y2K effects on the broader aggregate. In
</p>
<p>particular, the growth of institutional money funds should slow substantially as the buildup
</p>
<p>of corporate liquidity in late 1999 dissipates and as investors find yields on market
</p>
<p>instruments to be more attractive than the lagging returns on such funds. Managed
</p>
<p>liabilities of banks in M3 should grow more slowly this year as well, as banks pare back the
</p>
<p>extraordinary Y2K-related pace of issuance of the fourth quarter. Nevertheless, despite

retirement accounts, amounted to $102 billion in the year and a half ending in June 1997 and

</p>
<p>some increase in real interest rates and a slightly more conservative lending stance by banks
</p>
<p>and other depositories, bank lending is expected to pick up markedly this year, contributing
</p>
<p>to the faster growth of M3 than of GDP.
</p>
<p>(24) After growing 6-1/2 percent in 1999, the debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors
</p>
<p>is projected to increase 5-1/4 percent this year, somewhat below the anticipated growth of
</p>
<p>nominal GDP. Only a small portion of the deceleration owes to the unwinding of extra
</p>
<p>borrowing late in 1999 associated with Y2K. More fundamentally, rising government
</p>
<p>surpluses induce faster paydowns of Treasury debt, and some moderation in private
</p>
<p>spending slows nonfederal debt growth to a still rapid 8-1/4 percent. Moreover, both equity
</p>
<p>retirements and the accumulation of liquid assets held by businesses are projected to
</p>
<p>moderate from their rapid rates of increase in 1999, holding down business credit demands.
</p>
<p>Offsetting these influences in part is the widening gap between capital expenditures and
</p>
<p>internal funds, as investment remains strong while profit growth slows. Household debt
</p>
<p>growth is expected to ease somewhat after its surge toward the end of 1999, as spending on
</p>
<p>big ticket items is restrained by higher interest rates and lower realized returns on equity
</p>
<p>investments. While banks may tighten up a bit further on lending terms and conditions,
</p>
<p>credit costs to private borrowers are unlikely to rise by much more than benchmark yields.
</p>
<p>Ranges for Money and Debt
</p>
<p>(25) The ranges for money and debt in 2000 that the Committee selected on a
</p>
<p>provisional basis last July are presented below, along with an alternative that adjusts the
</p>
<p>money ranges for faster growth of potential GDP. As in other recent years, the Committee
</p>
<p>chose provisional ranges for the monetary aggregates in 2000 that it saw as benchmarks for</p>
<p />
</div>
<div class="page"><p />
<p>-19-
</p>
<p>money growth under conditions of long-term price stability and historically typical velocity
</p>
<p>trends, while the range for domestic nonfinancial debt was better aligned with projected
</p>
<p>growth of that aggregate in 2000. The provisional range for debt, at 3 to 7 percent, is
</p>
<p>centered not far from the staff's projection for debt growth in 2000, and therefore no
</p>
<p>alternative setting for that range is offered for consideration. 16 The provisional ranges, listed
</p>
<p>as alternative I, are the same set that has been in place since the middle of 1995. The
</p>
<p>Committee may wish once again to retain these ranges as an implicit indication to the public
</p>
<p>of the low weight it places on the monetary and debt aggregates in formulating monetary
</p>
<p>policy. The existing ranges might also be chosen if the increases in productivity observed in
</p>
<p>recent years were seen as likely to be transitory.

<p>M3 2 to 6 3 to 7 6-1/4
</p>
<p>Debt 3 to 7 3 to 7 5-1/4
</p>
<p>16. If the Committee chose to reinterpret the range for debt as a price stability range,
parallel with the treatment for the monetary ranges, it would have several choices, depending
on how it interpreted history. It could set a range for debt that was about a percentage point
faster than its expected growth of nominal GDP at price stability, reflecting the decline in
debt velocity on balance since 1959. However, debt velocity has been rather flat outside of
the 1980s, so a price stability range for the debt aggregate could alternatively be centered on
the expected steady state growth of nominal GDP, as is the case for M2.</p>
<p />
</div>
<div class="page"><p />
<p>-20-
</p>
<p>(26) If, however, the faster productivity growth of recent years is expected to
</p>
<p>persist or even pick up further, the ranges in use since the mid-1990s would no longer be
</p>
<p>centered around money growth expected when prices were stable. In alternative II, the
</p>
<p>ranges for M2 and M3 are adjusted upward to allow for faster growth of potential output.
</p>
<p>When the Committee shifted to using price stability ranges in the mid-1990s, the staffs
</p>
<p>estimate of potential output growth was about 2-1/4 percent and there was thought to be
</p>
<p>perhaps a percentage point of upward bias in the implicit GDP deflator. Over the last four
</p>
<p>years, however, the staff estimates that potential GDP growth has averaged about 3-1/2
</p>
<p>percent, while the bias in the implicit deflator is now about 1/2 percentage point. Potential
</p>
<p>GDP growth is deduced from estimates of structural productivity growth averaging 2-1/2
</p>
<p>percent, plus about 1 percent growth in labor inputs.17,18 The midpoints of the ranges in
</p>
<p>alternative II are consistent with these estimates of recent potential output growth and
</p>
<p>residual bias in the implicit GDP deflator, assuming historically typical velocity behavior.
</p>
<p>With stable velocity, M2 would be expected to grow at the implied 4 percent pace of
</p>
<p>17. While actual nonfarm business productivity has grown at an average 2-3/4 percent rate
over the last four years, about 1/4 percentage point has been cyclical, according to staff
estimates. Differences in the growth rates of output and hours in the nonfarm business
sector versus the overall economy require a downward adjustment of 0.1 percentage point in
arriving at potential GDP growth.
</p>
<p>18. Similar estimates for potential GDP expansion over the last four years can be
derived using Okun's law: Actual GDP has grown an average 4-1/4 percent and the
unemployment rate has fallen 0.4 percentage point per annum on balance since 1996.
Estimates of Okun's law over recent decades imply that the difference between actual and
potential output growth is twice the rate of decline in the unemployment rate, or 3/4
percentage point, implying potential output growth of 3-1/2 percent over the period.</p>
<p />
</div>
<div class="page"><p />
<p>-21-
</p>
<p>nominal GDP. The range for M3 would be a percentage point higher than that for M2,
</p>
<p>reflecting the faster average growth of the broader aggregate over history. 19
</p>
<p>(27) For a variety of reasons, however, desired steady state growth of the monetary
</p>
<p>aggregates might be faster than the midpoints of the ranges in alternative II. The staff
</p>
<p>estimates that, owing to accelerating productivity, the growth of potential GDP will be yet
</p>
<p>more elevated going forward--4 percent over this year and next. Moreover, the Committee
</p>
<p>may believe that a small positive true inflation rate is desirable in the long run because of
</p>
<p>possible nominal rigidities in the economy or because of potential risks to the ability of
</p>
<p>policy to react forcefully to economic weakness if the nominal federal funds rate were close
</p>
<p>to the lower bound of zero.20 The Committee may view a small positive true inflation rate
</p>
<p>as still consistent with effective price stability in that such a rate may be sufficiently low as to
</p>
<p>have no influence on the decision-making of households and businesses. If the Committee
</p>
<p>did decide to adjust the monetary ranges up by a percentage point or more, the Humphrey
</p>
<p>Hawkins report and testimony could clarify that no greater weight was intended to be placed
</p>
<p>on the aggregates in the formulation of policy. The July 1999 Humphrey Hawkins report
</p>
<p>noted that such an adjustment might be needed if faster productivity growth persisted.
</p>
<p>19. The velocity of M3 has been rather unstable and its long-run trend difficult to assess
(chart 7). M3 has grown faster than M2 on average since 1959; this divergence has been
evident in recent years as well and is projected to continue over the forecast period.
However, it is unclear why nominal magnitudes would grow at divergent rates over the very
long run, and the price stability range for M3 might ultimately have to be aligned to that for
M2.
</p>
<p>20. This latter concern may have become less of a risk of late because of apparent
increases in the equilibrium real funds rate, likely associated with faster productivity growth.</p>

</p>
<p>Short-Run Policy Alternatives
</p>
<p>(28) In view of continued and surprising vigor in incoming spending data and a
</p>
<p>slightly higher projected path for equity prices, the staff has again notched up its assessment
</p>
<p>of the underlying strength of aggregate demand. At the same time, the forecasts for
</p>
<p>productivity growth and expansion of potential GDP have been revised up a touch. The
</p>
<p>staff has assumed that the FOMC will respond to inflationary pressures by raising the
</p>
<p>federal funds rate 1-1/4 percentage points, 1/2 percentage points more than in the December
</p>
<p>Greenbook. These firming actions are assumed to occur a bit sooner than currently built
</p>
<p>into the yield curve and are expected to be accompanied by an edging higher of long-term
</p>
<p>yields and a plateauing of equity prices not much above current levels. The growth of real
</p>
<p>GDP is now projected at 4 percent in 2000 and 3-3/4 percent in 2001, compared with 3-
</p>
<p>3/4 percent for both years in the last Greenbook. The unemployment rate is seen as
</p>
<p>remaining around 4 percent over the forecast period. This degree of pressure on resources
</p>
<p>is expected to lead to a noticeable acceleration of core consumer prices, with the PCE chain
</p>
<p>price index excluding food and energy projected to be rising at a 2-1/4 percent rate in the
</p>
<p>second half of 2001, compared with 1-1/2 percent during 1999. Foreign economies are
</p>
<p>projected to continue growing briskly, prompting increases in official interest rates in many
</p>
<p>major trading partners this year that about match those assumed for the United States. As a
</p>
<p>result, the foreign exchange value of the dollar is expected to hold around current levels
</p>
<p>through 2000 before depreciating moderately next year as U.S. interest rates flatten out and
</p>
<p>swelling volumes of dollar-denominated debt associated with a high and rising current
</p>
<p>account deficit weigh on international investment portfolios.</p>
<p />
</div>
<div class="page"><p />
<p>-23-
</p>
<p>(29) This bluebook proposes three short-run monetary policy alternatives for the
</p>
<p>Committee's consideration at this meeting: an unchanged stance of monetary policy
</p>
<p>(alternative B); a 25 basis point firming of the federal funds rate (alternative C); and a 50
</p>
<p>basis point tightening (alternative D).
</p>
<p>(30) Despite the significant inflation risk embodied in the staff forecast and
</p>
<p>identified in the Federal Reserve's announcement following the December meeting, the
</p>
<p>Committee might not yet be convinced that policy action is necessary and hence might be
</p>
<p>inclined to choose alternative B. Even though labor markets have remained tight for some
</p>
<p>time, readings on core prices generally have been well behaved, excepting the pickup in
</p>
<p>various NIPA inflation measures for the fourth quarter reported today. While these reports
</p>
<p>may be disquieting, the four-quarter changes in these measures remain moderate. Taken
</p>
<p>together with other price reports, the recent behavior of core inflation may still be
</p>
<p>consistent with trend productivity growth that is strong enough, or a natural rate of
</p>
<p>unemployment that is low enough, to restrain inflation for considerably longer than in the
</p>
<p>staff forecast. In light of this possibility, the Committee may wish to wait awhile in order
</p>
<p>better to assess the extent of inflationary pressures. If the Committee were to keep the
</p>
<p>stance of policy unchanged, however, it presumably would want to accompany
</p>
<p>announcement of that choice with a statement, under its new policy, that "the risks are
</p>
<p>weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures in the
</p>
<p>foreseeable future," given the high rate of labor utilization and the continued strength in
</p>
<p>demand that could push that rate even higher.</p>
<p />
</div>
<div class="page"><p />
<p>-24-
</p>
<p>(31) In view of the macroeconomic situation and recent Federal Reserve
</p>
<p>statements, market participants uniformly seem to expect a tightening of monetary policy at
</p>
<p>this meeting, with considerable weight currently being placed on a 25 basis point move and
</p>
<p>some probability on a 50 basis point increase. In these circumstances, implementation of
</p>
<p>the unchanged money market conditions of alternative B, even if accompanied by a
</p>
<p>statement that the balance of risks remains tilted to the upside, would confuse investors.
</p>
<p>Nonetheless, financial markets, especially for equities, would rally if investors trimmed their
</p>
<p>expectations of the extent of cumulative monetary tightening. Short-term market interest
</p>
<p>rates would drop nearly 1/4 percentage point, and the dollar would weaken on foreign
</p>
<p>exchange markets.
</p>
<p>(32) The announcement following the December meeting indicated that the
</p>
<p>FOMC was concerned that a continuation of rapid demand growth could lead to an
</p>
<p>escalation of inflation pressures. If anything, the upside risks to the economy and inflation
</p>
<p>seem to have intensified over the intermeeting period, perhaps inclining the Committee
</p>
<p>toward the 25 basis point firming of policy of alternative C. Indeed, those risks would
</p>
<p>mount should financial markets rally as a result of policy inaction. And although
</p>
<p>productivity may still be accelerating, the momentum of spending risks outstripping the
</p>
<p>expansion in available labor, exacerbating strains in already-taut labor markets. The staffs
</p>
<p>assessment is that considerable policy firming will be necessary to contain inflation. Even if
</p>
<p>the Committee finds this assessment plausible, it still may want to proceed incrementally, as
</p>
<p>it typically has done, because of uncertainty about the response of financial markets to its
</p>
<p>actions, about the sensitivity of spending to financial market conditions, and about the</p>
<p />
</div>
<div class="page"><p />
<p>-25-
</p>
<p>reaction of inflation to labor market conditions. Moreover, long-term inflation expectations
</p>
<p>remain damped, suggesting that a rapid shift in the stance of policy is not essential at this
</p>
<p>point. Still, the Committee may wish to express the view that, even after the 100 basis
</p>
<p>points of cumulative tightening since mid-1999, the risks remain tilted toward increased
</p>
<p>inflation pressures.
</p>
<p>(33) Investors appear to be anticipating a 25 basis point firming and a statement
</p>
<p>that the balance of risks is weighted toward inflation. As a result, these choices would likely
</p>
<p>result in little change in market prices. As this is the first Committee meeting under the new
</p>
<p>disclosure policy, however, an assessment of the market reaction is somewhat more
</p>
<p>uncertain than usual. There is a good chance that market participants would read the
</p>
<p>announcement as suggesting that another firming could well be in the offing, but such an
</p>
<p>expectation is already consistent with current readings on federal funds futures rates, which
</p>
<p>imply a near-certainty of another 25 basis point move at the March meeting.
</p>
<p>(34) If the Committee sees recent data as tending to confirm that substantial
</p>
<p>monetary restraint will need to be applied over the next year or so to keep inflation in check,
</p>
<p>as implied by the staff forecast, it might choose the 50 basis point tightening of policy
</p>
<p>contemplated in alternative D. In this circumstance, the Committee might see advantages
</p>
<p>to moving well along in the process relatively quickly, to minimize the odds that inflation
</p>
<p>expectations begin to rise and to reduce the probability that a protracted period of
</p>
<p>tightening will be required. And, it might also want to adopt a statement that it saw the
</p>
<p>risks as still being tilted toward higher inflation, which would convey a sense that further
</p>
<p>policy tightening might well be needed. On the other hand, if the Committee thought that a</p>
<p />
</div>
<div class="page"><p />
<p>-26-
</p>
<p>prompt 50 basis point adjustment had a reasonable chance of being sufficient to contain
</p>
<p>inflation to a satisfactory level, at least for some time, it presumably would indicate, under
</p>
<p>the formula laid out in its new disclosure policy, that "the Committee believes that the risks
</p>
<p>are balanced with respect to prospects for" "its long-run goals of price stability and
</p>
<p>sustainable economic growth."
</p>
<p>(35) The 50 basis point tightening at this meeting contemplated under alternative
</p>
<p>D is not fully incorporated in market prices, and thus implementation of this alternative
</p>
<p>would probably result in nearly a quarter-point rise in money market yields. The effects on
</p>
<p>longer-term yields and on equity prices would probably be conditioned importantly by the
</p>
<p>FOMC's statement regarding the balance of risks. With a statement of symmetric risks "for
</p>
<p>the foreseeable future," any drop in bond prices might be damped as the effects of the
</p>
<p>tighter-than-expected stance of policy over the near term are partly offset by some flattening
</p>
<p>of investors' expectations of policy tightening after March. If the FOMC instead chose to
</p>
<p>link its tightening action with wording indicating that it saw the balance of risks as still tilted
</p>
<p>toward inflation, market participants would likely revise upward their expected path of
</p>
<p>Federal Reserve tightening. Hence, bond and stock markets would probably sell off, and
</p>
<p>the dollar would appreciate on foreign exchange markets.
</p>
<p>(36) Under the unchanged money market conditions of alternative B, M2 growth
</p>
<p>is projected to pick up a bit, to a 6 percent annual rate over the December to June period,
</p>
<p>from the 5-1/2 percent rate from September to December, despite a small drag from the
</p>
<p>unwinding of Y2K effects. M2 would be somewhat above its provisional 1 to 5 percent
</p>
<p>annual range in June. M3 is expected to decelerate sharply, to a 5-1/4 percent rate over the</p>
<p />
</div>
<div class="page"><p />
<p>-27-
</p>
<p>December to June period from the 14 percent pace of September to December. Adjusted
</p>
<p>for Y2K influences, M3 growth is expected to be about the same in the two periods. M3
</p>
<p>also would be above its provisional 2 to 6 percent annual range in June. Growth of the debt
</p>
<p>of domestic nonfinancial sectors is expected to slow, dropping to a 5-1/4 percent rate over
</p>
<p>the December to June interval from the 6 percent pace between September and December,
</p>
<p>leaving this aggregate a bit above the middle of its provisional 3 to 7 percent annual range in
</p>
<p>June.</p>

<p>1. Targets are for bank credit until 1983; from 1983 onward targets are for domestic nonfinancial sector debt.
</p>
<p>2. The figures shown reflect target and actual growth of M1-B in 1980 and shift-adjusted M1-B in 1981. M1-B was
relabeled M1 in January 1982. The targeted growth for M1-A was 3-1/2 to 6 percent in 1980 (actual growth was 5.0
percent); in 1981 targeted growth for shift-adjusted M1-A was 3 to 5-1/2 percent (actual growth was 1.3 percent).
</p>
<p>3. When these ranges were set, shifts into other checkable deposits in 1980 were expected to have only a limited effect
on growth of M -A and M1-B. As the year progressed, however, banks offered other checkable deposits more actively,
and more funds than expected were directed to these accounts. Such shifts are estimated to have decreased M1-A growth
and increased M1-B growth each by at least 1/2 percentage point more than had been anticipated.
</p>
<p>4. Adjusted for the effects of shifts out of demand deposits and savings deposits. At the February FOMC meeting, the
target ranges for observed M1-A and M1-B in 1981 on an unadjusted basis, expected to be consistent with the adjusted
ranges, were -(4-1/2) to -2 and 6 to 8-1/2 percent, respectively. Actual M1-B growth (not shift adjusted) was 5.0 percent.
</p>
<p>5. Adjusted for shifts of assets from domestic banking offices to International Banking Facilities.
</p>
<p>6. Range for bank credit is annualized growth from the December 1981 - January 1982 average level through the fourth
quarter of 1982.
</p>
<p>7. Base period, adopted at the July 1983 FOMC meeting, is 1983 QII. At the February 1983 meeting, the FOMC had
adopted a 1982 QIV to 1983 QIV target range for M1 of 4 to 8 percent.
</p>
<p>8. Base period is the February-March 1983 average.
</p>
<p>9. Base period, adopted at the July 1985 FOMC meeting, is 1985 QII. At the February 1983 meeting, the FOMC had
adopted a 1984 QIV to 1985 QIV target range for M1 of 4 to 7 percent.
</p>
<p>10. No range for M1 has been specified since the February 1987 FOMC meeting because of uncertainties about its
underlying relationship to the behavior of the economy and its sensitivity to economic and financial circumstances.
</p>
<p>11. At the February 1990 meeting, the FOMC specified a range of 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent. This range was lowered to
1 to 5 percent at the July 1990 meeting.
</p>
<p>12. At the February 1993 meeting, the FOMC specified a range of 2 to 6 percent for M2, 1/2 to 4-1/2 percent for M3,
and 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent for domestic nonfinancial debt. These ranges were lowered to 1 to 5 percent for M2, 0 to 4
percent for M3, and 4 to 8 percent for domestic nonfinancial debt at the July 1993 meeting.
</p>
<p>13. At the February 1995 FOMC meeting, the FOMC specified a range of 0 to 4 percent. This range was raised to 2
to 6 percent at the July 1995 meeting.

<p>NOTE: Weekly data for columns 1 through 13 are week-ending averages. As of September 1997, data in column 6 are interpolated from data on certain commercial paper trades settled by the Depository Trust Company; prior
to that, they reflect an average of offering rates placed by several leading dealers. Column 14 Is the Bond Buyer revenue Index, which Is a 1-day quote for Thursday. Column 15 is the average contract rate on new
commitments for fixed-rate mortgages (FRMs) with 80 percent loan-to-value ratios at major institutional lenders. Column 16 is the average initial contract rate on new commitments for 1-year, adjustable-rate mortgages
(ARMs) at major institutional lenders offering both FRMs and ARMs with the same number of discount points.
