MONEY MARKET AND RESERVE RELATIONSHIPS

Recent developments

Since the April 18 announcement of the increase in the dis-

count rate (to 5-1/2 per cent) and in Regulation Q ceilings on large

denomination negotiable CD's, and in light of the Committee's move

toward firmer monetary conditions at the subsequent FOMC meeting,

both short- and long-term market yields have risen moderately on

balance, and the prime rate has risen 1/2 point. Aside from temporary

declines at the end of the double settlement week, Federal funds rates

have traded around 6 per cent in recent sessions. The 3- and 6-month

bill rates have increased by around 15-20 basis points to 5.50 and

5.65 per cent, respectively. Net borrowed reserves of $536 million

were published for the statement week containing the discount rate

change, partly reflecting very low excess reserve holdings of country

banks in the second half of their reserve periods; this figure compares

with average net borrowed reserves of $268 million for the preceding

three weeks.

Bill rates have shown only moderate increases thus far since

the discount rate hike largely because of sizable bill demands. Among

these were demands for reinvestment of the proceeds of the $2.3 billion

of tax anticipations bills which were not turned in for taxes, and large

seasonal demands from public funds.

Prior to the move to even greater monetary restraint associated

with the discount rate increase, short-term rates had moved gradually

higher in response to the early April firming of open market policy.

In the early part of April the 3-month bill rate rose by around 15

basis points to almost 5.35 per cent. Dealer financing costs rose

markedly in this period, partly as a result of the sharp rise in the

basic reserve deficit of New York money market banks as the tax period

approached. Also, one key money market bank seemed to shift its

longer-run money position policy to become more of a borrower in the

funds market and less ready a supplier of funds to dealers.

In adjustment to the Treasury bill rates and dealer financing

costs, repurchase agreements made by the Management in the period

April 3-18 were made at 5-1/8 per cent, 1/8 above the then prevailing

discount rate. In addition, an earlier scarcity of bills, which had

pushed rates sharply lower toward the end of March, was mitigated through

moderate net sales of bills by the Desk for foreign accounts, net bill

sales of $335 million by the System in the first half of the month, and

an announcement by the Treasury of $100 million cash additions to the

weekly 6-month bill auction through mid-year. Thus, of the 30 basis

point rise in the 3-month bill rate since the April 2 FOMC meeting, about

half occurred before the discount rate hike and about half afterwards.

Other short-term rates showed mixed changes in the earlier part of April

and have generally risen 10 - 20 basis points on balance since the

discount rate hike.

The progressively tighter conditions in short-term markets

put banks at an increasing competitive disadvantage in bidding for CD

money before the Q-ceiling changes. As a result, there were large

run-offs of CD's during April, amounting to over $1 billion by around

mid-month. The new CD ceiling rates led to a somewhat larger than

usual increase in outstanding CD's in the week following the tax date,

although a large proportion of these sales apparently were for purposes

of resale into the market; there are no strong indications as yet of

a widespread bank aggressiveness in seeking new CD funds. For the

most part, posted CD rates beyond the 30-59 day area have remained

somewhat below the new ceilings, but there are reports that active

issuance of 3-month CD's at the 6 per cent ceiling rate. Also in

the course of April there was a slackening in inflows of consumer-type

time and savings deposits, especially at large banks.

A sizable portion of the April CD maturities occurred around

the tax date and contributed to heavy bank sales of Treasury bills and

to the sharp run-up of bill rates at that point. Banks were experiencing

increasing loan demand pressure in the first half of the month as well,

though there was apparently some abatement of such demands after the

tax period.

Bank sales of Treasury securities to meet CD maturities and

loan demand have tended to hold down the credit proxy. For April bank

credit on average is estimated to decline at about a 3-1/2 per cent

annual rate, and time and savings deposits to rise at only a 1/2 of one

per cent annual rate. Private demand deposits, on the other hand,

expanded at around a 14 per cent annual rate in April, considerably higher

than in March, mainly reflecting large net transfers from U.S. Govern-

ment deposits. With currency also continuing to grow rapidly, the

money supply in April bulged sharply.

Prospective developments

The possibilities of a tax increase, the status of peace

negotiations, and uncertainties as to the specifics of a Treasury

financing are among the factors which make any projection of a

constellation of money market conditions in the period ahead especially

subject to unexpected variations. As best can be gauged at this point,

the maintenance of prevailing firmer conditions in the money market during

April 26, 1968.



CONFIDENTIAL(FR) -5- April 26, 1968.

the next four weeks may involve a Federal funds rate fluctuating

around 6 per cent, member bank borrowings around $750 million and

net borrowed reserves in a $350-$500 million range. Both borrowing

and net borrowed reserves might possibly be deeper depending in part

on the extent of reserve pressure that develops at central money market

banks and on the inclination of banks to borrow from the discount window

rather than in the funds market. Persistence of this degree of tautness

in such money market indicators may serve to drive the 3-month bill

rate up in a 5-1/2 -- 5-3/4 per cent range, partly because of the

associated high dealer financing costs (with costs of new money in

New York often 6-1/2 per cent or a little above) and also because of

the effect on attitudes of market participants who may not have yet

fully appreciated the extent of monetary tightness that is in train.

If it were not for the possible effect on bill rates of a

sustained taut monetary policy, the 3-month bill rate over the next few

weeks might show little, if any, tendency to rise further. The ending

of mid-April tax period pressures has begun to ease the reserve position

of central money market banks, and if past behavior is any guide, the

position of such banks is likely to be relatively comfortable in May.

Moreover, large bill sales by dealers to the public during the past

several days have depleted the trading supply of bills going into a

period when System open market operations are likely to be on the buy

side at least over the next two weeks. Finally, the weekly additions

to the 3-month bill auction are scheduled to come to an end.



CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -6- April 26, 1968.

The forthcoming mid-May Treasury financing is expected to have

relatively little impact on bill rates, unless the whole financing were

to be concentratedin a15-18 month issue. Market expectations are that

the Treasury will probably seek to avoid the sizable attrition that

might accompany a "rights" exchange for the $4 billion of publicly

held maturing issues. Rather, a cash exchange is anticipated, possibly

with both a short- and intermediate-term offering, with the Treasury

perhaps raising some new cash if market conditions are appropriate.

A cash exchange has in the past generally been associated with somewhat

less bill demand from holders of maturing issues than has a "rights"

exchange, in which the appearance of "rights" value on the maturing

issue has made it attractive for holders of the issue to sell it and

often to reinvest the proceeds in the bill market.

A bill rate even at the upper end of the projected range will

enable banks to compete fairly effectively for CD funds if they choose.

But banks are not expected to be overly aggressive in seeking longer-

term CD funds at near ceiling rates unless loan demands are exceptionally

strong or unless they become more convinced that the outlook is for

considerably higher interest rates in the months ahead--which is a

possible development if the recent revived hopes for a tax increase

again fade away. The staff expectation is that banks will add somewhat

to outstanding negotiable CD's in May, as they make an effort to begin

recovering from the approximately $1.5 billion run-off between the mid-

March and mid-April tax periods. Net additions to outstanding CD's

may be in the order of $300 - $600 million over the month, or just

slightly more than seasonal.



CONFIDENTIAL (FR)

This relatively conservative estimate of CD offerings is

also based partly on the expectation that immediate bank needs for

funds are not likely to be extremely large. Business loan demands on

banks during coming weeks are expected to slacken somewhat from their

very rapid mid-March to mid-April pace. There may be some pick-up in

bank credit demands, however, in connection with the mid-May refunding,

as dealers and other temporary holders seek financing. It is not

expected that banks, in terms of their longer-run portfolio choices,

will be able, or willing, to do much more than roll over the maturing

mid-May issues.

Given these prospective credit demands, and with the Treasury

assumed to raise only about $400 million of new cash through over-

allotments in the mid-May refunding, outstanding bank credit is likely

to show little change in the course of May, and, on average, move only

in a +2 to -2 per cent annual rate range. Bank credit would, of course,

show a larger increase if the Treasury raised more new cash than assumed

around mid-May, and particularly so if tax and loan crediting were granted

on the cash portion.

Assuming the bulk of the Treasury's cash financing is

accomplished in June, bank credit might grow at a 4-6 per cent annual

rate; loan demands are also likely to be stronger, and banks may begin

to press CD offerings more strongly on the market. If the mid-points

of these ranges are realized, bank credit expansion (as measured by

the proxy) would be at about a 4 per cent annual rate over the first

half of the year.

April 26, 1968.



CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -8- April 26, 1968.

The anticipated moderate recovery in CD's is likely to lead

to growth in time and savings deposits during May in a 5 - 7 per cent

annual rate range, with inflows of consumer time and savings deposits

remaining sluggish given the existing structure of market interest

rates. Money supply growth in May is expected to drop off from April,

though to remain relatively rapid, at around an 8 - 10 per cent annual

rate. The net new cash expected to be raised by the Treasury in May

will not be sufficient to forestall a further sizable decline in the

Treasury's cash balance (seasonally adjusted), and this will result

in further shifting of funds from U.S. Government to private demand

deposits. The quite rapid growth in currency of the past two months

is projected to slow down; the staff does not yet have any very

convincing explanation for the surge in currency growth, and,

similarly, no strong reason to assume the growth will continue.

The constrained growth in bank credit in May, and also in

June when compared with other periods of Treasury cash borrowing, is

likely to contribute to additional upward pressures on longer-term

interest rates, barring a tax increase or the psychological impact of

a break-through in Vietnam peace negotiations. There is no evidence

yet of large-scale anticipatory capital market borrowing by corporations

and state and local governments, but there are signs of a growing

calendar in both markets that will tend to add to market pressures

in a period when the Treasury will be marketing coupon issues and

possibly a PC.

Explanation of Projections in Table B-1

1. Changes in Federal Reserve credit indicate reserves needed to offset projected changes in
required reserves and factors affecting the supply of reserves.

2. Projected changes in currency outside banks reflect seasonal movements plus an allowance for
growth of about $40 million per week.

3. Projected effects of Treasury operations, included in "technical factors," reflect scheduled
and assumed calls in current two weeks and thereafter, maintenance of Treasury balances with
Federal Reserve at $1.0 billion.

4. Projected changes in required reserves assume the existing net reserve position of banks and
the structure of interest rates in the market, as well as the current economic outlook. On
the basis of these assumptions of projections reflect expected movements in bank credit and
money in the period ahead, including the effects of such elements as the public's loan demand,
repayments of previous loans, bank's investment preferences and willingness to supply loans,
bank's desires and abilities to obtain time and savings deposits, and the Government's financing
needs. The projections thus encompass normal seasonal developments, temporary bursts of

loan demand and expected associated repayments not currently reflected by the seasonals, and
whatever cyclical and growth demands for money and credit are expected in the projection period.
Assumed Treasury financing operations include: $0.2 billion increase in the weekly and monthly

Treasury bill auctions through June 5; $0.4 billion, May 15; $2.0 billion, June 7.
