MONETARY AGGREGATES AND
MONEY MARKET CONDITIONS

Recent Developments

(1) In May all of the key monetary aggregates substantially

exceeded the paths acceptable to the Committee at the last meeting. Growth

in the narrowly defined money supply accelerated to an annual rate estimated

on a preliminary basis, at around 17 per cent. If this preliminary estimate

holds up, it will be the largest increase for any month in the 25 year

history of the daily average series. The annual growth rate of the adjusted

credit proxy remained relatively moderate--at only about half that for

M1 --although it exceeded the expected rate by about the same number of

percentage points as M1.

1/ Data for last five days of May are still estimated on basis of prelim-
inary information for statement week ending June.2.

(2) Shortly after the last Committee meeting, preliminary data

for the statement week ending May 12 indicated that M 1 and M2 had increased

to levels well above their bluebook paths. Because this increase occurred

in the week when settlement was being made on the heavy early May volume of

June 4, 1971

dollar transfers into foreign currencies, question was raised whether it

might not simply be a temporary reflection of such transfers. However,

disaggregated final data for the week indicated that the increase was not

concentrated at the money centers through which the bulk of foreign exchange

transactions probably occurred. Moreover, since the week of the 12th,the

level of the money stock has continued to run well above the bluebook path.

The reasons for the extraordinary recent strength of money supply are unclear,

but they may reflect a lagged response to the marked reductions of interest

rates in earlier months, a more rapid growth of money GNP thus far in 1971,

and perhaps a precautionary build-up in cash balances by consumers and others

in an uncertain economic atmosphere.

level to which it had risen in early May, this tendency persisted immediately

following the Committee meeting, adding another 1/8 to 3/8 of a percentage

point to the overall yield advance and perhaps contributing to further stock

price declines. By the third week of May, however, bond markets began to rally

and stock prices turned upward. Most recently key bond yields in all market

sectors have dropped a little below the levels prevailing at the time of the

last meeting. During the period when yields were still under upward pressure,

the Desk purchased about $130 million of Treasury coupon issues on small orders

placed directly through dealers rather than through a general go-around.

(4) During the period immediately following the May 11 meeting, in

view of the general weakness of bond markets and with the Treasury financing

still a factor, the Desk continued to aim at a Federal funds rate around 4-1/2

that the aggregates were exceeding
per cent even after new data indicated/the paths specified at the May 11 meeting.

On May 20, when the securities markets rally began and new evidence indicated

that the aggregates were even stronger than thought earlier, the Desk aimed

at a funds rate in the 4-1/2--4-3/4 per cent range. On May 26 the funds rate

target was raised again to around 4-3/4 per cent, and a week later to around

4-7/8 per cent. In terms of weekly averages, the funds rate was 4.55 per cent

in the first statement week following the last meeting, and 4.68 and 4.82 per

cent respectively in the two succeeding weeks.

(5) In maintaining a higher average rate on federal funds, the

Desk provided non-borrowed reserves somewhat less liberally than otherwise.

This has been reflected in the marginal reserve measures. Over the three

full statement weeks since the last meeting, net borrowed reserves averaged



-4-

about $215 million in contrast to average free reserves of $70 million over

the three preceding statement weeks. Similarly, in the most recent three

weeks, member bank borrowings at the Federal Reserve averaged a little over

$400 million, nearly double the average for the preceding period.

(6) The general firming of day-to-day money market conditions

in May was reflected--with some lag--in further marked advances of other

short-term interest rates. The rate on 3-month Treasury bills, for example,

moved from a level around 3.85 per cent at the time of the last meeting to

a recent high of 4.45 per cent, while advances of other short-term rates

ranged generally from 1/4 to 5/8 of a percentage point. During late May

and early June when the bond market was rallying, bill rates also declined

somewhat as they often do at this time of the year. But most recently, the

3-month Treasury bill has edged up to around 4.30 per cent.

annual ratesof change in major financial aggregates for selected periods.

Prospective developments

(8) The continued strengthening of the aggregates has led the

staff to raise its estimates of both the levels of and growth rates in

money supply and bank credit that might be expected in the near term at

any given level of interest rates. In view of recent developments the

8-1/2 per cent growth rate in M1 for the second quarter acceptable to the

Committee at the last meeting appears practically impossible to achieve

(except for accidental developments or substantial projection misses not

related to deliberate policy operations). Moreover, the average 8 per

cent growth rate over both the second and third quarters together--which

represented the intermediate path acceptable to the Committee last time--

would also be very difficult to attain. At the present time, such a path

would require a very sharp drop to around 4 per cent annual rate in third

quarter growth in M1 . This would appear to entail a considerable wrench-

ing of the money market, with a near-term rise in the Federal funds rate so

large as seriously to upset capital markets, possibly followed later in

the summer or early fall by the need to induce a sharp drop in the funds

rate in order to keep M1 growth from falling below even a 4 per cent rate

over the fourth quarter. Though not as magnified, similar control problems

could develop in moving onto other less restrictive paths--for instance,

the alternative C path presented for consideration at this time.

(9) Three alternative paths for the various aggregates are

shown in the detailed table on page 7. The text table on page 8 summarizes

staff estimates of the relation between money market conditions and the three

alternative paths for the aggregates. Monthly, as well as quarterly, rates

of growth are shown in this summary table for M 1 (taken to represent the

collection of aggregates) to highlight the sharply diminished rates of growth

that might be expected by late summer, particularly if money market condi-

tions are to be tightened significantly further. In specifying the constella-

tion of money market conditions, it should be pointed out that as the Federal

funds rate moves above the discount rate, bank attitudes toward use of the

discount window will change, with consequent uncertainties in estimating the

expected level of member bank borrowings during such a transition period.

Federal funds rate 4-3/4 5-1/4 6

Member bank borrowings 250 - 350 350 - 450 450 - 600

(10) Given a Federal funds rate of around 4-3/4 per cent, M1

growth in June would be expected at about a 9-10 per cent annual rate,

and for the second quarter as a whole it would be around 12 per cent.

The third quarter rate of growth would be projected to slow only modestly

to around 10-1/2 per cent. But by late in that quarter and in the fall a

substantially slower growth rate would be expected, as the lagged effect

on the demand for money of the higher short-term interest rates that will

have prevailed since mid-March begins to take hold.



-9-

(11) A tightening of the money market between now and mid-year

to the degrees indicated by the suggested specifications for alternatives B

and C would have little effect on growth in M1 during June, but would begin

to have more noticeable effects in ensuing months.1/ Under alternative B the

M 1 growth rate in the third quarter would be expected to be reduced to 9-1/2 per

cent and under alternative C to 8 per cent. However, by late summer or early

fall, it is our best estimate that the growth rate would be sharply reduced,

perhaps in alternative C to only about a 3--4 per cent annual rate, although

there are great difficulties of course in pinpointing exact months in which

low growth rates would be likely to emerge. Growth at such low rates would

continue for some months as sharply higher short-term interest rates gradually

reduce the demand for money balances and as higher long-term interest rates

over the next few months and possibly weakness in the stock market depress

individuals' net worth (which also reduces money demand). Thus, during fall

the money supply could be growing considerably less than might be desired

unless interest rates were moved sharply downward in the interim.

(12) Alternative B, which indicates a somewhat more gradual

deceleration of the aggregates than alternative C, is less likely to lead

to sharp and sustained upward interest rate adjustments and hence to the

need for a later easing in money market conditions. However, over the near-

term a funds rate around 5-1/4 per cent, as specified in alternative B, would

likely induce a renewed increase in long-term interest rates, particularly as

expectations of a discount rate increase became more prevalent and another

rise in the prime rate more likely. But the general interest rate increase

would not carry as far as under alternative C and there would be a greater

probability of a corrective market rally later on.

1/ Weekly patterns for the aggregates between now and the next Committee meeting
are appended. Because changes in money market conditions affect aggregates with
a lag, differences among the alternatives for the weeks immediately ahead are,
of course, quite small.



-10-

(13) Under all three alternatives, growth in M2 is expected to

slow more than growth in M1 between the second and third quarters. Time and

savings deposits other than large CD's are growing less rapidly in the second

than the first quarter, although the slowing thus far has been less than

anticipated. We expect a further slowing in the third quarter as consumer

spending strengthens and as short-term interest rates rise--with the slowing

in such deposit inflows becoming more pronounced to the extent the money

market tightens. Under alternative A, we would expect the 3-month bill rate

between now and mid-year to be in a 4-1/4--4-3/4 per cent range, and it may be

expected to rise somewhat above that range in the summer as the Treasury finances

large and partly seasonal cash needs. Under alternative B, the 3-month bill

would be likely to move into a 4-5/8--5-1/4 per cent range by or shortly

after mid-year; and the rate would likely be substantially higher under

alternative C.

(14) Loan demands on banks over the summer months are expected to

be fairly strong as economic recovery proceeds and as some borrowers switch

from the open market to banks. And growth in the adjusted credit proxy may

be somewhat greater in June and the third quarter than in April-May, although

it is in general expected to continue on the moderate side. Instead of

declining, nondeposit sources of funds are projected to show little net change

from their recently prevailing minimal levels; thus, they would no longer be a

negative factor affecting bank credit. Outstanding large CD's are expected

to show little net change from current levels under alternative A, given the

relatively comfortable liquidity position of banks. But with tighter money

market conditions--as under alternatives B and C--a moderate net growth in CD's

might develop as banks attempt to compensate in part for slower growth in other

time and demand deposits. In addition, under tighter reserve conditions, banks

would become less willing purchasers of securities.



-11-

Possible directive language

(15) This section presents possible language for the second

paragraph of the directive corresponding to the three alternative policy

courses discussed above. In all three alternatives it is proposed to

delete the reference not only to the now-completed Treasury financing,

but also to uncertainties in foreign exchange markets. Although such

uncertainties do, of course, continue, the likelihood that exchange

market developments may pose significant problems for domestic financial

markets in the near-term now seems considerably less than it did at the

height of the tensions in early May.

(16) Alternative A. The following language is proposed for

possible use if the Committee decides to call for maintenance of prevail-

ing money market conditions, subject to a proviso clause.

"To implement this policy, [DEL: the committee seeks to

moderate growth in monetary and credit aggregates over

the months ahead, taking account of the current Treasury

financing, developments in capital markets, and uncertain-

ties in foreign exchange markets.] System open market

operations until the next meeting of the Committee shall

be CONDUCTED WITH A VIEW TO [DEL: aimed initially at] maintaining

[DEL: currently] prevailing money market conditions; [DEL: and thereafter

conducted with a view to maintaining bank reserves and money

market conditions consistent with the above cited objectives.]

PROVIDED THAT SOMEWHAT FIRMER CONDITIONS SHALL BE SOUGHT

IF IT APPEARS THAT THE MONETARY AND CREDIT AGGREGATES ARE

SIGNIFICANTLY EXCEEDING THE GROWTH PATHS EXPECTED AND

IF CAPITAL MARKETS ARE NOT UNDER EXCESSIVE PRESSURE."



-12-

If the Committee adopts this alternative, it may wish to consider the

money market conditions noted for alternative A in paragraph (9) as a

description of "prevailing" conditions, and for purposes of the proviso

clause to adopt the aggregate growth paths discussed earlier in connec-

tion with alternative A as the "expected" paths. The proviso clause

has been formulated in one-way terms, guarding against significant

excesses but not shortfalls, on the assumption that the Committee would

not want money market conditions to be eased in the coming period if the

aggregates should fall short of the indicated paths. As will be noted,

the proposed proviso retains the sense of the reference to capital

market developments in the present directive (i.e., to take account of

such developments in any firming operations) by indicating that somewhat

firmer conditions are to be sought under the proviso only "if capital

markets are not under excessive pressure."

(17) Alternative B. This language is proposed for possible

use if the Committee decides (a) to formulate its primary instruction

in terms of desired growth rates for the monetary and credit aggregates

(subject to any constraints that might be imposed by developments in

capital markets), and (b) to adopt as targets for the time being the

growth rates discussed earlier in connection with alternative B.

"To implement this policy, the Committee seeks to

moderate growth in monetary [DEL: and credit] aggregates over the months

ahead, taking account of [DEL: the current Treasury financing,]

developments in capital markets [DEL: , and uncertainities in foreign

exchange markets]. System open market operations until the

next meeting of the Committee shall be [DEL: aimed initially at]



-13-

[DEL: maintianing currently prevailing money market conditions,

and thereafter] conducted with a view to maintaining bank

reserves and money market conditions consistent with the

[DEL: above cited] THOSE objectives."

It is proposed to use the phrase "to moderate growth in monetary aggregates

in the months ahead" as a summary description of the objective for the

aggregates, deleting the words "and credit", on the assumption that the

Committee will not view recent rates of growth in the adjusted proxy as

so large as to require moderation.

(18) Alternative C. This language is proposed for possible

use if the Committee decides to adopt as targets the growth rates dis-

cussed earlier in connection with alternative C, and to instruct the Desk

to move to the money market conditions noted in paragraph (9) in connec-

tion with that alternative.

"To implement this policy, [DEL: the Committee seeks to

moderate growth in monetary and credit aggregate over

the months ahead, taking account of the current Treasury

financing, developments in capital markets, and uncer-

tainties in foreign exchange markets.] System open market

operations until the next meeting of the Committee shall

be [DEL: aimed initially at maintaining currently prevailing

money market conditions, and thereafter] conducted with a

view to MOVING ACTIVELY TO [DEL: maintaining] bank reserves and

money market conditions [DEL: consistent with the above cited

objectives] THAT WILL LEAD TO A SUBSTANTIAL MODERATION OF

GROWTH IN MONETARY AGGREGATES OVER THE MONTHS AHEAD."



-14-

This language has been formulated in a manner which the staff believes

would underscore the Committee's determination to slow the growth rates

in the aggregates.
