MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES 

Recent Developments 

Summary 

(1) Financial markets remained under severe strain over the intermeeting 

period.  Although there were signs of improvement in some money markets, 

conditions continued to be poor, spreads were elevated, and year-end pressures 

emerged.  The Treasury’s announcement on November 12 that funds from the 

Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) would not be used to purchase securities 

backed by mortgage-related and other assets elicited a negative price reaction in 

several financial markets.  Intensifying concerns about the financial condition of 

Citigroup and the potential systemic implications of its failure prompted the U.S. 

government to intervene to provide financial support.  In response to deteriorating 

conditions in credit markets, the Federal Reserve announced on November 25 the 

creation of the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) and also a 

program to conduct large-scale outright purchases of debt issued by housing-related 

GSEs and mortgage-backed securities (MBS) backed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, 

and Ginnie Mae.  On net, the sharp deterioration in the outlook for economic growth 

led market participants to mark down substantially the expected path of monetary 

policy over the intermeeting period, and they now appear to expect a 50 basis point 

cut in the target federal funds rate at the upcoming FOMC meeting.  Yields on 

nominal Treasuries plunged and TIPS-based measures of inflation compensation 

declined.  In the corporate sector, broad equity price indexes moved lower while risk 

spreads soared over the intermeeting period.  Although issuance of nonfinancial 

investment-grade bonds was solid in November, speculative-grade debt issuance 

continued to be nil.  Bank lending exhibited broad weakness in November.  



   

Household credit declined in the third quarter.  Numerous foreign central banks eased 

monetary policy considerably amid signs of a worldwide economic slowdown.    

Financial Institutions 

(2) Investor concerns about the condition of financial institutions mounted 

over the intermeeting period.  Credit default swap (CDS) spreads for U.S. banks 

widened notably, and their equity prices fell, likely reflecting in part sharp declines in 

the value of mortgage-related and other assets (Chart 1).  Anxiety about the financial 

condition of Citigroup intensified, especially in the wake of the firm’s announcement 

that it would lay off 52,000 workers and absorb $17 billion in distressed assets from 

structured investment vehicles.  To support financial market stability, the U.S. 

government on November 23 entered into an agreement with Citigroup to provide a 

package of capital, guarantees, and liquidity access.1  Banking organizations began to 

take advantage of the FDIC’s Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program, with twelve 

institutions issuing roughly $70 billion in bonds under the program (see the box 

entitled “The FDIC’s Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program”). 

(3) Other financial institutions also came under pressure over the intermeeting 

period.  CDS spreads for insurance companies remained elevated, possibly reflecting 

concerns regarding the prospective profitability of these firms as well as declines in 

the values of their investment portfolios.  Equity prices of insurance companies 

slipped lower, on net, over the intermeeting period.  REITs were significantly affected 

by the deterioration in the commercial mortgage market, and their equity valuations 

fell and CDS spreads surged.  Average returns of hedge funds were negative for a 

                                           
1 As part of the agreement, the Treasury and FDIC will provide protection against outsized 
losses on a pool of about $306 billion in residential and commercial real estate and other 
assets.  Under this arrangement, Citigroup will issue preferred shares to the Treasury and 
FDIC.  In addition and if necessary, the Federal Reserve stands ready to backstop residual 
risk in the asset pool through a non-recourse loan.  Moreover, the Treasury will purchase an 
additional $20 billion in Citigroup preferred stock using TARP funds.

The FDIC’s Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program 

On October 14, the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation (FDIC) announced a Temporary Liquidity 
Guarantee Program (TLGP) to help improve market 
confidence in the U.S. banking system.  An interim rule was 
published on November 3, and a final rule was released 
November 21.  The TLGP has two components:  The 
Transaction Account Guarantee Program (TAGP) and the 
Debt Guarantee Program (DGP).  The TAGP covers 
(through December 31, 2009) all balances in noninterest 
bearing transactions accounts in excess of the deposit 
insurance limit of $250,000, as well as certain additional 
accounts (such as NOW accounts with interest rates of 
0.5% per year or less), held at FDIC-insured depository 
institutions. Demand deposits have soared, registering over 
150 percent annualized growth in November, in part 
because of the TAGP.  Reportedly some institutional 
investors are leaving funds in these accounts rather than 
earn very low rates in other money markets, particularly the 
repo market.  In addition, some large time deposits—which 
are not covered by this program—have reportedly been 
converted to demand deposits to benefit from the 
guarantee. 

The DGP covers certain new senior unsecured obligations 
issued by FDIC-insured depository institutions and by most of 
their parent holding companies.  The guarantee covers all new 
debt with maturity over one month, up to a cap based on 
senior debt outstanding as of September 30, 2008.1  All 
guaranteed debt issued by June 30, 2009 is covered until 
maturity or until June 30, 2012, whichever is sooner.  Fees 
associated with this program range from 50 basis points for 
debt with maturities of 180 days or less to 100 basis points for 
maturities beyond 360 days. 

  

 

 
 
 
 
 
 

1Eligible instruments consist of federal funds, promissory notes, commercial 
paper, unsubordinated unsecured notes, and interbank deposits (including CDs, 
deposits in an International Banking Facility, and Eurodollar deposits).  In its final 
rule, the FDIC excluded obligations with maturities of less than 30 days and will 
not collect fees against those obligations.  The final rule also gives the FDIC 
discretion to adjust firms’ use of the program on a case-by-case basis.

Initial inclusion in the TLGP was automatic, with eligible institutions having until December 5 
to decide whether they wanted to continue participating in the program or to opt out of one or 
both of the DGP and the TAGP.  Virtually all large institutions chose to participate in both 
components of the TLGP.  The FDIC reports that about 800 institutions have opted out of the 
TAGP and more than 3000 have opted out of the DGP.  However, FDIC staff indicate that 
there has been some confusion regarding participation in the DGP, and these numbers are likely 
to be revised.        

Issuance of debt under the DGP began in late November.  As shown in the table on the 
previous page, eligible institutions have issued about $70 billion in notes, primarily denominated 
in U.S. dollars, with maturities ranging from December 2010 to June 2012.  Roughly one-third 
of the issuance has been floating rate.  The FDIC estimates that issuance of senior unsecured 
bank notes under the DGP could eventually total as much as $500 billion.  Debt issued under 
this program has thus far traded at spreads to Treasuries somewhat wider than those of 
comparable-maturity agency debt but substantially lower than those of corporate notes not 
subject to the guarantee.  There are some notable differences in spreads on these debt issues 
across institutions.  Moreover, the differences in spreads across firms appear to be correlated 
with differences in CDS premiums.  In part, the difference in yields on guaranteed debt 
instruments may reflect investor uncertainty regarding the FDIC's payout process in the event 
of default.  Market participants reportedly indicated that, with a significant amount of DGP 
debt expected to be issued over coming months, and with the Federal Reserve expected to 
purchase large quantities of agency debt, the difference in spreads between these assets is likely 
to persist.  Nonetheless, DGP debt spreads have generally narrowed since issuance, amid 
reportedly notable trading volumes as investors have become familiar with the program.

sixth consecutive month in November, although recent losses were not nearly as large 

as those in September and October.  In the wake of their recent poor performance, 

hedge funds have reportedly experienced considerable net redemptions, with some 

estimates suggesting that October outflows equaled about 2 percent of industry assets 

under management.  Further, year-end redemption requests appeared to continue to 

weigh on the industry.  To meet actual and expected redemption requests, hedge 

funds were said to have liquidated positions, likely exacerbating asset price declines in 

several markets.  Meanwhile, prime money market mutual funds (MMMFs), which 

had experienced outflows in September and October, posted net inflows over the 

intermeeting period.  The inflows likely reflected an easing of investor concerns about 

the safety and liquidity of these funds, owing to the Treasury’s Temporary Guarantee 

Program and the support provided by several Federal Reserve facilities.  

Market Functioning 

(4) Money markets remained strained over the intermeeting period, particularly 

at terms beyond overnight, although there were some signs of improvement.  In 

unsecured interbank funding markets, Libor fixings at most maturities declined 

notably early in the period and spreads over comparable-maturity overnight index 

swap (OIS) rates narrowed further from the record levels reached in October (Chart 

2).  The one-month spread initially jumped as that maturity crossed year-end but has 

narrowed again in recent days as the Libor fixing declined.  Trading in longer-term 

interbank funding markets reportedly remained thin.     

(5) In secured funding markets, conditions continued to be strained over the 

intermeeting period.  Amid high demand for safe investments, the overnight general 

collateral (GC) repo rate remained very low and fell to around zero late in the 

intermeeting period.  Fails to deliver in the Treasury market came down substantially 

from the extraordinary levels reached in October and overnight securities lending

from the SOMA portfolio fell sharply, although these declines came against a 

backdrop of sharply lower transaction volume as investors have reportedly become 

less willing to lend collateral out of fear that it will not be returned and as some large 

dealers are reportedly reducing the amount of collateral they are supplying to the 

market ahead of year-end.  However, fails have picked up somewhat in recent days as 

the GC repo rate reached zero.  The low level of SOMA lending may in part be due to 

a high fee relative to market rates.  Demand for safe instruments was also apparent in 

the Treasury bill market, where yields turned negative at times.  During the 

intermeeting period, the Treasury announced that it would not roll over bills related to 

the Supplementary Financing Program (SFP), for the stated reason of preserving 

flexibility in managing debt policy, and uncertainty about supply, combined with a 

perceived lack thereof, appeared to exacerbate poor conditions in the bill market.  

Despite the decline in spreads over Treasury GC rates later in the period, strains in 

markets for repo transactions backed by agency and MBS collateral remained evident, 

with bid-asked spreads and haircuts very elevated.  

(6) In contrast, conditions in the commercial paper (CP) market improved over 

the intermeeting period, reflecting importantly the recent measures taken by the 

Federal Reserve in support of this market.  Spreads on 30-day A1/P1 financial and 

asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) continued to narrow after the Commercial 

Paper Funding Facility (CPFF) became operational on October 27, although spreads 

subsequently reversed a portion of the declines as maturities crossed over year-end.  

By contrast, spreads on A2/P2 paper—which is not eligible for purchase under the 

CPFF—stayed extremely elevated.  The dollar amounts of unsecured financial CP and 

ABCP outstanding rebounded from their October lows, though this increase was 

more than accounted for by issuance into the CPFF.  As of December 10, credit 

extended under the CPFF totaled $311 billion.  Credit extended under the Asset-

Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (AMLF) fell 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 8 of 60



   

by more than half over the intermeeting period, to $34 billion.  Thus far, the Money 

Market Investor Funding Facility (MMIFF) program has registered no activity.  The 

low demand for credit from the AMLF and MMIFF likely reflects the recent net flows 

into money market mutual funds, the institutions that the two facilities were designed 

to support. 

(7) Strains remained evident or even intensified in a number of long-term 

financial markets over the period.  The functioning of the market for Treasury 

coupon securities remained impaired.  The on-the-run premium for the ten-year 

nominal Treasury security surged higher from already elevated levels.  Trading 

volumes in the Treasury market continued to decline and bid-asked spreads were 

abnormally wide.  Liquidity in the corporate bond market was also impaired for 

speculative-grade bonds, while conditions have improved somewhat in recent months 

for investment-grade bonds.  In the CDS market, liquidity and price discovery 

apparently remained poor, based on the number of dealers providing quotes and the 

range of dealer quotes.  The announcement by the Treasury on November 12 that 

TARP funds would not be used to purchase mortgage-related and other assets 

sparked a sharp decline in various asset prices.  The selloff was particularly 

pronounced in the market for commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS), with 

an index of CDS spreads on AAA-rated CMBS widening 310 basis points, on net, 

over the intermeeting period.  Secondary market prices of syndicated leveraged loans 

also declined to new record lows and implied spreads on the LCDX index soared to 

record levels, as hedge funds reportedly unloaded their holdings of leveraged loans 

and as collateralized loan obligations came under significant pressure.  Average bid-

asked spreads in the syndicated loan market widened further, on net.         

(8) Depository institutions continued to make heavy use of the discount 

window.  Although primary credit outstanding declined somewhat in recent weeks, it 

stood at $90 billion as of December 10.  Recent TAF auctions, for both 28-day and 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 9 of 60



   

84-day credit, were undersubscribed; the size of the auctions had been raised, and the 

number of bidders remained relatively steady.  Overall, credit extended under the 

TAF increased about $150 billion to $448 billion.  Bidding was especially light for the 

two forward TAF auctions conducted over the intermeeting period—each for $150 

billion in short-term credit over year-end.  While a number of the Term Securities 

Lending Facility (TSLF) auctions held over the period were oversubscribed, the two 

most recent auctions were undersubscribed.  Market participants exercised only $8 

billion of the options on $50 billion of TSLF loans against Schedule 2 collateral on 

their November 24 exercise date.  However, the auction offering $50 billion in 

options for 13-day Schedule 2 TSLF loans straddling the year-turn was 

oversubscribed, with investors reportedly attributing the reception to the current 

strong demand for Treasury collateral.  Use of the Primary Dealer Credit Facility 

(PDCF) declined significantly over the intermeeting period, falling to $52 billion on 

December 10 from $80 billion on October 28.  On November 10, the Treasury and 

the Federal Reserve announced a restructuring of the support provided to AIG.2   

                                           
2 The Treasury announced that it would purchase $40 billion of newly issued AIG preferred 
shares under the TARP, which allowed the Federal Reserve to reduce from $85 billion to 
$60 billion the total amount available under the credit facility established on September 16.  
Further, the interest rate on that facility was reduced to Libor plus 300 basis points, the fee 
on undrawn funds was reduced to 75 basis points, and the term of the facility was 
lengthened from two years to five years.  The Federal Reserve also announced plans to 
restructure its lending related to AIG by extending credit to two newly formed limited 
liability companies.  The first, which will receive a $22.5 billion loan from the Federal 
Reserve and a $1 billion subordinated loan from AIG, will purchase residential mortgage-
backed securities from AIG.  No credit has yet been extended to this facility.  As a result of 
this facility, the securities lending facility established by the New York Federal Reserve Bank 
on October 8 will be repaid and terminated.  On December 10, the outstanding amount of 
credit outstanding to AIG, including the original loan arrangement and the securities lending 
facility, totaled $57 billion.  The second new company will receive a $30 billion loan from the 
Federal Reserve and a $5 billion subordinated loan from AIG and will purchase multi-sector 
collateralized debt obligations on which AIG has written CDS contracts.  As of December 
10, $20 billion in credit had been extended to this facility.  CPFF credit to AIG as of 
December 10 was $16 billion.

(9) Even though the interest rate paid on excess reserves was raised to the 

lowest target federal funds rate in place during the reserve maintenance period, the 

effective funds rate continued to trade soft to the target, likely reflecting the extremely 

high provision of liquidity through the Federal Reserve’s liquidity facilities (see the 

box “Recent Developments in the Federal Funds Market”). 

Monetary Policy Expectations and Treasury Yields 

(10) The FOMC’s decision at its October meeting to lower the target federal 

funds rate 50 basis points to 1 percent was broadly in line with market expectations 

and elicited only a modest reaction in financial markets.3  However, economic data 

releases that suggested a weaker outlook for growth and lower inflation than had been 

anticipated, along with continued strains in financial markets that weighed on investor 

sentiment, contributed to a sharp downward revision in the expected path of policy 

over the period (Chart 3).  Responses to the Desk’s survey indicate that primary 

dealers view a 50 basis point reduction in the target federal funds rate as the most 

likely outcome at the upcoming meeting.  Reading policy expectations from federal 

funds futures and options is not straightforward, as quotes on those instruments 

reflect expectations that the effective federal funds rate will continue to average below 

the target for a while (see box “Expected Softness in the Expected Federal Funds 

Rate”).  Federal funds futures indicate that investors expect the effective federal funds 

rate after the December meeting to be around 30 basis points.  Using our standard 

assumption for term premiums, Eurodollar futures quotes suggest that investors 

anticipate that the FOMC will begin gradually raising the target federal funds rate in 

the summer of next year, with the rate expected to reach about 1.55 percent by the 

                                           
3 The effective federal funds rate averaged 0.34 percent over the intermeeting period amid 
extraordinary volatility.  Over this intermeeting period, the volume of long-term repurchase 
agreements was unchanged.  The desk did not redeem any Treasury securities.  On net, the 
Desk purchased $2.2 billion in agency securities.

Recent developments in the federal funds market 

Trading conditions in the federal funds market over the intermeeting period were influenced 
by various factors including the rate paid on excess reserve balances (the excess rate), further 
increases in the level of reserve balances, the finalization of the FDIC’s Temporary Liquidity 
Guarantee (TLG) program, and, more recently, expectations of policy easing in December.  

There have been some discernable effects of the excess rate on the federal funds market.  
Beginning November 6, the Board raised the excess rate to the lowest target rate in effect 
over the maintenance period.  After this change, brokered trades at near-zero rates 
essentially ceased and the share of federal funds trades brokered at rates below 25 basis 
points fell from 80 percent to 5 percent by the end of the month.  That said, most federal 
funds trades have still occurred at rates below the excess rate, with a significant portion of 
such trades involving sellers that were not eligible to receive interest on reserves.  While 
arbitrage by institutions eligible to receive interest on reserves could, in theory, support the 
funds rate, there are reportedly a number of impediments to this arbitrage.  Large-scale 
purchases of federal funds by eligible institutions could push their leverage ratios below 
desired levels.  Moreover, many sellers reportedly tightened their counterparty credit limits, 
limiting buyers’ ability to arbitrage.  Finally, prior to the release of the final rule for the 
FDIC’s TLG program on November 21, some buyers of federal funds were reluctant to 
arbitrage, given the possibility that they could face a 75-basis-point guarantee fee.  The 
effective rate edged up after the FDIC announced exclusion of federal funds borrowings 
with maturities of a month or less from coverage under the guarantee program. 

However, once the current maintenance period encompassing the upcoming FOMC 
meeting began on December 4, the effective rate fell.  Evidently, market participants have 
been expecting a cut in the target rate—and thus the excess rate—of at least 50 basis points.  
In addition, the level of excess reserve balances has increased further, reflecting the 
expansion of the Federal Reserve’s liquidity programs and the runoff of the Treasury’s 
Supplementary Financing Program.  Against this backdrop, the share of federal funds trades 
brokered at near-zero rates jumped, and brokered volumes dropped to $70 billion, a level 
well below the average in recent years. 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 12 of 60



  
Expected Softness in the Effective Federal Funds Rate 
 

 

 

Federal funds have traded appreciably below (or “soft to”) the target in recent weeks, and 
market participants are likely expecting that this will continue to be the case after the 
December FOMC meeting, given the large amount of excess reserves currently in the 
financial system.  Consequently, rates implied by federal funds futures, which settle on 
monthly averages of the effective rate, probably reflect continued expectations for softness, 
in addition to anticipated changes in the target rate at the December meeting.  

Disentangling anticipated softness in the effective rate after the December meeting and 
expectations for the federal funds rate target established at that meeting is a complicated task
for at least two reasons.  First, the scope for softness in the funds rate relative to the target 
could begin to be constrained by the zero bound on nominal interest rates.  And second, 
further increases in reserve balances associated with the expansion of liquidity programs or 
the runoff of Treasury balances under the Supplementary Financing Program could exert 
additional downward pressure on the funds rate relative to the target rate.  

One simple way to isolate expected softness over the very near term is to assume that 
market expectations are equal to those of the primary dealers surveyed by the Desk.  The 
table below to the left shows the probabilities assigned by primary dealers in the December 8
survey to various target rates after the December meeting.  These probabilities imply that the 
dealers expect the target rate to be lowered to 50 basis points at the December meeting.  
Since the expected effective rate implied by federal funds futures after the December 
meeting is about 30 basis points, this target rate prediction suggests that market participants 
expect the effective rate to average about 20 basis points below the target in late December.  
An alternative market-based approach is to look at basis swaps between the prime rate and 
the effective federal funds rate.  Assuming that the prime rate will continue to be set at a 
level 3 percentage points above the target rate, one can construct an implied path for the 
target funds rate as shown in column 1 of the table at the bottom right.  Comparing this 
path with the path for the effective funds rate implied by OIS rates (column 2) provides a 
measure of expected softness (column 3).  Although liquidity in this basis swap market is 
somewhat limited, these calculations suggest that funds rate softness is expected to persist 
over the next few months but to become less pronounced over time.

end of 2010.  However, given the heightened uncertainty about the economic and 

financial outlook, term premiums may be larger than usual, which would imply that 

investors are expecting less policy tightening. 

(11) In response to the downward revision in the expected policy path and the 

significantly weaker economic outlook, yields on nominal Treasury securities fell 

substantially over the intermeeting period amid reports of strong safe-haven flows.  

Market expectations that the Federal Reserve may begin purchasing longer-term 

Treasury securities also appeared to push long-term yields lower, especially following 

the Chairman’s speech on December 1 in which he pointed to the possibility of 

substantial purchases of Treasury or agency securities in open market operations.  On 

net, off-the-run two-year Treasury yields fell 95 basis points to 0.55 percent, while off-

the-run ten-year yields dropped 130 basis points to 3.15 percent; the on-the-run ten-

year Treasury yield dropped as low as 2.54 percent, its lowest level in more than four 

decades.  TIPS-based inflation compensation over the next five years declined 50 

basis points, while inflation compensation five to ten years ahead fell 90 basis points.  

Although these declines occurred amid sharp decreases in inflation measures and 

energy prices, they were likely amplified by poor liquidity conditions in TIPS and 

nominal Treasury markets.  In contrast, comparable measures of inflation 

compensation obtained from inflation swaps were little changed on net, over the 

intermeeting period.  Near-term expectations for inflation from the Reuters/Michigan 

and Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank surveys decreased, consistent with the further 

drop in oil prices, while long-term expectations were unchanged.  Primary dealers 

surveyed by the desk lowered their forecasts notably for core PCE inflation in 2009 

but left their long-run forecasts for CPI inflation about the same.

Capital Markets 

(12) As financial market conditions worsened, investors seemed to grow more 

concerned about the likelihood of a deep and prolonged recession.  Stock prices of 

financial corporations fell notably, while broad equity indexes declined, on net, amid 

very high volatility (Chart 4).  Led by large profit reductions in the financial sector, 

operating earnings per share for S&P 500 firms in the third quarter came in about 20 

percent below year-earlier levels.  For nonfinancial firms, earnings per share rose 

about 10 percent, owing almost entirely to gains by firms in the oil and gas industry.  

Looking ahead, analysts marked down substantially their projections for earnings over 

the coming year for both financial and nonfinancial firms, with double-digit declines 

in year-over-year profitability now expected for the fourth quarter in nearly every 

sector.  The spread between the twelve-month forward trend earnings-price ratio for 

S&P 500 firms, and the long-term Treasury yield—a rough gauge of the equity risk 

premium—continued to be exceptionally elevated.  Option-implied volatility of the 

S&P 500 remained near its recent record levels.    

(13) Conditions in corporate debt markets tightened further over the period.  

Risk spreads on BBB-rated and speculative-grade bonds soared and risk spreads on 

higher-rated bonds remained extremely elevated.  CDS spreads on investment-grade 

and speculative-grade corporate bonds widened further.  Gross issuance of bonds by 

nonfinancial investment-grade companies continued at a solid pace, but issuance of 

junk bonds remained at zero.  Issuance of leveraged syndicated loans remained 

extremely weak.    

(14) To help reduce the cost and increase the availability of residential mortgage 

credit, the Federal Reserve announced on November 25 a program to purchase up to 

$100 billion in direct obligations of housing-related government-sponsored 

enterprises (GSEs) and up to $500 billion in MBS backed by Fannie Mae, Freddie 

Mac, and Ginnie Mae.  Agency debt spreads, which had widened early in the period,

narrowed sharply on the announcement.  Subsequent purchases of agency debt by the 

Desk were well received and led to a further reduction in agency spreads.  On net 

over the period, agency debt spreads narrowed 35 basis points while option-adjusted 

spreads on agency MBS declined about 110 basis points.  Likely reflecting in part 

these developments, conditions in the primary residential mortgage market improved.  

The interest rate on 30-year fixed-rate conforming mortgages declined, on net, about 

100 basis points to about 5.5 percent, prompting a notable increase in mortgage 

refinancing. 

(15) To address the tightening of credit conditions for consumers and small 

businesses, the Federal Reserve also announced on November 25 the creation of the 

TALF to support the markets for ABS collateralized by student loans, auto loans, 

credit card loans, and loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (SBA).4  

The facility is expected to be operational by February of next year, and discussions 

with market participants about operational details of this facility are ongoing.     

(16) In the municipal bond market, issuance of longer-term municipal bonds 

continued to rebound in November from the low levels of the past couple of months 

even as yield ratios relative to Treasuries continued to surge.  Anecdotal reports 

suggest that the upward moves in yields may owe in part to supply pressures as states 

and localities seek to refinance their variable-rate demand notes through the issuance 

of long-term debt.  The credit quality of municipal bonds deteriorated further, on net, 

over the period, likely placing further upward pressure on yields. 

                                           
4 Under this program, the Federal Reserve will lend up to $200 billion on a non-recourse 
basis to holders of certain AAA-rated ABS backed by newly and recently originated 
consumer and small business loans.  Using funds from the TARP program, the Treasury will 
provide $20 billion of credit protection in connection with the TALF.

Foreign Developments 

(17) Foreign financial markets continued to fluctuate amid mounting concerns 

about the ongoing global recession, but movements in equity prices and exchange 

rates moderated somewhat relative to developments over the preceding few months.  

Faced with clear evidence of a slowdown in activity and a rapid waning of inflationary 

pressures, central banks around the world eased policy sharply.  The Bank of England 

lowered its base rate by a total of 250 basis points, the European Central Bank by 125 

basis points, and the Swiss National Bank by a total of 200 basis points.  The Bank of 

Japan reduced its target for the overnight call rate by 20 basis points, to 30 basis 

points.  A number of central banks in emerging market economies also eased policy, 

most prominently the People’s Bank of China, which cut its main policy rate from 

6.93 percent to 5.58 percent in two separate moves and also lowered reserve 

requirements.  The announcement on October 29 of new reciprocal swap lines with 

Brazil, Korea, Mexico, and Singapore was well received; since that time, Korea has 

made two drawings. 

(18) Reflecting prospects for lower inflation and accommodative monetary 

policy for an extended period, ten-year nominal sovereign bond yields, which had 

been relatively little changed over the previous intermeeting period, dropped sharply 

in foreign industrial economies, as they did in the United States (Chart 5).  Equity 

indexes in the foreign industrial economies, which suffered very large drops in the 

previous period, were mixed, declining in many euro area economies and Canada but 

rising in Japan and the United Kingdom.  Equity indexes rose in most emerging 

markets, in many cases registering double-digit percent increases.  Sovereign credit 

spreads were volatile and remained elevated over the past month. 

(19) The major currencies index of the dollar moved down nearly 2 percent, on 

net, since the October FOMC meeting.  Gains against some currencies—especially a 

9 percent rise against sterling—were more than offset by declines against the euro and

yen.  The dollar as little changed against the currencies of our other important trading 

partners over the period, despite large gains against the Brazilian real.  The dollar was 

little changed on net against the renminbi; an unusual downtick in the value of the 

renminbi late in the period, however, spurred concerns that the Chinese government 

may be planning to guide the currency lower to help boost exports. 

Debt and Money 

(20) The debt of the domestic nonfinancial sectors is estimated to have 

expanded at about a 7¼ percent annual rate in the third quarter, somewhat slower 

than reported in the previous Bluebook, but still notably faster than the pace seen 

earlier this year (Chart 6).  The strength in overall debt growth owes to a surge in 

borrowing by the federal government related to the Supplementary Financing 

Program and the TARP.  In the nonfinancial business sector, borrowing slowed in the 

third quarter from its pace earlier in the year.  After a sharp increase during the period 

of severe financial turmoil in October, when businesses reportedly drew down back-

up lines of credit at banks, borrowing appears to have fallen back in November.  

Household debt is now estimated to have contracted in the third quarter, reflecting a 

likely reduction in home mortgages amid continuing declines in house prices.      

(21) Commercial bank credit exhibited broad weakness in November.  

Commercial and industrial (C&I) loans declined slightly in November following a 

surge in October.  According to the November Survey of Terms of Business Lending, 

the average spread on C&I loans—adjusted for changes in nonprice loan terms—

increased 25 basis points to its highest level since early 2004, and spreads on higher-

risk loans that were not made under previous commitment increased sharply.  Growth 

in consumer loans also tailed off in November, and residential real estate loans 

continued to decline.  Moreover, loans drawn under home equity lines of credit, 

which had expanded briskly since mid-2007, slowed last month.  Banks have reported

tightening lending standards in the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey for some 

time.  The tightening of lending standards no doubt contributed to the 6 percent drop 

(at an annual rate) in the amount of total lending commitments--the sum of total 

outstanding loans and unused commitments--in the third quarter, which represents 

the largest decrease in that series since the data on unused commitments became 

available in the second quarter of 1990. 

(22) M2 expanded at an 8½ percent annual rate in November, a significant 

slowdown from the pace of the previous month.  Retail money funds contracted 

somewhat after a surge in October that reflected safe-haven inflows to Treasury-only 

funds.  The growth of small time deposits slowed somewhat, although their rate of 

expansion remained quite rapid as banks continued to bid aggressively for these 

deposits.  Liquid deposits showed a moderate expansion in November.  Flows into 

demand deposits, which are covered by the FDIC’s new Temporary Liquidity 

Guarantee Program, were significant and apparently reflected shifts out of savings 

accounts as well as a redirection of funds by banks’ customers away from other 

money market instruments, given their extremely low interest rates.  Currency growth 

remained strong, likely because of continued solid foreign demand for U.S. 

banknotes.

Economic Outlook 

(23) The staff has again revised down sharply its outlook for economic activity.  

Conditions in the labor market have deteriorated more steeply than previously 

thought, the decline in industrial production has intensified, consumer and business 

spending have dropped further, and financial conditions, on balance, appear to have 

tightened again.  As a consequence, the staff forecast now assumes that the federal 

funds rate target will be lowered to ½ percent at this meeting and to ¼ percent early 

next year, where it stays for the remainder of the forecast period.  Long-term Treasury 

yields drift up over the forecast horizon from a level that is more than a percentage 

point lower than in October, as the heavy demand for safe assets moderates when 

economic activity begins to improve later next year, and as the ten-year window for 

the Treasury yield extends further beyond the period of very low short-term interest 

rates anticipated for the next few years.  Corporate bond yields decline over the 

forecast period, as economic conditions eventually improve and risk aversion abates.  

Mortgage rates, which declined a bit less than Treasury yields over the intermeeting 

period, drop further to about 5 percent—nearly a percentage point lower than in the 

October forecast.  Equity prices rise at an annual rate of about 12 percent from a level 

that is approximately 9 percent lower than in October.  The foreign exchange value of 

the dollar is flat in 2009 and declines about 3 percent in 2010.  Oil prices, which have 

dropped about $29 per barrel over the intermeeting period, rise in line with futures 

quotes to around $65 by the end of 2010, a level $20 per barrel lower than in October.  

The staff forecast also assumes that a large fiscal stimulus package, amounting to 

about $500 billion, is approved by the Congress early in 2009.   

(24) Against this backdrop, real GDP is expected to fall at an annual rate of 

4¾ percent in the current quarter and 3 percent in the first half of 2009, 3½ and 

2 percentage points more, respectively, than in the previous projection.  Over the 

remainder of 2009 and in 2010, the economy is forecast to recover slowly.  Amid the 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 24 of 60



   

weaker outlook for GDP growth, the unemployment rate is anticipated to rise to 

8¼ percent in 2010, almost 1 percentage point above the level in the October forecast 

and 3½ percentage points above the staff’s estimate of the NAIRU.  Increased slack 

in resource utilization, diminished pressures from energy and materials prices, a 

decline in import prices, and some reduction in inflation expectations lead to a further 

projected moderation in core PCE inflation from 2 percent this year to 1 percent in 

2009 and ¾ percent in 2010.  Overall PCE inflation is projected at ¾ percent in 2009 

and 1 percent in 2010. 

Monetary Policy Strategies  

(25) As indicated in Chart 7, the Greenbook-consistent measure of short-run r* 

now stands at -3½  percent, about 30 basis points lower than in the October 

Bluebook.  The further decline in r* over the intermeeting period primarily reflects the 

continued decline in equity prices and the widening of credit spreads, as well as the 

weakness of incoming data on the labor market, motor vehicle sales, consumer 

spending, industrial production, and business sentiment.  Financial and economic 

developments also explain an extremely steep drop in the estimate of short-run r* 

obtained from the small structural model.  This measure has moved down about 3¾  

percentage points since the last Bluebook to about -6¾ percent.5  The estimate of 

short-run r* from the FRB/US model has fallen 1 percentage point since the previous 

Bluebook and is now around -6¼  percent.  The estimates of short-run r* span a wide 

interval, but all except the single-equation estimate are well below the current level of 

the actual real federal funds rate. 

                                           
5 To a lesser extent, the shift in the r* from the small structural model also reflects the 
revision in the current level of the output gap.

(26) Chart 8 depicts optimal control simulations of the FRB/US model using the 

long-run staff forecast.6  In these simulations it is assumed that, in view of potential 

adverse effects of very low interest rates on financial markets and institutions, the 

Committee would not wish to lower the target federal funds rate below 25 basis 

points.7  For an inflation goal of either 1½ percent or 2 percent (the left-hand and 

right-hand sets of charts, respectively), the optimal control simulations prescribe a 

trajectory for the nominal federal funds rate that hits the lower bound early in 2009 

and remains there through 2013, before tightening shortly thereafter.  Absent a lower 

bound to short-term nominal interest rates, the optimal policy would have required a 

much larger reduction in the nominal federal funds rate, on the order of 5 percentage 

points in 2009.  Under either inflation goal, the unemployment rate is significantly 

higher for the next few years than in the October Bluebook, rising above 8 percent at 

the end of 2009 and remaining above the NAIRU through 2012; the path of core 

inflation is 40 to 80 basis points lower than in the October Bluebook, staying below 1 

percent from 2010 onwards, reflecting the much weaker current and projected state of 

aggregate demand, as well as recent declines in prices of oil and other commodities.  

These optimal control simulations illustrate how the zero lower bound limits 

conventional monetary policy:  With inflation falling rapidly while the nominal federal 

funds rate is constrained to a level close to zero, the real interest rates increase, and 

the corresponding tightening exacerbates weakness in activity and the rise in 

unemployment.  The Bluebook box, “Implications of Nonconventional Policies for 

Optimal Monetary Policy,” provides an illustration of how nonstandard policy actions 

could alter the optimal policy path.  

                                           
6 In these simulations, policymakers place equal weight on keeping core PCE inflation close 
to a specified goal, on keeping unemployment close to the NAIRU, and on avoiding changes 
in the nominal funds rate.  
7 This assumption differs from the one in the previous Bluebook where the lower bound 
was set equal to zero. These simulations assume that the actual federal funds rate trades at 
the target level chosen by the Committee.

Implications of Unconventional Policies for Optimal Monetary Policy 
 

 

 

1 Note 21 in the materials on the zero bound that were sent to the Committee on December 5 (“Gauging the Macro 
Stimulus from Monetary Policy Communications and Other Tools”) provides a quantitative assessment of 
unconventional measures, including the effects of fiscal policy actions.  

Given the severe deterioration in the economic outlook 
since the last Bluebook, the optimal control simulations  
presented in the current Bluebook show the federal funds  
rate falling to its lower bound early next year and remaining 
there beyond 2012.  These simulations presume that the  
channels of the monetary transmission mechanism are  
operating normally; but, as the solid lines in the figures  
illustrate, the lower bound imposes a considerable  
constraint on the ability of the optimal policy to provide  
enough stimulus to generate a robust recovery with  
a relatively quick return of inflation and unemployment  
to desired levels.   

This baseline policy exercise assumes that the Federal  
Reserve does not undertake unconventional policies  
beyond those already incorporated in the Greenbook  
forecast.  However, the exercise can be revised to take  
account of the estimated effects of a variety of  
unconventional monetary policy tools, including  
quantitative easing, targeted purchases of specific  
securities, and communication strategies aimed at  
influencing policy expectations.  Combining conventional 
optimal policy adjustments with these nontraditional policy 
responses should yield better outcomes for activity and  
inflation.1 

To illustrate such a possibility, the dashed red lines in the 
Figures show the effects on the optimal policy path and  
Economic   outcomes of assuming that the Federal Reserve 
engages   in more sustained nontraditional policy actions.  
In this particular simulation, it is assumed that the  
implementation of such a policy package would lower the  
level of nominal long-term interest rates —including  
Treasury rates, mortgage rates, and corporate bond rates— 
by about 100 basis points from 2009 to 2012, and 50 basis  
points  in 2013, relative to what would occur under conventional  
optimal policy.

Implications of Unconventional Policies for Optimal Monetary Policy (Cont.) 
 

 

 

The reduction in long-term rates boosts aggregate spending directly; it also provides further 
indirect stimulus through higher corporate equity prices and a lower foreign exchange value  
of the dollar.  In response, the unemployment rate runs ¼ to ½ percentage point below  
its path under conventional policy, and inflation does not fall quite as much.  These more 
favorable macroeconomic conditions, in turn, allow optimal monetary policy to begin to 
tighten at the end of 2012.  

The economic effects of this particular example of unconventional policies are modest, but 
the estimates are subject to considerable uncertainty.  First, it is possible that aggressive 
actions could, by easing investor concerns about the outlook, lower long-term private interest 
rates by even more than 100 basis points, although the degree of substitutability across 
Treasury and private securities is uncertain and smaller effects are also possible.  Second, these 
results are based on a model in which only financial variables respond directly to 
announcements about future policies; larger stimulative effects might be obtained if the 
expectations influencing spending decisions and wage-price setting, and not just those 
influencing financial markets, also responded fully to the implications of the nontraditional 
policy actions for future economic conditions.  Third, more pronounced results might be 
possible if the nontraditional policy actions were paired with a major fiscal stimulus.

(27) As depicted in Chart 9, the outcome-based policy rule prescribes a funds 

rate that drops to the 25-basis-point lower bound by 2009Q1 and stays there through 

2011 before steadily rising to about 3½ percent by the end of 2013.  The trajectory of 

the funds rate consistent with financial market quotes declines to below 0.50 percent 

during the first half of 2009 before rising to a plateau of about 2¼ percent starting in 

2011. 8  In contrast to FRB/US simulations with the outcome-based rule, information 

from financial markets indicates that investors see a relatively high likelihood of policy 

tightening by the end of 2009.9  As shown in the bottom panel of Chart 9, the near-

term prescriptions from both the 1993 and 1999 versions of the Taylor rules are 

significantly lower than those shown in the previous Bluebook, reflecting the weaker 

path for output and lower projected levels of inflation.  The 1993 Taylor rule 

prescribes setting the funds rate about 1½ percentage point lower than in October; 

both the first-difference rule and the 1999 Taylor rule prescribe setting the funds rate 

at its lower bound.  The near-term prescriptions from the 1993 Taylor rule are slightly 

higher than for the other rules because the 1999 Taylor rule and the first difference 

rule are a bit more sensitive to the output gap.  

                                           
8 The probability of low interest rates may be underestimated because the confidence 
intervals shown in the top right panel of Chart 9 are computed from interest rate caps with 
strike prices between 1 percent and 14 percent.  Interest rate caps with a strike price below 1 
percent are not currently traded. 
9 As noted earlier, given the uncertainty about the economic and financial outlook, reading 
policy expectations from federal funds futures and options is not straightforward.  In 
particular, the term premium may be larger than usual, which would imply that investors are 
expecting less policy tightening than what it is shown in Chart 9 (see box “Expected 
Softness in the Expected Federal Funds Rate”).

Policy Alternatives 

(28) This Bluebook presents four alternatives for the Committee’s consideration, 

summarized by the draft statements on the following pages.  In view of the sharp 

deterioration in the economic outlook, the proximity of the zero lower bound on 

nominal interest rates, and the unconventional policy actions that have already been 

announced, the content and structure of the proposed alternatives differ substantially 

from previous Bluebooks.  Under Alternative A, the Committee decides not to set a 

target for the federal funds rate, states that it anticipates that weak economic 

conditions are likely to warrant funds rates near zero for some time, and makes clear 

that its main policy tool going forward will be actions that make use of the Federal 

Reserve’s balance sheet.  Under Alternative B, the Committee instead announces a 

target range for the federal funds rate of 0 to ¼ percent and states that it will use all 

available tools to promote the resumption of sustainable economic growth and price 

stability.  Under Alternative C, the target rate is cut 50 basis points to ½ percent and 

the possibility of a further downward adjustment, should conditions warrant, is left 

open.  Under Alternative D, the federal funds rate target is left unchanged at 

1 percent under the view that recent policy actions should help promote acceptable 

economic growth over time; as in Alternative C, the possibility of future policy easing 

is left open.  In view of the large amounts of reserves being provided by the Federal 

Reserve’s various liquidity facilities, Alternatives C and D recognize that federal funds 

may trade below the target rate for at least some time.  All four alternatives 

acknowledge that economic activity appears to have slowed further since the last 

FOMC meeting.  Alternatives A, B, and C note that the Committee expects inflation 

to moderate in coming months and even sees some risk that inflation could drop 

below levels consistent with price stability; Alternative D uses the same language on 

inflation as the October statement.  To make clear that adjusting the funds rate is not 

the Federal Reserve’s only policy tool in a world of very low interest rates, all four

October FOMC Statement 

1.  The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to lower its target for the federal 
funds rate 50 basis points to 1 percent.  

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

2.  The pace of economic activity appears to have slowed markedly, owing importantly to 
a decline in consumer expenditures. Business equipment spending and industrial 
production have weakened in recent months, and slowing economic activity in many 
foreign economies is damping the prospects for U.S. exports. Moreover, the 
intensification of financial market turmoil is likely to exert additional restraint on 
spending, partly by further reducing the ability of households and businesses to obtain 
credit.  

3.  In light of the declines in the prices of energy and other commodities and the weaker 
prospects for economic activity, the Committee expects inflation to moderate in coming 
quarters to levels consistent with price stability. 

4.  Recent policy actions, including today’s rate reduction, coordinated interest rate cuts 
by central banks, extraordinary liquidity measures, and official steps to strengthen 
financial systems, should help over time to improve credit conditions and promote a 
return to moderate economic growth. Nevertheless, downside risks to growth remain. The 
Committee will monitor economic and financial developments carefully and will act as 
needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability. 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 34 of 60



 
 

 

   

 

 

 

 
 

Alternative A 

1.  Since the Committee’s last meeting, labor market conditions have deteriorated, and 
the available data indicate that consumer spending, business investment, and industrial 
production have declined.  Overall, the outlook for economic activity has weakened 
further. 

2.  Meanwhile, inflationary pressures have diminished quickly.  In light of the declines in 
the prices of energy and other commodities and the weaker prospects for economic 
activity, the Committee expects inflation to moderate in coming quarters and sees some 
risk that inflation could decline for a time below rates that best foster economic growth 
and price stability in the longer term.  [In support of its dual mandate, the Committee will 
seek to achieve a rate of inflation, as measured by the price index for personal 
consumption expenditures, of about 2 percent in the medium term.] 

3.  In current circumstances, the Committee judged that it was not useful to set a specific 
target for the federal funds rate.  As a result of the large volume of reserves provided by 
the Federal Reserve’s various liquidity facilities, the federal funds rate has declined to 
very low levels, and the Committee anticipates that weak economic conditions are likely 
to warrant federal funds rates near zero for some time.   

4.  The focus of policy going forward will be to continue to support the functioning of 
financial markets and stimulate the economy through open market operations and other 
measures that entail the use of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.  In particular, as 
previously announced, over the next few quarters the Federal Reserve will purchase large 
quantities of agency debt and mortgage-backed securities to provide support to the 
mortgage and housing markets, and it stands ready to expand its purchases of agency debt 
and mortgage-backed securities as conditions warrant.  The Committee is also evaluating 
the potential benefits of purchasing longer-term Treasury securities.  Early next year, the 
Federal Reserve will also implement the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility to 
facilitate the extension of credit to households and small businesses.  The Federal 
Reserve will continue to actively consider ways of using its balance sheet to further 
support credit markets and economic activity. 

5.  In related actions, the Board of Governors today approved a 75 basis point decrease in 
the primary credit rate to 1/2 percent and established interest rates on required and excess 
reserve balances of 1/4 percent.  In approving the reduction in the discount rate, the 
Board acted on requests submitted by the Federal Reserve Banks of . . .

Alternative B 

1.  The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to establish a target range for the 
federal funds rate of 0 to 1/4 percent.   

2.  Since the Committee’s last meeting, labor market conditions have deteriorated, and 
the available data indicate that consumer spending, business investment, and industrial 
production have declined.  Overall, the outlook for economic activity has weakened 
further. 

3.  Meanwhile, inflationary pressures have diminished quickly.  In light of the declines in 
the prices of energy and other commodities and the weaker prospects for economic 
activity, the Committee expects inflation to moderate in coming quarters and sees some 
risk that inflation could decline for a time below rates that best foster economic growth 
and price stability in the longer term. 

4.  The Federal Reserve will employ all available tools to promote the resumption of 
sustainable economic growth and to preserve price stability.   In particular, as previously 
announced, over the next few quarters the Federal Reserve will purchase large quantities 
of agency debt and mortgage-backed securities to provide support to the mortgage and 
housing markets, and it stands ready to expand its purchases of agency debt and 
mortgage-backed securities and as conditions warrant.  The Committee is also evaluating 
the potential benefits of purchasing longer-term Treasury securities.  Early next year, the 
Federal Reserve will also implement the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility to 
facilitate the extension of credit to households and small businesses.  The Federal 
Reserve continues to consider possible additions to and expansions of its liquidity 
facilities, as well as other means of using its balance sheet to further support credit 
markets and economic activity. 

5.  In a related action, the Board of Governors unanimously approved a 75-basis-point 
decrease in the discount rate to 1/2 percent. In taking this action, the Board approved the 
requests submitted by the Boards of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of . . .  The 
Board also established interest rates on required and excess reserve balances of 
1/4 percent.

Alternative C 

1.  The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to lower its target for the federal 
funds rate 50 basis points to ½ percent.   

2.  Reflecting in part the intensification of the financial strains earlier in the fall, the pace 
of economic activity has slowed further and the near-term outlook has worsened.  Labor 
market conditions have continued to deteriorate, and consumer spending, business 
investment, and industrial production have declined.  

3.  In light of the declines in the prices of energy and other commodities and the weaker 
prospects for economic activity, the Committee expects inflation to moderate in coming 
quarters and sees some risk that inflation could decline for a time below rates that best 
foster economic growth and price stability in the longer term. 

4.  In these circumstances, the Committee’s primary concern is the downside risks to the 
economy.  The Committee will monitor economic and financial developments carefully 
and will use all available tools to promote the resumption of sustainable economic growth 
and to preserve price stability.   

5.  In particular, as previously announced, over the next few quarters the Federal Reserve 
will purchase large quantities of agency debt and mortgage-backed securities to provide 
support to the mortgage and housing markets, and it stands ready to expand its purchases 
of agency debt and mortgage-backed securities as conditions warrant.  The Committee is

Federal Reserve continues to consider possible additions to and expansions of its liquidity 
facilities, as well as other means of using its balance sheet to further support credit 
markets and economic activity.

decrease in the discount rate to 1/2 percent. In taking this action, the Board approved the 
requests submitted by the Boards of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of . . .     

7. In view of the large volume of reserves provided by the Federal Reserve’s various 
liquidity facilities, the Committee recognizes that the federal funds rate is likely to 
average somewhat below the ½ percent target.

Alternative D 

1.  The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal 
funds rate at 1 percent.   

2.  Reflecting in part the intensification of the financial strains earlier in the fall, the pace 
of economic activity appears to have slowed further, and the near-term outlook for 
growth has deteriorated.  Moreover, the downside risks are significant.  However, policy 
actions taken in recent months, including reductions in short-term interest rates to very 
low levels, extraordinary liquidity measures, and official steps to strengthen the financial 
system, should help over time to improve credit conditions and promote a return to 
moderate economic growth.  As announced previously, the Federal Reserve will purchase 
a large volume of agency debt and mortgage-backed securities to provide support to the 
mortgage and housing markets and thus to broader economic activity.  Early next year, 
the Federal Reserve will also implement the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility 
to help facilitate the extension of credit to households and small businesses. 

3.  In light of the declines in the prices of energy and other commodities and the weaker 
prospects for economic activity, the Committee expects inflation to moderate in coming 
quarters to levels consistent with price stability. 

4.  In view of the large volume of reserves provided by the Federal Reserve’s various 
liquidity facilities, the Committee recognizes that the federal funds rate is likely to 
average significantly below the target rate for some time.  The Committee will monitor 
economic and financial developments carefully in light of recent policy actions and will 
act as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability. 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 38 of 60



   

alternatives point to the recent announcements that the Federal Reserve will purchase 

large volumes of agency debt and mortgage-backed securities and will implement the 

Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF).  Alternatives A, B, and C also 

explicitly refer to the possibility of further using the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet to 

support financial markets and economic activity, including by purchasing Treasury 

securities.   

(29)   If the Committee agrees that the economic outlook has deteriorated 

significantly since the October meeting and thinks that substantial monetary stimulus 

will be needed to support a recovery in economic activity, it may be inclined to favor 

Alternative A or Alternative B.  Members may be disappointed by a forecast, such as 

the one presented in this Greenbook, in which economic activity contracts severely 

this quarter and in the first half of next year and recovers only slowly after that, even 

with a federal funds rate at 25 basis points through 2010 and with substantial fiscal 

stimulus.  Accordingly, Committee members may feel that even stronger policy action 

than what is assumed in the Greenbook will be necessary to promote a return to 

sustainable economic growth.  Regarding the outlook for inflation, the Committee 

may be concerned that the projected sharp contraction in economic activity, coupled 

with the striking ongoing decline in the prices of energy and other commodities, may 

cause inflation to fall to an uncomfortably low level, perhaps even lower than 

projected in the staff forecast (as in the “Lower Inflation” alternative scenario in the 

Greenbook).  In these circumstances, Committee members may thus wish to take a 

bold action at this meeting to counter the risk of deflation, and they may also want to 

presage further expansions of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet. 

(30) Against this backdrop, the Committee may decide not to announce a target 

for the federal funds rate at this meeting and signal instead that its focus has shifted to 

the use of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet as an especially important policy tool 

going forward, as in Alternative A.  The Federal Reserve’s balance sheet has already 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 39 of 60



   

expanded considerably in recent months and will continue to expand in the immediate 

future as the Federal Reserve begins to purchase agency debt and mortgage-backed 

securities in volume, as already announced, and as the TALF becomes operational.  

Federal funds have often traded below 50 basis points since the October meeting 

even with the current target of 1 percent.  In the last week, with the anticipation of 

further policy easing at this meeting, federal funds have traded persistently below 

10 basis points.  Members may thus view a shift away from interest rate targeting and 

towards balance sheet management as essentially already under way.  Committee 

members may also be mindful that announcing a target that is not possible to achieve 

may create the impression that Federal Reserve policy is ineffective, even though 

powerful tools remain at the Committee’s disposal to address the deteriorating 

economic and financial situation.   

(31) One such tool is communication.  As incorporated in the third paragraph of 

Alternative A, the Committee could explicitly state that it anticipates that short-term 

interest rates will remain low for some time.   Members may be reluctant to enter into 

an unconditional commitment because they may feel that such a commitment would 

be too constraining should they need to tighten policy sooner than now expected.  To 

mitigate this concern, the Committee could phrase the commitment in implicitly 

conditional terms by indicating its anticipation that “weak economic conditions are 

likely to warrant federal funds rates near zero for some time,” as suggested in the 

statement accompanying Alternative A.10  In addition, if members were concerned 

that even increased use of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet as a policy tool and a 

                                           
10 The Committee may feel that a commitment that is conditioned on too precise a set of 
events may also be undesirable because, in the future, a need to tighten policy may arise well 
before those specific events materialize.  The proposed sentence makes clear in broad terms 
that the commitment is not unconditional (because the expectation of very low rates is based 
on “weak economic conditions”), but at the same time the condition is cast in terms broad 
enough that it likely will not constrain the Committee’s future decisions.  The length of the 
commitment (“for some time”) is described in similarly broad terms for the same reason. 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 40 of 60



   

commitment to keep interest rates low for some time might not be sufficient to 

counter deflationary pressures, the Committee could explicitly state, as indicated in 

the bracketed sentence, that it will seek to achieve a rate of inflation of about 

2 percent in the medium term, in order to buoy inflation expectations.  Higher 

inflation expectations, in turn, would reduce real interest rates and so support 

economic activity. 

(32) The statement suggested for Alternative A begins by acknowledging the 

further weakening of the outlook for economic activity rather than with a sentence 

about the federal funds rate.  This departure from the standard structure of the 

FOMC statement is intended both to emphasize that the focus of the Committee has 

shifted away from the target federal funds rate and to provide a clear rationale for that 

shift.  The second paragraph notes the weakening of inflationary pressures and the 

risk that inflation could decline for a time below rates that best foster economic 

growth and price stability.  As noted above, members may wish to conclude that 

paragraph with the sentence, “In support of its dual mandate, the Committee will seek 

to achieve a rate of inflation, as measured by the price index of personal consumption 

expenditures, of about 2 percent in the medium term.”  By using the words “seek to 

achieve” and “in the medium term,” the Committee would acknowledge that it may 

not be possible to maintain inflation at the desired level over the specified period, but 

the statement would nonetheless signal the Committee’s policy objective.  If members 

were uncomfortable with taking such a step at this meeting, they could simply omit 

that sentence from the statement.  The third paragraph notes the Committee’s 

decision not to set a specific target for the federal funds rate, acknowledges that the 

federal funds rate has already declined to very low levels, and states the expectations 

that federal funds rate will remain near zero for some time.  The statement goes on in 

paragraph 4 to indicate a shift of the Committee’s focus from the target rate to the use 

of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.  That paragraph repeats a number of measures 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 41 of 60



   

that have already been announced but not (or only partially) implemented, thereby 

emphasizing that a number of unconventional policy actions are already forthcoming, 

and foreshadows the possibility that the Federal Reserve will purchase longer-term 

Treasury securities if conditions warrant.  The intention to continue to actively 

consider policies that employ the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet is also explicitly 

stated in order to clarify that other tools could also be used if needed to support credit 

markets and economic activity.   

(33) While expectations of next week’s policy action are difficult to discern from 

market quotes because of the continued expected softness in the federal funds rate, 

the Desk’s survey suggests that most primary dealers see a 50 basis point reduction in 

the target federal funds rate as the most likely outcome of the December meeting, and 

that a majority sees ½ percent as the trough for the target federal funds rate this cycle.  

As a result, a decision to move away from interest rate targeting and to let federal 

funds fluctuate somewhere in the vicinity of the zero bound will likely surprise 

investors.  Short-term interest rates will decline, but probably not by much, 

considering that they are already very low and that federal funds are already trading at 

rates well below ¼ percent.  Stock prices may rise if investors read the decision to 

move away from targeting the level of the federal funds rate and concentrate on use 

of the balance sheet as underscoring the Federal Reserve’s determination to promote 

a rapid return to sustainable economic growth.  The foreign exchange value of the 

dollar will likely decline somewhat.  Judging from the Desk’s survey, some market 

participants may be surprised by the reference to unconventional policies in the 

statement.  And the indication that the federal funds rate could remain near zero for 

some time could lead investors to mark down their expected path for policy in 2009 

and beyond.  As a result of these influences, longer-term interest rates should move 

lower, although the size of that decline may be muted because the purchases of 

agency and mortgage-backed securities have already been announced and the 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 42 of 60



   

Chairman raised the possibility of purchases of large quantities of Treasury securities 

in a recent speech. 

(34) If the Committee shares the staff view that the economic outlook has 

deteriorated markedly and thinks that, given the circumstances, moving the federal 

funds rate near the zero bound on nominal interest rates is desirable, but it wants to 

continue to provide an explicit target for the federal funds rate, then it might choose 

to establish a target range of 0 to ¼ percent as in Alternative B.  Continuing to set a 

target that encompasses very low federal funds rates would not compromise the 

Committee’s ability to resort to unconventional policy measures.  In addition, some 

members may be concerned that switching to the use of the Federal Reserve’s balance 

sheet as its main policy tool could delay a return to a more conventional monetary 

policy based on interest rate targeting because some unconventional policy measures 

(such as the purchases of long-term assets) may not be easy or cheap to unwind 

quickly.  Consequently, members may feel that maintaining a target range, however 

low, could be desirable because it may make a return to more traditional monetary 

policy simpler and more straightforward once economic and financial conditions 

improve.  In addition, Committee members may see the maintenance of a federal 

funds target as advantageous from a governance perspective, since the determination 

of the target rate is a prerogative of the Committee, whereas the Committee and the 

Board both have separate authorities that can be used to affect the composition and 

size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet. 

(35) Achieving exactly a zero effective federal funds rate may be impossible since 

there would be no incentive for depository institutions to sell funds without 

compensation.  It may even be undesirable, given the strains that it could put on some 

financial institutions and financial markets.  On the other hand, members may feel 

that the direct monetary stimulus obtained by bringing the target rate to a very low 

but positive level, along with the increased flexibility thereby provided to use 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 43 of 60



   

nonconventional policy actions, outweighs the associated costs.  As in Alternative A, 

the Committee may also be concerned that the sharp contraction in economic activity 

and the steep declines in the prices of energy and other commodities may cause 

inflation to fall to an uncomfortably low level.  In such circumstances, conditional on 

their desire to maintain a federal funds rate target, Committee members may prefer to 

make that target as low as possible immediately, rather than making a more gradual 

adjustment, to counter the risk of further severe deterioration in economic and 

financial conditions.   

(36) The rationale section of the statement under Alternative B begins by noting 

the recent deterioration in economic conditions and in the outlook for economic 

activity.  The statement is also explicit as to the reduction in inflationary pressures and 

notes the risks that inflation could decline for a time below levels that best foster 

economic growth and price stability in the longer term.  The fourth paragraph makes 

clear the intention to use all tools at the Committee’s disposal to promote the 

resumption of sustainable economic growth and to preserve price stability.  Some of 

these tools—the already announced purchases of agency debt and mortgage-backed 

securities, the possible expansion of those purchases, the possibility of beginning to 

purchase longer-term Treasury securities, the implementation of the TALF, and the 

possible expansion of other types of liquidity provision and other means of using the 

Federal Reserve’s balance sheet—are also noted.     

(37) Given that most market participants appear to expect only a 50 basis point 

reduction in the target at this meeting, a decision to reduce it instead by at least 

75 basis points will come as surprise, but likely not a large one since some investors 

apparently anticipate that the target will be brought down to ¼ percent at the January 

meeting.  As a result, nominal interest rates would likely decline a little, stock prices 

may increase some, and the foreign exchange value of the dollar may decline 

modestly.  As in Alternative B, market participants may also be surprised by the 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 44 of 60



   

reference to unconventional policy measures, and medium- and long-term Treasury 

yields might edge lower.  

(38) The Committee may prefer Alternative C for a number of reasons.  

Members may feel that a substantial policy easing at this meeting is warranted in 

response to the sharp deterioration of the economic outlook in recent weeks.  A 

50 basis point cut in the target rate at this meeting may be seen as appropriate, 

considering that policy has been eased substantially over the last year, that a number 

of extraordinary liquidity measures have been put in place or are in train, and that 

mortgage rates have already dropped appreciably in light of the Federal Reserve’s 

recently announced program to purchase agency debt and mortgage-backed securities.  

The Committee may wish to give the stimulus produced by the combination of all 

these policies a chance to show its effects, while at the same time leaving open the 

possibility of a further reduction in the target rate and the implementation of more 

unconventional policy actions should macroeconomic conditions fail to improve.  A 

reduction in the target rate to ½ percent that is matched by a comparable reduction in 

the interest rate on excess reserves would likely cause federal funds to trade below the 

new target.  Even so, the Committee may still want to set a target of ½ percent to 

signal where it would want federal funds to trade once financial conditions begin to 

improve, some Federal Reserve programs are unwound, and the amount of excess 

reserves in the system returns to a more normal level.   

(39) Alternatively, members may feel that quite forceful policy action is required 

to counter the sharp deterioration in the economic outlook but at the same time be 

unwilling to lower the target rate below 50 basis points.  Members’ reluctance to move 

to an extremely low target federal funds rate may stem from concerns about the 

potential for adverse consequences on various financial markets and institutions that 

such a move could engender.  Such a concern may be reinforced by the likelihood that 

federal funds will trade below the new target until improved financial conditions allow 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 45 of 60



   

a substantial reduction in excess reserves in the financial system.  Members may also 

be worried that a very low target for the federal funds rate may itself lead to 

undesirable increases in inflation expectations.  The Committee may thus view 

½ percent as a floor for the target federal funds rate and may wish to apply any 

further monetary stimulus exclusively through unconventional policies, such as 

purchases of agency and mortgage-backed securities or Treasury securities.  

(40) As a third motivation for favoring Alternative C, members may view a 

decision to reduce the target rate by 50 basis points as an intermediate step towards 

reaching a level of rates closer to the zero bound at a later date.  Such an approach 

would be consistent with the staff’s assumption in the Greenbook projection, the 

prescriptions of a number of policy rules, and the optimal control simulations with an 

inflation target of either 1½ or 2 percent described in the monetary policy strategies 

section of this Bluebook.   Even if members are not concerned that a sustained 

environment of very low interest rates will be particularly harmful to certain financial 

markets and institutions, they may still believe that making the move toward the zero 

bound in two steps would be preferable on the grounds that it would allow market 

participants more time to adjust to a world of near-zero interest rates.  In addition, the 

Committee may feel that such a gradual approach would not be overly costly in terms 

of its macroeconomic objectives since further monetary stimulus could be provided 

through additional unconventional policy measures.  Finally, an inclination to ease 

policy 50 basis points at this meeting might be reinforced by the fact that most market 

participants appear to expect a 50 basis point reduction in the target rate, and 

Committee members might be reluctant to inject further uncertainty into financial 

markets at a time when markets remain extremely fragile. 

(41) The rationale section of the statement accompanying Alternative C begins 

by acknowledging that economic activity is contracting in the fourth quarter and by 

pointing to deterioration in labor markets, household and business spending, and 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 46 of 60



   

industrial production.  The paragraph on inflation reiterates, as in October, that the 

Committee expects inflation to moderate because of the weaker economic outlook 

and the decline in the prices of energy and other commodities, but also, as in 

Alternatives A and B, that there are risks that inflation will fall to rates below those 

that would best foster economic growth and price stability.  The next paragraph 

makes clear that downside risks to the economy are the Committee’s primary concern 

and indicates that the Committee “will use all its available tools to promote the 

resumption of economic growth and to preserve price stability.”  This wording is 

intended to leave the door open to, but not promise, a further reduction in the target 

rate if conditions warrant, while at the same time making it clear that unconventional 

policy actions are also available.  Some of these actions, including the possibility that 

existing programs may be expanded or new programs may be implemented if 

appropriate, are cited in the next paragraph.  If the Committee viewed Alternative C 

as a stepping stone to an even lower target federal funds rate, it may wish to add a 

sentence to signal more clearly to market participants that a further reduction in the 

target rate may be forthcoming.  For example, the fourth paragraph of the statement 

could conclude by saying that, “The Committee will consider whether further 

reductions in the target federal funds rate would be beneficial in light of evolving 

circumstances.”  On the other hand, if the Committee sees ½ percent as a floor below 

which it is not likely to push the target rate, it may also wish to make its thinking more 

explicit, for example by adding the clause “Although the Committee believes that 

further reductions in the target federal funds rate would not be beneficial on balance” 

immediately before the indication that the Committee will use all of its available tools 

(which in this case would be referred to as “all other available tools”).  The statement 

concludes with an acknowledgement that federal funds may trade below the target, 

given the large amounts of excess reserves in the system. 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 47 of 60



   

(42) Since most primary dealers see a 50 basis point policy easing as the most 

likely outcome at this meeting, and since a majority see ½ percent as the trough for 

the target federal funds rate this cycle, the market reaction to an announcement like 

that for Alternative C is likely to be muted, with short-term interest rates, equity 

prices, and the foreign exchange value of the dollar all changing little.  The 

movements in these variables may be a bit more pronounced if the Committee 

decided to be more explicit regarding its proclivity to move the target rate lower in the 

future because the uncertainty as to the floor for the target would be removed; any 

such move, however, is not likely to be major, partly because market participants may 

expect federal funds to trade quite soft to the target in any case.  As in Alternative B,  

longer-term interest rates may decline a little, but probably not by much, because 

investors may be somewhat surprised by the language on the use of the Federal 

Reserve’s balance sheet as a means of further supporting credit markets and economic 

activity. 

(43) If the Committee’s view of the economic outlook is appreciably more 

optimistic than the staff’s, and, in particular, if members believe that past policy 

actions, along with those announced but not yet implemented, will be sufficient to 

return the economy to a path of moderate economic growth before too long, the 

Committee may wish to leave the target rate unchanged at this meeting as in 

Alternative D.  Committee members may have a somewhat more upbeat outlook for 

2009 and 2010 that the staff and may believe, for example, that the recovery from the 

present recession, starting in the second half of next year, will be more robust than 

anticipated by the staff, as in the “faster recovery” alternative scenario in the 

Greenbook.  In addition, the Committee may think that the policy actions taken 

recently not only by the Federal Reserve but also by other foreign central banks, the 

Congress, the Treasury, and the FDIC (including the reduction in policy rates to very 

low levels, purchases of agency debt and mortgage-backed securities, extraordinary 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 48 of 60



   

liquidity measures, official steps to strengthen the financial system, and fiscal stimulus) 

should be given a chance to work, and that their combined effect could potentially be 

very large.  Indeed members may be mindful that the extent and timing of some of 

those policies, such as the fiscal package that will ultimately be passed by the 

Congress, is still unknown.  The fiscal package may well turn out to be larger, or 

implemented sooner, than currently assumed in the staff forecast.  (The “bigger fiscal 

package” scenario in the Greenbook illustrates this possibility.)  With that upside risk 

in mind, the Committee may want to pause at least at this meeting and see whether 

the economy will show some signs of recovery as these policies begin to take effect.  

The Committee may also anticipate that, although federal funds are likely to continue 

to trade below target for a time because of the large amounts of excess reserves 

currently in the system, an unchanged federal funds rate target provides a better signal 

of its policy intentions.  The Committee may believe that, over time, existing liquidity 

facilities can be scaled back or eliminated, allowing the federal funds rate to converge 

back to its target level.  Alternatively, members may feel that bringing the target to an 

unprecedented low level may increase uncertainty, further compromise market 

functioning, decrease confidence, perhaps boost inflation expectations, and so 

ultimately be counterproductive.  Members may also want to preserve some room to 

lower the target rate at a later date in order to bolster confidence should further 

negative shocks hit the economy. 

(44) The rationale portion of the statement accompanying Alternative D 

acknowledges that the pace of economic activity appears to have slowed further and 

that the near-term outlook has deteriorated.  However, the statement notes that the 

Committee expects the recent policy measures to improve credit conditions and 

promote a return to moderate growth over time.  To underscore that the Federal 

Reserve has already taken concrete actions in response to the deterioration in the 

outlook, the remaining part of that paragraph notes that the Federal Reserve will 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 49 of 60



   

purchase large amounts of agency and mortgage-backed securities and will implement 

the TALF early next year.  The language on inflation remains unchanged from the 

October meeting, and the last paragraph acknowledges, as in Alternative C, that 

federal funds may continue to trade below the target for some time.  The statement 

concludes by noting that the Committee will monitor economic and financial 

developments and will act as needed to promote its statutory objectives.  That 

declaration, together with the indication of downside risks to the outlook, would likely 

be seen as signaling that the Committee is open to further reduction in the target rate 

at upcoming meetings if conditions warrant. 

(45) Given current expectations, market participants would likely be extremely 

surprised if the Committee were to leave the target rate unchanged.  Short-term 

interest rates would probably back up somewhat, although the extent of the increase 

would likely be moderated by recognition that federal funds would continue to trade 

below target for some time.  Equity prices would drop, and the dollar would 

appreciate.  The absence of any reference to additional means of using the Federal 

Reserve balance sheet to improve credit and liquidity conditions would likely induce 

investors to reconsider their views of the likelihood of further purchases of assets by 

the Federal Reserve, and medium- and longer-term yields would probably move 

notably higher.  Overall, volatility and strains in financial markets would likely 

increase. 

Money and Debt Forecasts 

(46) The staff forecast for M2 has changed little since October.  After expanding 

at a 7½ percent rate this year, boosted by the decline in short-term rates and the 

associated drop in the opportunity cost of holding M2 assets, M2 growth is projected 

to slow to about 3 percent in 2009 as nominal GDP growth falls and opportunity cost 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 50 of 60



   

begins to rise.  In 2010, M2 is anticipated to grow at roughly the same rate as in 2009 

and about in line with nominal GDP.   

(47) Amid sharply curtailed mortgage and consumer credit, household debt is 

expected to decline about 1 percent in 2009 and to rise just a little in 2010 as credit 

constraints ease only gradually.  Even though overall credit conditions are expected to 

ease over time, nonfinancial business debt will likely expand at a weak pace next year 

and in 2010, as capital spending will remain sluggish.  Federal debt, which has surged 

in the second half of 2008 because of government programs aimed at addressing 

financial market strains, is anticipated to continue to grow at a rapid pace throughout 

the forecast period.  Overall, total domestic nonfinancial debt is projected to expand 

4½ percent in 2009 and 4¼ percent in 2010.

Alternatives for the Directive 

(48) Federal funds have traded predominantly around or below ½ percent since 

the October meeting even with a target rate of 1 percent.  Given the provision of 

large amounts of excess reserves through the liquidity programs that the Federal 

Reserve has put in place in recent months, and with balance sheet constraints that 

prevent many depository institutions from exploiting the arbitrage between low 

federal funds rates and higher interest rates on excess reserves, the funds rate has 

fallen well short of the target set by the Committee, as discussed in more detail in the 

“Recent developments in the federal funds market” box.  As noted earlier, the 

proposed statement for Alternatives C and D acknowledge that the same will likely be 

true in the future, at least so long as the amount of excess reserves in the system 

remains elevated.  If the Committee wanted to maintain a target, potential steps to 

soak up excess reserves, short of drastically reducing the size of existing liquidity 

facilities and currency swap agreements with foreign central banks—an option that 

the Committee presumably would find unappealing—include, in principle, financing 

existing and potential new liquidity facilities by issuing Federal Reserve bills or by 

expanding the Special Financing Program (SFP) and thus the size of the Treasury 

balance at the Federal Reserve.  However, the former measure would require 

authorization by the Congress, and the Treasury is unlikely to take the latter step in 

the near term because of possible debt-ceiling constraints.  Indeed, concerns about 

the debt ceiling have led the Treasury to reduce over recent weeks the size of the SFP 

and the associated balances placed at the Federal Reserve.  A possible alternative 

would be for the Federal Reserve to offer depository institutions a term deposit 

facility in which they could place funds for fixed periods of time and earn interest at a 

rate above that paid on excess reserves.  Balances placed under this facility would not 

count toward reserve requirements and could not be accessed before their maturity.  

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 53 of 60



   

The staff has begun to develop plans for such a facility, but its likely effectiveness in 

putting upward pressure on the federal funds rate is unclear. 

(49) If the Committee wants to keep a target for the federal funds rate of either 

½ percent as in Alternative C or 1 percent as in Alternative D, and agrees that the 

options available to drain reserves from the system and enable the Desk to meet the 

target are either unlikely to materialize or are likely to be otherwise undesirable, it may 

wish to change the wording of its directive to the Desk to recognize that it does not 

expect the target to be consistently met given the circumstances.  The Committee may 

wish to include in the directive a sentence similar to that in the public statements that 

will accompany the policy decisions and explicitly indicate that it recognizes that the 

federal funds rate may tend to trade below the new target.  If it were to choose 

Alternative C, the Committee may also want to direct the Desk to purchase 

$100 billion in housing-related GSE debt and up to $500 billion in agency-guaranteed 

MBS, as already announced, and to do so by the end of the second quarter of next 

year to provide a more specific time frame than the “several quarters” indicated in the 

November 25 press release.  Such a directive is not included under Alternative D 

because if the Committee were optimistic enough about the outlook to select that 

alternative, it might not want the desk to complete the full amount of the announced 

purchases.   

(50) Under Alternative B, the Committee would direct the Desk to seek 

conditions in reserve markets consistent with federal funds trading in a range of 0 to 

¼ percent.  It may also want to direct the Desk to purchase GSE debt and agency-

guaranteed MBS over the next intermeeting period, but to leave the Desk ample 

latitude to vary the timing and pace of such purchases depending on conditions in the 

market for such securities and on broader mortgage market and housing sector 

conditions.  The Committee may want to reiterate the limits that have already been 

announced for such purchases.   

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 54 of 60



   

(51) If the Committee decides not to set a target at all, as in Alternative A, it 

could specify to the Desk that it has suspended setting a target and that it anticipates 

that the reserve conditions associated with its open market operations and the 

liquidity programs put in place by the Federal Reserve will result in federal funds rates 

near zero.  It may also direct the desk to purchase GSE debt and agency-guaranteed 

MBS over the next intermeeting period, as under Alternative B, and subject to the 

same limits. 

(52) Draft language for the directives is provided below. 

Directive Wording 

Alternative A:  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and 

financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable 

growth in output.  Over the intermeeting period, the Committee directs the 

Desk to purchase GSE debt and agency-guaranteed MBS, with the aim of 

providing support to the mortgage and housing markets.  The timing and pace 

of these purchases should depend on conditions in the markets for such 

securities and on a broader assessment of conditions in primary mortgage 

markets and the housing sector.  By the end of the second quarter of next year, 

the Desk is expected to purchase up to $100 billion in housing-related GSE 

debt and up to $500 billion in agency-guaranteed MBS.  The Committee has 

suspended setting a target for the federal funds rate, and it anticipates that the 

reserve conditions associated with its open market operations and the liquidity 

programs put in place by the Federal Reserve will result in federal funds rates 

near zero.

growth in output.  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee seeks 

conditions in reserve markets consistent with federal funds trading in a range of 

0 to ¼ percent.  The Committee directs the Desk to purchase GSE debt and 

agency-guaranteed MBS during the intermeeting period with the aim of 

providing support to the mortgage and housing markets.  The timing and pace 

of these purchases should depend on conditions in the markets for such 

securities and on a broader assessment of conditions in primary mortgage 

markets and the housing sector.  By the end of the second quarter of next year, 

the Desk is expected to purchase up to $100 billion in housing-related GSE 

debt and up to $500 billion in agency-guaranteed MBS. 

Alternative C:  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and 

financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable 

growth in output.  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee has 

established a target for the federal funds rate of ½ percent.  In view of the large 

volume of reserves provided by the Federal Reserve's various liquidity 

programs, the Committee recognizes that the federal funds rate is likely to 

average somewhat below the ½ percent target rate.  The Committee directs the 

Desk to purchase GSE debt and agency-guaranteed MBS during the 

intermeeting period with the aim of providing support to the mortgage and 

housing markets.  The timing and pace of these purchases should depend on 

conditions in the markets for such securities and on a broader assessment of 

conditions in primary mortgage markets and the housing sector.  By the end of 

the second quarter of next year, the Desk is expected to purchase up to 

$100 billion in housing-related GSE debt and up to $500 billion in agency-

guaranteed MBS.

Alternative D:  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and 

financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable 

growth in output.  The Committee has maintained its target for the federal 

funds rate at 1 percent, but in view of the large volume of reserves provided by 

the Federal Reserve's various liquidity programs, the Committee recognizes that 

the federal funds rate is likely to average somewhat below the 1 percent target 

rate.

Appendix A: Measures of the Equilibrium Real Rate 
 

 

 

   
Measure Description 

Single-equation 
Model  

The measure of the equilibrium real rate in the single-equation model is based on an 
estimated aggregate-demand relationship between the current value of the output gap and 
its lagged values as well as the lagged values of the real federal funds rate. 

Small Structural 
Model 

The small-scale model of the economy consists of equations for six variables: the output 
gap, the equity premium, the federal budget surplus, the trend growth rate of output, the 
real bond yield, and the real federal funds rate. 

Large Model 
(FRB/US) 

Estimates of the equilibrium real rate using FRB/US—the staff’s large-scale econometric 
model of the U.S. economy—depend on a very broad array of economic factors, some of 
which take the form of projected values of the model’s exogenous variables. 

Greenbook-
consistent  

The FRB/US model is used in conjunction with an extended version of the Greenbook 
forecast to derive a Greenbook-consistent measure.  FRB/US is first add-factored so that 
its simulation matches the extended Greenbook forecast, and then a second simulation is 
run off this baseline to determine the value of the real federal funds rate that closes the 
output gap. 

TIPS-based 
Factor Model 

Yields on TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) reflect investors’ expectations of 
the future path of real interest rates, but also include term and liquidity premiums.  The 
TIPS-based measure of the equilibrium real rate is constructed using the seven-year-ahead 
instantaneous real forward rate derived from TIPS yields as of the Bluebook publication 
date.  This forward rate is adjusted to remove estimates of the term and liquidity 
premiums based on a three-factor arbitrage-free term-structure model applied to TIPS 
yields, nominal yields, and inflation.  Because TIPS indexation is based on the total CPI, 
this measure is also adjusted for the medium-term difference—projected at 40 basis 
points—between total CPI inflation and core PCE inflation. 

 
 

The equilibrium real rate is the real federal funds rate that, if maintained, would be projected to return 
output to its potential level over time.  The short-run equilibrium rate is defined as the rate that would 
close the output gap in twelve quarters given the corresponding model’s projection of the economy.   
The medium-run concept is the value of the real federal funds rate projected to keep output at potential 
in seven years, under the assumption that monetary policy acts to bring actual and potential output into 
line in the short run and then keeps them equal thereafter.  The TIPS-based factor model measure 
provides an estimate of market expectations for the real federal funds rate seven years ahead.  

The actual real federal funds rate is constructed as the difference between the nominal rate and realized 
inflation, where the nominal rate is measured as the quarterly average of the observed federal funds rate, 
and realized inflation is given by the log difference between the core PCE price index and its lagged 
value four quarters earlier.  For the current quarter, the nominal rate is specified as the target federal 
funds rate on the Bluebook publication date.  For the current quarter and the previous quarter, the 
inflation rate is computed using the staff’s estimate of the core PCE price index. If the upcoming FOMC 
meeting falls early in the quarter, the lagged inflation measure ends in the last quarter.   

Confidence intervals reflect uncertainties about model specification, coefficients, and the level of 
potential output.  The final column of the table indicates the values published in the previous Bluebook.

Estimates of the real federal funds rate depend on the proxies for expected inflation used.  The table 
below shows estimated real federal funds rates based on lagged core PCE inflation, the definition used 
in the Equilibrium Real Federal Funds Rate chart; lagged four-quarter headline PCE inflation; and 
projected four-quarter headline PCE inflation beginning with the next quarter.  For each estimate of the 
real rate, the table also provides the Greenbook-consistent measure of the short-run equilibrium real rate 
and the average actual real federal funds rate over the next twelve quarters.

Appendix B: Analysis of Policy Paths and Confidence Intervals 

Rule Specifications:  For the following rules, it denotes the federal funds rate for quarter t, while  
the explanatory variables include the staff’s projection of trailing four-quarter core PCE inflation (πt), 
inflation two and three quarters ahead (πt+2|t and πt+3|t), the output gap in the current period and one 
quarter ahead ( y y *t t−  and y y *t t+ +1| − t 1|t ), and the three-quarter-ahead forecast of annual average GDP 
growth relative to potential (Δ −4 4y y *t t+ +3| Δ t 3|t ), and π *  denotes an assumed value of policymakers’ 

 

 

 

long-run inflation objective.  The outcome-based and forecast-based rules were estimated using real-
time data over the sample 1988:1-2006:4; each specification was chosen using the Bayesian information 
criterion. Each rule incorporates a 75 basis point shift in the intercept, specified as a sequence of  
25 basis point increments during the first three quarters of 1998.  The first two simple rules were 
proposed by Taylor (1993, 1999).  The prescriptions of the first-difference rule do not depend on 
assumptions regarding r* or the level of the output gap; see Orphanides (2003). 

Outcome-based rule it =  1.20it-1–0.39it-2+0.19[1.17  + 1.73 πt  + 3.66( *t ty y− )  – 2.72( *1 1t ty y− −− )]

Forecast-based rule it =  1.18it-1–0.38it-2+0.20[0.98 +1.72 πt+2|t+2.29( *1| 1|t t t ty y+ +− )–1.37( *1 1t ty y− −− )]

Taylor (1993) rule it = 2 + πt + 0.5(πt – *π ) + 0.5( *t ty y− ) 

Taylor (1999) rule it = 2 + πt + 0.5(πt – *π ) + ( *t ty y− ) 

First-difference rule it = it-1 + 0.5(πt+3|t – *π ) + 0.5( 4 4 *3| 3|t t t ty y+ +Δ − Δ ) 

FRB/US Model Simulations:  Prescriptions from the two empirical rules are computed using dynamic 
simulations of the FRB/US model, implemented as though the rule were followed starting at this FOMC 
meeting.  The dotted line labeled “Previous Bluebook” is based on the current specification of the policy 
rule, applied to the previous Greenbook projection.  Confidence intervals are based on stochastic 
simulations of the FRB/US model with shocks drawn from the estimated residuals over 1986-2005.  
Information from Financial Markets:  The expected funds rate path is based on forward rate 
agreements, and the confidence intervals for this path are constructed using prices of interest rate caps. 
Near-Term Prescriptions of Simple Policy Rules:  These prescriptions are calculated using Greenbook 
projections for inflation and the output gap. Because the first-difference rule involves the lagged funds 
rate, the value labeled “Previous Bluebook” for the current quarter is computed using the actual value  
of the lagged funds rate, and the one-quarter-ahead prescriptions are based on this rule’s prescription for 
the current quarter.
