MONETARY AGGERGATES AND
MONEY MARKET CONDITIONS

Recent developments

(1) Late January data are still partially estimated, but there

appear to have been sizable shortfalls from the expected growth path for

the narrowly defined money supply (M1) in the last two weeks of the

month, as shown in the table on the following page. It now appears

that growth of the money stock for all of January was at about a 3 per

cent annual rate, below the 5-1/2 per cent rate projected at the time of

the last Committee meeting. In contrast to the shortfall in M1, more

broadly defined money supply (M2) increased somewhat more than expected

in January, as time and savings deposits other than large CD's grew

more rapidly in January than in December. The bank credit proxy grew

in January nearly as rapidly as expected at the last meeting.

(2) The sluggish January growth in the money supply occurred

despite efforts of the Trading Desk to achieve a faster rate of growth

by fostering easier money market conditions. For most of the period

since the last FOMC meeting, the daily effective Federal funds rate was

in a 3-7/8--4-1/4 per cent range, with heavy U.S. Government security

dealer positions built up in consequence of the refunding exerting some

upward pressure on the funds market. In the weeks immediately following

the last Committee meeting the Desk was aiming at a Federal funds rate

around 4-1/4 per cent, somewhat below the most typical rate prevailing

before the meeting. When the large shortfall of M1 below path for the

week of January 20 was finally confirmed (around January 28), the Federal

funds target was lowered to 4 per cent or a shade lower, and most recently,

with M1 data for the final week of January also coming in low, the target

was lowered to 3-3/4 per cent. In the latest two statement weeks, net

borrowed reserves averaged around $30 million and borrowing at the

Federal Reserve $320 million. This compares with $310 and $375 million,

respectively, for the preceding two statement weeks.

(3) The lower Federal funds rate in January, along with the

further cuts in the discount rate and in the commercial bank prime rate,

strengthened market expectations of further rate declines. In consequence,

seasonally enlarged flows of funds to banks and other financial institutions

were invested aggressively, and both short- and long-term market interest

rates dropped sharply. The 3-month Treasury bill, for example, was most

recently bid at around 4 per cent, about 65 basis points below its

level at the time of the meeting. Long-term rates are about 35-70 basis

points below levels at the time of the last meeting, after taking account

of the back-up in such yields over the past week.

(4) In the generally strong market environment, the Treasury's

quarterly financing operation, which included a pre-refunding of $13.5

billion of November 1971 and February 1972 maturities, was highly success-

ful. A total of $10.8 billion of the $19.5 billion of publicly held

eligible issues were exchanged, with $5.2 billion going into the new

4-1/2 year, 5-7/8 per cent note and $5.6 billion into the 7-year,6-1/4

per cent issue. Attrition on the $6.0 billion of February and March 1971



-4-

maturities totalled only $1.1 billion, or 18 per cent, despite the

absence of a short-term anchor issue in the refinancing. Most recently,

dealer positions in coupon issues maturing in more than a year totaled

$1.7 billion, although dealers have reported fairly good progress in

distributing their awards of about $1.1 billion of new issues.

Prospective developments

(6) The further shortfall of M 1 in January relative to FOMC

expectations indicates that a greatly accelerated rate of growth in M 1

will be required in February and March if the FOMC still wishes to attain

the March average level of the money stock that was targeted at the

previous two FOMC meetings. With January behind us, there is obviously

less time to make up a shortfall, and as a result a considerable amount

of reserves would have to be supplied over a relatively short period, with

a consequent sharp easing effect on money market conditions. A more

gradual make-up of recent shortfalls would require a less rapid provision

of reserves and less of an easing of money markets. Two alternatives for

making up the shortfall in M1 are indicated below in an effort to clarify

policy alternatives for the Committee. A third alternative, which

assumes no change from the money market conditions most recently prevail-

ing and involves no deliberate further effort to make up for past shortfalls

in M1, is presented at a later point.

(7) The table below summarizes two alternative paths for making

up the M1 shortfall. The first column--called alternative A--makes up the

shortfall by March and continues with a 6 per cent rate of growth in the

second quarter. The second column, alternative B, shows a path which does

not make up the shortfall by March; in other words, this alternative does

not retain as a target the March average level of M 1 set at the previous two

FOMC meetings. It does assume, however, that growth in M 1 would be greater

than 6 per cent in the second quarter as the shortfalls of the fourth

quarter and January are made up over a longer period. The particular path



would reach the same average level in June for M1 as indicated for

alternative A. And the growth rate over the 9 months from September

1970 to June 1971 would be just under 6 per cent. In either case the

growth rates for the second quarter and the June level could, of course,

be greater if the Committee should decide that a trend growth rate of

more than 6 per cent is desirable for the longer run.

1/ This growth rate is 8 per cent, rather than the 7-1/2 per cent of the

base, a somewhat higher growth rate is required to attain the previous
desired March level.

rates for all of the monetary aggregates that are believed to be consistent

10 per cent annual rate of growth in M1 for February and March together

--may entail a much lower Federal funds rate, perhaps ranging around 2-1/2

per cent, with the 3-month bill rate dropping to around 3 per cent. And

the net free reserve position of member banks is likely to average $150

million or a little more, as excess reserves build up, given the low interest

rates. It would be anticipated, however, that by early spring, the Federal

funds rate would have to rise rather sharply--to around 4-1/2 --5 per cent,

with a concurrent snapback in bill rates--as reserves are provided less

generously in order to move down to the assumed longer-run growth rate,

typified in alternative A by a 6 per cent growth in M1 for the second

quarter.

(10) Since the alternative B pattern of growth in monetary

aggregates involves a somewhat less rapid February--March annual growth

rate for M1 of 9 per cent, attainment of this rate would seem to

involve a smaller reduction in the Federal funds rate than under alterna-

tive A--perhaps a funds rate in a 3--3-1/2 per cent range--and a net free

reserve position of $50-$150 million. The accompanying drop in the 3-

month Treasury bill rate might be into a 3-1/4--3-3/4 per cent range.

Because of the more gradual approach to making up the shortfall in M1

under alternative B, a sizable later snapback in money market rates would

not be expected. Still, in early spring the Federal funds rate and the

bill rate might be somewhat above the upper end of these ranges as reserves

are adjusted to bring growth in M1 onto a 7 per cent growth path for the

second quarter as a whole.



-10-

(11) The weekly paths for the monetary aggregates that would

be consistent with the monthly patterns for alternatives A and B between

now and the next meeting are shown in the table on the next page.

(12) The rate of inflow of time deposits other than large

CD's is expected to slacken later in February and March, following the

unusually rapid growth of the previous two months. A number of banks

have adjusted downward interest rates offered on consumer-type time and

savings accounts. This tendency is likely to become more widespread,

especially under alternative A, and may serve, along with an increase of

consumer spending as projected in the Green Book, to moderate savings

inflows. However, given the very rapid growth in time and savings deposits

other than large CD's that has already occurred and taking account of the

expected increase in M1, the rate of growth in M2 (M1 plus time and savings

deposits other than large CD's) is expected to be a very sizable 16-1/2

per cent annual rate in the first quarter. Under alternative B, the rate

of growth in M2 would be expected to be only slightly less rapid than

under alternative A. These estimates of M2 behavior in the future are

highly problematical because of uncertainties about the timing and extent

of bank cuts in offering rates on consumer-type accounts and the effect

of this on savers in a period of declining market interest rates.

(13) Growth in the adjusted credit proxy (rates of growth

are shown for alternatives A and B in the table on p. 8) will be influenced

by continued more moderate growth in large negotiable CD's following the

sharp expansion of earlier months. Banks have dropped offering rates sharply,

and the spread of CD rates over bill rates has narrowed. A pick-up in busi-

ness loan demand might make banks more willing borrowers through CD's, but bank

liquidity is substantial enough so that they could easily accommodate

borrowers by diverting funds from securities. Bank-related commercial

paper is expected to continue running off at about the recent $50-$100

million per week rate. We have assumed only minor further declines in

Euro-dollar borrowings.

(14) The preceding discussion has indicated that the money market

would probably have to be eased significantly further in order to make up

for recent shortfalls in M1. The Committee, however, may wish to consider

a policy of stabilizing the money market at around recently prevailing

conditions, given the sizable growth in M2 and the adjusted credit proxy

and the recent sharp drop in interest rates. Prevailing money market

conditions can be taken to include a Federal funds rate around 3-3/4--4

per cent, which would reflect the most recent objectives of the Trading

Desk; the 3-month bill rate might be in a 3-3/4--4-1/4 per cent range.

Assuming such conditions are maintained, monetary aggregates for the

remainder of the first quarter and for the second quarter, as well as

weekly paths, are shown in the accompanying table.

(15) With a policy of keeping to prevailing money market

conditions, termed alternative C, M1 growth in the first quarter would

be at a 6 per cent annual rate and no pick-up from this rate would be

anticipated in the second quarter. Thus, if the staff is correct in

this projection, the shortfalls in M1 growth for the fourth quarter and

January would not be recovered. A relatively rapid M1 growth would,

however, be expected in February and March as the effects of recent

interest rate declines gradually have an impact on demand fbr money

and on the assumption that the staff projection of a rapid GNP growth

in the first quarter materalizes.

(16) With the money market unchanged from recent easier con-

ditions, long-term interest rates may show some further declines, on

balance, over the coming weeks, as the sizable corporate and municipal

calendar and the overhang of new Treasury financing issues is worked

off. If money market conditions ease further--as would appear to be

necessary under alternatives A and B--long-term yields could be expected

to decline more sharply as banks make further aggressive efforts to

attract corporate borrowers and as investors react in anticipating

further rate declines.

Possible directive language

(17) This section presents possible language for the second

paragraph of the directive for the three alternative policy courses

discussed above.

(18) Alternative A. As noted earlier, this alternative is

proposed for possible use if the Committee decides that the shortfall

in January from the path associated with its earlier first-quarter

target growth rate (which in itself allowed for a make-up of the short-

fall that occurred in the fourth quarter) is to be made up in the re-

maining part of the first quarter.

"To implement this policy, the Committee seeks to promote

accommodative ccnditions in credit markets; GREATER GROWTH IN

THE NARROWLY DEFINED MONEY STOCK, MAKING UP THE SHORTFALL

FROM THE DESIRED GROWTH PATH THAT HAS DEVELOPED: and [DEL: moderate]

CONTINUED SUBSTANTIAL expansion in OTHER monetary and credit

aggregates. System open market operations until the next

meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a view

to maintaining bank reserves and money market conditions

consistent with those objectives [DEL: taking account of the

forthcoming Treasury financing]."

The indicated language with respect to the aggregates (i.e., the

reference to the "narrowly defined money stock, ' followed by a separate

reference to "the other monetary and credit aggregates") is suggested

to make clear (1) that it is with respect to M1 that a shortfall is to

be made up, and (2) that the Committee is also taking account of the

behavior of key monetary aggregates other than M1.

(19) Alternative B. This alternative is proposed for possible

use if the Committee decides that past shortfalls are to be made up

over a period extending through the second quarter, and that the target

for growth of M1 in the first and second quarters should be set at 7

per cent. The Committee might choose such an approach in order to avoid

the type of "whipsawing' of money market conditions that paragraph (9)

suggests would be required to achieve annual rates of growth for M1 of

8 per cent in the first quarter and 6 per cent in the second quarter.

"To implement this policy, the Committee seeks to promote

accommodative conditions in credit markets, GREATER GROWTH IN THE

NARROWLY DEFINED MONEY STOCK, AND [DEL: moderate] CONTINUED RAPID expansion



-16-

in OTHER monetary and credit aggregates. System open market

operations until the next meeting of the Committee shall be

conducted with a view to maintaining bank reserves and money

market conditions consistent with those objectives [DEL: taking

account of the forthcoming Treasury financing]."

As will be noted, the language of alternative B differs from that of

alternative A only in the omission of the clause (following the reference

to the narrowly defined money stock) reading "making up the shortfall

from the desired growth path that has developed." Such a clause might

be considered unnecessary in this alternative in light of the extended

period over which the shortfall is to be made up.

(20) Alternative C. As will be noted, this alternative is

similar to the second paragraph of the directive issued by the Committee

on December 15, 1970. It is suggested for possible use if the Committee

decides not to seek to make up past shortfalls in M1 even over the more

extended time period, if doing so would require the degree of easing in

money market conditions suggested by the analysis in paragraphs (9) and

(10) above.

"To implement this policy, [DEL: the Committee seeks to promote

accommdative conditions in credit markets and moderate expansion in

monetary and credit aggregates.] System open market operations

until the next meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a

view to maintaining PREVAILING [DEL: bank reserves and money] market con-

ditions, [DEL: consistent with these objectives, taking account of the

forthcoming Treasury financing] PROVIDED THAT MONETARY AND CREDIT



-17-

AGGREGATES APPEAR TO BE EXPANDING AT LEAST AS FAST AS PROJECTED."

The Committee may wish to have the proviso clause interpreted in terms

of the projections of M1 (or of M1, M2, and the bank credit proxy)

shown in the table on p. 13, based on the assumption of a continuation

of prevailing money market conditions. The proviso clause--like that

in the December directive--is formulated in a manner that would permit

growth in the aggregates at rates higher than projected, but would call

for easing of money market conditions to make up any shortfalls from

projections associated with this alternative.
