text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) The System left the intended degree of reserve pressure

unchanged during the period since the FOMC meeting on September 27.

Apart from some tightness in the reserves market around the end of the

third quarter, federal funds traded close to their expected level of

4-3/4 percent and averaged 4.77 percent for the period as a whole.

The allowance for adjustment and seasonal borrowing was reduced $250

million in six steps during the intermeeting period to $225 million in

view of the typical autumn decline in the demand for seasonal credit

at the discount window. Actual borrowing averaged close to its

allowance over the period.

(2) Other interest rates rose appreciably over the intermeet-

ing period in response to economic data generally indicating sustained

momentum in aggregate demand, high levels of output relative to poten-

tial, and persistent signs of price pressures at early stages of pro-

duction. In light of these developments, market participants have

revised upward their expectations of monetary tightening as the expan-

sion proceeds. As to their near-term outlook, quotes on federal funds

futures, shown in the upper left-hand panel of Chart 1, suggest that

markets now incorporate noticeably higher federal funds rates than in

late September. Most short- and long-term term rates jumped 1/4

to 1/2 percentage point, bringing rates on thirty-year Treasuries

above 8 percent and yields on fixed-rate mortgages above 9 percent for

the first time since early 1992. The largest advances were registered

1. Quotes on federal funds futures and other short-term market
interest rates currently appear to incorporate moderate year-end
premiums.

at the two- to five-year maturities, a pattern that was reflected in a

bulge in forward rates over the next few years; for example, the one-

year forward rate at the three-year mark increased 60 basis points

while the one-year forward rate ten years out rose only 35 basis

points. This pattern suggests that some of the increase in market

yields represents higher real interest rates, reflecting market par-

ticipants' presumption that the unanticipated strength in spending

implies that monetary policy will need to lean harder against building

inflationary pressures than previously thought. Some of the run-up in

nominal rates also likely owed to increased inflation expectations,

though the evidence on this is mixed. Available measures of inflation

expectations based on surveys of households and business forecasters

have suggested no recent upward trend, and the price of gold has

fallen slightly. However, broad commodity price indexes have con-

tinued to move up on balance over the last several weeks, and the

foreign exchange value of the dollar came under renewed downward pres-

sure during the intermeeting period despite considerable increases in

nominal interest rates.

(3) After weakening over much of the period, the dollar's

exchange value recovered somewhat in November to end the period down,

on balance, 1 percent against the mark, 1/2 percent against the yen,

and 1/2 percent on a weighted-average basis. Although the dollar's

soft tone earlier appeared mostly to reflect the market's perception

of heightened inflation risks in the United States, some of the dol-

lar's weakness against the mark may have stemmed from a lessening of

political uncertainty in Germany with the Kohl coalition's reelection.

Short-term interest rates rose 15 basis points and long-term rates

edged lower in Germany; in Japan, short-term rates were about



unchanged while long-term rates rose 20 basis points. When the dollar

touched lows of DM1.4907 and Y96.12 on November 2, the Desk began to

intervene to buy dollars. On that day and the next, U.S. monetary

authorities purchased $1.3 billion against yen and an equal amount

against marks. That intervention seemed to support the dollar, per-

haps in part by reinforcing market expectations of an imminent

tightening of monetary policy. (Federal funds futures rates jumped a

few basis points during the intervention.) The dollar seemed to

receive a further boost from the U.S. election results and the release

of the PPI for October.

(4) Ml and M2 remained weak in October, mostly reflecting the

increase in market interest rates resulting from the tightening of

monetary policy this year. M2 contracted at a 1 percent annual rate

last month after falling in the previous two months and was at the

lower bound of its 1 to 5 percent annual range. Its Ml component

dropped at a 3-1/2 percent rate. Demand deposits have been depressed

by reduced compensating balance requirements, as earnings credit rates

have risen in response to climbing market rates, and by declines in

deposit balances associated with the plunge in mortgage refinancing

activity. Interest rates on other checkable and savings deposits,

including MMDAs, have responded sluggishly, and the resulting sharp

increase in the opportunity cost of these assets has apparently

prompted some depositors to shift funds into small time deposits and

money fund shares, where yields have risen more briskly.2  Noncom-

2. Other checkable deposits have also been reduced by a sweep-
account program introduced on a phased basis in recent months by

; through October, $2.2 billion

(Footnote continues on next page)



petitive tenders for Treasury securities have strengthened during the

year, indicating the attractiveness of direct holdings of open market

instruments relative to M2 assets. Nonetheless, even after taking

into account opportunity costs, the extent of the recent weakness in

M2 has been surprising, especially in view of a sharp drop-off of net

inflows into bond and stock mutual funds in recent weeks and the

persistent strength in spending indicators. 3

(5) M3, by contrast, was a bit stronger than was expected at

the time of the last FOMC meeting. This aggregate increased at a

3-1/2 percent annual rate in October, lifting it well within its

0 to 4 percent annual range. Banks continued to issue large CDs at a

fast clip to finance strong growth of loans and to replace a runoff in

nondeposit sources, which had been expanding rapidly earlier in the

year; banks also reduced their holdings of securities to fund loan

growth.

(6) Both nonfederal sector debt and total domestic nonfinan-

cial sector debt appear to have continued to expand at only a moderate

pace over the summer months and into October, despite continued easing

of credit availability at banks. Through September, total debt

increased at about a 5 percent rate from the fourth quarter of 1993,

leaving it in the lower half of its 4 to 8 percent monitoring range.

(Footnote continued from previous page)
of balances are estimated to have been shifted out of OCDs by this
program. Partly in association with the contraction in transaction
deposits, total reserves dropped at a 6-1/4 percent annual rate in
October. Growth of currency, however, rebounded from the more
moderate rates of August and September, boosting the expansion of the
monetary base to a 6-1/2 percent rate.

3. M2 plus bond and stock mutual funds is estimated to have been
about flat in October, bringing its expansion from the fourth quarter
of 1993 to 1-1/2 percent.



With long-term rates continuing to back up, bond issuance by corpora-

tions remained near the depressed third-quarter pace in October.

However, business borrowing from banks was robust last month and

commercial paper borrowing accelerated, partly to finance impending

mergers. Issuance of bonds by state and local governments also was

damped by higher interest rates, and outstanding tax-exempt debt is

estimated to have declined as a result of heavy retirements. In the

household sector, data from banks for October indicate that consumer

borrowing was again quite rapid; however, the limited information

available for home mortgage borrowing suggests a moderate pace of

activity. On the supply side of the credit markets, the most recent

survey of bank loan officers revealed a further easing of terms and

standards on business loans and increased willingness to extend credit

to consumers. In the open markets, quality spreads on lower-rated

corporate bonds and commercial paper have remained quite narrow even

as the general level of rates has backed up.

Policy Alternatives

(7) Two monetary policy alternatives for Committee considera-

tion are presented formally below. Alternative B would keep the

intended federal funds rate unchanged at 4-3/4 percent, in association

with retaining an allowance of $225 million for adjustment plus sea-

sonal borrowing at the discount window.4  Alternative C embodies a

50 basis point increase in the federal funds rate to 5-1/4 percent,

accomplished either by an equal rise in the discount rate to 4-1/2

percent with the borrowing allowance kept at $225 million or by an

increase in the borrowing allowance to $275 million at the current

discount rate of 4 percent. A still larger increase in the federal

funds rate than envisioned under alternative C is also discussed.

(8) The staff economic forecast assumes that a relatively

steep upward trajectory for the federal funds rate over coming months

will be necessary to restrain inflation next year. The Committee is

assumed to raise the federal funds rate 150 basis points by the spring

of next year and to keep it at that 6-1/4 percent level through most

of 1995. In conjunction with the earlier policy tightenings, this

path is seen as engendering financial conditions sufficiently restric-

tive to hold the growth of aggregate demand below that of potential

real GDP over next year and into 1996. The resulting return of the

unemployment rate to a level above its estimated natural rate of 6

percent or so will tend to reverse an incipient acceleration of infla-

tion and thereby keep any near-term inflationary uptick from becoming

embedded in the expectations that enter into wage- and price-setting

decisions. Market participants appear to have a trajectory for the

4. Further downward technical adjustments to the allowance can be
anticipated over the intermeeting period as demands for seasonal
credit continue to approach their normal trough early next year.



federal funds rate roughly similar to the staff's assumption built

into short-term spot rates and futures quotes through next spring. In

contrast to the staff assumption, however, rates further out the term

structure can be read as suggesting expectations of additional tight-

ening.

(9) Choice of the unchanged policy of alternative B might be

based on the judgments that most of the effects of previous increases

in interest rates are still in the pipeline, that convincing signs of

higher inflation have not yet appeared, and that under these circum-

stances the Committee can await evidence indicating whether the

effects of previous monetary tightening will be sufficient to restrain

spending adequately. The weakness in the monetary aggregates and

moderate expansion of overall measures of credit may be seen as

offering support for the view that financial conditions are not con-

ducive to a sustained pickup in inflation. Indeed, even without

another tightening move, M2 seems likely to come in just below the

1 percent lower bound of its annual growth range this year and M1 to

come in at only 2 percent.

(10) Market expectations are for substantial increases in the

funds rate over the balance of the year. Opinions reportedly have

coalesced around either increases of 50 basis points at both the

November and December FOMC meetings, or a 75 basis point increase at

the November meeting, which would reduce the odds of a further policy

tightening this year. Thus, the absence of a tightening move at this

meeting would catch market participants off guard. Heightened con-

cerns that the Federal Reserve would not move sufficiently to contain

inflation would generate a further depreciation of the foreign

exchange value of the dollar, and probably induce a significant



selloff in note and bond markets. Some decrease in short-term inter-

est rates might accompany the decision not to adjust policy at this

meeting, although a sense that tightening action could be postponed

only for a short time would limit the decline.

(11) The 50 basis point rise in the funds rate under alterna-

tive C could be favored on the grounds that the incoming data on

economic activity again have been stronger than expected. With the

economy perhaps overshooting its potential rather than settling into a

"soft landing," the risks of an associated future pickup in inflation

pressures would seem to have increased. A 1/2 point move in the

federal funds rate, perhaps accompanied by an equal increment to the

discount rate, could be seen as keeping pace with the need for policy

firming in a deliberate manner consistent with the size and frequency

of recent policy actions. The resulting real federal funds rate would

be a bit above its long-run average, but restraint of at least this

magnitude might be appropriate in light of the current pressure on

capacity and the stimulative effects of the drop in the dollar and the

easing of terms and standards of bank lending.

(12) With market participants generally appearing to have

built in a move of at least this size, interest rates could exhibit

little initial reaction to the implementation of alternative C. The

receipt of information on output and price developments over the

intermeeting period along the lines of the relatively robust Greenbook

forecast might reinforce the market's perception that additional

System tightening is required, and interest rates could edge higher

later in the period. The foreign exchange value of the dollar could

remain around recent trading levels if nominal interest rates move



-10-

sufficiently higher to offset the effects of a heightened sense of

potential inflationary pressures.

(13) The Committee might wish to consider an even more sub-

stantial tightening of reserve market conditions--for example, on the

order of 75 basis points. This step could be judged as more suited to

the strength of the emerging threat that the economy may be overshoot-

ing its potential, setting in motion a gradual self-reinforcing pro-

cess of increasing inflation. Under these circumstances, a more

decisive move toward restraint would be needed to avoid an upward

ratcheting of inflation. Market sentiment has deteriorated during the

hiatus in policy tightening, judging by the rise in bond yields and

weakness in the exchange value of the dollar. By more clearly notch-

ing up monetary policy to a firmer posture, a larger step might better

assure market participants that the Federal Reserve was acting force-

fully enough to head off future inflation and might forestall the

perceived need on the part of the market participants for another

tightening move this year. If so, the action could spur a near-term

rally in bond markets and strengthen the dollar. Some increases in

very short-term market interest rates would likely result, of course,

from the somewhat larger-than-expected rise in the funds rate, and

banks could immediately raise their prime rate by a comparable amount.

(14) With regard to credit flows over coming months, the

staff sees continued moderate expansion and perhaps some slowing in

the pace at which bank lending terms are being eased. The debt of

domestic nonfinancial sectors is expected to grow during the fourth

quarter at near the same 5 percent pace averaged over the first three

quarters of the year. In the first quarter of next year, overall debt

is projected to edge up to a 5-1/4 percent rate of growth, owing to a



-11-

step-up in federal borrowing. Nonfederal debt growth is likely to

about maintain its pace of earlier this year, remaining somewhat below

the projected growth of nominal GDP. Nonfederal debt growth will

probably continue to be led by the household sector, although expan-

sion of home mortgage and consumer debt is likely to edge lower over

the next two quarters. In the corporate sector, by contrast, some

pickup in credit market borrowing may be in the offing, reflecting a

further widening in the financing gap as spending for fixed capital

and inventories increases relative to internal sources of funds. The

financing mix should remain heavily weighted toward bank loans and

short-term paper, with bond issuance staying depressed. Anecdotal

reports of recent resistance by banks to pressures for further reduc-

tions in lending spreads, along with concerns about credit quality

expressed by regulators, suggest that credit terms and standards may

not be easing quite so rapidly over coming months.

(15) Forecasted growth rates of the monetary aggregates from

October to March and from the fourth quarter of this year through

March under both policy alternatives are shown below.5  (More

detailed data appear on the table and charts on the following pages.)

Under alternative B, offering rates through the first quarter would

continue to adjust upward in the face of steady money market rates.

As a result, retail deposit inflows are projected to strengthen

gradually, yielding growth rates for M2 of 1 percent over the October

to March interval and 1-1/2 percent from the fourth quarter of 1994 to

March. The resumption of quarterly average growth, at a 1 percent

rate in the first quarter, combined with a projected slowing of

5. Because no further policy moves are presumed to occur under
alternatives B and C after the November FOMC meeting, these growth
rates are stronger than those consistent with the Greenbook forecast.



-12-

nominal GDP, would be associated with a reduced growth rate of 4-3/4

percent of M2 velocity, down from a projected increase of 7-1/4 per-

cent in the fourth quarter. M1 is projected to decline at a 1 percent

rate from October to March under alternative B, as currency flows

abroad remain robust but demand and other checkable deposits continue

to decline. The staff does not expect banks to continue to run

off securities at the recent pace, so that the growth of bank credit

should pick up. Rapid issuance of large time deposits will continue

to fill some of the gap left by still-sluggish retail deposits, and

thus M3 is projected to outpace M2 from October to March, likely

expanding at a 2-1/2 percent rate under alternative B.

(16) Under the 50 basis point increase in the funds rate of

alternative C, both M2 and M3 would record slower growth over the next

five months than under alternative B. Given the sluggish upward

adjustment of offering rates on M2 balances, households would divert

still more savings into direct holdings of market instruments. M2

6. Currency and the monetary base are projected to grow from
October to March at 8-1/2 percent and 6-3/4 percent rates,
respectively, while total reserves are expected to decline at a
4-1/2 percent rate over this period.

is projected to be flat on balance over October to March, implying an

increase from the fourth quarter of this year to March at only a 1/2

percent rate--below the Committee's provisional range for 1995 of 1 to

5 percent. With bank credit expansion also slightly more restrained

as higher interest rates damp spending and borrowing, M3's growth from

October to March would be reduced to a 2-1/4 percent rate.

Directive Language

(18) Presented below is draft wording for the operational

paragraph that includes the usual options for Committee consideration

and a reference to a possible increase in the discount rate.

OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH

In the implementation of policy for the immediate

future, the Committee seeks to DECREASE SOMEWHAT/main-

tain/INCREASE SOMEWHAT the existing degree of pressure

on reserve positions, TAKING ACCOUNT OF A POSSIBLE

INCREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE. In the context of the

Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and

sustainable economic growth, and giving careful con-

sideration to economic, financial, and monetary develop-

ments, somewhat (SLIGHTLY) greater reserve restraint

would (MIGHT) or (SOMEWHAT) slightly lesser reserve

restraint (WOULD) might be acceptable in the intermeet-

ing period. The contemplated reserve conditions are

expected to be consistent with modest growth in M2 and

M3 over [DEL: the balance of the year] COMING MONTHS.
