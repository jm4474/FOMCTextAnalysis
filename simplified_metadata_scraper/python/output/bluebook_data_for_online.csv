This would be equal to the rate of growth for the quarter that the Committee indicated as the minimum acceptable at its last meeting, at a time when it was expected that fourth quarter growth would be 5 per cent.

Alternative C would imply a significant further easing of money market conditions from those that have recently evolved, with, for example, the Federal funds rate thought to be consistent with this alternative in a 3-7/8--4-1/2 per cent range. Under alternative C, however, short-term interest rates would almost certainly decline over the period ahead, with the bill rate likely to be in a 3-3/4--4-1/4 per cent range. The lower interest rates and greater reserve supply under alternative C would likely lead to a more rapid 3 per cent rate of growth in December, followed by an 8 per cent expansion in the first quarter. Under alternative C there could be a pick-up in business borrowing from banks as lending terms ease further, but the increased inflow of demand and consumer-type deposits associated with that alternative would probably generate enough resources so that banks would not need to be more aggressive in that CD market.

Therefore, the staff believes that this strategy would imply somewhat higher money market rates early in 1976 than under alternative B.

Under alternative B, the average 50 basis point advance in the funds rate would probably exert only a small dampening influence on the aggregates during the two month projection -8- period; the average M1 growth rate for August-September might be reduced to nearly 5-3/4 per cent.

The steep rise in the funds rate contemplated under alternative C--to a 7-1/4 per cent average in the weeks immediately ahead--would be expected to exert a more pronounced restraint on near- term monetary growth. Market repercussions from the rise in the Federal funds rate of 100 basis points or more contemplated under alternative C, of course, would be more extreme. Increasingly, however, higher market interest rates will come to impinge on savings inflows to the intermediaries, and under alternative C this impact would probably be quite pronounced by the fourth quarter. (15) In the August-September period, we would expect savings inflows to continue at the more moderate recent pace, but perhaps to be drifting lower, particularly under alternative C.

The interest rate forecast might have been expected to decline because alternative B in effect forgives the ""overshoot"" in M-1 growth during the third quarter and, hence, does not imply as low a rate of monetary growth over the next few quarters as it did earlier. Thus, under alternative B, M-2 growth for the year ahead is expected to be in a 7 to 9_ per cent range and M-3 growth in an 8 to 11 per cent range, _ and 1 percentage point higher than current longer-run ranges. It would also be consistent with the longer-run policy stance indexed by alternative B, as well as with near-term efforts to support the dollar in exchange markets.

The midpoint of the 3 to 6 percent proposed alternative B range plus the revised, lower ATS effect also is equal to an M-1 growth adjusted for ATS effects of about 6 percent. Thus, alternative B' essentially repre- sents continuation of growth in M-1 at about 6 percent: the midpoint of the alternative B' range is 5 per cent, and we have assumed that ATS effects retard M-1 growth by only about 1 percent. Thus, they assume that alternative B for 1979 is followed by 1/ If the court decision does become effective, measured M-1 growth in the QIV '79 to QIV '80 period could be increased by 1 to 2 percentage points, depending on how much of the funds shifted from demand deposits to ATS accounts returned to demand deposits. -10- 1/ alternative B' for 1980, A by A', and C by C', Under alternative B/B'--an unchanged policy with respect to the aggregates--the Federal funds rate is expected to decline somewhat by early 1980 (to a level of around 9-1/2 percent), assuming economic activity weakens about as projected. The lower panel of the chart compares the projected July-August expansion with the proposed alternative B longer-run range. The dotted line in the chart also shows annual growth rates needed from the actual June level to reach targeted midpoint levels by the fourth quarter of 1979 under the current longer-run range and proposed alternative B; these growth rates 2/ are 2 percent and 5-1/2 percent, respectively. Growth at the midpoint of the alternative II range would bring M-2 to about the mid- point of its current (and also proposed alternative B) longer-run growth range by August. As in other recent months, large- denomination time deposits are not expected to contribute to growth in M-2 as banks continue to supplement their demand and small denomination time deposits growth with Eurodollars and RPs. 16 Growth Ranges and Actual M-2 and M-3 M-2 Current and Alternative B.

(16) Pressures on thrift institutions are unlikely to ease over the next few weeks under alternative B.

On the assumption that adoption of this -13- alternative would mean that the Committee desires greater assurance that growth rates for the aggregates will not be excessive, the upper limit of the proposed funds rate range has been raised slightly from that of alternative B. Consistent with such an approach, the nonborrowed reserve path for this alternative has been constructed on the assumption that borrowings average a shade under $2 billion, implying growth in nonborrowed reserves of around 8_ percent over November and December--considerably less than the alternative B pace. Pressures on thrift institutions would be somewhat more intense than under alternative B, mortgage rates would probably rise a little further, and the bank prime rate would also be under further upward pressure.

(20) The substantial decline in short rates that appear to be implied by alternative A probably would be accompanied by significant downward pressures on the international value of the dollar, especially if the dollar also remains under pressure because of the crises in the mid-East. Net inflows of funds to thrift institutions are likely to pick up only modestly from their second half of 1979 pace, and costs of such funds would not decline as much as under alternative A. The exchange value of the dollar under alternative B is likely to decline somewhat as market participants focus on the decline of interest rates, but there would be less downward pressure than under alternative A, in part because any interest rate declines under alternative B would be associated with slower money growth. (24) The more modest money growth over the next few months under alternative B provides more scope for expansion in M-1 in the second half of 1980 than does alternative A.

Under such circumstances, there may be little if any reduction in the demand for borrowing under alternative B from around the $1_ billion average level of January. (17) The easing of money and credit demands in the second quarter, when the economy is projected to weaken more substantially than in the first, enhances the probability of some decline of interest rates at that time, particularly if the Committee were to opt for the slight acceleration in M-1A growth over the March to June period to the 5_ percent annual rate proposed in alternative B.

Thus, there is more than usual uncertainty about the demand for borrowing, and therefore about the level of the nonborrowed reserve path consistent with money supply and total reserve targets of alternative B. (11) Under alternative B, a funds rate in the 15 to 16 percent range is likely to emerge over the weeks immediately ahead, and possibly higher before the year is out. Finally, continued intervention by the U.S. to slow the appreciation in the foreign exchange value of the dollar--which is likely to continue rising under alternative B--could generate additional pressure on Treasury yields as the Federal Reserve or Treasury offers securities to the market to finance foreign currency purchases.

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 38 of 45 (41) The first part of the rationale portion of the statement associated with Alternative C would acknowledge the recent deterioration in economic and financial conditions. Finally, the risk assessment under Alternative C begins by stating that the balance of risks has shifted toward downside risks to growth. (42) Given the high odds embedded in financial market prices of at least a 25 basis point cut at this meeting, a decision to adopt Alternative C would surprise market participants, leading to an appreciable upward revision of their short-term outlook for the path of policy and probably an increase in short-and intermediate- term interest rates.",,,,No Sentences Alternative D,,,,No Sentences Alternative E,

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 34 of 60 Alternative A 1. (29) If the Committee agrees that the economic outlook has deteriorated significantly since the October meeting and thinks that substantial monetary stimulus will be needed to support a recovery in economic activity, it may be inclined to favor Alternative A or Alternative B. (30) Against this backdrop, the Committee may decide not to announce a target for the federal funds rate at this meeting and signal instead that its focus has shifted to the use of the Federal Reserves balance sheet as an especially important policy tool going forward, as in Alternative A. As incorporated in the third paragraph of Alternative A, the Committee could explicitly state that it anticipates that short-term interest rates will remain low for some time. To mitigate this concern, the Committee could phrase the commitment in implicitly conditional terms by indicating its anticipation that weak economic conditions are likely to warrant federal funds rates near zero for some time, as suggested in the statement accompanying Alternative A.10 In addition, if members were concerned that even increased use of the Federal Reserves balance sheet as a policy tool and a 10 The Committee may feel that a commitment that is conditioned on too precise a set of events may also be undesirable because, in the future, a need to tighten policy may arise well before those specific events materialize. (32) The statement suggested for Alternative A begins by acknowledging the further weakening of the outlook for economic activity rather than with a sentence about the federal funds rate. As in Alternative A, the Committee may also be concerned that the sharp contraction in economic activity and the steep declines in the prices of energy and other commodities may cause inflation to fall to an uncomfortably low level. Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 54 of 60 (51) If the Committee decides not to set a target at all, as in Alternative A, it could specify to the Desk that it has suspended setting a target and that it anticipates that the reserve conditions associated with its open market operations and the liquidity programs put in place by the Federal Reserve will result in federal funds rates near zero.

As in Alternative B, market participants may also be surprised by the Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 44 of 60 reference to unconventional policy measures, and medium- and long-term Treasury yields might edge lower. As in Alternative B, longer-term interest rates may decline a little, but probably not by much, because investors may be somewhat surprised by the language on the use of the Federal Reserve_x001A_s balance sheet as a means of further supporting credit markets and economic activity.

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 36 of 60 Alternative C 1. (38) The Committee may prefer Alternative C for a number of reasons. (40) As a third motivation for favoring Alternative C, members may view a decision to reduce the target rate by 50 basis points as an intermediate step towards reaching a level of rates closer to the zero bound at a later date. (41) The rationale section of the statement accompanying Alternative C begins by acknowledging that economic activity is contracting in the fourth quarter and by pointing to deterioration in labor markets, household and business spending, and Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 46 of 60 industrial production. If the Committee viewed Alternative C as a stepping stone to an even lower target federal funds rate, it may wish to add a sentence to signal more clearly to market participants that a further reduction in the target rate may be forthcoming. Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 47 of 60 (42) Since most primary dealers see a 50 basis point policy easing as the most likely outcome at this meeting, and since a majority see Â½ percent as the trough for the target federal funds rate this cycle, the market reaction to an announcement like that for Alternative C is likely to be muted, with short-term interest rates, equity prices, and the foreign exchange value of the dollar all changing little. The language on inflation remains unchanged from the October meeting, and the last paragraph acknowledges, as in Alternative C, that federal funds may continue to trade below the target for some time. (49) If the Committee wants to keep a target for the federal funds rate of either Â½ percent as in Alternative C or 1 percent as in Alternative D, and agrees that the options available to drain reserves from the system and enable the Desk to meet the target are either unlikely to materialize or are likely to be otherwise undesirable, it may wish to change the wording of its directive to the Desk to recognize that it does not expect the target to be consistently met given the circumstances. If it were to choose Alternative C, the Committee may also want to direct the Desk to purchase $100 billion in housing-related GSE debt and up to $500 billion in agency-guaranteed MBS, as already announced, and to do so by the end of the second quarter of next year to provide a more specific time frame than the several quarters indicated in the November 25 press release.",,,,"Under Alternative D, the federal funds rate target is left unchanged at 1 percent under the view that recent policy actions should help promote acceptable economic growth over time; as in Alternative C, the possibility of future policy easing is left open.

(43) If the Committees view of the economic outlook is appreciably more optimistic than the staffs, and, in particular, if members believe that past policy actions, along with those announced but not yet implemented, will be sufficient to return the economy to a path of moderate economic growth before too long, the Committee may wish to leave the target rate unchanged at this meeting as in Alternative D. (44) The rationale portion of the statement accompanying Alternative D acknowledges that the pace of economic activity appears to have slowed further and that the near-term outlook has deteriorated.

Such a directive is not included under Alternative D because if the Committee were optimistic enough about the outlook to select that alternative, it might not want the desk to complete the full amount of the announced purchases.

Alternative A also highlights the risk that inflation could persist below levels consistent with the dual objectives of monetary policy; this language might help underscore the Committees intent not to allow inflation to remain below its optimal level in the long run and thus may help prevent an unwanted further decline in expectations of long- run inflation.

(51) In an environment of exceptionally high uncertainty, policymakers may judge that Alternative A provides the most appropriate balance between downside risks to the economic outlook over the next several years and the risk that excessive expansion of the Federal Reserves balance sheet could hamper the conduct of monetary policy at longer horizons.
