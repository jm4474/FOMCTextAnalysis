Prefatory Note 
 
 
The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 
Please note that some material may have been redacted from this document if that

1  In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic 
format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Please note that the numbers and text in charts and 
tables were not reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

MONEY MARKET AND RESERVE RELATIONSHIPS
Recent Developments
(1) Since the last meeting of the Committee, long-term
interest rates have risen to new highs. The sharpest increase--about
50 basis points--was in yields on State and local government securities;
other long-term securities rose 15 to 40 basis points. The rise of
interest rates reflected further substantial reduction in bank holdings
of State and local government securities and uncertainties as to the
future tax status of such securities, heavy actual and expected borrowings
by Federal Agencies as other sources of housing finance were constricted,
and--in view of continuing inflationary pressures and the likelihood of
continued monetary restraint--an erosion of market convictions that
interest rates were on their way down in the near-term. In the short-
term market, the 3-month Treasury bill rate has fluctuated within
recent ranges; the outstanding bill peaked at 7.16 per cent in late
August, following auctioning of a $2.1 billion Treasury strip of short
maturing bills, but has most recently traded around 7.05 per cent.
(2) The Federal funds market experienced considerable
churning in August and early September, as, among other things, banks
adjusted to changes in System reserve regulations. The most frequent
effective Federal funds rate since the last meeting has been 9-3/4 per
cent. But the average effective rate was about 9 per cent, as the
Federal funds rate dropped off rather sharply on a number of days when
major banks found themselves with excess reserves. During the four
statement weeks ending September 3, net borrowed reserves at all member
banks and member bank borrowings averaged $1 billion and $1-1/4 billion,
respectively, little changed from the preceding four week period. With
respect to reserve aggregates, nonborrowed and total reserves declined
in August by about 4 per cent and 6-1/2 per cent, respectively.
(3) The bank credit proxy, adjusted to reflect Euro-dollar
borrowings, is now estimated to have declined at about a 10 per cent
annual rate on average in August, in line with projections in the last
Blue Book. Funds obtained from nondeposit sources other than Euro-
dollars are estimated to have declined somewhat in the course of August
as the run-off of loan Rp's in response to the System's new regulation
more than offset a further rise in outstanding commercial paper issued
by bank affiliates. On average for the month, however, nondeposit sources
other than Euro-dollars would still add about 2 percentage points to the
proxy estimate of bank credit in August, compared with about 5 per-
centage points in July when the proxy plus Euro-dollars had declined
at an 11 per cent annual rate.
(4) CD run-off in August is estimated at around $850 million,
and the average annual rate of decline in total time and savings deposits
is estimated at about 15-1/2 per cent for the month. The money supply
in August declined at a 5-1/2 per cent annual rate, or at the weak end
of earlier projections.

in major deposit and reserve aggregates for the latter half of 1968

Prospective developments
(6) An unchanged constellation of money market conditions
may be considered to include a Federal funds rate averaging around 9
per cent, member bank borrowings in a $1 - $1-1/2 billion range, and
net borrowed reserves around $1 billion. Under these conditions, the
3-month bill rate may fluctuate in a 6-3/4 - 7-1/4 per cent range, about
the same range as in recent experience. The System will be a net seller
of bills until around mid-month, partly to offset expected direct
Treasury borrowing from the Federal Reserve. During this period the
market will also be affected by the need to provide short-term finance
in connection with corporate dividend and tax dates. After mid-month,
the System will return to the buy side of the market. In that period,
downward pressure on the bill rate might also be exerted by reinvestment
demand for bills if the Treasury offers a "rights' exchange for the
$5-3/4 billion of publicly held coupon issues maturing on October 1.
(7) The Treasury is expected to announce terms of the
exchange on September 17, and the market anticipates that a security
in the intermediate-term area may be included as an option. The
relativelysizable Treasury refunding together with prospective Federal
agency issues, the recent build-up in the corporate calendar, and
continued inability of banks to purchase municipals suggest that
upward pressures on longer-term interest rates may continue. Sizable
investment demand at the current advanced level of interest rates
could emerge, however, if there were developing expectations of a
cooling in the economy.
(8) Financing of the recent Treasury bill strip, paid for
on August 25, and prospective demands on banks in connection with the
mid-September tax period and Alaskan oil lease payments are likely to
be reflecte in some expansion of total member bank deposits and bank
credit, on average, in September and only a moderate decline in reserve
aggregates. Total and nonborrowed reserves might decline in a 3 - 7 per
cent, annual rate, range during the month on average. The decline
reflects the lagged effects on required reserves of reductions in out-
standing total member bank deposits in the first three weeks of August.1 /
(9) Total member bank deposits in September are expected to
rise in a 2 - 5 per cent annual rate range, on average, with the in-
crease accounted for by a sharp rise in U.S. Government deposits.
Because of transfers to U.S. Government deposits, private demand deposits
are expected to contract further in September. However, the already
reduced liquidity of corporations suggests that they will have to rely
importantly on new loans from banks to finance larger than seasonal
tax payments. Thus, the decline in private demand deposits is expected
to be only about half of the rise in U.S. Government deposits. On
balance, the outstanding money supply may contract in a 4 - 7 per cent,
annual rate, range in September.
(10) Total time and savings deposits at banks may decline
in a 0 - 3 per cent, annual rate, range in September. Outstanding
CD's are expected to decline by about $1 billion in September, or
somewhat more than seasonally, given the continuing unfavorable interest
1/ Adjusted to be on a consistent timing basis with deposits,
the reserve aggregates would show increases of around 1 - 3 per
cent in September.
rate structure. However, on a seasonally adjusted basis, the September
decline in CD's appears likely to be smaller than in August since,
because of interest rate relationships, corporations have not built
up September CD maturities to anything like the extent they usually
do to meet tax payments. Relative to maturities the attrition ts
expected to be at least as large as in other recent months. Consumer-
type time deposits are expected to continue weak, but not as weak as
in July and the first half of August, if experience with recent intra-
quarterly patterns is any guide.
(11) The net change in Euro-dollar borrowings and other
nondeposit sources of funds to banks may not, on balance, significantly
alter the September projection of the proxy series. The marginal
reserve requirement on Euro-dollars affects such borrowings beginning
with the current statement week, but banks will not have to put up the
reserves until the week beginning October 16. The effect of such
reserve requirements on bank behavior remains to be seen, but we are
assuming only a small further growth in Euro-dollars. With respect to
other nondeposit sources, loan Rp's will continue to decline because
of the recent regulatory change; on the other hand, commercial paper
issued by bank affiliates probably will continue to increase but seems
unlikely to compensate fully for the reversal of trend in loan Rp's.
