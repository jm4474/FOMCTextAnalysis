Prefatory Note 
 
 
The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 
Please note that some material may have been redacted from this document if that

1  In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic 
format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Please note that the numbers and text in charts and

MONEY MARKET CONDITIONS
Recent developments
(1) M1 expanded at an annual rate of about 14 per cent in March,
and current data suggest about a 6 per cent growth rate for April. For the
two-month target period, M1 thus appears to be growing at a 10 per cent
annual rate, well above the Committee's range of tolerance, as the table
shows. Growth of M2 over the March-April period appears to be running at
an annual rate of around 10½ per cent, slightly above the upper limit
of its range of tolerance. Larger-than-seasonal Federal tax refunds have
probably contributed to the particularly rapid growth in demand and time
deposits other than large CD's. During late February and the first three
weeks of March, refund payments totalled about $10.5 billion, or 55 per
cent more than in the same period last year.

(2) Growth of the bank credit proxy resumed in March, following
the slight February contraction. The proxy appears to be rising more
rapidly in April, and may show an annual growth rate of around 8 per cent
for the two months combined. With business demand for bank loans
remaining weak, banks have used the recent increases in their overall
deposit flows largely to acquire Government securities and to help finance
expanded positions of security dealers.
(3) Following the March 18 FOMC meeting, the Account Manager
initially sought reserve conditions consistent with a Federal funds rate
remaining around 5 per cent. Data available shortly after the last
meeting, however, indicated stepped up growth in the aggregates to rates
at or above the Committee's ranges. In these circumstances, the Desk
would normally have tolerated a firming up in the funds rate to the 5¾
per cent upper limit of the Committee's range. But in view of the weak-
ness in the economy and the sensitive condition of financial markets,
the FOMC concurred with the Chairman's recommendation (of March 27) that
the Manager be instructed to treat 5½ per cent as the approximate upper
limit for the weekly average funds for the time being. In the first
two statement weeks of the intermeeting period the funds rate had
averaged close to 5 per cent. In the week just ended, when a sharp
drop in the Treasury balance added to the reserve supply, the average
funds rate declined to 5.28 per cent.
(4) Short-term interest rates generally have moved higher
since the March meeting. The rate on 3-month Treasury bills has advanced
up 75 basis points, to 6.40 per cent. Private short-term rates have
advanced 10-25 basis points. With these latter rates rising, most large
banks have elected to hold their prime lending rate at 7½ per cent.
Factors that appear to have contributed to the rise in short-rates include
the large amount of new cash being raised by the Treasury in the short-term
area, belief that enactment of the tax bill will insure a near term pick-up
in economic activity, and the emerging expectation that monetary policy
will not be easing much, if any, further.
(5) Bond yields have also increased over the intermeeting
period, carrying some series up by as much as 40 basis points. With
corporate offerings projected to remain large for some months ahead and
the Treasury expected to raise $5-7 billion of new cash on average per
month over the next year or so, investors who expect upward rate pressure
later in 1975 and on into 1976 were reluctant to commit funds to long-term
markets. In these unfavorable circumstances scheduled new corporate debt
offerings of more than $1 billion were either cancelled or postponed.
Near the end of the intermeeting period, the combination of higher bond
yields and cutbacks in scheduled bond offerings helped to stabilize
conditions in bond markets.
(6) Deposits at nonbank thrift institutions expanded at a
very rapid pace in March, reflecting not only the attractiveness of yields
on depositary claims but also inflows of tax refunds. While these
institutions have continued to use improved flows to pay down debt and
rebuild liquidity, current supplies of mortgage funds reportedly are
adequate. Nevertheless, with other long-term yields rising, the thrifts
have not been aggressive mortgage lenders and mortgage rates have
stopped declining.
(7) The table on the following page shows (in percentage
annual rates of change) selected monetary and financing flows over
various time periods. Appendix table III compares money supply growth
rates computed on a quarterly-average basis with those computed on a
last-month-of-quarter basis.

Prospective developments
(8) The presentation of alternative policy specifications
has been revised somewhat in order more clearly to encompass as
longer-run objectives a broad spectrum of monetary aggregates and to
include a time span of a year as well as shorter periods. Alternative--
and, as best can be estimated, mutually consistent--ranges for longer-run
rates of growth in the various monetary aggregates for the 12-month
period from March 1975 to March 1976 are shown below for Committee con-
sideration. (Consistent growth rates from the first quarter of 1975 to
the first quarter of 1976 are shown in appendix table V). Growth rates
for interim periods (shown for convenience as point estimates rather than
ranges) under the three alternatives are included in the detailed table
on the next page.

a more rapid 6¾ per cent annual rate to make up for the first quarter
shortfall. M 2 for this alternative shows about the same rate of growth
as at the last meeting, but M3 is somewhat more rapid, reflecting the
greatly enlarged public preference for deposits at thrift institutions
which appears to have emerged.
(10) Possible alternative short-run operating ranges of
tolerance for the Federal funds rate and for Ml, M2, and RPD
are shown in the table below for Committee consideration.

(11) Various different short-run specifications could be
consistent with a given longer-run target. Any particular 12 month
growth rate for a monetary aggregate could be achieved with different
patterns of growth in the aggregate during the period, and with con-
sequent different timing and magnitude of any necessary interest rate
adjustments. The short-run specifications deemed "consistent" with the
contemplated in attaining the 12-month objective. In developing the
short-run specifications shown for the several alternatives in the pre-
ceding paragraph, it was assumed that the Committee would desire to have
the aggregates grow at a faster rate over the first half of the period--
that is, from March to September--than over the ensuing 6 months, for
the following reasons: (1) large tax rebates and one-time social security
payments are expected to have a strong impact on demand and time deposits
in late spring and early summer; (2) previous declines in short-term
interest rates are still having an expansionary impact on money demand;
and (3) the sharp rebound projected for the economy in the third quarter
would spur transactions demand for cash. All of the alternatives assume
that as economic recovery develops, the Federal funds rate would need
to rise above the mid-point of the short-run ranges shown to bring growth
in the aggregates into line with longer-run targets. In the case of
alternatives B and C, the short-run specifications indicate a rise in
the Federal funds rate over the next few weeks. The staff expects that
such a rise would moderate the extent to which interest rates might have
to rise later in order to restrain money demand.
(12) Alternative A contemplates a Federal funds rate remaining
in the 5¼-5½ per cent range most recently prevailing. M1 would be
expected to increase over the two month April-May period in a 7-9 per
cent annual rate range. Growth is expected to be especially large in
May when the largest part of the tax rebates are paid out. This
alternative contemplates about a 7¾ per cent annual rate of growth in
M1, and 11 per cent in M 2, over the second and third quarters.
(13) With little or no change in the Federal funds rate over
the next few weeks, upward pressures on market interest rates, if any,
are likely to occur mainly in the Treasury market. The Treasury will
continue to add sizable amounts to its weekly and monthly bill auctions,
A $1.5 billion 2-year note will be auctioned on Tuesday. And in the
mid-May refunding of $3.8 billion of maturing publicly held debt--to
be announced on Thursday, May 1--the Treasury will also probably raise
about $2-2½ billion of new cash in the coupon area. Recent postponements
in the corporate bond market have relieved pressure in that area to some
extent, but any interest rate decline will be limited over the near-term
since the calendar remains heavy and recently postponed issues would likely
be rescheduled as the market shows signs of improvement.
(14) A rise in the Federal funds rate to around the 6 per
cent level--as shown for alternative B short-run specifications in
paragraph (10)--would probably lead to a sharp market reaction. The
coupon issues, particularly short-term coupons, might rise another 50
basis points, or possibly more in the short-run as markets over-anticipate
the extent of monetary tightening in process. Such a rise would lead to
yields in the 7¾-8 per cent area on 2-year Treasury notes--a yield level
which, if sustained, would begin to attract funds that might otherwise
go into banks and thrift instituions. We have assumed some moderation
in such flows under this alternative, but they are expected to remain
relatively large over the next few months. The availability of mortgage
market funds may not, therefore, be significantly limited in this period.
(15) The rise of interest rates under alternative B would work
to hold growth in M1 over the second and third quarters to around a 6¾ per
cent annual rate, as noted earlier. With some diminution in the expansion
of interest-bearing deposits, growth in broader measures of money would
be moderated, relative to alternative A. Bank credit expansion would be
reduced somewhat, but with business and consumer loan demands expected
to be weak at least over the next month or two, banks would still be in
a position to participate heavily in Treasury financings.
(16) The roughly 1 percentage point rise in the Federal funds
rate over the next few weeks contemplated under alternative C would
probably cause other short-term rates to rise by even larger amounts, at
least temporarily, mainly because of expectational effects on markets in
a period of heavy Treasury financings and with near-term prospects of
economic recovery. Longer-term rate increases could be substantial, if
borrowers tended to accelerate offerings under the circumstances in
anticipation of even higher rates later. On the other hand, pressures
on bond markets could be moderated if corporate borrowers begin to
utilize bank lines so as to avoid being locked into relatively high
interest costs. Lower growth rates in all of the monetary aggregates
would be expected. Banks and thrift institutions may begin to experience
a significantly slower inflow of consumer-type time and savings deposits,
and the bank prime loan rate and mortgage market rates would probably
show significant increases.
Proposed directive
(17) Presented below are three alternative formulations
for the operational paragraph of the directive, which are intended to
correspond to the similarly lettered policy alternatives discussed in the
preceding section. In all three alternatives, it is proposed to include
a reference to Treasury financing because the regular mid-May financing
will be announced later this month.
Alternative A
To implement this policy, while taking account of THE
FORTHCOMING TREASURY FINANCING AND OF developments in domestic
and international financial markets, the Committee seeks to
achieve bank reserve and money market conditions consistent
with more rapid growth in monetary aggregates over the months
ahead than has occurred ON AVERAGE in recent months.
Alternative B
To implement this policy, while taking account of THE
FORTHCOMING TREASURY FINANCING AND OF developments in domestic
and international financial markets, the Committee seeks to
achieve bank reserve and money market conditions consistent
with SOMEWHAT more rapid growth in monetary aggregates over the
months ahead than has occurred ON AVERAGE in recent months.
Alternative C
To implement this policy, while taking account of THE
FORTHCOMING TREASURY FINANCING AND OF developments in domestic
and international financial markets, the Committee seeks to
achieve bank reserve and money market conditions consistent
with [DEL: more rapid] MODERATE growth in monetary aggregates over the
months ahead [DEL: than has occurred in recent months].
