MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES
Recent Developments
(1) Financial markets were turbulent at times in the second half of the intermeeting
period. Against a backdrop of mounting stresses in Asian financial markets, equity prices
dropped appreciably in the week ending October 24 and plunged worldwide the following
Monday (Chart 1). The sell-off was accompanied by a sharp decline in interest rates on U.S.
Treasury securities, as investors sought liquidity and safety, and by a substantial widening of
spreads over Treasuries on emerging-market and, to a much lesser extent, U.S. corporate debt.
Actual price volatility soared, as did implied volatility on bond and stock prices as inferred
from options markets. Over the following days, however, increased demand for equities in
the United States, including from individual investors, contributed to a rebound in U.S. and
foreign equity markets and an unwinding of some of the previous flight to safety. Adding to
the positive tone in financial markets, especially abroad, were international steps to stabilize
Indonesian financial markets (paragraph 3). However, financial markets remain skittish, and
U.S. equities sold off again today, sparked by renewed declines in Asian stock prices and
unanticipated strength in U.S. employment and wages.1 2
(2) On balance, financial market developments during the intermeeting period seem
to have left investors a little less confident about economic and financial prospects and with
expectations of lower inflation. U.S. equity price indexes fell 2-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent over the
intermeeting period, leaving major indexes 18 to 26 percent above their levels at the
beginning of the year. Yield spreads on private securities relative to Treasuries rose around
couple of years. Treasury coupon yields declined 10 to 25 basis points, with all of the
decline registered after stock prices began to drop sharply.3 With consumer inflation
continuing to run lower than investors had anticipated and international financial
developments reinforcing perceptions of continued disinflation--or even, to some, incipient
deflation--the spread between nominal and real yields at the ten-year maturity narrowed about
stresses in financial markets worldwide and their perceived feedback on the U.S. economy,
investors evidently concluded that the possibility of any firming of U.S. monetary policy over
coming months, already low, had vanished.
(3) Amid spreading financial turmoil in developing countries, the dollar
appreciated significantly against the currencies of many emerging market countries during the
intermeeting period. In response to pressure on its currency, the Hong Kong Monetary
Authority drove its market interest rates up sharply in order to hold its peg to the dollar. In
response, stock prices in Hong Kong fell by a third, triggering the worldwide drop in equity
values in late October. The announcement on October 31 of an IMF-led support package for
Indonesia--which includes a possible short-term loan of up to $3 billion through the
Treasury's Exchange Stabilization Fund--as well as coordinated intervention in support of the
Indonesian rupiah by Japan, Singapore, and Indonesia contributed to partial recoveries of
beleaguered financial markets in emerging-market economies. In Asia, equity prices dropped
significantly against the dollar. For the first time this year, stresses in Asia spilled over to
financial markets in Latin America, and spreads on Brady bonds increased 2 to 3 percentage
points.4 As speculative pressure against Brazilian assets mounted, one-month domestic
interest rates rose 20 percentage points and share prices fell 27 percent. The Mexican peso
depreciated about 7-1/4 percent, on balance, and share prices dropped 13 percent.
(4) In contrast to its gains against currencies of developing nations, the dollar
slipped 2 percent on a G-10 weighted-average basis, muting its appreciation overall. The
dollar was little changed against the yen. Prospects for the Japanese economy appeared to
deteriorate over the intermeeting period; domestic demand evidently has not yet rebounded
from the depressing effects of the consumption tax increase in the spring, and the
intensification of financial turmoil in other Asian countries raised the prospect of further
negative shocks to Japanese exports. Over the intermeeting period, the Nikkei index fell 12
percent, and long-term rates in Japan declined 25 basis points to 1 5/8 percent, a historical low.
Virtually all of the dollar's decline occurred against European currencies. Short-term interest
rates in most continental European countries climbed 20 to 35 basis points over the period as
widespread expectations of a tightening of monetary policy in Germany were confirmed when
the Bundesbank raised the rate on its weekly repo tender on October 9. Long-term interest
rates in continental Europe rose in the first two weeks of October in line with the advance in
short-term rates, but they reversed course as prices in global equity markets declined in the
second half of the month. This week, the Bank of England raised its RP rate 25 basis points,
citing higher-than-expected inflation and persistent strength in domestic demand; financial
markets in the United Kingdom sold off moderately on the unexpected action. For the
intermeeting period as a whole, bond yields in most European countries were up 5 to 10 basis
points, and equity indexes generally fell 5 to 10 percent.
; the
Desk did not intervene.
(5) The broad monetary aggregates decelerated further in October. M2 grew at a
advance from the fourth quarter of 1996 to 5 percent, the upper end of its 1 to 5 percent
annual range. 5 The slowing was attributable to money market mutual funds, whose growth
was off considerably from their strong summer pace. Preliminary data suggest that flows into
money market mutual funds and deposits did not benefit significantly from the volatility in
the capital markets in recent weeks. While mutual funds reported a substantial increase in
customer inquiries and activity, outflows from domestic equity funds proved small and
temporary; weakness in international funds, however, proved to be more lasting. With bank
credit growth moderating last month, growth of M3 also edged down in October, but by less
than the staff had envisioned in the last bluebook, to a still-strong 8 percent annual rate; from
the fourth quarter of last year, this aggregate has risen at an 8 percent annual rate, placing it
well above its 2 to 6 percent annual range.
(6) M2 velocity was about flat in the third quarter, with short-term opportunity
costs unchanged. Abstracting from movements in opportunity costs, V2 has trended higher
over the past few years (Chart 2), perhaps reflecting continued flows into long-term mutual
funds. Although it did not rise last quarter, the behavior of V2 remained broadly consistent
with a model that includes a stronger time trend than was present from the mid-1960s to the
late 1980s, but a similar long-run response to opportunity costs (lower panel of chart).
Nonetheless, considerable uncertainty continues to surround the prospective behavior of M2
(7) Overall credit growth appears to have remained moderate in recent months. In
the household sector, increases in consumer credit have averaged somewhat under the growth
in nominal income, far below the rates earlier in the economic expansion. According to the
most recent Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey, banks continued to tighten terms and
standards on credit card loans, but fewer of them reported doing so than on previous surveys;
in contrast to previous surveys, few banks tightened on other consumer loans. Business
borrowing has remained rapid, propelled by a shortfall of internal funds relative to capital
expenditures as well as by brisk merger activity. Bond issuance dipped sharply late in the
month in response to volatility in the markets. In contrast, equity offerings have held up in
recent weeks, though buy-backs increased in the wake of equity price declines. Firms have
also relied on bank funding, which remains readily available on attractive terms to most firms.
The loan officer survey indicated that terms such as spreads of loan rates over funding costs
continue to be eased in reaction to continued intense competition from other bank and
nonbank lenders.6 With the federal deficit widening seasonally, the Treasury has resumed
net borrowing in the market, including in the bill sector, but its debt issuance remains modest
seasonally adjusted. Overall domestic nonfinancial sector debt appears to be continuing to
expand at an underlying rate of less than 5 percent, leaving this aggregate in the lower half of
its 3 to 7 percent annual range for the year.

Short-run Policy Alternatives
(8) The staffs forecast again calls for real GDP growth to remain faster than the
growth of potential for a while, reducing the unemployment rate to almost 4-1/2 percent by mid-
staff has scaled back its projection of the underlying acceleration in core prices, owing to
surprisingly placid incoming price readings, continued robust gains in labor productivity, and
the likelihood of a lower trajectory for non-oil import prices as a consequence of the recent
financial disruptions in Asia. Still, with core inflation projected to be on an upward track,
especially abstracting from the technical adjustments to the CPI, the staff forecast assumes
that the FOMC will tighten its policy stance next year. The associated rise in bond yields
will accentuate the downward correction in equity prices foreseen as investors become
disappointed by earnings. As a consequence, real GDP growth in 1999 drops to a pace
slower than that of potential, pushing unemployment by the end of that year a bit above its
current rate.
(9) If the Committee shares the staffs assessment that the U.S. economy has
overshot its sustainable productive potential, it may be disposed to tighten its policy stance, as
in the 25 basis point rise in the funds rate in alternative C. With markets still somewhat
unsettled, the extent of their reactions to a policy tightening is especially difficult to gauge,
and the odds that those reactions, both in the United States and abroad, could be outsized are
probably higher than usual. Under these circumstances, if the Committee were inclined to
tighten, it might consider waiting until it had greater assurance that domestic and foreign
financial markets have quieted further. The Committee would be led to raise rates if it
judged the threat of an inflationary uptrend to be serious enough to justify a preemptive
policy initiative, even in the absence of any evidence in hand of actual acceleration in prices.
In light of the persistent strength of final demand to date, the likely effects of recent financial
market events on the U.S. inflation outlook could well be seen as too minor to assuage
Committee concerns about intensifying inflationary forces. The Committee may judge that
the impacts of weaker economies and currencies in Asia on U.S. export volume and import
prices will be relatively limited. Also, given the small net size of the stock market decline,
the cost of equity capital may be seen as remaining low enough, when combined with the still
accommodative credit conditions for businesses in securities markets and at financial
intermediaries, to undergird continued heavy investment spending. Similarly, household
financial wealth may be regarded as remaining elevated enough, when considered together
with likely persisting employment gains and still high consumer confidence, to keep
consumption spending on a strong path. A policy tightening--even if delayed until markets
stabilize--likely would induce further sizable downward adjustments to stock prices, and bond
prices as well, and bolster the exchange value of the dollar. However, these market responses
could be viewed as a necessary aspect of the transmission of monetary policy restraint. For
example, in the staff forecast, a decline of around 20 percent in stock prices over the next
year or so is a key element in limiting the rise in inflation.
(10) Alternative B, which would leave the intended federal funds rate at 5-1/2
percent, could be chosen at this meeting either merely as a deferral of a tighter stance until
financial markets have become more resilient, or, more positively, as a justifiable policy
posture, absent some change in the tenor of incoming information about inflation prospects.
The continuing string of data suggesting stronger real activity and softer inflation than
expected has provided evidence that, at least in some respects, economic behavior is deviating
from historical patterns. In those circumstances, knowing at what point resource pressures
will induce cost and price acceleration--and hence when preemptive policy actions would
become warranted--is difficult, making a "wait-and-see" posture more attractive. Despite the
recent strength in aggregate demand, the current policy stance still could turn out to be
consistent with sustainable economic expansion and subdued inflation. Indeed, inflation
expectations probably have receded even further of late; certainly that would be consistent
with the narrowing spread between yields on the Treasury's nominal and inflation-protected
securities. By itself, this development should restrain the wage- and price-setting process.
Moreover, the fall in inflation expectations has further raised real short-term interest rates,
which should work to restrain spending over time, other things equal.
(11) Markets are unlikely to react immediately if the Committee again chooses to
maintain its current intended federal funds rate, because participants have incorporated an
unchanged policy stance into market prices. The market does not appear to share the staff
assessment that the economy has already overshot its capacity constraints, and that pressures
on resources are likely to intensify. Thus, data over coming months in line with the
Greenbook projection would seem likely to induce some increase in market yields. In
addition, if the perceived risk of volatility in prices of corporate equity and debt should
diminish somewhat further, it would erode even more the flight-to-quality incentive for
holding Treasuries and augment the upward pressure on yields on Treasury notes and bonds.
Banks and other intermediaries may stop easing the terms and conditions of their lending to
businesses, reflecting some of the heightened concerns about credit quality evident in
securities markets of late. In foreign exchange markets, the weighted-average value of the
dollar against other G-10 currencies probably will hold around its current level, but could
tend to appreciate as U.S. long-term rates edge higher and especially should speculative
pressures on Latin American markets subside.
(12) The staff anticipates that, under alternative B, M2 and M3 will grow at annual
rates of 4-1/2 and 6-1/4 percent, respectively, over the five months from October to March of next
year. Over the fourth and first quarters, quarterly average growth rates for the two aggregates
of 5-1/4 and 7-1/4 percent are anticipated, compared with a Greenbook forecast of 5-1/4 percent on
average for nominal GDP. The standard measure of the opportunity costs of holding
monetary assets is effectively unchanged over the next two quarters as the policy tightening
assumed by the staff starts toward the end of that interval. The updrift in M2 velocity
observed in the last few years should be muted in the period ahead, because some investors
will likely choose the safety of M2 assets over increased exposures in equity markets. The
sizable downtrend in M3 velocity is expected to persist. Bank credit is expected to expand at
around a 6 percent rate over the five months, supported in part by strong business lending to
help finance continued investment in plant and equipment, so M3 growth likely again will be
bolstered relative to that of M2 by still-rapid issuance of large time deposits as well as by
inflows into institution-only money funds. For this year as a whole, M2 is seen as growing at
the 5 percent upper end of its range, while M3 is expected to expand 2 percentage points
faster than the 6 percent upper bound of its range.
(13) Over the fourth and first quarters, domestic nonfinancial debt is projected to
grow at a 5 percent average pace, near that of nominal spending. The expansion of federal
debt, however, will be held far below this rate by the modest borrowing needs of the
Treasury. Nonfederal debt growth, by contrast, is expected to pick up to a little more than a
demands should be boosted by the widening of the financing gap, restrained only minimally
by the edging up of financing costs. The household sector's acquisition of debt should be
well maintained through the first quarter of next year.
