MONEY MARKET AND RESERVE RELATIONSHIPS
Recent developments
Since the last meeting of the FOMC, there has been a marked
further reduction in short-term rates, with declines of around 35 basis
points in bill rates, sizable drops in rates on CD's, and declines of
The Federal funds rate moved generally into a 4 - 4-3/4 per cent
range, as compared with 5 - 5-1/8 per cent in February. And new
dealer loan rates during March were most often in a 5 - 5 per cent
range at New York banks and 4-3/4 - 5 per cent from sources outside
New York.
These rate declines have been partly encouraged by market
expectations of a discount rate decrease, but they also importantly
reflect the further easing of bank reserve conditions during the past
month when nonborrowed reserves expanded by a more than 25 per cent
annual rate.
The rapid expansion in reserves in March, the easing of
money market conditions, and the expectations that monetary policy
would ease further, have also contributed to declines in long-term
rates. But the extremely heavy calendar of new corporate and other
issues has limited the declines. As a result, unlike short-term
rates, yields on corporate, state and local government, and long-term

U.S. Government securities remain above their earlier lows reached
in the late January-mid-February period.
A large part of the rapid rise in nonborrowed reserves
was absorbed by an increase in excess reserves and a reduction in
borrowings. Excess reserves rose to an average of about $425 million
during the past four statement weeks from $345 million during the
previous four weeks, reflecting in part the initial bank response to
the recent reserve requirement reduction. At the same time, member
bank borrowings from the Federal Reserve declined from $365 million to
$205 million. In consequence, net free reserves averaged $220 million
during the past four statement weeks, up sharply from a net borrowed
reserve average of around $20 million during the previous four weeks.
Required reserves, however, did grow substantially in March
and total member bank deposits (the bank credit proxy) expanded at
about a 15 per cent annual rate. Borrowings by banks abroad through
their foreign branches appear to have shown little change on balance
in March. Over the four month December-March period, nonborrowed
reserves rose at an 18.5 per cent annual rate, the bank credit proxy
at 12.5 per cent (about 11.5 per cent after allowing for the decline
in foreign borrowings earlier in the quarter), and the end-of-month
series on total loans and investments of banks at an estimated 11.5
per cent annual rate.
The rapid rate of bank credit growth reflects in part return
flows of funds into time deposits as the decline in market rates permitted
CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -3- March 31, 1967.
banks to reverse the disintermediation of last summer and fall. Time
and savings deposits expanded at about a 15 per cent annual rate in
March, and at about a 16 per cent rate over the past four months.
The March increase was sparked by a resurgence of growth in pass-
book savings. Growth in outstanding negotiable CD's has moderated
substantially since early in the year.
The substantial growth in nonborrowed reserves that has
been necessary to ease money markets has also led to considerable
expansion in private demand deposits and in the money supply. Money
supply rose at a 15 per cent annual rate in March, and the rise over
the past four months was at a 6 per cent rate. In part, consumers may be re-
building both demand and savings deposits because of uncertainties
about the economic outlook. Business demand deposit holdings may
also have risen in part in order to prepare for large tax payments
to be made in the near future.
Prospective developments
Money market relationships with no policy shift. Credit
markets during the coming month are likely to be affected by sizable,
though temporary, demands for short-term credit to help finance large
accelerated April tax payments; by a continued relatively heavy bond
market calendar; by the need for investors to make payments on the
even heavier volume of issues of recent weeks; by the ending of
initial bank adjustments to the March reductions in reserve require-
ments; and by fluctuations in market expectations concerning Federal
CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -4- March 31, 1967.
Reserve policy actions. Against this near-term background, as best
can now be projected, a continuation of prevailing conditions of
ease in the money market, assuming no change in the discount rate,
would likely require a continued liberal provision of reserve funds
if the Federal funds rate were to remain in a 4½ - 4-3/4 per cent
range and the 3-month bill rate in a 4.00 - 4.20 per cent range.
The April tax date will tend to exert upward pressure on
money market rates. Toward the end of April and in early May, however,
normal seasonal demands for bills could be augmented if the Treasury
undertakes an attractive rights financing in connection with its
regular May refunding (which will be announced in late April and
books will be open in early May).
A Federal funds rate generally in a 4½ - 4-3/4 per cent
range would probably keep dealer loan rates by and large at 5 per
cent or above in New York, so that marginal dealer borrowing costs
would also be high enough to make the cost of carry an important
factor reducing dealer willingness to hold relatively large bill
positions. Such dealer borrowing costs might also be subject to
pressure if the basic reserve deficiency of major money market banks
enlarges around mid-April as it did last year when tax-related needs
for funds were substantially less than this year. Thus, given these
possibilities, it may take a Federal funds rate around 4 per cent,
and often shading lower, to keep money market rates and conditions as
comfortable over-all as in recent weeks.
CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -5- March 31, 1967
Maintenance of prevailing conditions of ease in the money
market may still entail a net free reserve position for member banks
as high as the recent $200 - $300 million range, especially around
the period of peak tax date pressures. There appears to be some
scope for a decline in excess reserves over the period ahead, since,
as indicated earlier, banks built up excess reserves somewhat as part
of their initial response to the recent reserve requirement reduction.
However, wide swings in marginal reserve measures are probable in the
coming weeks in view of the likelihood of sharp shifts in reserve
distribution between money market and other banks during April.
Bank credit, deposits and long-term rates with no policy
shift. The reserves provided to maintain the market conditions noted
in the preceding paragraphs and in light of expected large credit
demands over the tax period would probably support bank credit
growth in a 10 - 13 per cent annual rate range (as measured on a
daily average basis by the proxy). Time and savings deposits are
expected to rise further, but the rate of growth--in a 10 - 13 per
cent range--is likely to be slower than the exceptional pace of
recent months. Consumer-type time deposits and passbook savings are
likely to show continued relatively sizable growth unless consumer
spending picks up, but it is assumed that net expansion in outstanding
CD's will be moderate. Large banks may prefer to finance temporary
tax-related loan demands through day-to-day borrowing in the Federal
funds market or even from abroad, rather than in the CD market where
CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -6- March 31, 1967.
they are committed to the funds at somewhat longer term and with
relatively little difference in cost.
Although the heavy volume of tax payments in prospect in
April is expected to boost bank loan demands, some factors may
operate to limit the extent of loan rise. For example, recent capital
market financing may be used to a substantial extent to reduce
indebtedness to banks. Such loan repayments, in conjunction with a
large expected growth in U.S. Government deposits as corporate and
personal income tax payments are made, probably will reduce private
holdings of demand deposits somewhat. Such holdings are projected
to decline in a 2 - 5 per cent (annual rate) range in April. With
currency continuing to rise, however, the money supply is expected
to remain about unchanged.
While staff projections of loan growth in April are large
and, of course, could be exceeded in actual event, there is the
possibility that loan growth could be less rapid than expected,
either because we have underestimated loan repayments out of capital
market proceeds or because the inventory adjustment gathers momentum.
Under these conditions, demand deposits could decline even more. In
addition banks might reduce their demands for borrowings, including
funds from abroad, and also cut back their demand for time deposits
further. But the full force of such developments limiting bank
credit expansion is not likely to show up until later in the spring.
CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -7- March 31, 1967.
Should expectations of a lower discount rate be disappointed,
even the sizable bank reserve and credit expansion that is presently
the staff's maximum likelihood projection--given maintenance of
prevailing money market conditions--may not be sufficient to fore-
stall some back-up in long-term market rates in April. While the
odds would appear to favor continued small declines in long-term
rates because of the moderation in the new issue calendar from the
record March volume, dealer holdings of municipal issues have been
building up and recent new corporate issues appear to have been priced
somewhat ahead of the market in anticipation of a further monetary
policy easing action.
Further ease through open market operations alone. To
achieve some easing of monetary policy without a discount rate
reduction is likely to require an increase in net reserve availability
to a $300 - $350 million range. This could be consistent with a
Federal funds rate in a 4 - 4½ per cent range and with increased chances
that growth in the monetary aggregates will be closer to or above the
upper ends of the ranges indicated earlier. Credit market reactions
to such a move are not entirely predictable, however, with some market
participants becoming even more convinced that a sizable discount rate
cut was imminent and with others perhaps becoming more doubtful. An
easing policy carried out only through open market operations might be
construed as indicating that the System may foresee the need for
reversing monetary policy in the near future and therefore is reluctant
CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -8- March 31, 1967.
to lower the discount rate; this would tend to limit interest rate
declines associated with further ease in open market operations.
The 3-month bill rate could fluctuate widely over the near-term under
the circumstances as expectations with respect to discount rate change
wax and wane.
Further ease with discount rate cuts. A 1/4 point decline
in the discount rate to 4½ per cent would tend essentially to do little
more than confirm current levels of security yields. It would become
more likely that the Federal funds rate would move below 4 per cent,
assuming free reserves in their recent range. It would also serve
to lower dealer lending rates somewhat, and thereby take some
potential upward pressure off bill rates in the longer run. Over
the short-run, though, the 3-month bill rate may rebound from its
very recent 4 per cent level, and perhaps fluctuate in a 3.90 to
a small discount rate cut could also smooth market adjustments around
the mid-April tax date. The expansion in reserve and monetary aggre-
gates could very well remain within the ranges earlier indicated for
an unchanged monetary policy since borrowers and banks have to a
great extent already built in a discount rate reduction of at
least this size into their decisions.
If the discount rate were cut to 4 per cent, the market
effects are likely to be more noticeable. The 3-month bill rate
might fall into a 3.60 - 4.00 per cent range, as Federal funds and
CONFIDENTIAL (FR)
dealer loan rates declined roughly in line with the discount rate and
as the market assumed that supportive open market operations would be
forthcoming. Bank lending and time deposit rates--including not only
rates on CD's but also on consumer-type time deposits--might tend to
move further downwards, especially after the tax period has passed.
And such rate movements, or anticipations of them, are likely to
reduce long-term market rates somewhat further, to reduce interest
rates offered by nonbank depositary institutions, and to encourage
additional declines in mortgage rates and easing in mortgage terms.
Growth in bank credit with the discount rate at 4 per cent
could be a few percentage points more rapid than the 10 - 13 per cent
range earlier indicated. This would be particularly the case if banks
permitted CD rates to lag behind the decline in bill rates--taking
the opportunity to obtain additional CD money. Downward adjustments
in bank lending terms would also tend to increase bank credit growth
as capital market financing became relatively less attractive. But
it is conjectural whether such adjustments would come soon enough to
affect April. In any event, a point decline in the discount rate
would probably require a follow through over the weeks ahead in the
form of somewhat larger free reserve positions, in order to attain
the full extent of easing in market conditions likely to be set in
motion by the discount rate action.
