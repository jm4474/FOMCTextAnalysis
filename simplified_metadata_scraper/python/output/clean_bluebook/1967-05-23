MONEY MARKET AND RESERVE RELATIONSHIPS
Recent developments
Since the May 2 meeting of the Committee, money market
conditions have remained comfortable while capital markets have been subject
to intensified pressure. Federal funds have continued to trade at or close
to the discount rate, with trades more frequently below than above it.
Dealer loan rates posted by major New York banks have averaged just
under 4-3/8 per cent, about the same as in the second half of April.
Yields on Treasury bills and on commercial and finance company paper
have continued to decline. With demand for bills, especially the
shorter maturities, remaining strong, the 3-month bill rate has
fallen from around 3.75 per cent in early May to 3.55 per cent most
recently. Yields on CD's, on the other hand, have risen, especially on the
longest maturities, as some major banks increased their efforts to attract
longer-term CD's. Reportedly, a number of banks are paying rates
as high as 4-3/4 to 5 per cent for 1-year money.
Yields in long-term debt markets continued to move higher
in the first three weeks of May under the weight of heavy current and
prospective new offerings and other factors affecting investor expecta-
tions. Average yields on long-term Treasury bonds are now within 15
basis points, and prime grade corporate and municipal obligations within
the short-term debt markets declining further, the spread between

short and long-term rates has continued to widen, evidencing market
expectations of continued upward pressure on interest rates in the
months ahead.
In the first three statement weeks ending in May, net free
reserves and member bank borrowings have averaged about $275 million
and $110 million, respectively. In the four statement weeks ending
in April, free reserves had averaged about $80 million less and member
bank borrowings about $40 million higher.
Growth in total member bank deposits, which had been at an
annual rate of 15 per cent in the first four months of the year, fell
off sharply in the first half of May and for the month as a whole the
bank credit proxy is now expected to increase at a 3-4 per cent
annual rate. Allowing for further repayments of Euro-dollar borrowings
by major banks would reduce the implied credit expansion by about 1
percentage point. For the December-May period expansion in the bank
credit proxy is estimated at an 11-1/2 per cent annual rate (and at
The slower growth in total member bank deposits this month
has reflected a sharp decline in U.S. Government deposits, only partly
offset by an increase in private demand deposits, as well as somewhat
slower expansion in total time and savings deposits. Treasury deposits
have been reduced by continued acceleration in Federal Government
spending, by somewhat larger than expected attrition in the May re-
funding, and by market purchases by the Treasury of coupon issues for
CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -3- May 19, 1967.
the trust funds during the course of the refunding. Also, tax
receipts are being cut back this month as a result of the new pattern
of corporate payments of withheld taxes.
Although shifts out of U.S. Government balances have given
strong impetus to the growth in private demand deposits, sizable loan
repayments following the mid-April tax period have tended to curb the
expansion somewhat. On the basis of data through mid-month, private
demand deposits and the money supply are expected to increase at
annual rates of 15 per cent and 14 per cent, respectively, in May.
This expansion would result in a December-May growth rate in money
supply of just under 6 per cent.
Despite recent increases in posted CD rates, commercial banks
have as yet replaced little of the CD run-off they experienced in the
April tax period. Banks have concentrated their efforts mainly in
attracting longer-term CD funds, presumably in anticipation of both
higher loan demands in the fall and further upward pressures on market
interest rates. Investors apparently have shown some resistance to
placing funds in longer CD maturities and, in the case of shorter
CD's, banks have not been willing to bid aggressively for new funds.
On the other hand, consumer CD's and passbook savings balances
have continued to grow rapidly and, therefore, total time
and savings deposits appear to be expanding at a rate of about
CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -4- May 19, 1967.
less than in the first four months of the year, with the drop re-
flecting entirely the cessation in growth of large negotiable CD's.
With the combined total of private and Government demand
deposits projected to decline, total required reserves are expected
to increase very little in May. Nonborrowed reserves are likely to
show a seasonally adjusted increase of perhaps 6 per cent (annual
rate), however, reflecting higher excess reserves and lower member
bank borrowings.
Prospective developments
A continuation of prevailing conditions in the money market
would imply: Federal funds trading mostly around 4 per cent, with the
effective rate averaging slightly below the discount rate; free reserves
fluctuating generally within a $200 - $300 million range; member bank
borrowings continuing to average somewhat above $100 million; and
dealer loan rates at New York banks ranging below 4.50 per cent. Some
temporarily greater reserve availability might be needed, however, to
cushion churning around the mid-June tax and dividend period.
Even assuming unchanged money market conditions, Treasury
bill rates probably will continue under downward pressure as a result
of seasonal influences in the period ahead. The System will be on
the buying side of the market for much of the period until the next
Committee meeting; a wide range of investor demands for seasonal and
temporary investment and reinvestment purposes should continue strong;
CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -5- May 19, 1967.
in June a record $5.5 billion of tax anticipation bills would mature.
With continuing heavy inflows, the Federal Home Loan Banks will
probably continue to offer strength to the short-term market either
by buying Treasury bills direct or by redeeming debt, thus freeing
private funds for investment in bills.
The 3-month bill rate may thus move towards the lower end
of a 3.40 - 3.60 per cent range. As this downdrift progresses,
however, some offsetting factors should come into play. In particular,
the widening spreads between short and intermediate-term yields and
between rates on bills and those on CD's and other money market paper
may tend to limit the bill rate decline. Also, projections of reserve
factors indicate that the System will be shifting from the buying to
the selling side of the market around mid-June. Moreover, if the
Treasury is forced to draw down its balance with the Reserve Banks
in the days immediately preceding the tax date, as seems quite
possible, larger System sales to absorb reserves may be needed.
Even with further declines in bill rates, however, yields
in capital markets may well remain under upward pressure, given the
present very uncertain market atmosphere. Despite the appearance of
some less optimistic current business statistics, the weight of the
new issue calendar and expectations of economic resurgence later on
continues to dominate investor attitudes. The market is also beginning
to focus on the Treasury's potentially large deficit and the resulting
likelihood of heavy second half financing. This could include some
CONFIDENTIAL (FR)
flotations of over-5-year issues in the event that Congress allows
some flexibility outside the 4-1/4 per cent ceiling. Also, another
issue of FNMA participations is expected shortly.
On the other hand, a technical rally in the bond market
is possible, especially in U.S. Governments. Some market observers
feel that the recent bond yield increases may have outrun current
economic developments. And in the Treasury market recent sizable
purchases by official accounts have helped to lighten dealer holdings
of longer-term issues. On balance, however, we would expect that in
the absence of further official actions, underlying market forces
would be likely to continue to work toward higher rates.
Market expectations, which have played an important role in
generating upward pressures on bond yields, have not been associated
with any particular signs of strength in bank loan demands in recent
weeks. In fact, continued heavy capital market flotations may result
in further loan repayments by major corporations. A temporary bulge
in bank loans is likely around the mid-June tax date, since projected
corporate income tax payments then are very large--even larger than
last year. But the improved liquidity position of corporations,
including large holdings of June tax bills and of sizable amounts of
maturing CD's, and the projected liquidation of business inventories
should operate to hold down both bank loan demand and total bank
credit expansion
May 19, 1967.
CONFIDENTIAL (FR)
We therefore anticipate that, with money market conditions
unchanged, the average increase in the bank credit proxy during June
will be at an annual rate in a range of 4-7 per cent, somewhat higher
than May's 3-4 per cent but still substantially slower than earlier in
the year. Such an increase would bring the annual growth rate in total
member bank deposits for the December-June period to 10 - 11 per cent
(9 - 10 per cent after allowing for reductions in Euro-dollar borrowings).
Deposit movements in June on average should continue the May
pattern of large shifts from U.S. Government to private balances.
With currency continuing its steady growth of around 6 per cent, the
projected increase in private demand deposits would result in money
supply expansion in June at an 8 - 11 per cent rate. Such an increase
in June would produce a growth rate for the recent expansion period
(December-June) of 6 - 7 per cent. Over the entire recent interval
of contraction and expansion of the money supply (June 1966-June 1967)
the growth rate would be 2.5 per cent.
Expansion in total time and savings deposits in June is
projected to continue at about the 13 per cent annual rate now expected
for May, with consumer-type CD's and passbook savings accounting for
all the growth. Favoring continued rapid growth in consumer time and
savings deposits are the lower returns available on competing short-
term market instruments and the continuing large volume of personal
savings being generated in the economy. The outlook for CD's in June
is for some decline around the mid-month tax and dividend dates, although
May 19, 1967.
CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -8- May 19, 1967.
these declines may be offset in part by stepped-up bank efforts to
attract longer-term CD's.
With only moderate expansion in bank credit projected for
June and with most of the net expansion concentrated in time deposits,
only a small increase in required reserves--on the order of 2 per cent,
annual rate-- is expected.
Effects of greater emphasis on coupon operations
If there is sufficient concern about present and immediately
prospective bond market conditions, a substantial portion of the System's
reserve supplying operations in the weeks ahead could be conducted in
coupon operations rather than bills, as was done in the last week.
Staff projections indicate a net need for expanded reserves amounting
to roughly half a billion dollars over the next four weeks.
The possible impact of such operations on longer-term bond
yields is most difficult to gauge in the current market environment.
In large measure, the level of bond yields will continue to be
dominated by market expectations, by the extent to which such
expectations are sustained by basic economic developments, and by
the flow of new capital issues. Use of System coupon operations
to supply part of the projected reserve needs over the next few
weeks might have only limited effects on market trends; indeed,
developments strengthening market expectations of an economic upturn
could overwhelm even substantial System purchases. But in the present
state of expectations, which still shows some evidence of indecision,
CONFIDENTIAL (FR)
official account purchases could be positive factors in helping to
clear away supplies of Government securities overhanging in the market.
In addition, such operations might be followed by a somewhat better
bond price performance if the upward rate movement to date has tended
to over-discount the near-term economic prospects and market pressures.
The configuration of interest rates and reserve relation-
ships delineated on pages 4 to 8 might be altered marginally by a
program of System coupon operations. In particular, Treasury bill
rates would tend to decline less than specified earlier, and there
could be minor sympathetic responses in other short-term rates. There
might also be some narrowing in the spread between short- and long-term
yields. But Federal funds and dealer loan rates would not likely be
affected by the shift in the pattern of System buying, and net
marginal reserve availability would, in the context of no change
in monetary policy, necessarily remain unchanged. Therefore, we would
anticipate no difference in the behavior of the monetary aggregates
from those projected above.
