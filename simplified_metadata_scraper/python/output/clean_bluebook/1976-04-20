Prefatory Note 
 
 
The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 
Please note that some material may have been redacted from this document if that 
material was received on a confidential basis.  Redacted material is indicated by

1  In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic 
format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Please note that the numbers and text in charts and 
tables were not reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

Recent developments
(1) M1 increased at about a 6½ per cent annual rate during March.
With incoming data for early April showing further strength, growth for
March and April combined now appears to be running at about a 7¼ per cent
annual rate, as compared with the 6 per cent mid-point of the Committee's
range. Growth in M2 over the March-April period is now projected at nearly
a 10 per cent annual rate, also above the mid-point of the Committee's
range. Inflows to savings accounts at banks, although below the extra-
ordinary February pace, have remained quite strong. Deposit growth at
nonbank thrift institutions also has been well maintained, with March
expansion at S&L's and savings banks combined running close to a 15 per
cent annual rate.

(2) During the intermeeting period, estimates of growth in M1
and M2 for March-April fluctuated around the mid-point of the FOMC's ranges,
and the Desk continued to aim for reserve availability consistent with
Federal funds trading around 4¾ per cent. In the four statement weeks since
the March meeting, excess reserves and member bank borrowing have averaged
$210 million and $50 million, respectively, both somewhat below their recent
levels. Nonborrowed reserves over the March-April period have shown little
net change, as reserves to support M1 and M2 continued to be released by
declines in CD's; in addition, more of the money growth than expected took
the form of currency, which requires no reserves.
(3) With the funds rate remaining stable, short-term interest
rates have dropped back to levels reached in mid-January, when the funds
rate first moved down into the 4¾ per cent range. These declines, together
with the relatively favorable performance of the wholesale and consumer
price indexes, have contributed to a further strengthening of investor
demands for longer-term investments. Since the last FOMC meeting, bond
yields have declined another 15 to 40 basis points despite the heavy recent
volume of new issues. In mortgage markets, rates have declined 5-10 basis
points further.

Prospective developments
(5) Alternative longer-run growth ranges for the monetary
aggregates are shown below for Committee consideration. They pertain to the
one year period from QI '76 to QI '77. The ranges shown under alternative B
are the same as those adopted in January for the QIV '75-QIV '76 period.
Alt. A Alt. B Alt. C
M1 5½-8½ 4½-7½ 3½-6½
M2 9-12 7¾-10¾ 6-9
M3  10-13 9-12 7½-10½
Proxy 7-10 6-9 5-8
(6) In considering these alternative longer-run targets, the
Committee may be interested in their relationship to the QIV '76 levels for
the monetary aggregates that were implied by the mid-points of the ranges
adopted in January. From the fourth quarter of '75 to first quarter of '76,
M2 and M3 expanded at annual rates very near the mid-points of the ranges
adopted previously (and shown above under alternative B); thus, continuation
of growth near these rates would be associated with QIV '76 levels close to
those implied by the earlier targets. However, M1 growth from the fourth
to first quarter--at a 2.9 per cent annual rate--was well below both the
lower limit of the longer-run range and the 6 per cent mid-point of
that range. To achieve the level in QIV '76 implied by the mid-point of the
earlier range, M1 would have to grow at almost a 7 per cent annual rate over
the last three quarters of this year. Assuming M1 growth returns to a 6 per
cent annual rate in the first quarter of 1977, this would imply a growth rate

longer-run ranges are suggested below:

M2 9½-13½ 8½-12½ 8-12
Federal funds rate 3¾-4¾ 4¼-¼ 4¾-5¾
(intermeeting range)
(8) The Federal funds rate range of alternative B is centered
on the recently prevailing 4¾ per cent level. Given the bulge in M1 in
early April, we expect that such a funds rate would be accompanied by M1
growth in a 5-9 per cent, annual rate, range over the April-May period.
With expansion in time and savings deposits other than large CD's remaining
relatively strong, M2 growth over the same period is likely to be in an
(9) M1 growth has been generally strengthening in recent months.
Part of the expansion in recent weeks may be attributable to declining
Treasury deposits, but on balance it seems likely that a somewhat more
typical relationship between M1 and GNP is being re-established. We would
expect M1 to grow at about a 7 per cent annual rate from the first to second
quarter. The staff expects that interest rates will soon have to begin
rising if growth over the one-year QI '76-QI '77 period is to be constrained
to 6 per cent--the mid-point of the longer-run growth range of alternative B.
Our projected Federal funds rate patterns through the first quarter of 1977
for all alternatives are shown in appendix table IV. Under alternative B,
the funds rate is expected to reach the 7 per cent level by early next
(10) If the funds rate stays around the mid-point of its
alternative B range over the next four weeks, short- and longer-term interest
rates are unlikely to change significantly. On April 28, the Treasury will
be announcing its mid-May refunding of some $4 billion of publicly-held
maturing debt. The Treasury may also raise about $1 -2 billion of new cash
at the same time. It is possible that a longer-term bond as well as a note
in the 7-10 year maturity area may be included in the offering. While the
volume of corporate and municipal bond offerings appears to be dropping
off from its exceptional March pace, the forward calendar remains high,
and substantial longer-term offerings by the Treasury could exert some
upward pressure on bond yields.
(11) Alternative C contemplates a gradual tightening of the
money market over the next four weeks to the mid-point of a 4¾-5¾ per cent
funds rate range in the process of moving toward lower longer-run growth
rates for the aggregates. In the short-run, however, the impact on M1
and M2 probably would be no more than minor because member banks would
respond to the reduced availability of nonborrowed reserves contemplated
under this alternative by increasing their borrowing. It is possible,
though, that a substantial upward adjustment in the Treasury bill and other
short-term rates would occur in response to signs of a sustained upward
movement in the funds rate. Under these conditions, if short-rates moved
well above the 5 per cent passbook ceiling rate, there could be sizable
outflows of interest-sensitive funds from savings accounts, particularly those
held by businesses and State and local governments. This would tend to drop
the rate of growth in M2 toward the bottom of the indicated April-May range.
(12) Under alternative C, we expect that interest rates would
have to rise considerably further to achieve a 5 per cent M1 growth from
QI '76 to QI '77. By early 1977, the funds rate might be around 7¾ per
(13) Under alternative A, the mid-point of the longer-run growth
target for M1 is 7 per cent. In order to achieve this more rapid growth,
money market conditions would probably have to ease somewhat over the
next few weeks, and the funds rate would probably remain below 5 per
cent until well into the summer months. Thereafter, however, interest
rates would need to rise, with the Federal funds rate probably reaching
the 6 per cent area in early 1977. Given the expected pattern of market
interest rates, interest-bearing deposits would likely remain quite strong
into the third quarter, but inflows would begin to slow later on as rates
on market instruments became more attractive.
(14) Over the period immediately ahead, internal funds available
to the business sector are expected to remain quite ample relative to
requirements generated by inventory and capital investment, so that little
pick-up in business short-term credit demands is anticipated. As expenditures
continue to rise, though, businesses later this year are expected to turn
increasingly to commercial banks and the paper market for funds. Under
alternatives A and B, banks are likely to have sufficient funds available
without reliance on significant increases in CD's. But under alternative
C limited fund flows by late this year could induce banks to rely
appreciably more on sales of CD's to satisfy credit demands.
Proposed directive
(15) Presented below are four alternative formulations for the
operational paragraph of the directive. The first three are couched in terms
of desired growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead and are intended
to correspond to the similarly lettered policy alternatives discussed in the
preceding section. The fourth alternative is proposed in the event that the
Committee wishes to formulate its instructions in terms of money market con-
ditions and wishes to maintain the conditions now prevailing. Since the
last meeting, exchange market conditions have tended to become stable,
although the pound and the lira remain subject to particular uncer-
tainties. Therefore, in all alternatives, we propose deleting the
specific reference to "the sensitive state of foreign exchange markets"
that was inserted at the last meeting, and restoring the previously long-
standing reference to international financial markets.
Alternative "Monetary Aggregates" Proposals
Alternative A
To implement this policy, while taking account of developments
in domestic AND INTERNATIONAL financial markets, [DEL: and the sensitive
state of foreign exchange markets,] the Committee seeks to achieve
bank reserve and money market conditions consistent with [DEL: moderate]
SUBSTANTIAL growth in monetary aggregates over the period ahead.
Alternative B
To implement this policy, while taking account of developments
in domestic AND INTERNATIONAL financial markets, [DEL; and the sensitive
state of foreign exchange markets,] the Committee seeks to achieve
bank reserve and money market conditions consistent with moderate
growth in monetary aggregates over the period ahead.
Alternative C
To implement this policy, while taking account of developments
in domestic AND INTERNATIONAL financial markets, [DEL; and the sensitve
state of foreign exchange markets,] the Committee seeks to achieve
bank reserve and money market conditions consistent with [DEL: moderate]
MODEST growth in monetary aggregates over the period ahead.
'Money Market" Proposal
To implement this policy, while taking account of developments
in domestic AND INTERNATIONAL financial markets, [DEL: and the sensitive
state of foreign exchange markets,] the Committee seeks to [DEL: achieve]
MAINTAIN PREVAILING bank reserve and money market conditions [DEL: consistent
with moderate growth in monetary aggregates] over the period ahead,
PROVIDED THAT MONETARY AGGREGATES APPEAR TO BE GROWING AT ABOUT THE
RATES CURRENTLY EXPECTED.
