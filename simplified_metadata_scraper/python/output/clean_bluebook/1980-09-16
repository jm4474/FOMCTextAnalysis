Prefatory Note
The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redacted passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked 
and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

Recent developments
(1) Growth of the narrow monetary aggregates accelerated
sharply to record rates in August and thus far in the third quarter is
well above the targets established by the Committee for the June to
September period, as shown in the first three columns of the table below.
Nonetheless, these monetary aggregates are within the Committee's target
ranges for the whole year 1980--with growth of M-1A in the lower half and
of M-1B in the upper half, as shown in the last two columns of the table.
M-2 is also running above the Committee's three-month path, but unlike the
narrow aggregates, growth for the year to date is above the Committee's
longer-run range.

(2) Early in the intermeeting period, when evidence of the
record increase in M-1A and M-1B for the first week of August first be-
came availabile, it became clear that the growth of the narrow monetary
aggregates would probably exceed the Committee's short-term objectives by a
substantial amount and that total reserves would be running well above path
as required reserves strengthened. Adherence to the nonborrowed reserve
path over the intermeeting period led to a rising level of adjustment
borrowing-from the $75 million initially assumed to a peak weekly average
level of almost $1.2 billion before falling back to about $535 million in
the most recent statement week. In recognition of the strength in total
reserves, the nonborrowed reserve path was reduced late in the period.

(3) The federal funds market firmed significantly following
the August Committee meeting, with the rate increasing from around 8 to
9 percent at the time of the last meeting to the 10¼ to 10½ percent area

the intermeeting period.
in early September and to the 10 to 11 percent zone most recently. Other
short-term interest rates rose over the period as well, responding not only
to the tighter funds market and the stronger money growth, but also to
further indications of an improving economic outlook and the disappointing
performance of measures of inflation. Rates fluctuated widely around the
rising trend, reflecting changing market expectations about the duration
of the bulge in monetary growth and the System's response to it. On
balance, Treasury bill rates and yields on private short-term paper are
now 1¼ to 1½ percentage points higher than at the time of the August meet-
ing and 3 to 3-3/4 percentage points above their early summer lows. The
bank prime rate was raised from 11 to 12¼ percent during the intermeeting
period as banks' costs of funds rose.
(4) Bond yields rose by ¼ to ½ of a percentage point after the
August Committee meeting, while mortgage rates rose by about 3/4 of a
percentage point. As long-term markets tightened, debt offerings by
corporations and State and local governments were reduced somewhat,
although remaining quite large. Treasury coupon issues have been limited
to offerings in regular note cycles since the mid-quarter financing.
(5) Bank credit expansion picked up to a 17 percent annual
rate in August, the most rapid expansion since early in the first quarter.
Banks continued to acquire securities at the rapid pace of other recent
months, and lending by banks increased substantially last month. Loans
to business firms in particular showed renewed strength as increases
in bank loan rates lagged those of short-term market alternatives and
as corporations relied less on capital markets. Nonfinancial firms paid
down outstanding commercial paper in August, in sharp contrast to the
strong growth of outstanding paper in the first half of the year.
(6) Despite the substantial rise in short-term interest
rates, the dollar has declined somewhat in foreign exchange markets on
a weighted average basis since the August FOMC meeting. Although
market participants also are beginning to show concern that the U.S.
recession may be ending with little lasting effect on the rate of
inflation, most of the intermeeting decline in the value of the dollar
reflected the strength of the yen and sterling against all currencies.

annual rates of change, in percents, for selected monetary and
financial flows over various time periods.

Prospective developments
(8) Shown below are alternative sets of monetary aggregate
targets for the four-month August to December period, and associated
federal funds rate ranges for the intermeeting period. The relationship
of the August to December targets to the Committee's longer-run ranges
is depicted in the charts following page 8. (Detailed data for these
aggregates are contained in the tables on pp. 7 and 8.)

(9) Monetary growth rates for the final four months of the
year proposed under these alternatives represent a substantial decelera-
tion from the summer pace. A considerable slowing in money growth appears
in train for September, a not unusual development after a month of
exceptionally rapid increase, reinforced by the lagged effect on money demand
of the considerable rise in short-term interest rates that has occurred since
June. However, money demand is expected to be relatively strong over
the last three months of the year, as transactions needs rise in reflection
of the 11 percent annual rate of increase projected for nominal GNP. Under
these circumstances, to restrain money growth between now and year-end to
the pace specified by either alternative A or B would appear to imply a
further rise of interest rates--with the rise under alternative B larger
and occurring sooner.

(10) Under alternative A, the expansion in M-A over the
balance of the year at a 5-1/4 percent annual rate would produce growth
over the one-year QIV '79 to QIV '80 policy period of 4-1/2 percent,
just below the midpoint of the Committee's 3-1/2 to 6 percent range. The
gap between growth in M-1B and M-1A over the balance of the year is
expected to be considerably wider than the 1/2 point implicit in the
Committee's longer-run targets, though narrower than the experience of
summer when growth in NOW and ATS accounts accelerated in response to the
same factors leading to a resurgence of savings deposits. From August to
December, M-1B under alternative A is expected to expand at a 7-1/2 percent
annual rate, leading to growth for the year at the upper limit of its range.
(11) Growth in M-2 under alternative A is projected to slow
to a 9 percent annual rate over the balance of the year, a rate that
would keep growth for the year above the upper end of the Committee's
longer-run range. The expected slowing over the next few months mainly
reflects reduced growth in the narrow money aggregates, but the increase
in the nontransactions component of M-2 also is expected to be less rapid
than in the summer. Growth in savings deposits has already slowed, and
money market funds have actually been declining. The latter are expected
to resume growing over the months ahead, as recent increases in market
interest rates augment the average yield on their portfolio, but not at
the very rapid pace of late spring and early summer.
(12) To achieve the growth in the aggregates specified under
alternative A, total reserves would have to expand at about a 6 percent
annual rate from August to December, and, given the near-term pattern of
growth, by about a 7 percent annual rate from August to October. Assuming
adjustment borrowing of around $600 million--close to the average of recent
weeks but below the level expected for the current statement week--the
nonborrowed reserve path would call for growth at little over a 4
percent annual rate from August to October, with the federal funds rate
probably around 10-1/2--10-3/4 percent.
(13) Short-term interest rates are not expected to rise
significantly further over the next few weeks under alternative A.
Indeed, some temporary drop in short rates could occur as bank reserve
positions under this alternative may be less taut than market participants
currently expect. But business borrowing demand is expected to remain
relatively large as the economy strengthens. The recent tilt in the
distribution of borrowing toward short- from long-term markets could
persist but the continuing need to restructure balance sheets is expected
to keep long-term borrowing sizable over the months ahead. With short-
rates remaining relatively high and the economy apparently strengthening,
there appears to be little scope for declines in bond or mortgage rates.
Indeed, mortgage rates could drift up a bit more under alternative A, in
part reflecting the recent run-up in the cost of deposits.
(14) Alternative B calls for about 2 percentage points less
growth in M-1A and M-1B than alternative A over the last four months
of the year. For the one year QIV '79-QIV '80 period, growth in M-1A
would be 4 percent and M-1B 6 percent, in the lower and upper halves
of their respective ranges. M-2 growth would also be slower under
this alternative, but by considerably less than the narrow aggregates,
as the restraining effect of rising market interest rates is blunted by
upward adjustments in yields on interest-bearing deposits and other assets
in M-2. Over the QIV '79-QIV '80 period, M-2 growth would remain above
the Committee's upper limit under this alternative.
(15) The specifications for alternative B would require
total reserve growth from August to October at a little more than a 6
percent annual rate. Assuming adjustment borrowings of about $800 million,
nonborrowed reserves would expand at about a 1/2 percent annual rate. Given
this reserve path, the funds rate would probably be 11 percent or a little
higher, and other short-term rates might edge up from current levels.
Mortgage rates would probably rise noticeably further, as thrift institutions
become increasingly concerned about the cost and availability of deposits.
The dollar might take on a stronger tone in foreign exchange markets.
Directive language
(16) Given below are suggested operational paragraphs for
the directive consistent with the form of the directive adopted at
the August meeting. The language calls for expansion of reserve aggre-
gates at a pace consistent with the desired rate of monetary growth
over the last four months of the year, provided that the weekly average
federal funds rate remains within a specified range. The specifications
adopted at the August meeting are shown in strike-through form.
In the short run, the Committee seeks expansion of reserve
aggregates consistent with growth of M-1A, M-1B, and M-2 over the
[DEL: third quarter of 1980] AUGUST TO DECEMBER PERIOD at annual rates
of about [DEL: 6½] ____ percent, [DEL: 9] ____ percent, and [DEL: 12] ____ percent
respectively, provided that in the period before the next regular
meeting the weekly average federal funds rate remains within a
range of [DEL: 8] ____ to [DEL: 14] ____ percent.
If it appears during the period before the next meeting that
the constraint on the federal funds rate is inconsistent with the
objective for the expansion of reserves, the Manager for Domestic
Operations is promptly to notify the Chairman, who will then decide
whether the situation calls for supplementary instructions from
the Committee.
