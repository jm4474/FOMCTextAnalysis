Prefatory Note
The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redacted passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked 
and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

Class II – FOMC
MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES
Recent D evelopments
(1) The events in financial markets prior to the terrorist attacks might seem
to read like ancient history by now:  The Committee’s quarter-point reduction in the
intended federal funds rate on  August 21 was widely  expected and  barely sent a ripp le
through markets.  In the days that followed, most market interest rates edged lower in
light of generally downbeat news on  the economy, including the release of the August
employment data in ear ly September, and broad  equity indexes fell apprec iably.
Shortly after the terrorist attacks on September 11, the System announced that the
discount window was available to meet liquidity needs and began to provide a massive
amount of reserves through the window later that day and through open market
operations on the next day.  (See the box for a discussion of Desk operations and
reserve markets in the aftermath of the attacks.)  Market participants  evidently
interpreted the interruptions to production and spending ensuing from the terrorist
attacks and the possible knock-on effects on asset prices and confidence as
necessitating a considerable monetary policy response.  In the event, on September
17, the FOMC reduced the target federal funds rate ½ percentage point to 3 percent
and said in the press release that unusually large volumes of liquidity would continue
to be supplied until more normal financial market functioning was restored.  In recent
days, investors appear to be interpreting the sketchy information available on
economic conditions since September 11 as pointing to a gloomier outlook for the
economy, and federal funds futures quotes seem to incorporate high odds of another
50 basis point move at the October meeting and further easing in coming months that
would bring the funds rate to the neighborhood of 2 to 2¼ percent by early next year
(Chart 2).  As has been the case for some time, market participants apparently expect
that policy will reverse course fairly promptly, with about 1 percentage point of
firming next year embedded in market interest rates, although option prices indicate
that investors are unusual ly uncertain about this trajectory.
Desk Operations and Reserve Markets in the Wake of the Sept. 11 Attacks
The operations of some banks and federal funds brokers were seriously disrupted by the
effects of the terrorist attacks.  To help deal with these dislocations to markets and
payment systems, the System provided an immense volume of reserves through open
marke t operations and d iscount w indow lending  and also  established swap  lines with
several foreign central banks, one of which was partially drawn down (as shown in the
table in Chart 1).  A large add itional volume of reserves was created by check float as air
transportation was halted.  Although other factors–notably a significant expansion in the
foreign RP pool–absorbed a portion of these reserves, reserve balances swelled
dramatically, peaking at $114 billion on September 13.  The System suspended its fees and
penalties for daylight and overnight overdrafts for a time to ease the challenges banks
faced in managing reserve positions.  To facilitate settlement in the Treasury securities
market, the Desk temporarily eased its rules on securities lending, and dealers borrowed
record amounts of securities from the System.  Late in the week, discount window
borrowing plunged, returning to more normal levels as a result of the enlarged volume of
nonborrowed reserves and better functioning of the reserve market.  As air transportation
resumed, the level of float dropped back to more u sual levels by ea rly the following week.
With the fed funds market functioning more normally, the Desk gradually cut back
the provision of reserves through open market operations, and the level of reserve
balances began to drop sharply.  Nonetheless, the demand for and supply of
reserve balances has remained somewhat above usual levels.
In the immediate aftermath of the attacks, banks mostly traded reserves at the 3½ 
percent target federal funds rate under an informal convention, with a substantial
proportion of direct, rather than brokered, transactions.  As more normal
functioning resumed in the funds market, the federal funds rate fell below the
FOMC’s formal targets for several days but fluctuated around the new target last
week (as seen in  the lower panel of Chart 1 ).

(2) Rates on short- and intermediate-term Treasury securities fell about 60
to 110 basis points on balance over the intermeeting period, with the bulk of the
decline occurring after September 11.  The prices for these securities appear to have
been boosted by actual and expected easing of the stance of monetary policy as well as
safe-haven demands amid sharp fluctuations in equity prices and heightened global
economic and po litical uncertainties.  Yields on ten-year Treasury notes declined
about 30 basis points, however, and those on thirty-year bonds were flat, buoyed in
part by investor concerns about the deteriorating outlook for the federal budget
surplus and the future supply of Treasury debt.
(3) Some of the infrastructure of the Treasury securities market was
damaged or destroyed by the terrorist actions.  Since then, market functioning has
improved considerably but remains somewhat impaired.  Virtually all brokers and
dealers have resumed operations, although many are operating at backup locations
and a number of firms have scaled back their market-making.  Trading volumes for
on-the-run issues have returned to historical ranges, and bid-asked spreads have
narrowed.  Nonetheless, such spreads remain slightly elevated, the amounts that can
be transacted at those spreads are smaller than usual, and trading  in off-the-run issues
is quite limited.  W hile clearance and  settlement mechanisms are now generally
performing normally, market participants report that a considerable volume of trades
from September 11  have yet to be reconciled.  Partly as a consequence, the incidence
of failed securities trades remains relatively high.
(4) Yields on investment-grade corporate bonds were generally about
unchanged on balance over the intermeeting period, with the exception of those on
relatively short-term or very highly rated obligations, such as federal agency debt,
which dropped considerably.  Junk bond yields, however, jumped more than  100 basis
points over the period.  Issuance of corporate bonds ceased for a few days after
September 11, and investment-grade firms have accounted for virtually all the issuance
since then.  Trading activity in secondary markets for corporate bonds also has picked
up in recent days but remains noticeably below normal, particularly in the h igh-yield
sector.  The commercial paper market was significantly disrupted, leading to brief
involuntary extensions of paper that would otherwise have matured, but issuance and
activity have since rebounded; during the interruption, some firms reportedly drew on
backup lines of credit at commercial banks.  Discussions with several large banks
indicate that most have not yet adjusted their terms and standards for business loans
since September 11, but loan requests from firms in selected industries are being
scrutinized more carefully; some of the banks contacted said that loan demand had
weakened notably .  Equity markets were closed for  four days following the attacks.
After the markets reopened, broad  equity price indexes tumbled, but in recent days
they have recovered part of those losses on balance, bringing their cumulative declines
over the intermeeting period to  13 to 22 percent.  Intraday price changes in the equity
market were quite large, and forward-looking measures of uncertainty inferred from
options prices are unusually high.
(5) The dollar’s average exchange value against other major currencies was
about unchanged on balance over the intermeeting period, as modest dollar
appreciation early in the period was erased following the attacks.  The dollar var ied in
a wide range against the yen, ending the period ¾ percent lower.  Against the euro,
the dollar slipped ½ percent on balance.  In contrast, the dollar gained about
2 percent vis-à-vis the Canadian dollar, as investors reacted to signs that the slowdown
in that country could be particularly abrupt.  Central banks in most foreign industrial
countries appreciably eased policy after the attacks, typically by 50 basis points, but
long-term yields generally moved little on net.  Share prices fell sharply on all major
exchanges, in many cases by more than in this country.                                                   ,
U.S. authorities did not intervene for the ir
own accounts.
(6) The dollar’s exchange value against the currencies of our other important
trading partners rose 2 percent during the intermeeting period, driven especially by the
reaction in Latin  American markets to  the more uncertain globa l economic
environment.  The dollar gained 7¼ percent against the Brazilian real, and it rose 4¾
percent against the peso, as Mexican output declined and as investors worried about
an intensification of the spillovers from the U.S. slowdown.  Trading in emerging
market debt was severely reduced for almost a week.  Once trading recovered,
emerging market bond spreads increased sharply, with those on Latin American
sovereign debt widening by 50 to 200 basis points on net over the intermeeting
(7) M2 growth sp iked to an estimated 19 percent annual rate in September
as the result of a record $165 billion surge in this aggregate for the week ending
September 17.  In that week, disruptions to the infrastructure of financial markets led
to a large involuntary accumulation of liquid deposits, which is expected to have
largely run off in the subsequent week.  A heightened demand for safe and  liquid
assets apparently encouraged  further substitutions from equity mutua l funds into
deposits in M2.  The flight to safety and the intermeeting policy easing spurred a
resurgence in institution-only money market funds in September, further lifting M3
growth.  Domestic nonfinancial sector deb t expanded a t a 4¾ percen t pace in August,
about in line w ith its average growth since the fourth quarter  of last year.  The growth
of nonfedera l debt remained relatively low, as the liquidation of inventories likely

allowed firms to run off short-term debt.  With the Treasury raising funds to finance
tax rebates, federal debt rose at around a 7½ percent annual rate in August, somewhat
faster than in the previous month.
Policy Alternatives
(8) The information that had accumulated up to September 11  pointed to
weaker economic activity than the staff had anticipated at the time of the August
FOMC meeting .  Since then, in response to the dislocations to economic activity
arising from the terrorist attacks, the further drop in equity prices, and an expected
marking down of household and business confidence, the staff has revised down
substantially its near-term outlook and now shows a mild downturn in real GDP in
the Greenbook this year and only a modest uptick, on balance, in the first half of
2002.  In light of this much weaker outlook, the staff has assumed that the federal
funds rate will be reduced another 50 basis points this fall and then held steady at 2½
percent until it is raised gradually in the second half of 2003.  Fiscal policy is assumed
to provide a moderate impetus to growth over the next two years.  Long-term interest
rates are expected  to hold at about their current levels into early next year and then to
drift down, the dollar to depreciate slightly, and equity prices to fall in the near term
on earnings disappointments but to trend higher thereafter.  With the growth of
spending projected to fall short of that of potential output growth until mid 2002, the
unemployment rate is expected to reach 6¼ percent and then to decline just slightly
toward the end of the forecast period.  The resulting slack in resources, as well as the
pass-through effects of lower oil prices, allows core PCE and CPI inflation to edge
down to 1½ percent and 2¼ percent, respectively, in 2003.
(9) If the Committee, like the staff, saw a high probability of protracted
economic weakness ahead and, as a consequence, a substantial rise in the
unemployment rate and a decline in core inflation, it presumably would  ease policy
further, as assumed in the Greenbook.  The Committee may see the staff forecast as
embodying an appreciable enough downward revision to the prospects for spending
and inflation pressures to justify reducing the intended federal funds rate 50 basis
points at this meeting.  The equilibrium real federal funds rate, which summarizes the
more persistent factors shaping spending and pressures on resources, is now
estimated to be about a full percentage point lower than was thought at the time of
the August meeting according to the measures based on the staff forecast as well as
historical data (as discussed in the box).  Even if the Committee did not think that the
factors depressing spending were likely to be long lasting enough to lower the
equilibrium real funds rate to that extent, those forces still might be seen as
sufficiently persistent to  warrant add itional policy easing for a time.  In addition, with
household  and business confidence possibly fragile, the Committee  may consider it
important to be seen as moving aggressively with another half percentage point
easing.  Indeed, given the prevailing expectation among market participants of such an
action, the Committee might be concerned that a smaller-sized ease could trigger an
inappropr iate tightening of other financial conditions that could prove especially
problemat ic given the remain ing strains in  the financial  market infrastructure.
Moreover, the Committee may believe that, if aggregate demand proves to be
surprisingly strong, the cost of having eased policy a little too much a t this time would
be relatively small given that inflation expectations are likely to remain well contained.
(10) Investors have largely priced in a  ½ percentage point easing at this
meeting, along with a characterization of the balance of risks as pointed toward
economic weakness.  Accordingly, financial market prices likely would be little
changed if such expectations were realized.  As always, the press release will be
scrutinized for hints of the Comm ittee’s policy intention going forward, and any sense
in the statement that there were higher-than-expected odds of subsequent policy
easing  would trigger a downward ad justment of the expected path of the funds rate .
In that circumstance, short- and intermediate-term interest rates would likely decline
and equity prices increase.
Equilibrium Real Federal Funds Rate Estimates
One way to assess the stance of monetary policy is by comparing the actual real
federal funds rate to estimates of its equilibrium level.  The equilibrium real federal
funds rate can be defined as the rate consistent with output being at its potential
level once the effects of transitory shocks–those with  dynamics that play out within
a few years–have dissipated.  Chart 4 shows the range spanned by five estimates of
the equilibrium federal funds rate calculated by Board staff, as well as the actual real
federal funds rate and the real funds rates implied by the po licy alternatives
discussed in the text.  (The real funds rate is measured as the nominal federal funds
rate less the lagged four-quarter change in core PCE prices as a proxy for expected
inflation.)
The recent behavior of these measures is shown in the table below the chart.  The
two estimates of the equilibrium rate based on the historical data have declined over
the intermeeting period because current-quarter activity now appears likely to be
weaker than had previously been anticipated.  The two measures of the equilibrium
rate based on the historical data augmented  by the staff projection have declined
considerably further, reflecting the much weaker assessment of aggregate demand
embodied in the staff forecast.  By contrast, the estimate of the equilibrium federal
funds rate based on indexed Treasury yields has changed little.
The revisions to  the measures of the equilibrium funds ra te, while substantial in
some cases, are fairly modest relative to the uncertainty associated with the
estimates.  In the case of the statistical filter method, standard errors of the
estimates can be calculated.  For 2001Q3, these standards errors imply that a 90-
percent confidence interval is roughly 2¼ percentage points on each side of the
point  estimate.

(11) Easing policy 25 basis points at this meeting might be seen by the
Committee as sufficient to induce an adequate recovery of economic growth over the
time frame that such policy action would be felt on spending.  The Committee might
be especially inclined  to adopt this option if it had reason to suspect tha t aggregate
demand would snap back relatively promptly.  For example, the Committee may read
the current political climate as indicating that a considerable degree of fiscal stimulus
is in the offing.   Or the Committee may be of the view that much of the adverse
effects of the terrorist attacks on confidence is likely to be short lived.  In any case,
the outlook for fiscal policy, the state of confidence, and the economy more generally
is quite uncertain at this time, and the Committee may prefer to await further
developments before committing to a larger policy action.  If events turn more
adverse than expected in coming  weeks, an additional easing step could be taken even
before the next meeting.  In contrast, should aggregate demand prove resilient, this
relatively modest ease would provide a b it more assurance of eventually bringing core
inflation down.
(12) The announcement of a 25 basis point easing would surprise market
participants, likely prompting a rise in interest rates, particularly at the short end of the
yield curve, as well as a decline in stock prices.  While the market fully expects an
announcement that the risks remain tilted toward weakness, a more explicit suggestion
of the Committee’s readiness to consider further steps, even in the intermeeting
period, wou ld work to lim it the market reaction to th is policy choice.
(13) Under the Greenbook forecast, the growth of domestic nonfinancial
debt is expected  to remain subdued in the months ahead.  The federal government is
forecast to resume paying down debt, albeit  at a slower ra te than earlier  this year.
Household and business debt is pro jected to continue to expand  moderately  in
reflection of the weak outlook for consumer and investment spending.  Much of the
bulge in emergency financing provided by banks immediately following the terrorist
attack should be repaid quick ly, as bond and paper markets have made considerab le
progress in returning to more normal operations.  However, in light o f the likely
increased perception of and lessened willingness to take on risk, investors will
probably rem ain more cautious in extending credit to lower-rated firms, as reflected in
widened risk spreads since the terrorist actions.  Home mortgage borrowing should be
fairly well maintained because of continuing low interest rates.
(14) Under the  assumptions of the Greenbook forecast, M 2 growth is
projected to slow to a 5½ percent pace over the September-to-March period, owing
to declines in household incomes, the waning of effects on money demand of the
cumulative policy easings, and the running off of balances bloated by market
disruptions.  Over the four quarters of 2001, M2 is expected to post robust growth of
around 10 percent, boosted not only by declines in the opportunity cost of holding
money but also by the surge in mortgage refinancings, by unusual demands for U.S.
currency, especially in Argentina, and by the reduced attractiveness of stock market
investments relative to deposits and money funds.  Partly because of these special
factors, the velocity of M2 is expected to drop at a record annual rate of 6¾ percent
this year, faster than would be predicted by the traditional relationsh ip of velocity to
opportunity costs.
Directive and Balance of Risks Language
(15) Presented below for the members' consideration is draft wording for (1)
the directive and (2) the “balance of risks” sentence to be included in the press release
issued after the meeting (not par t of the directive).
(1) Directive Wording
The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial
conditions that will foster price stab ility and promote sustainable growth in
output.  To further its long-run  objectives, the Committee in the immediate
future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with MAINTAINING/
INCREASING/reducing the federal funds rate AT/to an average of around
___3 percent.
(2) “Balance of Risks” Sentence
Against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and
sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the
Committee believes that the risks [ARE BALANCED WITH RESPECT TO
PROSPECTS FOR BOTH GOALS] [ARE WEIGHTED MAINLY
TOWARD CONDITIONS THAT MAY  GENERATE HEIGHTENED
INFLATION PRESSURES] [continue to be weighted m ainly toward
conditions that may generate economic weakness] in the foreseeable future.
