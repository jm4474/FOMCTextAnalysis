MONEY MARKET AND RESERVE RELATIONSHIPS
Recent developments
A marginal reduction in market pressures has developed since
the last meeting of the Committee in the wake of fiscal legislation and
of open market operations. In the market for day-to-day money, the
effective Federal funds rate has centered around 6 per cent, as com-
pared with 6-1/8 per cent during the 3 weeks prior to the previous
Committee meeting, and dealer loan rates have also eased fractionally.
The rate charged on System RP's to dealers was reduced from the 5-3/4
per cent rate prevailing since late April to 5-5/8 per cent.
The reserve position of banks also has been under less pressure
in recent weeks. After averaging about $735 million in the last two
statement weeks of June, member bank borrowings declined to an average
of around $450 million in the first two statement weeks ending in July,
as major banks accelerated their borrowing from the Euro-dollar
market and as the basic reserve deficit of principal money market banks
improved seasonally. Net borrowed reserves fluctuated between $100
and $300 million in the past two weeks; country banks first reduced
and then increased excess reserves, though the average level was lower
than usual for this time of year.
Yields on nearly all maturities in the U.S. Government
securities market are about 20 basis points below levels prevailing
on June 18, with the 3-month bill most recently around 5-3/8 per cent.
However, other short-term rates have declined less and some not at all;

for example, yields on commercial and finance company paper remain un-
changed from their mid-June levels. These yields are typically less
sensitive to expectations than yields on Treasury securities, and tend
to move more in relation to current flows of funds. Yields in private
long-term capital markets showed little change for most of the period
since the last Committee meeting, but corporate bond yields declined
in the past two days, triggered by the good market reception accorded
the key Jersey Standard bond issue. Municipal yields, too, declined
in recent days.
In the days immediately following the last Committee meeting,
bill rates were pushed sharply lower, as a combined result of several
factors; demands for bills by holders of maturing June tax bills which
had not been turned in for taxes, unusually large System bill purchases
to offset the reserve effects of international developments, and initial
reactions to the passage of the fiscal package. While all bill rates
declined, the 3-month bill fell most sharply, dropping 40 basis points
to 4.20 per cent bid on June 21, below the lower end of the range
anticipated in the last Blue Book. The 3-month bill rate dropped low
relative to other short-term rates largely because of a technical short-
age of such bills for trading; the rate rebounded to around the mid 5.30's
within two days. Other bill yields, which had not declined quite as
much, did not rebound like the 3-month bill.
Bank credit expanded at a 6 per cent annual rate in June, the
upper end of the range anticipated in the last Blue Book. As bill rates
declined, banks were able to rebuild CD's substantially after the mid-
June tax date. Over the month of June, outstanding CD's declined only
CONFIDENTIAL (FR)
$250 million, which is about half the seasonal decline. Banks reduced
offering rates on maturities of 6-months or longer to around 6-1/8 per
cent. Rates on 3-month maturities remain at their ceilings.
The money supply in June rose at about a 7 per cent annual
rate, a shade below the range of expectations. U.S. Government deposits
showed a very small increase during the month.
The behavior of key monetary variables (as annual rates of
increase) is shown for longer time periods in the table below.

Prospective developments
Bank credit and deposit growth in July and August together
will be strongly influenced by the need to supply reserves to the
banking system to help finance $7.5 billion of Treasury cash needs
(including the $4 billion of tax bills already marketed in July), as
well as private demands associated with the tax legislation. If
currently prevailing money market conditions--as specified below--are
to be maintained under these circumstances, total reserves would have
to grow at a 7 - 9 per cent annual rate, on average, during the two months.
But nonborrowed reserves are likely to grow more rapidly, reflecting a
tendency for member banks to borrow less from the Federal Reserve with
market interest rates having moved lower relative to the discount rate.
Most of the increase in the reserve aggregates will be reflected in the
August figure, but much of the expansion will be underway in the latter
half of July and carry through to August.
Outstanding bank credit in July, as measured on a daily average
basis by the proxy, is expected to be about 1 - 4 per cent (annual rate)
above the average amount outstanding in June. The trend of growth in
the course of the month is expected to be rising, as banks position or
finance the March and April tax bills sold by the Treasury with 100 per
cent tax and loan credit (for payment July 11) and as banks help finance
the $1 billion or so of additional tax payments to be made by corporations
in mid-July in connection with the new tax law. In August, the bank
credit proxy may rise in a 10 - 12 per cent annual rate range, on average--
assuming the Treasury raises another $3 billion of new cash during the
July 12, 1968
CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -5- July 12, 1968
month, a substantial part of which possibly will be at the time of the
mid-August refunding. For the two months taken together, the bank credit
proxy may be expected to rise in a 6 - 8 per cent, annual rate, range.
It is too early to have a very precise idea of Treasury
financing plans for August, however. Apart from the need to raise new
cash, the Treasury will have to roll over $3.7 billion of publicly held
securities maturing in mid-August. It is possible that all of the
financing need (apart from continued cash additions to the weekly bill
auctions) could be satisfied through a combination of relatively short-
and longer-term notes; however, depending on the market outlook and
other factors, some of the cash could be raised through a PC, and/or
through additional tax bills. The specific nature and timing of the
financing(s) will, of course, affect the credit proxy measure.
Euro-dollar borrowings may add about 2 percentage points to
the above bank credit figures in July, but it is not expected that such
borrowings will be sufficient to add significantly to bank credit growth
in August. It is even possible that liabilities of U.S. banks in the
Euro-dollar market will decline by August, if confidence is restored in
the franc and sterling and if domestic funds remain somewhat more readily
This bank reserve and credit outlook for the weeks immediately
ahead assumes that the Federal funds rate remains around 6 per cent, but
is not infrequently below that rate; that net borrowed reserves are
generally in a $200 - $350 million range; that member bank borrowings
are in a $500 - $600 million area (as borrowings remain below their
May-June average, but rise from recent seasonally low levels); and
CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -6- July 12, 1968
that the 3-month bill rate is most frequently in a 5.30 -- 5.55 per
cent range. Bill rates would not be expected to decline much
from recent levels; and they might rise, because the pressure on bank
reserve positions implicit in the specifications above would probably
be sufficient to keep dealer financing costs fairly high, with 6-1/8 --
6-3/8 per cent the most frequent charge for new money in New York.
Dealer bill positions in the longer bill area have built up
substantially in recent days as dealers have bought from banks a fairly
sizable proportion of the new tax bills. Dealers have been willing
buyers in the expectation that monetary conditions would probably ease
in the weeks ahead. But continued relatively high financing costs are
likely to erode dealer willingness to position bills unless private
demand for bills is unusually strong. Mainly for seasonal reasons, the
System is not expected to be a very large net buyer in the market
between now and the next meeting of the Committee, in contrast to its
large net purchases of securities over the past few weeks. The System
is likely to have to absorb a moderate amount of reserves during the
next two weeks, and will return to the buying side of the market in late
July and early August; but foreign operations may be a factor continuing
to complicate domestic open market operations.
With bill rates remaining around or somewhat above recent
levels, banks would be able to add to outstanding negotiable CD's.
Under these conditions, we expect such CD's outstanding to rise by
around $1 billion in July, which would be about twice the seasonal in-
crease. Such a pace of expansion may not be sustained in August, however,
CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -7- July 12, 1968
partly because banks might bid less aggressively if loan demands diminish
after the July tax borrowing has passed.
Consumer-type time and savings deposits are expected to recover
in July and August from their sharply reduced growth rate of the second
quarter. But their rate of expansion is expected to remain moderate,
mainly because the combination of prevailing money market conditions
and further Treasury financings are likely to inhibit declines in both
short- and long-term market interest rates. The tax increase may also
absorb some funds that would otherwise flow into savings accounts.
Over-all, total time and savings deposits of banks may rise in a 7 - 10
per cent annual rate range in July, and about the same in August.
The money supply in July is expected to expand in a 8 - 10
per cent, annual rate, range. This high average rate of expansion for
the month in large part reflects the accelerated growth in private demand
deposits during the three statement weeks ending July 3, a period when
U.S. Government deposits were declining sharply. Money supply growth
is expected to slow sharply in the latter part of July and in August,
when Treasury cash balances are expected to rise substantially on balance.
For August the money supply may show little change on average.
While deposit growth is likely to pick up in the weeks ahead,
such growth may not be sufficient to enable banks to rebuild very much
liquidity or to adopt easier lending terms. Banks may be expected to
become somewhat more active in longer-term markets. However, in view
of the Treasury financing in prospect, significant declines in long-term
CONFIDENTIAL (FR)
rates might not develop until current large corporate bond market
demands moderate, or if signs of weaker business activity become more
evident to the market.
Policy alternative. Open market operations oriented toward
attaining somewhat easier money market conditions would probably en-
courage some further reductions in bill rates, a downward movement in
the more sluggish short-term rates, and declines in long-term interest
rates. Such easier conditions could entail a Federal Funds rate around
5-3/4 per cent, a net reserve position of banks in a 0 to minus $200
million range, and member bank borrowings in a $350 - $500 million range.
The 3-month bill rate would likely be in a 5-1/8 -- 5-3/8
per cent range under these circumstances. And expectations of a discount
rate decrease might be generated in the market as the spread of the
discount rate above the bill rate widens. Such expectations might dis-
courage some borrowing over the short-run in capital markets, and encourage
some investors to move funds into the market, thus exerting downward
pressures on longer-term interest rates.
With a lower over-all interest rate level, it is possible that
bank credit expansion will be somewhat more rapid than under currently
prevailing money market conditions. Interest rates are unlikely to fall
enough to stimulate business loan demand, which would be held down by the
expected cut-back in inventory building. But banks may become more eager
to rebuild their portfolio positions in order to capture the available
relatively high yields. Over-all, under the easing policy alternative
specified, one might expect a bank credit growth in a 7-9 per cent
annual rate range for July and August together.
