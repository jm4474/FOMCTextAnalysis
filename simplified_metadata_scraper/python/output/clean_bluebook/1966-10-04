Prefatory Note 
 
 
The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 
Please note that some material may have been redacted from this document if that

1  In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic 
format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Please note that the numbers and text in charts and 
tables were not reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

MONEY MARKET AND RESERVE RELATIONSHIPS
Recent developments
Since the last meeting of the Committee, conditions in the
money market have been alternately tight and relatively comfortable, with
the swings importantly influenced by expectational factors. In the two
auctions surrounding the mid-September tax date, the 3-month bill rate
rose sharply to a peak of 5.59 per cent, partly as a result of the
market's initial reaction to the changed Treasury financing picture and
partly as a result of fears about a mid-September money market squeeze.
The rate subsequently declined to around 5.35 per cent as demand for
bills from the public strengthened markedly at the higher rate levels,
as pressures associated with the tax date were quite moderate, and, in
very recent days, as the System returned to the buying side of the market.
The recent decline in bill rates was accompanied by a general
relaxation of the taut money market conditions that had emerged around
mid-September. In particular, the Federal funds rate declined during the
past two statement weeks, with trading frequently at rates below 5 per
cent. As a result, average dealer financing costs were reduced, and
dealers became more willing to bid aggressively for bills.
The recent more comfortable money market conditions could
have been related to banks' having prepared for stronger loan demands
and larger CD run-offs than actually materialized. Loan growth during
September was partly held down by tight bank lending policies but demands

also appear to have weakened somewhat. In addition to a sharp drop in
security loans, business loans by banks for the month of September are
estimated to have increased by an 11 per cent annual rate, as compared
a
with/9 per cent rate in the June-August period.
With respect to CD's, major reporting banks'net losses for
the month are estimated at $1. 2 billion. Such a net loss is equivalent
o one-fourth of maturities during the month, a smaller run-off than many
bankers had thought likely. The better experience of banks partly reflects
the almost $500 million of 33-day CD's obtained in midmonth as a result
of a corporate merger.
Under these circumstances, excess reserves of banks were
considerably larger than usual in mid-September, when banks were also
adjusting to higher reserve requirements on time deposits. With excess
reserves enlarged, total reserves expanded in September at a 4 per cent
annual rate, but both nonborrowed and required reserves showed declines.
The bank credit proxy also showed a slight decline for the month (-.5 per
cent annual rate, on the basis of preliminary figures and revised seasonal
factors), but it would show about a 1.5 per cent increase when adjusted
to include funds obtained from banks through their branches abroad. In
the month, private demand deposits and the money supply rose 8 per cent
and 7 per cent respectively.
Partly reflecting sharp fluctuations in excess reserves, net
borrowed reserves varied widely over the past three weeks, averaging about
$380 million. Borrowings of member banks drifted down in the more

comfortable money market environment after mid-September and averaged
$710 million over the past two statement weeks.
Prospective developments
Treasury bill rates will be influenced in the days immediately
ahead by relatively low dealer bill positions. It is not clear that
these positions will lead to much further rate declines, however, since
lower bill rates, especially on shorter maturities will decrease incentives
for switching out of CD's. Moreover, the Treasury will soon be announcing
its October bill financing, which may be in the $3-3.5 billion range.
All things considered, a range of fluctuation for the 3-month
bill rate of 5.25-5.60 per cent seems most likely over the next four weeks.
A sustained movement toward the upper end of the range is likely to depend
on a strengthening of loan demands -- given current bank lending policies --
and a concomitant rise in the Federal funds rate back to the neighborhood
of 6 per cent. The outlook for financing needs of both business and the
Federal Government suggests that banks are likely to be more pressed to
make loans in the period and therefore that they will tend to increase
their demand for reserve funds both through the discount window and in
the Federal funds market.
The availability to banks of funds from time and savings
deposits is likely to be no greater in October than it was in September
(when it rose by 1.5 per cent on average). In fact, taking into account
the apparently slightly more favorable competitive position of nonbank
savings institutions under the new structure of ceiling rates, the
CONFIDENTIAL (FR)
CONFIDENTIAL (FR) - 3 -
September 30, 1966
competition from Treasury and other open market paper, and recent CD
experience, banks' time and savings deposits might show a small decline
on balance in October. In that month, we are assuming a further $1.5
billion reduction in CD's outstanding, a rate of disintermediation that is
equivalent to roughly one or two percentage points on the bank credit
Assuming that the existing FOMC directive language of "firm
but orderly conditions in the money market" would comprehend some tightening
from money market conditions of the moment but not beyond the bounds of
recent experience, total and required reserves may rise by about 5 and
Federal and private credit demands. This reserve growth would be
sufficient to accommodate a private demand deposit expansion of about
apply). Government deposits can also be expected to rise during the month
on average as a result of the Treasury financing, but the continuing high
level of Federal expenditures is expected to keep the rise to modest
proportions. The bank credit proxy would, under these conditions, be
projected to expand by about 5-6 per cent in October, largely reflecting
the effect of the Treasury financing.
This assumed pattern of developments in October would mean
a money supply increase of only about 1 per cent annual rate since midyear
and of about 3 per cent for the year to date. Bank credit growth, as
measured by the proxy, would be about 3 per cent and 5 per cent over
CONFIDENTIAL (FR)
CONFIDENTIAL (FR) - 4 -
September 30, 1966
those respective periods (and 4.5 per cent and 6.5 per cent respectively
when funds obtained through foreign branches are included).
The outlook for the coming month is consistent with a tendency
not only for short-term markets to tighten but also for long-tenn rates
to rise. Actual long-term rate movements, however, are likely to be
dominated by such expectational factors as peace or tax prospects.
In the money markets a failure of rates to tend upward may
mean that banks are under less loan pressure than we currently foresee
and, therefore, that banks will have less of an inclination to borrow
from the System. Such a development would be consistent with a constella-
tion of relatively shallow net borrowed reserves, lower money market rates,
and a less than anticipated expansion in aggregate reserves.
