MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES
Recent Developments
(1) Federal funds have traded around the intended rate of 5-1/2 percent over the
intermeeting period, and quotes on futures contracts for federal funds and Eurodollar deposits
suggest that markets expect this level to prevail in coming months (chart). These futures
rates are little changed since the Committee's August meeting, as are short-term rates more
generally.1 Longer-term rates, by contrast, have declined 9 to 16 basis points on net, despite
generally stronger-than-anticipated news on spending. The drop came in reaction to
unexpectedly low inflation numbers and appeared to reflect a reassessment on the part of
some market participants of the fundamental relationship between economic activity and price
pressures. Rates on Treasury indexed securities have risen slightly over the intermeeting
period, supporting the view that the declines in nominal rates were largely in reaction to some
combination of reductions in inflation expectations and in compensation required for inflation
uncertainty. The downward movement in long rates further flattened the slope of the yield
curve, which now appears consistent with the interpretation that markets have priced in
essentially no System tightening even beyond the near-term period covered by the futures
market quotes noted above. Stock market indexes have continued to fluctuate sharply but
have risen appreciably, on net, over the intermeeting period, encouraged perhaps by the belief
that strong growth and low inflation can coexist.
(2) The weighted-average foreign exchange value of the dollar has decreased
somewhat since the August FOMC meeting; bilateral rates have diverged substantially,
reflecting disparate economic developments in major foreign countries. The dollar has
declined 3-1/4 percent against the mark, as data suggesting a pickup in German economic
activity and consumer price inflation fueled speculation about a possible increase in German
short-term interest rates prior to the selection of initial participants in stage III of EMU next
spring. In contrast, the dollar has risen 2-3/4 percent against the yen. Weakness in the yen
against the dollar has been fostered by continuing sluggish economic conditions in Japan, by
persistent problems in its financial system, and by the potential impact of the recent
depreciations of Southeast Asian currencies on Japan. Yields on Japanese long-term
government bonds have fallen 18 basis points, while equity prices have dropped 7 percent.
Long-term interest rates in the United Kingdom fell 60 basis points over the intermeeting
period as signs emerged that activity is slowing and as public statements by British officials
seemed to increase prospects for sterling's early entry into the third stage of EMU.
. The Desk did not intervene.
(3) M2 growth surged in August before slowing to the still-brisk rate of 6-1/2
percent now estimated for September--a much faster advance over the two months than
expected at the time of the last meeting. Part of the strength was attributable to heavy
inflows to money funds, which seem to have captured balances deflected or withdrawn from
stock mutual funds in response to declines in share values in August. However, other
components of M2 were also relatively robust, and, based on the staff projection for nominal
GDP, the velocity of this aggregate declined slightly in the third quarter despite steady
opportunity costs--the first drop in a year and a half. From the fourth quarter of 1996 to
September, M2 has grown at a 5-1/2 percent rate, above its 1 to 5 percent range. M3 growth
has remained exceptionally rapid during August and September, even though bank credit
growth has been moderate. Banks have substituted large time deposits for foreign
borrowings, and inflows to institution-only money funds have been substantial. As of
September, M3 had advanced at an 8-1/2 percent rate from its fourth-quarter 1996 base, well
above the 6 percent upper end of its range.
(4) In contrast to the monetary aggregates, the expansion of total debt has
remained moderate. Growth of the debt of private sectors has been supported in recent
months by borrowing by nonfinancial businesses, where credit has apparently been needed to
finance inventory accumulation and merger activity. Credit supply and credit quality in the
business sector continue to be very good: Spreads on business obligations in markets and at
banks are quite narrow, which is not surprising given historically low rates of default and
delinquency on junk bonds and business loans. Though growth in the debt of the household
sector has remained below the pace of recent years, it is still above that of income. There are
indications that credit problems in this sector are leveling off, and credit remains readily
available to most potential borrowers. Federal borrowing has resumed in recent months,
although at a very slow pace, as the Treasury has chosen to run down its cash balances this
quarter; state and local sector debt has shown little if any growth on net, owing to large
retirements of higher-yielding obligations. The paucity of government borrowing has reduced
the growth of total debt of nonfinancial sectors a bit in recent months, and expansion from
the fourth quarter of 1996 through August was at a 4-1/4 percent rate, below the 5 percent
midpoint of the Committee's range.

Policy Alternatives
(5) Economic data received since the August meeting suggest more momentum in
final sales but less inflation than the staff had expected. In the Greenbook forecast, the effect
of the strength in final sales on production is projected to be partly offset by a slowing of
inventory accumulation over the next few quarters. Even so, the expansion of real GDP is
expected to remain above the rate of growth of its potential through the remainder of this year
and the first half of the next, pulling the unemployment rate down to 4-1/2 percent. Although
over time aggregate demand should be restrained by the effects of the past appreciation of the
dollar, as well as an assumed rise in long-term rates and tightening in the stance of monetary
policy next year, the unemployment rate stays at that low level through the end of 1998.
These strains on resources contribute to an increase in inflation over the next year and a half.
The outcomes for the unemployment rate and inflation in the staff forecast are near the lower
ends of the central tendencies of the projections of Committee members provided at the July
meeting for 1997 but a shade below those for 1998.
(6) The staff assessment of the pressures on resources implies that policy restraint
is in order at some point to check an upcreep in inflation, but the Committee may,
nonetheless, prefer to hold the federal funds rate at its current level of 5-1/2 percent at this
meeting, as in alternative B. Over the past few quarters sustained high levels of resource
utilization have been associated with flat or, by some measures, even declining inflation. The
Committee may read this experience as suggesting the possibility that economic activity can
run on the high side of historical norms without putting much pressure on inflation. Even in
the staff forecast some of the moderate pickup in consumer prices owes to a smaller drag
from import prices as, by assumption, the dollar stabilizes. Additional impetus to inflation
comes from a projected further decline in the unemployment rate. Given these uncertainties
attending the prospects for inflation, the Committee might be willing to defer putting restraint
in place so as to get more readings on the pace of stock-building, the strength of final sales,
and the behavior of wages and prices. A willingness to await new information might be
reinforced if the Committee were of the view that any current misalignment of policy was
modest at worst. Some reassurance in this regard might be gotten from the likelihood that the
real fed funds rate has ticked higher in recent months, as inflation expectations seem to have
declined along with the drop in measured inflation, while the nominal funds rate has been
held steady. With scant indications of pipeline pressures that normally presage a pickup in
inflation, and with business profit margins perhaps ample enough to absorb a portion of any
speed up in cost increases, the Committee may well have time to act before an incipient
increase in inflation becomes firmly embedded in inflation expectations.
(7) If the Committee were confident that the staff had correctly identified the threat
that inflation would pick up, or wanted some greater assurance of further progress toward
price stability, it would likely favor raising the federal funds rate promptly, perhaps at this
meeting by the 25 basis points of alternative C. The need for prompt action might be seen
as elevated because the vigor of final sales threatens to add to pressures on resources, and the
longer the economy operates beyond its sustainable potential, the more disruptive may be the
correction needed to contain inflation. Despite relatively high short-term real rates, financial
conditions remain quite supportive to spending: The stock market continues to generate
impressive gains in wealth; longer-term real interest rates seem to have held fairly steady or
perhaps edged lower since spring; and capital markets and depositories remain quite receptive
to borrowers. The rapid growth of the monetary aggregates in the past few months may be
seen as one more warning flag that financial conditions are supporting more spending than
can be accommodated without an increase of inflation. While the Committee might be more
inclined than ever to view structural changes as permitting the economy to operate at a higher
rate than in the past, the projected unemployment rate of 4-1/2 percent falls short of all but
the rosiest estimates of the natural rate. Moreover, a portion of the recent good performance
of inflation has owed to temporary factors, such as the strength in the foreign exchange value
of the dollar, which are not likely to be repeated over coming quarters. Even worker
insecurity may be expected to erode in a strong labor market marked by reduced layoffs.
With those beneficial forces likely to wind down, the Committee may fear that the effects of
strains on resources may show through more forcefully to the prices of goods and services
than in the staff forecast, perhaps more in line with traditional relationships.
(8) Virtually no one in the market anticipates action at this meeting, so that yields
across the term structure are not likely to budge much and the dollar should continue to trade
around its current level on foreign exchange markets immediately following the adoption of
the unchanged policy stance of alternative B. Treasury bill rates have been depressed of late
by low issuance, and the turnaround in bill sales in the fourth quarter prompted by the
seasonal bulge in the federal deficit may roll back some of the decline in rates on those
securities. Over time, if economic developments unfold as in the staff forecast, market
participants are in store for some disappointment: Inflation will be a touch faster, providing a
context in which expected strength in readings on economic activity are more likely to be
taken as evidence that higher real rates are required to slow spending to contain price
pressures, and corporate profits should decelerate. Against this backdrop, nominal yields
would likely edge higher, with both their real and inflation compensation components rising,
and equity prices would likely decline.
(9) The Committee's choice of alternative C at this meeting would catch market
participants completely unawares. Money market rates would rise at least as much as the 25
basis point hike in the federal funds rate, and intermediate- and long-term rates could increase
substantially as well. The extent of the increase, of course, would depend on market
participants' interpretation of the rationale for Federal Reserve action. The action might be
viewed as simply a purchase of limited additional insurance against higher inflation in
response to a spurt to final demand. Alternatively, the tightening might be taken as evidence
that the Federal Reserve had not become as optimistic as market participants have come to
suspect it was about the economy's ability to produce at unusually high rates without
generating more inflation; such a reassessment might even lead some investors to revise their
own views about inflation as well as about future Federal Reserve behavior. In either case,
the implied rise in real rates would buoy the exchange value of the dollar but depress equity
values. Stock prices might be doubly hit if confidence in the expected growth of earnings
were shaken not only by the prospects for tighter policy but also by a less favorable view of
the long-run path of potential output. In these circumstances, incoming data bearing on the
strength of spending and inflation pressure would be especially scrutinized, and large swings
in financial prices might become even more common.
(10) Under the unchanged policy stance of alternative B, the growth of the
monetary aggregates should slow significantly. The expansion of money market fund shares,
an important contributor to M2 growth in recent months, has already begun to settle down as
the response to last month's equity price decline has abated. Still, the rapid growth of M2 in
August and September implies that this aggregate will begin the fourth quarter at a high level,
so even substantial slowing thereafter leaves quarterly average growth at an elevated rate--
indeed, again a shade above that projected for nominal GDP. M3 growth will slow as well,
but will remain above the rate of expansion of M2 owing to continued rapid expansion of
institution-only mutual funds, which are gaining market share in the cash management
business, and further substantial growth in large time deposits. All told, M2 and M3 growth
for 1997 should be about 1/2 and 2-1/4 percentage points, respectively, above their annual
ranges. Under alternative C, even though opportunity costs would likely rise with the
imposition of monetary restraint, M2 might be bolstered to some extent in the near term
should a correction in the stock and bond markets induce investors to favor money market
over bond and stock mutual funds.
(11) Credit demands are anticipated to quicken in the fourth quarter, paced by a
resumption of substantial net borrowing by the federal government. Markets and depositories
will remain ready sources of funds for business, which they will continue to tap in volume in
light of substantial external financing needs and a pickup in share retirements. Household
borrowing, in contrast, should run at the less rapid pace seen in recent quarters; credit
conditions and spending on durables are unlikely to change much from earlier this year. As a
result, the debt of the domestic nonfinancial sectors should finish the year about 4-1/2 percent
above its fourth-quarter 1996 base, just a little below the midpoint of its annual range.
