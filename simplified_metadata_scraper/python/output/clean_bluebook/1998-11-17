Prefatory Note
The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redacted passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked 
and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

Class I-- FOMC
MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES
Recent Developments
(1) The Committee's quarter-point easing in the intended federal funds rate at its
September meeting was smaller than many market participants anticipated but elicited only a
muted immediate response in financial markets (chart 1). In the days that followed, the
announcement by several major banks of large trading losses and the expected unwinding of
positions by hedge funds and other leveraged investors combined to weigh on market sentiment.
Market liquidity, which had already begun to worsen, deteriorated sharply, as evidenced by rising
premiums for on-the-run Treasury securities (chart 2) and widening bid-asked spreads. The
demand for on-the-run Treasury securities was heightened further by flight-to-quality flows out
of private and emerging market securities. Credit spreads on private instruments moved still
higher, and major equity indexes suffered additional losses, as market participants' perceptions
of, and aversion to, risk intensified. Many borrowers responded to the continued tightening of
credit terms in open markets by drawing down prearranged lines at banks. Banks, meanwhile,
encountered increasing difficulty in syndicating large loans, with some deals completed only
after an upward repricing of rates while others were canceled altogether. Owing in large part to
deteriorating financial conditions, expectations of further System easing mounted in the two
weeks following the September meeting. Nevertheless, the announcement on October 15 of a
second quarter-point reduction in the intended level of the federal funds rate, along with a like
change in the discount rate, came sooner than market participants had expected. On the
afternoon of the announcement, Treasury securities again rallied, with rates on bills out to a year
shedding 25 basis points and those further out the curve declining somewhat less.
(2) Over the rest of the intermeeting period, financial strains gradually moderated,
and security issuance resumed in a number of key markets, although investors remain highly
selective and conditions in securities markets are still abnormally illiquid. As investors became
somewhat more willing to take on risks, as market expectations of additional near-term System
easing waned, and as issuance by the Treasury and the private sector picked up, Treasury rates
backed up appreciably. Bid-asked spreads in that market and premiums for on-the-run issues
both narrowed, albeit to levels that are above normal. Interest rates on private instruments
showed mixed changes after the second easing. In the commercial paper market, yields on
higher-rated paper edged down, but rates on lower-grade paper were little changed. In the
corporate bond market, investment-grade yields generally rose somewhat, in part owing to supply
pressures related to the recovery of issuance. For junk bonds, both rates and spreads declined,
rolling back a portion of their outsized increases of September and early October; while offerings
of high-yield bonds have resumed of late, investors have continued to favor better-known issuers.
Equity markets also rallied substantially after the second policy easing, with notable rebounds for
shares of money-center and investment banks. On balance over the intermeeting period, nominal
Treasury interest rates rose as much as 20 basis points, many private rates were about unchanged
at the short end but increased 18 to 40 basis points at the long end, and major equity indexes
gained 6 to 10 percent. Against the backdrop of the significant improvement in market
conditions, federal funds futures rates now suggest about even odds of no action or a 25 basis
point cut at the November FOMC meeting (although they point to a near certainty of such a move
by year end).
(3) Variations in the federal funds rate around target levels were somewhat larger than
usual over the intermeeting period. Although aggregate balances held to meet reserve and
clearing requirements continued to edge down as a result of the ongoing spread of retail sweep
arrangements, other factors probably were much more important in exacerbating fluctuations in
the funds rate in recent weeks. Heightened perceptions of counterparty risk in the interbank
market led borrowing banks to lock in their funding earlier in the morning (so as to minimize the
risk of having to borrow at the discount window) and induced lending banks to shift more of
their placements from term to overnight maturity. Commercial banks pared or more tightly
administered their counterparty credit limits in the interbank market. These forces on net boosted
the need for additional reserve balances and put upward pressure on the funds rate at the usual
Desk intervention time. The Desk responded by using the level of the funds rate at the time of
operations as a guide.1 Often, the funds rate fell late in the day when banks attempted to shed
unneeded balances as reserve positions became clearer. In the event, the effective federal funds
rate averaged very close to the intended level, but there were several instances of atypically large
and persistent daily deviations from that level.
1 To meet projected permanent needs to add reserves, the Desk arranged $4.6 billion of
outright purchases of Treasury coupons in several tranches. In light of the illiquidity in the
Treasury market, the Desk gave dealers extra time to afford them more opportunity to line up
clients willing to sell Treasury securities. The Desk also split its outright operations into eight,
rather than the usual four, tranches to reduce the number of issues in each purchase so as to keep
processing time between submission and acceptance of offers to a minimum. In addition, for the
first time, the Desk announced the specific securities it was not willing to purchase because the
SOMA already had sufficient holdings relative to the total outstanding supply.
(4) The dollar declined around 1 percent on balance against the major currencies
during the intermeeting period, paced by a net depreciation of 8-1/2 percent against the yen. On
October 7 and 8, the dollar-yen rate dropped by as much as 15 percent to an intraday trough of
111.58 amid especially volatile and illiquid trading conditions. Market sources attributed much
of the downward pressure to the efforts of hedge funds and other investors to reduce leverage and
exchange-rate exposure embodied in speculative positions involving the funding of non-yen
assets with low-interest yen borrowing (the so-called yen-carry trade). Over the most recent two
weeks, the dollar has risen steadily, reversing about 7 percent of its losses against the yen,
bolstered in part by mounting disappointment about Japanese fiscal and banking system
measures. On balance, the realignment of the dollar-yen exchange rate contributed to an
improved financial climate in some of the economies in the Asian-Pacific region, especially
those with currencies tied to the dollar. The dollar appreciated slightly on balance against the
mark, despite the easing of U.S. monetary policy, which contrasted with the unchanged stance of
the Bundesbank. Other euro-area central banks did lower official interest rates during the period,
bringing their short-term market interest rates closer to the corresponding German rates, but these
moves were expected as part of the convergence process ahead of the launch of the euro in
January. The dollar rose 3 percent against sterling, as the Bank of England lowered its official
RP rate 1/2 percentage point, somewhat more than expected, in response to signs of weakening
economic growth. The U.S. dollar appreciated 2-1/2 percent against the Canadian dollar, even
though the Bank of Canada moved in tandem with Federal Reserve policy actions. The Desk did
not intervene in foreign exchange markets for U.S. accounts over the period.
(5) Declines in official short-term interest rates in several industrial countries
contributed to the lessening of financial strains around the world over the intermeeting period.
As in the United States, the flight to both quality and liquidity moderated in other industrial
countries. Yields on ten-year German government securities rose 22 basis points over the
intermeeting period, somewhat more than those on comparable government securities in other
euro-area countries. Major equity indexes in industrial countries rose as much as 11 percent on
balance during the intermeeting period. Internationally coordinated efforts to contain a possible
financial crisis in Brazil, combined with statements by the G-7 on October 30, apparently
reassured investors in emerging market assets. Equity prices in emerging economies also rose
substantially, with indexes in many economies turning in double-digit percentage gains over the
intermeeting period. In addition, yield spreads on dollar-denominated bonds of Asian and Latin
American governments declined on net over the period.
(6) Turmoil in financial markets spurred expansion of the monetary aggregates in
October. M2 posted its second consecutive month of double-digit growth, with continued
strength in its liquid components, especially retail money market mutual funds (MMMFs). The
advance in M2 probably was boosted as well by the decline in its opportunity cost resulting from
the System's two easings and, for much of October, the unusual softness in Treasury bill rates.
Gains in M3 were even larger, as the easings stimulated inflows to institution-only MMMFs and
as banks sought to fund heavy demands for loans. Bank lending was supported in part by credit
demands deflected from securities markets, where bond issuance, particularly of high-yield
instruments, slowed sharply in September and into October, and where commercial paper ran off
in October and early November. Borrowers evidently made use of preestablished lines of credit
at banks, but new borrowers and those attempting to renegotiate existing credit lines faced less
favorable terms and conditions. According to the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey in
November, a large share of respondent banks have tightened standards and terms for business
loans since September, while distinct signs emerged for the first time in recent years of a
tightening for smaller firms. Overall business borrowing apparently has softened in recent
months. By contrast, household debt growth has been strong of late; home mortgage borrowing
continued to respond to the relatively low level of mortgage rates, and consumer credit expanded
briskly in September along with associated consumer spending. Federal debt, on a seasonally
adjusted basis, has run off a little more rapidly in recent months, but, on net, overall domestic
nonfinancial debt growth appears to have slowed only a bit.

Policy Alternatives
(7) Although the staff forecast now foresees a somewhat less pronounced slowdown
in output than in the September Greenbook, aggregate demand growth still is projected to
weaken appreciably in coming quarters, helping to contain inflation. The current projection
assumes that the Federal Reserve will take one more small easing step by year end, with the total
decline in the funds rate thereby cumulating to the same 3/4 percentage point assumed in
September but more frontloaded to the end of this year. International influences are expected to
remain a drag on U.S. economic growth, albeit a diminishing one. Domestic credit spreads and
liquidity premiums, while narrowing further as investor confidence continues to recover, are seen
as staying somewhat elevated relative to levels earlier this year. Corporate earnings reports are
expected to prove disappointing to investors, pushing equity prices down noticeably by next
spring. With financial conditions on balance restraining aggregate demand, real GDP growth is
projected to slow considerably next year, to just over 1-1/2 percent, before strengthening
somewhat to 2-1/4 percent over the year 2000. The labor market remains tight, with the
unemployment rate edging up to about 5-1/4 percent by the middle of 2000. Overall inflation
picks up somewhat, boosted by a reversal in petroleum and other import prices.
(8) The Committee may find such a pattern to be relatively attractive if it believes that
the economy is operating beyond a sustainable level, but wishes to reduce the pressures on
resources only gradually; inflation still stays fairly quiescent, and financial markets strike a better
balance between the frothy conditions of recent years and the extreme risk aversion evident in
recent months. A slight additional easing at this meeting, as in the 25 basis point reduction in the
federal funds rate of alternative A, could be considered broadly in line with the policy
assumption underlying the staff forecast.2 The case for an immediate easing would be
strengthened if the Committee thought that the risks to the staffs economic outlook were
distinctly skewed to the downside, perhaps owing to the possibility of more adverse
developments in Latin America. In addition, a prompt policy easing would be more likely than
would standing pat to lessen the odds on a reemergence of anything like the earlier extreme
reluctance to take on risk that had caused rates on private securities to back up and had
threatened to retard economic activity. Indeed, such an easing action might be expected to foster
continued normalization of financial conditions here and abroad. An easing also might reduce
the chances, or at least lessen the effects, of possible funding problems at some financial
institutions, particularly around year end, that could interfere with credit intermediation. Finally,
an easing would help to offset some of the effects of both the tightening in lending terms and
standards at commercial banks that has been under way and the softness in global economic
activity that has been exacerbated by further weakness in Japan.
(9) The 25 basis point easing of policy under alternative A would tend to boost most
financial markets, given that the federal funds futures market evidently now has built in only
about even odds of such an action at this meeting. Consequently, rates on short-term private
market instruments, such as commercial paper, likely would move a little lower following
implementation of alternative A. With the easing perhaps fostering additional attenuation of
concerns about private credit risks, the unusual recent safe-harbor demands for Treasuries would
2 Alternative A could be implemented either through a 1/4 percentage point reduction in
the discount rate to 4-1/2 percent, or through a slightly more generous provision of nonborrowed
reserves, with no discount rate change, that eliminates the spread between the two rates.
abate further, and Treasury bill yields probably would fall less than those on private instruments.
Similarly, in longer-term markets, private rates also likely would decline, as would those on
older, less-liquid Treasury notes and bonds, while yields for on-the-run Treasuries might be little
changed as more of the recent flight-to-liquidity is unwound. Falling rates and improving
liquidity in markets for private securities probably would augment the recent tendency for some
rebound in trading volumes, and the better market conditions could help spur issuance, including
some deals previously postponed because of market turbulence. The value of the dollar on
foreign exchange markets likely would decline somewhat, and financial strains in foreign
markets probably would moderate further.
(10) If the Committee finds the Greenbook forecast plausible and acceptable, with the
risks of upside and downside surprises reasonably balanced, it may wish to defer consideration of
an easing action to later in the year (the point at which the staff forecast assumes such an action
will occur) to allow more time to assess the effects on financial markets and the real economy of
the easing that it has already put in place. Leaving policy unchanged at this meeting, as under
alternative B, would seem even more advisable if the Committee were skeptical that aggregate
demand will slow to the extent forecast by the staff. There is some reason to be cautious in
predicting much adverse effect on spending from financial developments. As noted, a number of
indicators of market performance suggest that, at a minimum, the decline in asset prices and
worsening of trading conditions have ceased and, in many markets, notably including that for
equities, a partial reversal has occurred. Indeed, the Committee could well be concerned that
further monetary easing would add fuel to the rebound in stock valuations, which arguably has
already gone beyond fundamentals. Changes to date in private financing rates may not have
imposed strong restraint on planned investment spending and, although the increased cost of
raising funds in private securities markets has shifted borrowing toward commercial banks, the
growth of aggregate debt in nonfederal sectors appears to have been well maintained.
(11) With many market participants likely to be disappointed by policy inaction, yields
on private securities could well back up some under alternative B. The increase in rates on
Treasury securities likely would be somewhat less, and spreads on private securities over
Treasuries probably would widen. Although the initial effects of this alternative on financial
markets could be somewhat negative, they would be muted and short-lived to the extent that the
public believes the Federal Reserve is staying especially watchful of financial market strains and
has not closed the door on further policy easing. While some risk of unusual year-end pressures
cannot be ruled out, chances are that any curtailment of liquidity and trading volumes across a
variety of markets would prove limited and essentially temporary. Equity prices likely would
decline somewhat. The value of the dollar on foreign exchange markets should firm, and credit
spreads for emerging market securities might rise.
(12) In response to the greater awareness of credit risks as well as the prospective
slowdown in economic growth, lenders are anticipated to remain cautious in extending credit in
the forecast period. Nonetheless, growth of C&I loans is likely to remain brisk through year end,
as lower-rated borrowers find the commercial paper market somewhat inhospitable and tap bank
lines. In corporate bond markets, conditions should continue to improve in coming months, but
investors are still likely to be selective, especially with regard to high-yield borrowers, and
spreads should stay wider than the very narrow levels of earlier this year. In the aggregate,
business borrowing will tend to drift down over coming quarters, owing to reduced net equity
retirements and, to a lesser extent, a trending lower of growth in fixed investment expenditures
and a more modest pace of inventory investment. Most households are expected to experience
little change in credit market terms, although marginal borrowers may see the availability of
credit trimmed a little. Still, the rate of expansion of consumer and mortgage credit will probably
edge lower, as personal consumption and housing expenditures decelerate over the next two
years along with personal income. On balance, growth in overall domestic nonfinancial debt is
expected to moderate in coming months. For 1998 as a whole, such debt is projected to expand 6
percent, in the upper half of the Committee's 3 to 7 percent annual range, but by March, this
aggregate is forecast to stand near the center of its comparable provisional range for 1999.
(13) M2 and M3 are predicted to continue to grow rapidly through the end of the year,
reflecting strong demands for liquidity in the aftermath of the volatile market climate, as well as
in response to the recent policy easings and the expectation in markets of more to come, which
have reduced the opportunity cost of holding monetary assets.3 Over 1998 as a whole, M2 and
M3 are projected to expand 9 and 10-3/4 percent, respectively, far overshooting their annual
ranges. In early 1999, however, M2 growth is projected to slow considerably as unusual
demands for liquid assets abate and households redeploy liquid assets previously parked in
money market mutual funds awaiting longer-term investment opportunities. M2 growth,
however, is expected to exceed that of nominal GDP. M3 is forecast to outpace M2 as banks
seek funding through instruments included in the broader aggregate to finance bank credit
3 The projections of money growth under alternative B assume, consistent with the
Greenbook forecast, that the stance of policy is left unchanged at the November meeting and
eased 25 basis points at the December meeting.
expansion and as institution-only money market funds remain attractive investments for
corporate cash managers. Under alternative B, M2 and M3 are projected to expand over the
October-to-March period at annual rates of 8 and 9-1/2 percent, respectively, leaving both
aggregates by March well above the ranges established provisionally for 1999.

(Option 2)
To promote the Committee's long-run objectives of price stability and sustainable
economic growth, the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets
consistent with maintaining/increasing/decreasing the federal funds rate at/to an average of
around ____ percent. In view of the evidence currently available, the Committee believes that
prospective developments are [equally likely to warrant an increase or a decrease (NO TILT)];
[more likely to warrant [a further] increase/decrease than a decrease/an increase (TILT)] in the
federal funds rate in coming months. Any potential changes in the federal funds rate operating
objective during the intermeeting period should be considered in that context. The contemplated
reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with some moderation in the growth in M2 and
M3 over coming months.
dropping the next to last sentence ["Any potential changes...."]. President Parry also would insert
the phrase "federal funds rate operating objective" in place of "federal funds rate" in the prior
sentence. President Hoenig would prefer to include the next to last sentence in the operating
paragraph only with asymmetric directives.
Alternative Language Proposed by President Minehan
(Option 3)
To promote the Committee's long-run objectives of price stability and sustainable
economic growth, the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets
consistent with maintaining/increasing/decreasing the federal funds rate at/to an average of
around ____ percent.
(1) (NO TILT) In that regard, the Committee views risks to the economic outlook
as evenly balanced for the intermeeting period, and believes changes in economic, financial, and
monetary conditions over that period could call for no change or for a slight [further] increase or
[further] decrease in the federal funds rate.
(2) (TILT) [However] [In addition], in view of the evidence currently available, the
Committee believes that economic, financial, and monetary developments over the intermeeting
period might require a slight [further] increase/decrease in the federal funds rate.
The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with some moderation in the
growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.
