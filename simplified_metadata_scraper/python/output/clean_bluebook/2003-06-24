Class II – FOMC
MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES
Recent Developments
(1) The FOMC’s decision at its May meeting to keep the intended federal
funds rate at 1¼ percent came as no surprise to most observers.  By contrast, splitting
the balance of risks into separate assessments about growth and inflation and
emphasizing a concern about further declines of inflation from an already low level
led market participants to mark down their policy expectations.  The announcement
also set the backdrop against which subsequent statements by Federal Reserve
officials regarding the possibility of deflation and available policy alternatives were
interpreted.  Options on federal funds futures indicate that market participants are
nearly certain of policy easing at this meeting, with a half-point cut given two-to-one
odds over a quarter-point cut.  Given the sense that Committee members have
become more concerned about inflation turning out too low than too high, market
participants now see a substantially longer period of low short-term interest rates;
indeed, the funds rate is expected to remain below its current level through this year
and most of next.1  (The box on the next page provides more detail on prevailing
market expectations.)
Policy Expectations
In addition to marking down the expected path of policy over the
intermeeting period, investors became more confident about their forecast for the
funds rate (Chart 1).  For example, based on options on eurodollar futures, the
width of the 90 percent confidence interval around the expected target level one
year ahead narrowed substantially over the period to stand at the lowest level in
many years.
A recently introduced options contract on federal funds futures on the
Chicago Board of Trade opens a new window on market participants’ near-term
policy outlook.  Prices of options at different strikes depend on investors’ subjective
probability assessment that the options will be in the money at expiration.  The
option-implied probability of no change in policy, the solid line in the bottom left
panel, remained above 50 percent until June 3, but has since dropped nearly to zero. 
At last reading, these option-implied probabilities suggest that investors consider a
half-point cut in the target rate about twice as likely as a quarter-point cut.
Prices of options on Eurodollar futures can be used in a similar way to
construct the probability distribution of the target rate later in the year, shown in
the bottom-right panel.  The most recent distribution (in red) has shifted markedly
to the left and the weight on rates in the lower tail has been revised up significantly. 
Indeed, investors apparently place about a 15 percent probability on the funds rate
trading at or below ½ percent in six months.
(2) Consistent with a lower expected path for policy, yields on Treasury
coupon securities shed 35  to 60 basis points over the intermeeting period, with much
of the decline concentrated in implied forward rates at the three- to seven-year
horizon (Chart 2).  Inflation-indexed yields fell somewhat less, implying that inflation
compensation declined moderately.  The desire by managers of mortgage-backed
security portfolios to extend the duration of their holdings, which has been shortened
by the recent wave of mortgage refinancings, may have amplified the downward
pressure on longer-term yields.  With uncertainty about the future course of interest
rates reduced, term premia may have declined, adding to the drop in bond yields.
(3) Yields on corporate bonds fell about in line with those on Treasuries
even as capital markets absorbed a surge in issuance by highly-rated firms.  Indeed,
even lower-tier issuers found markets receptive, taking advantage of historically low
bond yields to issue a record amount of debt in May.  Stock price indexes registered
sizable gains over the intermeeting period, buoyed by the decline in real yields as well
as the improved outlook for economic growth and earnings and, perhaps, the cut in
the tax rate on dividends and capital gains.2
(4) Since the May FOMC meeting, the dollar has slipped 3 percent further
against an index of major foreign currencies (Chart 4).  Contributing to the downward
pressure were comments by U.S. Administration officials that were interpreted on
balance as not opposing some depreciation of the dollar, and some heightening of
longstanding concerns about the availability of international capital flows to finance
the burgeoning U.S. current account deficit.  The dollar declined 4½ percent against
the Canadian dollar despite signs of slower activity in Canada.  The dollar also
dropped substantially against the euro, even as indicators pointed to lackluster
domestic demand in the euro area and an increasing drag on its exports from the
.  The Desk d id not intervene during the period for the accounts of the System
or the Treasury.
euro’s rebound over the past year.  The economic slowdown and lower rates of
inflation in the euro area have begun to stoke worries about deflation, especially in
Germany where the economy has been stagnating.  The ECB eased policy 50 basis
points on June 5, as had been widely expected.  The dollar was unchanged on balance
against the yen, as market participants took note of extremely large purchases of
dollars by Japanese authorities.3  The Bank of Japan raised its target somewhat for
reserve balances and also announced a new program to purchase asset-backed
securities.  Yields on foreign long-term government securities moved down but,
except for Canada, by less than in the United States.  Foreign stock markets largely
mirrored the continuing improvement in U.S. stock prices.
(5) The dollar has been about unchanged on net since the May FOMC
meeting against an index of the currencies of our other important trading partners,
amid divergent movements against individual currencies.  The dollar gained 3 percent
against the Mexican peso, as Mexico reported an unexpectedly large contraction of
GDP in the first quarter and signs of further weakness emerged.  In contrast, the
dollar lost ground against the Brazilian real, which strengthened 3½ percent, as
financial markets continued to reward Brazil for achieving progress on key structural
issues.  Brazil’s EMBI+ spread narrowed about 75 basis points more to about 7¼
percentage points, and Brazilian stocks moved up another 5½ percent.  Stock markets
in several Asian economies–Taiwan, Hong Kong, Korea, Thailand–were buoyed by
signs of recovery in the high-tech sector and indications that the impact of the SARS
epidemic may be waning.
(6) Households, businesses, and state and local governments continued to
take advantage of low longer-term yields in their funding.  Net bond issuance by
nonfinancial firms picked up over the period, but total borrowing remained fairly
weak as businesses continued to pay down short-term debt (Chart 5).  Despite the
stock market rally, gross equity issuance recovered only marginally from the depressed
levels of the preceding months, with initial public offerings remaining scarce.  Data
from commercial banks suggest that households continued to pile on mortgage debt
as further declines in mortgage interest rates fueled a brisk pace of home purchases
and another surge in refinancings.  Borrowing by the state and local sector picked up,
in part reflecting sizable advance refundings.  With tax receipts running on the weak
side and expenditures picking up, marketable Treasury borrowing surged, especially
after the debt ceiling was raised.  Given the extra impetus from the federal sector,
domestic nonfinancial sector debt remained on track to expand at a considerably
faster rate on balance in the second quarter than the 6½ percent pace registered in the
first quarter.
(7) The money stock expanded briskly in May.  Even after accounting for
estimated special factors boosting M2, including tax effects and mortgage refinancing
activity, underlying growth was still quite strong. With M2 likely to grow at an 8
percent rate this quarter but nominal GDP growth shaping up to be 2½  percent, M2
velocity will most likely show a substantial decline even though opportunity costs have
fallen only slightly.  The decline in the overall cost of holding M2 masks substantial
changes in relative returns on some components of the aggregate.  In particular, the
average yield on taxable retail money market mutual funds (the solid line in the lower
left panel of Chart 5) has fallen to the point that those funds have lost their typical
rate advantage to MMDAs offered by banks (the dotted line).  Within the universe of
money market mutual funds, as portrayed in the lower right panel, about 12 percent of
assets are held by funds paying yields below ½ percent, suggesting that the scope for
continued large gross flows is considerable.  Some of those funds, though, would
likely shift to other money funds rather than to liquid deposits or out of the monetary
aggregates if short rates were reduced further.
Policy Alternatives
(8) Recent financial developments and the passage of a sizable tax cut over
the intermeeting period have created a more supportive outlook for aggregate demand
in the staff projection, but data on inflation have mostly run to the soft side of staff
expectations.  In the Greenbook, the staff now assumes that the FOMC will trim its
target by ¼ percentage point and then subsequently keep it unchanged.  At the same
time, the level of stock prices has been raised and those of the dollar and long-term
interest rates lowered in recognition of their respective net movements over the
intermeeting period.  The staff also has incorporated the greater fiscal stimulus
embodied in the recently enacted tax cut than had been anticipated in the prior
Greenbook.  Thus, while incoming data have moved real GDP growth down a notch
over the first half, real growth over the next six quarters has been raised nearly ½
percentage point--to 4¼ percent over the second half of 2003 and 5¼ percent over
unemployment rate next year, which falls to 5.4 percent by late 2004.  Given the
generally lower-than-expected price data of late, core PCE inflation in the second
quarter has been trimmed a bit, implying that four-quarter inflation by this measure
will come in at 1 percent over this year.  Core inflation is projected to edge down
further in 2004, largely because slack in labor and product markets persists through
next year.
(9) The staff outlook presents a picture of an economy moving towards, but
not yet attaining, equilibrium:  While there is still some slack in labor markets, the
growth of real GDP is above that of its potential, and both inflation and the real
federal funds rate are at unusually low levels.  To examine longer-term strategies for
monetary policy as these dynamic imbalances adjust, three scenarios were created with
the aid of the FRB/US model.  The Greenbook forecast is extended through 2008 by
making several judgmental adjustments to the model that preserve the central features
of the staff outlook.  In particular, trend multifactor productivity is assumed to climb
steadily at almost 1½ percent per year, which combined with a modest pickup in
capital deepening from its current pace implies potential GDP is expanding at a
roughly 3¾ percent rate later in the decade.  The natural rate of unemployment
remains close to 5 percent–the staff’s current long-run estimate.  The unified federal
budget is projected to settle into a deficit of about 2 percent of nominal GDP.  The
demand for U.S. exports is bolstered by 4 percent annual real depreciation of the
dollar, as well as the gradual recovery of the world economy, so as to cap the current
account deficit relative to nominal GDP at a little over 5 percent.
(10) The dynamics of the FRB/US model have the property that, given the
forces playing out in the staff forecast, the Committee has considerable time before it
needs to realign the current unusually low real federal funds rate to its gradually rising
equilibrium value.  Three alternative simulations were run to examine the
consequences for the economy and long-run inflation of varying degrees of delay in
beginning the process of realigning the federal funds rate.  In particular, these
scenarios envision the consequences of moving the real funds rate to its long-run
equilibrium level of about 2¾ percent relatively smoothly over the course of one year.
The simulations differ according to when the Committee is assumed to start
tightening–either 2005, 2006, or 2007.  These simulations, shown in Chart 6, indicate,
quite obviously, that the longer the Committee waits to tighten, the more will
unemployment be worked down and inflation ultimately step up.  Were policy to
begin moving the real funds rate up in 2005, shown by the solid line in the upper left
panel, the unemployment rate would stay close to 5 percent after 2004 (the middle
panel), and core PCE inflation (the bottom panel) would settle around 3/4 percent.
Delaying that process by one year–the dashed lines–or by two–the dotted lines–causes
the unemployment rate to fall below 5 percent for a time and leads to higher inflation
down the road, with growth in core PCE prices settling in at 1½ and 2 percent,
(11) With regard to the immediate choice of policy, if the Committee both
shares the staff assessment that prospective slack in resource use could foster
disinflation and views the current inflation rate as already on the low side, it may favor
a 25 basis point reduction in the intended federal funds rate.  Such a policy move,
by preserving much of the recent rally in financial markets, would provide support to
aggregate demand, thereby helping to counter any tendency toward further substantial
disinflation, which the Committee announced would be unwelcome in its statement
after the May meeting.  This benefit to the economy may be seen as coming at a low
cost, in that an unwanted upsurge in inflation may be viewed as unlikely in an
environment in which the level of output lies well below that of its estimated potential
and inflation expectations remain subdued.  Indeed, inflation expectations may have
ticked lower of late, necessitating a moderate downward adjustment of the nominal
rate to keep the real interest rate from rising.  Should the action prove to be
unnecessary, it could readily be unwound before any material harm is done.  And even
if inflation picked up a bit, the Committee might see that rise as desirable to increase
the size of the cushion against the possibility of having to approach the zero bound
on the nominal federal funds rate.  Indeed, the alternative long-run scenarios suggest
that the Committee may be able to hold the nominal funds rate near 1 percent for a
considerable period of time without putting significant upward pressure on inflation.
(12) Alternatively, the Committee may find the case for a 50 basis point cut
in the funds rate to a level of 75 basis points to be persuasive.  The Committee may
wish to push harder against the persistent substantial output gap, which the staff has
recently revised upward slightly to an estimated 2¾ percentage points of GDP in the
second quarter.  As seen in Chart 7, with the real federal funds rate edging higher and
some estimates of its equilibrium level moving lower, a 50 basis point easing may be
seen as necessary merely to restore the degree of stimulus in place late last year.  If the
Committee thinks that the Greenbook is too optimistic about spending–perhaps
because the effects of higher oil prices of late are underplayed–then it may be
especially concerned about the chance of further disinflation as well.4  Even if the
Committee agrees with the Greenbook assessment of the economy, it may believe that
the projected inflation rate would be uncomfortably low given the problems likely to
emerge if the economy were to experience adverse shocks and the zero bound were to
become an important constraint on policy.  In this regard, the Committee may believe
that a 50 basis point cut in the funds rate could be taken back later, if need be, at less
cost to the economy than that potentially incurred by not moving now and increasing
the difficulty of countering future economic weakness because the zero floor to the
nominal funds rate became a binding constraint.
(13) If the Committee is reasonably confident that underlying economic
growth will turn out at least as strong as projected by the staff, it may view the
consequences of an unchanged funds rate as the best that are feasible, given the lags
with which monetary policy works.  In fact, because the staff would forecast rapid
GDP expansion over the next six quarters even with an unchanged funds rate, the
Committee may view any policy easing at this meeting as risking excessive pressures
on resources, exacerbating existing imbalances, or feeding an overshooting in financial
markets.  This concern could be especially pronounced if the Committee thinks that
additional easing would probably induce faster economic growth or a lower
unemployment rate than the staff foresees.  Especially with the mounting fiscal
stimulus evidently in train, the Committee may anticipate that a reduction in monetary
accommodation will be called for in the not-too-distant future, and another ease at
this meeting would make such a tightening action more sizable than otherwise.
Instead, the Committee may wish to continue to await more readings on the economy
collected after the Iraq war before reconsidering the need for any further easing
Directive and Assessment of Risks
(14) From January 2000 to January 2003, the Committee summarized its
views on the risks to the attainment of its goals of maximum sustainable economic
growth and price stability in terms of a single sentence–the “balance-of-risks”
assessment.  In March, the Committee dropped this sentence from the press
statement in light of the elevated uncertainties surrounding its outlook associated with
the looming onset of war.  The “balance-of-risks” language was refined in May, with
the press release including a three-part assessment of the economy that characterized
the risks individually surrounding the outlook for the growth of activity and inflation,
as well as their joint consequences for the balance of risks to achieving the
Committee’s goals.
(15) The experience since the May 6th announcement suggests that the three-
part risk assessment served the Committee’s interests well, in that the public quickly
came to understand the Federal Reserve’s concerns about additional disinflation
without building alarm about the prospects for economic growth.  By departing from
the routinized words of the prior balance-of-risk statement, the three-point risk
assessment was widely seen as meshing more effectively with the rest of the statement.
Moreover, going forward, the three-part assessment would provide broader coverage
of the range of possible outcomes for the economy than the earlier language,
suggesting that the Committee would not be under pressure anytime soon to amend
the form of the statement significantly.
(16)  While the Committee reviewed the wording of the release in advance of
the policy vote in May, it formally voted on only the level of the intended federal
funds rate, as will be noted in the minutes of that meeting to be released on Thursday,
June 26th.  In the past, the members of the Committee appear to have been satisfied
with the practice of routinely reviewing the public announcement after the policy vote.
Assuming that the Committee would prefer to return to including an assessment of
the risks to its outlook in its vote without reviewing the statement beforehand, it could
opt to vote both on the directive and the three-part risk assessment presented below.
To retain flexibility, the language of the assessment of risks below conveys the
direction of each of the three parts without specifying the exact wording of the three
relevant sentences of the announcement.
(1) Directive Wording
The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial
conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth
in output.  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the
immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with
maintaining/INCREASING/REDUCING the federal funds rate at/TO
an average of around ___1-1/4 percent.
(2) Risk Assessment
The Committee desires that included in the official announcement
released after the meeting (but not included in the directive) be the
indications that, against the background of its long-run goals of price
stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information
currently available: The risks to its outlook for sustainable economic
growth over the next several quarters [ARE WEIGHTED TOWARD
THE DOWNSIDE]  [are balanced] [ARE WEIGHTED TOWARD
THE UPSIDE]; the risks to its outlook for inflation over the next
several quarters [are weighted toward the downside]  [ARE
BALANCED] [ARE WEIGHTED TOWARD THE UPSIDE]; and,
taken together, the balance of risks to its objectives  [are weighted
toward the downside]  [ARE BALANCED] [ARE WEIGHTED
TOWARD THE UPSIDE] in the foreseeable future.
Market Reaction and Monetary and Credit Aggregates
(17) Under any of the three policy alternatives, the Committee may elect to
retain the current structure and content of its assessment of the two component risks
and their balance overall.  It may again judge that equal risks of a shortfall or
overshoot in real economic growth, combined with downside risks for inflation,
would balance out overall risks to the downside for the foreseeable future.   In
addition to the assessment of the risks, market participants will pay close attention to
the wording of the rest of the announcement, especially for any hints that the
Committee considers the likelihood of deflation to be anything other than quite low.
In that regard, some reports suggest the expectation that a 50 basis point move would
be accompanied by an explanation of the Committee’s plan for the alternative
implementation of policy, potentially including a rate target for a maturity longer than
(18) With market participants predicting that an easing is likely at this meeting
and that a reduction of 50 basis points is more probable than one of 25 basis points,
the market reaction would be most pronounced if the FOMC were to decide to stay
on hold.  Given that the outlook for corporate earnings with an unchanged funds rate
would be less buoyant than market participants expect, a stock price decline would
follow such a decision.  Unless this decline were quite large, some backup in long-term
interest rates would likely be associated with the sizable rise in short-term interest
rates.  An easing move of 25 basis points would have some of these effects, albeit
more muted.  By contrast, a 50 basis point reduction would be larger than expected
and could induce initial increases in stock and bond prices.  Such a cut could cause
financial distress for some higher-cost money market mutual funds and also might
begin to raise market concerns about the remaining scope for further conventional
monetary policy stimulus.  Indeed, longer-term Treasuries might be bid up in price
over time as market participants come increasingly to anticipate large-scale purchases
by the Federal Reserve.
(19) The Greenbook assumption of a 25 basis point easing, combined with its
projection of nominal GDP growth at a 5 percent rate over the second half of this
year, probably would induce M2 growth of 7½ percent over the same period.  The
implied decline in M2 velocity of 2½ percent follows an estimated drop of 4 percent
over the first half of this year.  On a period-end basis, domestic nonfinancial debt is
expected to expand at a pace of 7½ percent over the second half of this year.  The
federal debt component would grow at an annual rate of 10½ percent, and nonfederal
sector debt is projected to record a growth rate of 6¾ percent over the next two
quarters, paced by the expansion of home mortgage debt.
