Prefatory Note 
 
 
The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 
Please note that some material may have been redacted from this document if that 
material was received on a confidential basis.  Redacted material is indicated by

1  In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic 
format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Please note that the numbers and text in charts and 
tables were not reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

MONEY MARKET AND RESERVE RELATIONSHIPS
Money markets
Recent developments. Most short-term interest rates have
continued to move higher in recent weeks, but Treasury bill rates have
shown little net change since early March, although they have fluctuated
over a fairly wide range in this period. The recent increase in prime
loan rate was accompanied by rising rates on negotiable certificates
of deposit. Offering rates on commercial and finance company paper
also advanced as issuers made adjustments to the higher cost of bank
Over the three statement weeks ending March 16, net borrowed
reserves have averaged almost $215 million and member bank borrowings
about $540 million -- compared with averages of $120 and $475 million,
respectively, in February. The rise in net borrowed reserves in
recent weeks has been reflected in a somewhat tauter atmosphere in
the Federal funds market, where trading at 4-3/4 per cent has been
more frequent.
Although the banking system as a whole has been under
greater reserve pressure, two factors appear to have moderated any
related tendency for bill rates to rise. First, strong nonbank
bill demand has helped keep dealer inventories relatively low.
Second, the central money market banks continued to operate with
relatively comfortable reserve positions, as major banks, especially

in New York, prepared for large CD runoffs in March and heavy loan
demands over the tax and dividend periods.
Prospective developments. If net borrowed reserves average
around $200 million over the next three weeks, the 3-month bill rate
is likely to fluctuate within a 4.55 to 4.70 per cent range. With
continued pressure on member banks to borrow, the Federal funds rate
may be expected to trade more frequently at 4-3/4 per cent, especially
if loan demand continues strong.
A number of factors may tend to keep bill rates near the
lower end of the range in the earlier part of the period. These
include some reinvestment demand from maturing March tax bills not
turned in for taxes, demands associated with the April 1 Cook County
property tax, and temporary investment demands from proceeds of large
capital issues currently reaching the markets. In addition, the
anticipated termination in late March of the $100 million additions
to the weekly 3-month bill auctions may be having some firming
influence on the bill market.
With the reversal of Cook County buying and particularly
with the approach of the mid-April tax date, however, bill rates
may come under some upward pressure. Corporate tax payments in
mid-April under the accelerated schedule are expected to be about
$1-1/4 billion larger than last year and no tax bills are available
to smooth the payment process. Underlying factors that may keep
short-term rates under upward pressure in the weeks ahead are the
CONFIDENTIAL (FR) - 3 -
higher offering rates that have recently emerged on new time CDs
in a period of large maturities and prospective sizable short-term
Federal Agency issues.
Despite the rise in the prime loan rate, bond yields have
declined recently. This decline was influenced by rising expecta-
tions of a tax increase and by some postponements of previously
scheduled offerings. In the weeks ahead, the outlook for corporate
financing suggests upward pressure under bond yields. However, if a
tax rise should appear increasingly probable --with the attendant
implication that the present discount rate is sustainable -- bond
yields could remain around present levels.
Reserve flows, bank credit, and money
Current developments. Information available through mid-
March suggests that total reserves on a monthly average basis may
increase at about a 2 per cent annual rate, total member bank deposits
by 1 per cent, and time deposits around 5 per cent, while private
and Government demand deposits show offsetting movements. The pro-
jected rise in total reserves partly reflects an increase in
seasonally adjusted excess reserves, assuming the actual level of
these remains about unchanged from recent weeks. In contrast to
other recent months, nonborrowed reserves in March are expected to
CONFIDENTIAL (FR) - 4 -
After rising sharply in January and declining moderately
through February, the weekly figures for total member deposits, now
shown in the accompanying text table, have been rising modestly thus
far in March. Private demand deposits and the money supply have
risen rather sharply since their end-of-February lows, but this has
been largely offset by a greater than seasonal decline in Government
deposits, while time deposits have shown only a small rise.
Prospective developments. Reserve aggregates in coming
months are likely to grow somewhat more rapidly than the low rates
indicated for March. Private credit demands are expected to continue
strong and will help carry member bank deposits back above their
late January peak. A moderating factor in the rate of reserve expansion
will be the absence of Treasury cash financings, with the next Treasury
operation being a routine refunding in mid-May.
In view of large gross CD maturities ahead, net time deposit
expansion is not likely to be strong, although perhaps picking up
from its relatively slow March pace. Private demand deposits rose
sharply in the first half of March largely because of a decline
in Government deposits. There may be some further rise after the mid-
March tax date partly because Government deposits are expected to rise
less than seasonally; for the month as a whole an increase of over
10 per cent is expected in private demand deposits.
CONFIDENTIAL (FR) - 5 -
These shifts between public and private balances are
likely to be at least partly reversed in April, although the deposit
outlook is more uncertain than usual this year in view of the new
tax legislation and the lingering unknown effects of the 1964 tax
law on individuals' April payments (or refunds). But, as of now, one
would expect private demand deposits to be rising at around a 5 per
cent annual rate over the next few months, with Government deposits
showing little change on balance on a monthly average basis.
Bank credit expansion in the months ahead is likely to range
around a 5-6 per cent growth trend. A moderate growth in both total
and nonborrowed reserves would accompany such an increase.
