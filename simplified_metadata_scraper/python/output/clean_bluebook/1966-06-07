MONEY MARKET AND RESERVE RELATIONSHIPS
Money markets
Recent developments. Except for bill rates, short-term
interest rates have moved up in recent weeks in reflection of con-
tinued strong credit demands, including unusually heavy agency
financing, and sustained pressure on bank reserve positions. Yields
on commercial paper, bankers' acceptances, CD's, and Federal agency
issues have risen from 1/8 to 1/4 of a percentage point. The 5-1/2
per cent ceiling rate on CD's has been offered on increasingly
shorter maturities, as banks made efforts to compete for short-term
investment funds and to anticipate the almost $4 billion of CD's
maturing in June. Dealer loan rates also rose during May -- a period
when dealer finance needs were reduced -- and Federal funds traded
more frequently at 5 per cent or above, with some transactions at
The 3-month Treasury bill, meanwhile, remained in a narrow
to around 4.55 per cent. Demand for bills from the public has been
large, in part reflecting reinvestment of proceeds from security
sales and also preparation for the June tax date. Public demand
for bills has been supplemented by about $900 million of System
bill purchases in the market over the past two weeks. Under these

conditions, the availability of bills currently in the market has
been considerably reduced, as indicated by a marked decline in
dealer bill positions. Moreover, the maturity of tax bills in
March, large attrition in the May refunding, and the scheduled
maturity of $4.5 billion June tax bills has put a large dent in
the over-all availability of short-term U.S. Government securities
to the public.
Net borrowed reserves during the four statement weeks
ending June 1 averaged $350 million, with borrowings at around
$700 million, as compared with net borrowed reserves of about $290
million during the preceding four weeks, with borrowings of $635
million. Average borrowings during the past four statement weeks
are somewhat enlarged by the exceptional $812 million of the past
statement week, partly reflecting overborrowing prior to the long
Memorial Day weekend.
Prospective developments. Assuming net borrowed reserves
continue to average close to recent levels, the 3-month bill rate
is likely to move into a 4.60-4.70 per cent range, although
market shortages of bills could temporarily keep the rate below
but is projected to be on the buying side again beginning in late
- 2 - June 3, 1966
CONFIDENTIAL (FR) - 3 - June 3, 1966
Bill rates and money market rates generally are likely to
come under upward pressure around and after the mid-June tax date as
a result of a sizable speed-up in taxes and a continuing strong basic
loan demand. Corporate income tax payments are expected to be about
$1-3/4 billion larger than last year. In addition,in June corpora-
tions will make more than $1 billion of accelerated payments to the
Treasury of withheld individual income and social security taxes (with
an additional such speed-up in July). The additional corporate
income tax payments can be partly met out of the $1.2 billion of
additional tax bills maturing this year as compared with last. CD
maturities in June are $700 million more than last year, but only
$30 million more on the tax date. In any event, such maturities
will exert pressure on money markets as banks attempt at least to
roll them over. In this process, CD rates at the 5-1/2 per cent
ceiling may be more frequently quoted and also extended to shorter
The short-term market will also have to absorb sizable
additional cash borrowing by agencies, including a large issue by
the Federal Home Loan Banks later this month, while intermediate-
term markets will be tested by the current offering of FNMA and
SBA participations. All this, together with a substantial corporate
and municipal calendar, suggests the possibility of considerable
money and credit market pressures in the weeks ahead. However, long-
term rates have recently risen back close to their March peaks and
CONFIDENTIAL (FR) - 4 - June 3, 1966
appear to have stimulated some investment demand. And short rates
other than for bills have also risen, as earlier noted. It may be
that these markets have to some extent discounted June demands.
Given prospective demand pressures and market conditions,
there may be a strong tendency for banks to seek enlarged accommoda-
tion at the discount window. If, under these circumstances, net
borrowed reserves for the banking system as a whole are permitted
to deepen to levels consistently beyond $400 million, banks could be
slow to make portfolio adjustments or to tighten credit terms further.
However, such a deeper level of net borrowed reserves might quickly
engender market expectations of still higher short- and
long-term interest rates, and banks may find it more difficult to
roll over maturing CD's under existing Regulation Q ceilings. The
ultimate consequence then -- in a period of strong basic loan demands --
may be sustained borrowing demands from banks and therefore pressure
on discount window administration, the discount rate, and Regulation Q.
Reserve flows, bank credit, and money
Recent developments. As had been anticipated, reserve
aggregates and monetary variables showed sharply diminished growth
rates, and in some cases actual declines, on average in May after a
sharp April rise. Reserve aggregates declined in May with required
reserves dropping by about 3.5 per cent, while bank credit on a daily
average basis rose by only about 2.5 per cent. The disparate
CONFIDENTIAL (FR)
behavior of bank credit and reserves reflected a shift in deposit
composition from demand to time deposits during the month. Private
demand deposits declined sharply; there was a not quite offsetting
rise in Government deposits; and time deposits continued to expand
fairly rapidly, though below April's pace. Since the increase in
the discount rate and Regulation Q ceilings, the bank credit proxy
and time and savings deposits have risen less rapidly than in 1965,
while money supply has continued to rise at about the earlier rate.
Prospective developments. Bank credit and money supply
are expected to resume growth in the period ahead, with tax speed-ups,
cyclically strong loan demands, and agency financing contributing to
a relatively rapid movement. As of now, the projected growth does not
appear to be quite as sharp as occurred in March-April on average when
two tax dates ran close together and when monetary restraint was
not as pressing. Bank credit growth in June may be about 6-7 per
cent on average. The month-to-month change in the annual rate of
increase from May to June is influenced by the declining trend of
bank credit in May and an expected rising trend in June. Thus,
measured from the end of May to the end of June bank credit might
rise at about a 10 per cent rate or more.
During June, private demand deposits are likely to show
a relatively large increase, following their substantial recent
decline. On a monthly average basis, they could rise by about 10
per cent, partly because of a projected decline in U.S. Government
- 5 - June 3, 1966
CONFIDENTIAL (FR) - 6 - June 3, 1966
deposits. On a month-end basis, the rise would be even larger.
Time deposits are likely to increase at a slightly lower rate than
in May.
Much of the June credit demands -- particularly those
associated with agency issues and tax speed-ups -- are likely to
prove temporary. This suggests some tapering of the rate of growth
of bank credit and money after midyear. The monthly average rate
of increase in July may still be as large, or larger than June, but
the upward trend during July may be slowing down.
It is quite possible that the size of credit demands and
associated deposit expansion over the weeks ahead is being under-
estimated. For one thing, the amount of agency issues and the
degree of bank financing entailed in their flotation is uncertain.
For another, it is not clear how well prepared corporations may be
to make the accelerated payments of withheld individual income
and social security taxes, not only in June but also in July.
And finally, no allowance has been made in these projections for
any direct Treasury cash financing in July. If the Treasury
should raise cash through tax bills at that time, bank credit
expansion in July will almost certainly be enlarged. On the
other hand, if banks do not succeed in attracting time and
savings deposits at near recent rates -- or are unable to do
so because of legislative restrictions -- bank credit expansion
will be curtailed.
CONFIDENTIAL (FR) - 7 - June 3, 1966
The bank credit and deposit projections noted above imply a
growth rate in required reserves averaging out to about 5 per cent
over the next few months, although this might well be higher in view
of the uncertainties involved. This assumes net borrowed reserves
not much changed from current levels. If member banks were forced
to borrow additional reserves in the period ahead, growth in
required reserves might not slow down immediately, but would be
likely to do so as summer progresses.
