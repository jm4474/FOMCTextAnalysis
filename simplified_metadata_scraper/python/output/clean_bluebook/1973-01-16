Prefatory Note 
 
 
The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 
Please note that some material may have been redacted from this document if that

format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Please note that the numbers and text in charts and

MONEY MARKET CONDITIONS
Recent developments
(1) RPD and the money supply aggregates all appear to be
expanding at rates well above the upper limits of the Committee's
December-January ranges of tolerance, as shown in the following table.
For December alone, growth of M1 and M2 accelerated to annual rates of
revisions).1/ Growth of M1 in the fourth quarter was at an 8.6 per
cent annual rate, and growth for all of 1972 at an 8.2 per cent rate.
Although levels of M1 and M 2 both receded somewhat in early January, they
remained high relative to earlier projections.

(SAAR in Percentage Points)
Ranges of Current
Tolerance Estimates
(2) Contra-seasonal December increases in State and local
Government holdings of both demand and time deposits suggest that--as
expected--revenue sharing payments did contribute importantly to recent
growth of the money supply aggregates. In the case of M1, this contri-
bution apparently accounted for about 3 percentage points of the
December growth. No other special contributing factors have been docu-
mented, however; for example, a System telephone survey of banks parti-
cularly affected by Regulation J and the establishment of new RCC's
turned up little evidence of bank requests for increased compensatory
balances from corporations or others. The most plausible explanation of
recent rapid monetary growth thus appears to be the stimulus to trans-
actions demands generated by strong economic expansion.
(3) Shortly after the last Committee meeting, incoming deposit
data indicated that the reserve and monetary aggregates were tending to
run above the upper limits of the Committee's ranges of tolerance, and the
extent of these overshoots widened as the inter-meeting period progressed.
Because the terms of the Treasury's new bond financing were announced at
about the time firm evidence of overshoots became available, the Desk was
somewhat inhibited in moving to resist these excesses. Within this "even-
keel" constraint, however, the Desk did hold back on the provision of
nonborrowed reserves, and the average Federal funds rate advanced nearly
week, the funds rate averaged around 5.65 per cent. Recently, trading
has been 5.75 per cent, with Desk strategy on the provision of reserves
expected to result in a funds rate ranging between 5-3/4 and 5-7/8 per cent.
(4) Fluctuations in the rates at which Federal funds actually
traded were considerably wider than usual, ranging generally from as low
as 4-1/2 per cent to as high as 7 per cent. Large and erratic
day-to-day fluctuations in float contributed importantly
to this increased rate volatility by making it more difficult for both
banks and the Desk to manage reserve positions. In these circumstances
member bank borrowing was unusually heavy, particularly over the two long
holiday weekends. Average borrowings, however, dropped from $1.8 billion
in the New Year's holiday week to about $690 million in the latest week.
(5) The general firming of money market conditions over the
inter-meeting period was accompanied by relatively modest advances in
other interest rates. In short-term markets these advances ranged from
changed to only about 10 basis points higher. Sizable demand for securities
--arising partly from the reinvestment of revenue-sharing payments--tended
to limit rate advances on the most liquid types of short-term instruments,
particularly short-maturity Treasury bills. The yield on 3-month bills,
for example, showed a net decline mid-way in the inter-meeting period.
But recently it has risen to about 5.25 per cent, with announcement of
the Phase III wage-price program exerting a modest bearish impact on credit
(6) In the Treasury auction of its new 20-year bond demands from
reporting Government security dealers and other market professionals proved
to be stronger than anticipated, with their awards amounting to more than half
the total offering. Secondary market demand for the issue from final investors
was unenthusiastic at the unexpectedly low 6.79 per cent stop-out yield, and
the yield on the issue rose to 6.85 per cent as professionals
pressed to reduce their positions. Positions of reporting dealers have
declined substantially in the past few days, and most recently were
about $70 million

Prospective developments
(8) As in the previous Blue Book, three alternative sets of
relationships among monetary aggregates and money market conditions are
shown in summary form below for FOMC consideration (with figures for
aggregates representing seasonally adjusted annual rates of growth).
More detailed monthly and quarterly figures are shown in the table on
page 6a. Figures for money supply as variously defined represent the
new, revised series. Revision of the bank credit proxy and reserve series
has not yet been fully completed, and the figures for RPD represent our
best judgmental estimate of numbers consistent with the new money supply
series, pending completion of the overall revision in the next two weeks.

(9) Ranges of tolerance in RPD and the monetary aggregates
for January-February have been reduced to two percentage points so as
to provide a more precise indication of FOMC target paths from which
deviations can be measured. Strict adherence to a relatively narrow
RPD path may tend to lead to wider fluctuations in the Federal funds
rate. However, clear and significant shifts in the multiplier between
RPD and deposits could provide a basis for adjustment of the RPD path
in the inter-meeting period, depending on Committee preferences.
(10) Alternative B shown in paragraph (8) encompasses longer-
run paths for the aggregates that include a 5--6 per cent annual rate of
growth for M1, the longer-run target specified by the Committee at its
last meeting. Alternative A provides for somewhat more rapid growth in
the aggregates and alternative C for somewhat less.
(11) The short-run ranges of tolerance for the monetary
aggregates remain on the high side of longer-run targets. For example,
in alternative B, the January-February M 1 growth is indicated at
per cent, as compared with the 5--6 per cent longer-run target. It is
expected that revenue sharing payments in January and the beginning of
tax refunds next month will exert some temporary stimulus to growth in
holdings of cash and time and savings deposits.
(12) All of the alternatives shown indicate a slowing in
the second quarter growth rate in M1 and M2 relative to the first quarter.
This reflects mainly (a) disappearance of the transitory upward effect on
M1 from sizable Treasury refunds of taxes and smaller final payments by
individuals, (b) the lagged effect on money demand of past interest rate
increases, and (c) in alternatives B and C, particularly, reduced public
interest in time and savings deposits other than large CD's as short-term
rates rise further above ceiling rates.
(13) To achieve the aggregates of alternative B, the staff
expects that money market conditions will tighten from around prevail-
ing levels, given the continuing strong transaction demands for money
implicit in the rapid growth in nominal GNP projected for the first and
second quarters. The potential for money market tightening implied by
the alternative B monetary target paths is indicated by the 5-5/8--6-1/4
per cent Federal funds rate range shown for that alternative. Even with
RPD over the forthcoming January-February period rising in a 10--12 per
cent annual rate range, we would expect the funds rate to move up to
should be noted that even-keel considerations--discussed in paragraphs
(16) and (17)--would suggest that the most propitious time for a rise
in the funds rate, should one be required, is before the end of January. A
rise in the funds rate of the dimensions contemplated in alternative B
would likely be accompanied by a further rise in short-term rates generally,
with the 3-month Treasury bill rate in particular moving upward in a
(14) At such market rates, demand for member bank borrowings
would be relatively strong, even with the discount rate at the recently
announced 5 per cent level, and the level of borrowings might be around $1
billion on average. However, as borrowings continue large,many banks will wear
out their welcome at the window and this will add further to pressure on
open market rates and on banks to restrict acquisitions of loans and
(15) Efforts to achieve the reserve and monetary aggregates
of alternative C are likely to entail an even greater firming of money
market conditions, with the Federal funds rate probably moving well
above 6 per cent by the time of the next meeting. The 3-month bill
rate would likely rise into the 5-3/4--6 per cent area, if not by the
time of the next meeting then by early March when additional cash borrowing
through tax bill offerings may be anticipated. If short-term rates attain
these levels, there may be a rather marked dampening in flows of consumer-
type time and savings deposits, which could eventually call into question
the viability of current Regulation Q ceilings on such deposits.
(16) If the Committee were to opt to restrain growth in
reserves and monetary aggregates with the result that money market
conditions firmed, even-keel considerations would again be a constraint
on the timing of policy actions. Sufficient time has been given for
distribution of the recent long-term bond offering so that it no longer
appears to require special consideration. However, on January 31 the
Treasury will announce terms for refunding $4.8 billion of publicly-held
obligations that mature in mid-February. It is too early to have an
idea as to the nature of the refunding, although it does seem unlikely
at this point that new cash will need to be raised or that the Treasury
will wish to offer another long bond so close to the recent offering.
Thus, a relatively conventional exchange with short- and intermediate-term
options seems most likely.
(17) However that may be, a significant tightening of the
money market between late January and mid-February seems precluded if the
Committee wishes to adhere to previous even-keel standards. Some slight
upward drift in money market rates would not necessarily be ruled out,
depending on the psychological atmosphere around the refunding, but the
great bulk of any tightening, should it be required, would have to be
accomplished within the next two weeks.
(18) Alternative A indicates more expansive paths for the
reserve and monetary aggregates which are not likely to entail any
significant change in money market conditions from those recently pre-
vailing; this alternative, therefore, has the greatest probability of
minimizing conflicts between even-keel considerations and monetary
objectives. The funds rate under such conditions is likely to be most
frequently in the 5-3/8--5-7/8 per cent area. If the funds rate were to
remain near the upper end of that band, the 3-month bill rate probably
would be within a 5-1/4--5-1/2 per cent range over the next several weeks.
Upward bill rate pressures could be moderated in the near-term, however,
by demands for bills from State and local governments who have just
received their January revenue-sharing distribution. In addition, apart
from additions to the weekly and monthly bill auctions, the next sizable
bill offering is not expected until early March, as noted earlier.
(19) Long-term interest rates may not rise very much under
alternative A, but would probably show greater upward adjustments, at
least in the short-run, under alternatives B and C. Demands on bond
markets can be expected to be generally moderate this month and next.
The near-term forward calendar of new corporate and municipal issues
is relatively modest in size, although there are indications that the
volume could build up in the spring. Mortgage market demands, though
remaining large in volume, appear to have crested. Pressures on long-
term rates are thus most likely to come from the supply side, as.banks
and other institutional investors find that their inflows of funds are
dropping off or becoming significantly more expensive--conditions most
likely to develop under alternatives B and C. Bank interest in secur-
ities and mortgages is likely to be lessened in any event as business
loan demands continue strong, partly to help businesses finance the
anticipated acceleration in the rate of inventory accumulation.
(20) In addition to prospective credit flows, market psychol-
ogy will have a particularly important bearing in interest rate develop-
ments in the period ahead. The forthcoming budget message, the progress
of peace negotiations, and continuing evaluation of the new wage-price
program are major factors that will affect investor attitudes. Also,
market assessment of the likely course of monetary policy in the wake
of the recent discount rate action will be an important influence.
Proposed directives
(21) Presented below are three alternative formulations for the
operational paragraph of the directive, which might be taken to correspond
to the similarly lettered policy alternatives discussed in the preceding
section. In all three alternatives it is proposed to retain a reference
to Treasury financing because of the regular February refinancing to be
announced on January 31. Retention of the reference to credit market
developments is suggested should the Committee wish to take account of
the possibility of excessive market reaction to further increases in the
funds rate, particularly in connection with alternatives B and C. The
credit market reference could also encompass adverse reactions to the
discount rate increase should they occur.
Alternative A
To implement this policy, while taking account of THE
FORTHCOMING Treasury financing [DEL: operations] and possible credit
market developments, the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve
and money market conditions that will support [DEL: slower] SOME MODERATION
