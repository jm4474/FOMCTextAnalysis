Prefatory Note 
 
 
The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain.

format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing).

Recent developments
(1) M1 grew at a 14.5 per cent annual rate in October, after
remaining essentially unchanged in September. In November M1 growth
appears to be moderating significantly, however, and for the October-
November period it is now projected at a 9.5 per cent annual rate--some-
what above the upper end of the Committee's 5-9 per cent operating range.
With time and savings deposit inflows at commercial banks also running
stronger than anticipated, M2 is expected to grow at a 14.1 per cent annual
rate in the October-November period, also above the upper limit of its
2-month range. Growth of deposits at nonbank thrift institutions also
remained rapid during October, though less so than in the third quarter.
As a result of the increased demand for reserves associated with the
strength in demand and time deposits, nonborrowed reserves appear to be
increasing at an 8.7 per cent annual rate in the October-November period--
a considerably more rapid pace than over the preceding months of the
1/
year.-
1/ Appendix A contains a discussion of the actual behavior of
nonborrowed reserves in the weeks between the October and November
meetings relative to the behavior that was expected to be con-
sistent with the Committee's short-run ranges for monetary growth.

(2) Shortly after the October FOMC meeting, incoming data
suggested that growth in M1 and M2 would be at the upper limits of the
Committee's ranges. In these circumstances it appeared likely that the
immediate reduction in the funds rate objective contemplated by the FOMC
at its October meeting would have to be quickly reversed. The Chairman,
therefore, recommended--and a majority of the members concurred--that the
Desk continue aiming for a Federal funds rate at about the prevailing level
of 5 per cent. In the following week, with additional data suggesting
continued strength in the aggregates, the Chairman advised the Desk that
an increase in the funds rate would be inconsistent with the Committee's
(3) Interest rates have fluctuated within a narrow range since
the October Committee meeting. Most market rates edged upwards, as
market expectations of an immediate further decline in the Federal funds
rate were apparently disspelled early in the intermeeting period by
published weekly data suggesting that the monetary aggregates would grow
substantially in October. In lagged response to earlier declines in market
yields, however, the bank prime rate was reduced ¼ of a point to 6½ per
cent. In the mortgage market, the FNMA auction yield and interest rates
on conventional home mortgages reported by savings and loan associations
have declined somewhat in recent weeks. Stock prices have fallen
significantly further since the October FOMC meeting.
(4) Corporate demands for long term credit, after being very
strong through much of October, have been moderating recently, but the
volume of new tax exempt bond offerings has remained quite high. The
Treasury has also been an active borrower over the period since the
October FOMC meeting, raising $1.3 billion of new money through the sale
of 2-year notes in late October and $2.5 billion in connection with its
mid-November refunding. In the refunding, the Treasury auctioned $3.3
billion of 3-year notes at an average rate of 6.36 per cent, $2.2 billion
of 7-year notes at an average rate of 7.02 per cent and $1.0 billion of a
reopened 23¼ year bond at an average rate of 7.79 per cent. These issues
have most recently been trading around their auction averages. Dealers
have made fairly good progress in distributing the large awards they
received in the auctions.

Prospective developments
(6) Summarized below are three alternative sets of short-run
specifications for the monetary aggregates and the Federal funds rate.
More detailed data, including longer-run growth rates, are shown in the
tables on pp. 5a and 5b.

(7) Each of the alternatives presented is believed to be generally
consistent with the longer-run ranges for the aggregates covering the
QIII '76-QIII '77 period adopted by the Committee at the November 8
telephone meeting. But each of the shorter-run alternatives implies a
different pattern of interest rates and of money growth rates within the

(8) Alternative A involves an easing in money market conditions
over the next few weeks--with the funds rate moving down to the mid-point
of a 4-5 per cent range. However, assuming the staff's projection of the
rate of expansion in nominal GNP over the next year is correct, interest rates
would not be expected to decline for long and would probably soon have to
begin rising if M1 growth over the QIII '76-QIII '77 period were to be kept
to around 5½ per cent (the mid-point of the Committee's longer-run range of
4½-6½ per cent). On balance, money market conditions would be somewhat
easier and monetary growth rates somewhat more rapid over the next six
months under alternative A than under alternatives B or C. On the other
hand, alternative A would involve greater monetary restraint in the second
six months of the QIII '76-QIII '77 period.
(9) Alternative B involves maintenance of the Federal funds
rate at around 5 per cent over the next few weeks. We have also assumed
that credit and money demands would not begin to exert significant
upward pressures on the rate until around the middle of the first quarter
of 1977. Moreover, because alternative B--in contrast to alternative A--
does not involve any additional stimulation over the near term, not as
much monetary restraint would be required in the spring and summer of
next year to attain a one-year growth rate of 5½ per cent in M1. As a
result, the funds rate would rise less than under alternative A.
(10) Alternative C involves a tightening in the money market
over the next few weeks, with the funds rate rising to around 5½ per cent
by the time of the next Committee meeting. With such an early effort to
restrain growth in the aggregates, we would expect that little, if any,
further tightening would be required later.
(11) In general, under all three alternatives, the staff fore-
sees less upward pressure on interest rates than it had earlier. Transactions
needs for money are expected to be lower than thought earlier because the
staff's projection of nominal GNP over the next year has been further reduced.
Also, of course, financial innovations of the past year or two are expected
to continue to reduce the demand for M1 over the coming year.
(12) If our assessment of the interest rate outlook is correct,
it appears likely that growth in M2 and M3 over the QIII '76-QIII '77
period under any of the three alternatives may be at, or a shade above, the
upper ends of the 7½-10 and 9-11½ per cent ranges adopted for them by the
Committee. In making these estimates, we have assumed no substantial
near-term efforts by banks and thrift institutions to discourage recent
large inflows of time and savings deposits (other than large CD's) by
lowering offering rates on time certificates or by other means. If such
efforts develop, or if upward market interest rate pressures turn out to
be stronger than expected, growth in M2 and M3 would be more likely to fall
within the Committee's ranges.
(13) Under any of the alternatives presented, we expect M1
growth over the November-December period to be modest. Assuming unchanged
money market conditions over the next few weeks, as under alternative B,
M1 may expand in a 2½-6½ per cent annual rate range during the 2-month
period. Incoming data for early November suggest a sharp deceleration
in growth during the current month from the unusually high October rate
Moreover, growth is unlikely to strengthen in December, given the sluggish
expansion in economic activity now expected in the fourth quarter. If the
mid-point of the 2½-6½ per cent November-December range is realized, growth
in M1 from the third to the fourth quarter would be at almost a 7 per cent
annual rate.
(14) Expansion in M2 is expected to be quite sizable in November
and December. Recent data suggest that net inflows of time and savings
deposits (other than large CD's) at banks are continuing at around the
rapid September-October pace. Interest rates on such deposits are expected
to remain attractive over the weeks ahead as competing market interest
rates remain relatively low, especially under alternatives A and B. With
the unchanged money market conditions of alternative B, growth for M2
during November-December may be in a 9½-13½ per cent annual rate range--
the mid-point of which is above the upper limit of the Committee's longer-
run range. (The mid-point of the 2-month M1 growth band, on the other hand,
is at the lower limit of its longer-run range). The tightening of money
market conditions contemplated under alternative C may reduce the 2-month
M2 growth rate to an 8½-12½ per cent range.
(15) Credit demands are not expected to be particularly strong
between now and year-end. Neither information from the banking community
nor underlying economic forces suggest that business loan growth at banks
will be as large in the weeks ahead as it was in October, when there was
a surge in loan growth. Corporate demands on capital markets--particularly
the public bond market--seem to be in process of moderating, but a large
volume of foreign bond offerings is scheduled over the next few weeks.
The Treasury will probably raise $5 to $7 billion of new cash in the market
between now and year-end, but borrowing of this size has probably already
been discounted in the market.
(16) Thus, if the funds rate over the next few weeks stays around
its currently prevailing level of 5 per cent, market interest rates
generally are not likely to be under any upward pressure from the demand
side. If incoming economic data remain weak and expectations of a further
easing in monetary policy once again develop, interest rates might edge
down. And if the Federal funds rate should decline over the next few
weeks by about ½ percentage point, short-term rates may well drop sub-
stantially, with the 3-month bill rate perhaps falling to around 4 per
cent. Expectations of a discount rate decline would become more wide-
spread. Downward pressures on institutional rates--such as the prime loan
rate and primary mortgage market rates--would intensify. On the other
hand, if the Federal funds rate were to rise by about ½ percentage point,
there might be very considerable upward market rate adjustments in the short
run--particularly in the U.S. Government securities market, where dealer
positions are currently very large.
Proposed directive
(17) Given below is a proposed operational paragraph for the
directive if the Committee wishes to continue formulating its instructions
in terms of desired growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead.
No alternatives are presented for this formulation, in the expectation that
the reference to desired growth will be taken to apply to the longer-term
targets and that at this meeting the Committee will not reconsider those
"Monetary Aggregates" Proposal
To implement this policy, while taking account of developments
in domestic and international financial markets, the Committee seeks
to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions consistent with
moderate growth in monetary aggregates over the period ahead.
(18) Should the Committee desire to place main emphasis on bank
reserve and money market conditions, the language needed would depend on
the specific conditions sought. Three alternative "money market" direc-
tives intended to correspond to the similarly lettered policy alternatives
are given below.
