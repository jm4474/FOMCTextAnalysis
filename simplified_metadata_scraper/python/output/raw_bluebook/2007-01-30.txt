 MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES  

Recent Developments 

(1) The Committee’s decision at its December meeting to leave the target 

federal funds rate unchanged conformed to investor expectations, as did the retention 

of the tilt and risk assessment from the previous statement. 1  The language in the 

rationale portion of the statement, in contrast, was apparently read as suggesting a 

slight softening in the Committee’s outlook for economic growth, and the expected 

path for monetary policy beyond the near term edged down in response.  Over the 

intermeeting period, the release of the minutes of the December FOMC meeting and 

speeches by FOMC officials had little net effect on market perceptions.  However, 

stronger-than-expected reports on the economy, significant declines in oil prices, and 

generally benign inflation readings seemed to prompt investors to boost their 

expectations of growth and to mark down their assessment of near-term inflation 

pressures.  In terms of the implications for investors’ expectations for the path of the 

federal funds rate, the revisions to the growth outlook apparently predominated:  The 

expected trajectory of the federal funds rate over the next two years rotated up, with 

futures markets putting the federal funds rate at around 4.75 percent at the end of 

2008, about 45 basis points higher than at the time of the December meeting 

(Chart 1).  Market participants—including respondents to the Desk’s survey of 

primary dealers—now appear to believe that the federal funds rate will probably 

remain unchanged through the first half of this year.  Option-implied measures of 

uncertainty about the path of policy more than reversed their increases over the 

                                           
1 The effective federal funds rate averaged 5.24 percent over the intermeeting period.  
During the period, the Desk purchased $3.4 billion of Treasury coupon securities in the 
market.  The volume of outstanding long-term RPs decreased $4 billion, to $15 billion, to 
offset the seasonal reflow of currency.

previous intermeeting period, and the implied distribution of the funds rate about six 

months ahead now shows less of a skew toward significantly lower rates.  

(2) Yields on Treasury securities shifted up in a parallel fashion across the term 

structure, with two- through ten-year nominal Treasury rates increasing about 35 basis 

points over the intermeeting period.  Increases in forward rates at longer horizons 

appeared to reflect both the expectation of higher future short rates and wider term 

premiums.  TIPS-based inflation compensation was little changed at medium- and 

long-term maturities.  Inflation expectations as measured by the Reuters-Michigan 

survey were also about unchanged. 

(3) Broad equity indexes were little changed over the intermeeting period 

(Chart 2), as higher bond yields evidently countered the effects of favorable economic 

news and generally upbeat early readings on fourth-quarter earnings.  Implied 

volatility of the S&P 500 remained near historical lows.  The equity risk premium, as 

gauged by the difference between the twelve-month forward trend earnings-price ratio 

and the real long-term Treasury yield, declined a bit.  Spreads of yields on investment-

grade bonds over those on comparable-maturity nominal Treasuries held steady, while 

those on speculative-grade corporate bonds narrowed.  Corporate credit quality 

remained solid, with realized and expected default rates staying very low. 

(4) Indications of stronger U.S. economic growth helped lift the trade-weighted 

value of the dollar about 2 percent, on balance, versus major foreign currencies over 

the intermeeting period (Chart 3).2  The dollar’s largest gain—3¼ percent—came 

against the yen as investors reportedly came to expect the Japanese economy to 

recover more slowly and Japanese monetary authorities to tighten less in the near term 

than had been anticipated.  The dollar rose about 2 percent against the Canadian

dollar and the euro.  By contrast, the dollar fell slightly on net against sterling as the 

Bank of England, citing concerns about inflation pressures, wrong-footed markets on 

January 11 by increasing its policy rate 25 basis points.  Yields on long-term 

government securities in most major foreign industrial countries rose 30 to 35 basis 

points, roughly matching the increases on comparable U.S. issues.  As in the United 

States, most of the increases abroad appeared to be in the real component of yields, as 

market participants seemed to be factoring in expectations of greater strength in the 

global economy, including expected support to growth from the recent drop in oil 

prices.  A notable exception to this pattern was Japan, where nominal yields were 

roughly unchanged on net over the intermeeting period.  Stock markets in the major 

industrial countries recorded gains of 1 to 6 percent. 

(5) The foreign exchange value of the dollar was about unchanged on net 

against an index of currencies of our other important trading partners.  In Thailand, 

financial markets continued to be volatile, reacting in part to authorities’ efforts to 

deter capital inflows; share prices fell more than 10 percent.  The Thai turmoil did not 

appear to spill over to other Asian financial markets, and most Asian currencies 

moved in fairly narrow ranges.  The dollar declined ¾ percent versus the Chinese 

renminbi over the intermeeting period.  The dollar edged lower versus the Brazilian 

real, and the Brazilian EMBI+ spread narrowed to a record low of about 185 basis 

points.  

(6) The debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors is estimated to have expanded at 

an annual rate of 7½ percent in the fourth quarter of last year, close to the pace 

registered over 2006 as a whole (Chart 4).  Business debt grew more quickly last 

quarter, boosted in large part by a pickup in merger-related borrowing.  Among the 

major components of business debt, a sharp rise in the issuance of corporate bonds 

and commercial paper more than offset a moderation in the growth of C&I loans.  In 

the household sector, home mortgage debt is thought to have decelerated further in

the fourth quarter, reflecting in part the ongoing slowing in house price appreciation.  

Respondents to the January Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey reported weaker 

demand for mortgage loans, and some indicated that they had tightened standards for 

such loans.  The growth of consumer credit appears to have remained moderate last 

quarter. 

(7) M2 expanded briskly in December, bringing fourth-quarter growth to 

6¾ percent.3  Some of this strength probably reflected the lagged influence of declines 

in opportunity cost since midyear.  In January, the aggregate appears to have 

accelerated to a 9 percent rate, as growth of liquid deposits has picked up further.  

Retail money funds have continued to increase at a robust rate, while small time 

deposits appear to be decelerating.  Currency growth has been restrained as solid 

domestic demand has partially offset weak international demand.

Economic Outlook through 2008 

(8) The incoming data over the intermeeting period led the staff to mark up its 

assessment of real GDP in the fourth quarter of 2006.  The contours of the 

Greenbook forecast are otherwise little changed:  Real GDP is again projected to 

grow about 2¼ percent this year and 2½ percent in 2008.  With output expanding 

somewhat more slowly than the staff’s estimate of potential GDP this year and about 

at potential next year, the unemployment rate rises to almost 5 percent early next year 

and then levels off.  The path of core inflation is slightly below the December 

projection, mainly owing to new inflation data, lower energy and other commodity 

prices, and lower core import prices.  The staff now expects core PCE inflation to 

average 2¼ percent this year and 2 percent in 2008, while total PCE prices are 

projected to rise a bit faster than 2 percent in both years.  The forecast assumes that 

the Committee holds policy unchanged over the next two years, rather than easing 

slightly in mid-2008, as in the previous round.  Long-term Treasury yields are 

projected to edge up a bit over the forecast horizon as market participants come to 

realize that policy will not be eased as they had anticipated.  Stock prices are again 

assumed to rise at about a 6½ percent annual rate.  The real trade-weighted foreign 

exchange value of the dollar is projected to depreciate gradually, but from a higher 

level.  Reflecting the sharp decline in both spot and futures quotes, oil prices 

throughout the forecast period are about $9 per barrel lower than in the December 

Greenbook.   

Medium-Term Strategies 

(9) To shed additional light on the economic outlook and possible policy 

strategies, the FRB/US model was used to construct an illustrative extension of  

the Greenbook forecast beyond 2008 based on a set of medium-term assumptions 

together with some judgmental adjustments.  Important influences on the outlook 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 9 of 38



 

include trend multifactor productivity growth of about 1¾ percent per year, 

approximately flat energy prices, and a pickup in the pace of real dollar depreciation  

to an average rate of 3 percent per year.  Given the impetus to inflation from the 

declining foreign exchange value of the dollar, the unemployment rate would need  

to be a bit above the staff’s assumed long-run NAIRU of 5 percent to keep core  

PCE inflation stable.  The contours of aggregate demand are influenced by the  

unified federal budget deficit, which rises from 2 percent of GDP next year to about 

2¾ percent by 2012, and by the current account deficit, which stabilizes at around  

8 percent of GDP in response to the dollar’s depreciation and steady growth abroad.  

Further assuming that term, credit, and equity risk premiums gradually revert back  

to their historical norms, the real federal funds rate would need to decline about a 

percentage point from its current level, to around 2 percent, by 2012 to keep output 

expanding along the path of its potential. 

(10) As shown in Chart 5, the Greenbook-consistent estimate of short-run  

r*—the value of the real federal funds rate that would put the level of real GDP at its 

potential twelve quarters ahead—has shifted up about 50 basis points since the 

previous Bluebook.  This increase owes mainly to the upward revision to the staff’s 

assessment of aggregate demand implied by lower energy prices and recent robust 

readings on consumer spending.  The Greenbook-consistent measure of short-run r* 

now stands at about 3¼ percent, a bit above the actual real funds rate, while all three 

model-based estimates are considerably lower, at around 2½ percent.  The model-

based estimates of medium-run r*—the value of the real funds rate consistent with 

keeping output at potential at a seven-year horizon—are close to 2¼ percent, just 

above the TIPS-based measure of about 2 percent.    

(11) Chart 6 depicts optimal control simulations of the FRB/US model in which 

policymakers are assumed to place equal weight on three stabilization objectives: 

keeping core PCE inflation close to a specified goal of either 1½ or 2 percent, keeping

unemployment close to the long-run NAIRU, and avoiding changes in the nominal 

funds rate.4  In principle, because the decisions of the private sector depend in part  

on expectations regarding the future path of policy, and because policymakers are 

assumed to place somewhat greater weight on near-term outcomes relative to those  

at distant horizons, a policymaker might be tempted to reoptimize the path of policy 

at a later date, even in the absence of any new information.  However, given the 

structure of the FRB/US model, the magnitude of those readjustments in current 

circumstances would be very small (see box on “Dynamic Inconsistency and Optimal 

Control Policies”).  For an inflation goal of 2 percent (the right-hand set of charts), 

the optimal path of the nominal federal funds rate is somewhat higher than that 

presented in the October and December Bluebooks, remaining close to 5¼ percent 

over the next two years and then gradually declining to about 4 percent by the end  

of 2012.  With a lower near-term outlook for core inflation, this path for the nominal 

rate implies a somewhat higher real interest rate, which tempers the increased strength 

of aggregate demand.  Output remains close to its potential; the unemployment rate 

returns to the NAIRU by the end of next year and remains near that rate in 

subsequent years.  However, the cumulative decline in energy prices helps nudge 

inflation lower, and core inflation settles around its 2 percent goal without the need 

for any substantial economic slack.  By contrast, with an inflation goal of 1½ percent 

(left-hand set of charts), the optimal funds rate peaks at just above 6 percent in early 

2008—a bit higher than in the last two Bluebooks—and then declines gradually to 

about 3½ percent by 2012.  Furthermore, it is evident from this scenario that the 

latest revision to the staff’s outlook has not significantly affected the medium-term

expectations of households and firms are formed using more limited information.

Dynamic Inconsistency and Optimal Control Policies 
 
The optimal control policies shown in the Bluebook assume that the policymaker specifies  
a particular funds rate path starting from that date and then follows that path.  In principle,  
a policymaker might be tempted to reoptimize the path of policy at some later date, even in  
the absence of new information; that is, the prescriptions from these simulations might exhibit 
dynamic inconsistency.  The academic literature has emphasized two possible sources of this temptation.  
First, policymakers might desire to keep the unemployment rate below its sustainable rate and hence 
be inclined towards inflation surprises; however, because such surprises cannot be systematic if the 
private sector’s expectations are rationally determined, this inclination toward stimulative policies 
only raises inflation.  Second, if current decisions of the private sector depend on expected future 
monetary policy actions and if policymakers discount the future, then the central bank may be 
tempted to view private-sector expectations of future policy actions as a separate instrument from 
actual actions.  In the optimal control scenarios shown in the Bluebook, the first source of dynamic 
inconsistency does not arise because, along with other goals, policymakers are always assumed to 
have the objective of keeping unemployment close to its natural rate.  However, the second source 
could be relevant for the optimal control simulations that have become a staple of the Bluebook. 
  
The magnitude of this dynamic inconsistency can be gauged, for example, by considering the 
optimal control scenario shown in the left column of Chart 6, in which the policymaker has an 
inflation goal of 1½ percent.  As shown in the chart below, in the absence of any new information, 
reoptimizing the policy path in either 2009 (the dashed line) or 2010 (the dash-dotted line) yields 
funds rate prescriptions that differ by less than ¼ percentage point from those of the optimal policy 
in the benchmark scenario (the solid line).  Additional simulations (not shown) indicate that the 
small magnitude of these deviations is robust to alternative values of the policymaker’s discount rate 
and to the relative weight placed on the objective of avoiding interest rate changes.

The small magnitude of dynamic inconsistency provides some reassurance that the optimal control 
simulations shown in each Bluebook can serve as useful benchmarks in assessing medium-term 
policy strategies.  Of course, this issue might well loom larger under different macroeconomic 
circumstances or under alternative assumptions about policymaker preferences and private-sector 
expectations formation.1

unemployment and core inflation that are quite close to those presented in October 

and December. 

(12) The upper panels of Chart 7 depict model- and market-based assessments 

of the policy outlook through the end of 2012.  In the absence of shocks, the 

outcome-based rule prescribes a funds rate path that declines gradually to about  

4 percent by the end of 2012, while interest rate forwards imply a faster decline over 

the next two years and a leveling off at about 4½ percent after that.  Stochastic 

simulations of the FRB/US model indicate a 70 percent probability that the 

prescriptions of the outcome-based rule will fall in a range of 2 to 6½ percent during 

2012; information from at-the-money interest rate caps also indicates considerable 

uncertainty in financial markets regarding the prospective path of policy at longer 

horizons (see box on “Assessing Medium-Term Policy Uncertainty using Interest Rate 

Caps”).   

(13) The lower portion of Chart 7 reports the near-term prescriptions of simple 

policy rules for inflation goals of 1½ or 2 percent.  For example, the rule proposed  

by Taylor (1999) prescribes a funds rate of about 4¾ to 5 percent for the current 

quarter, whereas a funds rate of 5½ to 5¾ percent is stipulated by a variant of that 

rule incorporating a higher value of r*.  In each of these cases, the rule is consistent 

with a cut next quarter of about 25 basis points.  In contrast to the Taylor rules, the 

first-difference rule—which does not require estimates of the levels of the output gap 

or the equilibrium real interest rate—generates a funds rate that rises to 5¾ percent  

next quarter if the inflation goal is 1½ percent, or a flat funds rate if the inflation goal 

is 2 percent.

Assessing Medium-Term Policy Uncertainty using Interest Rate Caps 
 
Uncertainty around the prospective path of the federal funds rate can be assessed using 
implied volatilities derived from interest rate derivatives.  In previous Bluebooks, options  
on Eurodollar futures were used to construct confidence intervals at relatively short 
horizons, but these derivatives only trade out to two years.  By contrast, interest rate caps, 
which are among the most liquid over-the-counter fixed income derivatives, provide 
information about uncertainty at much longer horizons; hence, starting with this Bluebook, 
these derivatives are used to construct confidence intervals for the funds rate at horizons 
extending out six years.1 
 
An interest rate cap is a sequence of call options—referred to as caplets—that insures the 
holder against increases in short-term interest rates above a certain level over the horizon  
of the cap.  For example, a standard ten-year cap comprises thirty-nine quarterly caplets  
on three-month LIBOR, where the first caplet is linked to the realized three-month rate 
three months ahead, and the final caplet is linked to the realized rate 9¾ years ahead.   
Given prices of interest rate caps at several distinct maturities, it is feasible to compute an 
entire term structure of implied volatilities.  Translating these estimates from three-month 
LIBOR to overnight federal funds requires some assumptions regarding the magnitudes  
of term premiums and the relative volatility of overnight versus three-month interest rates.   
 
While interest rate caps are useful for assessing market uncertainty about policy at relatively 
long horizons, the confidence intervals presented in Chart 7 rest on two important 
assumptions that are commonly employed by options traders:  Short-term interest rates are 
assumed to be log-normally distributed and to follow a simple autoregressive process over 
the life of the contract.2  Furthermore, these confidence intervals are based solely on the 
prices of at-the-money options, whereas using the prices of both in- and out-of-the-money 
options could reveal significant information about market perceptions of skewness or heavy 
tails in the distribution of short-term interest rates; indeed, such information might well 
indicate more substantial downside risks than depicted in Chart 7.  These issues are the 
subject of ongoing research by Board staff. 
_____________________ 
1 For further information regarding methodology, see the January 9, 2007 memo by Benson Durham, “Federal Funds 
Confidence Intervals Derived from Interest Rate Caps.” 
2 Note that the log-normal assumption by construction implies that the distribution of rates is skewed somewhat  
toward higher rates.

Short-Run Policy Alternatives 

(14) This Bluebook presents three policy alternatives for the Committee’s 

consideration, summarized by the draft statements in Table 1.  Under Alternatives A 

and B, the Committee would leave the federal funds rate unchanged at this meeting, 

while under Alternative C it would tighten policy by 25 basis points.  Alternative A 

would reflect a judgment that the risks to economic growth and inflation are now 

roughly balanced.  In Alternatives B and C, the accompanying statement would 

continue to indicate that inflation is the predominant risk, suggesting that additional 

firming is still more likely than policy easing in the near term.  The rationale portion 

of all three alternatives has been trimmed some, given that the references in the 

December statement to prior monetary policy actions and the impetus to inflation 

from rising energy prices seemed stale. 

(15) The implications for monetary policy of better-than-expected news on both 

inflation and economic growth may be seen as roughly offsetting, suggesting that the 

Committee has little reason to alter its current policy stance and risk assessment.  If 

so, the Committee may be attracted to Alternative B, under which the federal funds 

rate would remain unchanged at 5¼ percent and the statement would continue to 

highlight concern about inflation.  The Committee may see the contours of the staff 

projection—output running close to its potential and core inflation edging down to 

2 percent by next year—as both reasonably likely and about the best possible in 

current circumstances.  In the staff’s analysis, the real federal funds rate is near the 

Greenbook-consistent measure of its equilibrium value (Chart 5), suggesting that the 

current policy stance is likely to be consistent with fostering output near potential 

over time.  Maintaining the current policy stance would be consistent with 

prescriptions from both the optimal policy path simulations of the FRB/US model 

(Chart 6) and the first-difference rule (Chart 7), based on an assumed 2 percent 

inflation objective.  Although the Committee may view inflation running at or above

Rationale 3.  Readings on core inflation have 
been elevated, and the high level of 
resource utilization has the potential 
to sustain inflation pressures.  
However, inflation pressures seem 
likely to moderate over time, 
reflecting reduced impetus from 
energy prices, contained inflation 
expectations, and the cumulative 
effects of monetary policy actions and 
other factors restraining aggregate 
demand.

Assessment of 
Risk 

4.  Nonetheless, the Committee 
judges that some inflation risks 
remain.  The extent and timing of any 
additional firming that may be needed 
to address these risks will depend on 
the evolution of the outlook for both 
inflation and economic growth, as 
implied by incoming information.

2 percent as uncomfortably high, downside risks to employment and growth, 

especially given the potentially delicate state of the housing sector, may persuade the 

Committee to refrain from tightening at this time.  If so, the Committee may continue 

to indicate that inflation is the predominant risk to the outlook, especially given the 

high rate of utilization in the labor market. 

(16) In light of the flurry of stronger-than-expected economic data over the 

intermeeting period, the rationale paragraph in the statement under Alternative B 

could indicate that the economy seems likely to expand at a moderate pace.  It could 

drop the reference to “a substantial cooling of the housing market” and note, instead, 

that “although some tentative signs of stabilization have appeared in the housing 

market, weakness in residential construction remains a drag on economic growth.”  

With regard to inflation, the statement could acknowledge that readings on core 

inflation “have improved modestly in recent months,” but reiterate the Committee’s 

concern that inflation pressures remain.  In its assessment of risks, the Committee 

could essentially repeat the language from its statement in December.          

(17) Investors see virtually no chance of a policy change at this meeting, and the 

Desk’s survey suggests that primary dealers unanimously expect that the 

accompanying statement will note that the Committee continues to see inflation as the 

dominant risk.  Consequently, implementation of Alternative B is unlikely to elicit 

significant market reaction.     

(18) In light of the improvement in the outlook for inflation during the 

intermeeting period and the persistence of downside risks arising from the substantial 

cooling of the housing market, the Committee may now judge that the risks to the 

attainment of its dual objectives are roughly balanced, as in Alternative A.  Removing 

the bias toward further tightening would leave the Committee better positioned to 

respond to the adverse effects of a possible further deterioration in residential 

construction or spillovers to consumer spending, along the lines of the “more 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 20 of 38



 

extensive housing correction” alternative Greenbook scenario.  Even absent such 

concerns, the expected path for inflation is somewhat lower than in December, 

implying that the real federal funds rate is poised to edge higher—a development that 

the Committee may view as reducing the likelihood of policy tightening in the near 

term.  Furthermore, the Committee might see core inflation as declining faster than in 

the staff forecast because, for instance, it perceives less tightness in labor markets than 

the staff (a possibility suggested by the “lower NAIRU” alternative Greenbook 

scenario), or because it is more optimistic about the disinflationary impetus from 

lower energy and other commodity prices and the stronger foreign exchange value of 

the dollar. 

(19) The rationale portion of Alternative A reflects the improved readings on 

economic growth but notes that the substantial cooling of the housing market remains 

a drag on the expansion.  The paragraph on inflation observes that “inflation 

pressures seem likely to moderate over time, partly reflecting the recent decline in 

energy prices.”  To indicate the Committee’s overall assessment of balanced risks, the 

statement then simply points to the dependence of future policy adjustments on the 

evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by 

incoming information. 

(20) Shorter-term interest rates would likely fall in response to an announcement 

along the lines of Alternative A, and longer-term yields might follow suit.  However, if 

investors read the statement as suggesting that the Committee was willing to tolerate 

somewhat higher rates of inflation over the long haul, longer-term yields could be 

pushed higher and the foreign exchange value of the dollar would likely weaken. 

(21) In contrast, the surprisingly strong economic performance in the fourth 

quarter and continued tightness in labor markets might heighten the concern of some 

members that the current stance of policy is likely to produce insufficient progress on 

inflation.  If so, the Committee might judge that an additional 25 basis point increase 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 21 of 38



 

in the federal funds rate at this meeting, as in Alternative C, is warranted.  Both the 

optimal policy path simulations of the FRB/US model (Chart 6) and the first-

difference rule (Chart 7) suggest that additional firming of policy should be 

undertaken if the Committee wishes to achieve a long-term inflation objective of 

1½ percent.  With signs indicating that the housing market is stabilizing, the major 

downside risk to the outlook appears to be less pressing.  In light of the economy’s 

resilience over the past several quarters, the Committee may also be concerned that 

the recent rebound in personal consumption expenditures may prove more persistent 

than in the staff projection (as in the “buoyant consumer spending” alternative 

Greenbook scenario), suggesting that the current stance of policy may not prevent the 

economy from stretching its resource use tighter.  In these circumstances, and with 

core inflation uncomfortably high, a slight policy firming at this meeting may be seen 

as both appropriate to ensure that the modest improvement in core inflation in recent 

months is not reversed and as desirable to signal the Committee’s resolve to foster a 

further decline.  

(22) Under Alternative C, the paragraph on economic activity in the rationale 

section notes the improvement in economic growth and observes that the housing 

market may be stabilizing.  The announcement also points out that, despite modest 

improvements, readings on core inflation remain elevated and that the extent and 

speed of further moderation in inflation remains uncertain.  In its assessment of risks, 

the Committee would once again indicate that inflation risks are the predominant 

concern, but could omit the clause referring to “the extent and timing of any 

additional firming” in the last sentence.  Instead, the statement would note that “in 

the near term policy firming is more likely than policy easing,” which may better 

reflect the Committee’s views regarding the range of likely outcomes about the 

direction of policy, especially following a firming at this meeting and the change in 

other forward-looking language. 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 22 of 38



 

(23) The choice of Alternative C would stun market participants, leading to an 

upward revision of their short-term outlook for the path of policy and a significant 

rise in short- and intermediate-term interest rates.  Longer-term rates would likely step 

up, especially if market participants became concerned that the inflation outlook is 

less benign than they had thought.  That said, by reaffirming the Committee’s 

determination to reduce inflation, this policy action might also lead market 

participants to expect a more rapid decline in inflation and possibly even to revise 

downward their perceptions of the Committee’s long-term inflation objective.  If this 

is the case, long-term forward rates might decline and the foreign exchange value of 

the dollar could strengthen.  

Money and Debt Forecasts 

(24) Under the Greenbook forecast, M2 is expected to grow about 5½ percent 

in 2007 and 5 percent in 2008, close to the rates projected in December. Opportunity 

costs edge down this year, as deposit rates continue to catch up to earlier increases in 

short-term interest rates.  As a result, M2 grows faster than nominal income in 2007.  

In 2008, opportunity costs are about flat and M2 grows broadly in line with nominal 

income.  In the forecast, continuing rapid growth in retail money funds offsets more 

sluggish growth in small time deposits, while liquid deposits expand moderately, on 

net.  Currency growth continues to be restrained by weak foreign demand.   

(25) The growth of domestic nonfinancial sector debt is projected to fall from 

about 7¾ percent last year to 6½ percent in 2007 and to about 6 percent in 2008.  In 

the household sector, the weakness in housing prices continues to dampen mortgage 

borrowing over the forecast horizon.  Corporate debt is also projected to slow 

appreciably, as the strong merger-related debt issuance seen last year wanes.  With the 

unified budget deficit expected to widen, federal debt growth is projected to pick up 

this year and next.

Appendix A: Measures of the Equilibrium Real Rate 
 

The equilibrium real rate is the real federal funds rate that, if maintained, would be projected to return 
output to its potential level over time.  The short-run equilibrium rate is defined as the rate that would 
close the output gap in twelve quarters given the corresponding model’s projection of the economy.   
The medium-run concept is the value of the real federal funds rate projected to keep output at potential 
in seven years, under the assumption that monetary policy acts to bring actual and potential output into 
line in the short run and then keeps them equal thereafter.  The TIPS-based factor model measure 
provides an estimate of market expectations for the real federal funds rate seven years ahead.  
 
The actual real federal funds rate is constructed as the difference between the nominal rate and realized 
inflation, where the nominal rate is measured as the quarterly average of the observed federal funds rate, 
and realized inflation is given by the log difference between the staff’s estimate of the core PCE price 
index and its lagged value four quarters earlier.  For the current quarter, the nominal rate is specified as 
the target federal funds rate on the Bluebook publication date.  
 
Confidence intervals reflect uncertainties about model specification, coefficients, and the level of 
potential output.  The final column of the table indicates the values for the current quarter based on  
the estimation for the previous Bluebook, except that the TIPS-based measure and the actual real funds 
rate are the values published in the previous Bluebook. 
  

Measure Description 

Single-equation 
Model  

The measure of the equilibrium real rate in the single-equation model is based on an 
estimated aggregate-demand relationship between the current value of the output gap and 
its lagged values as well as the lagged values of the real federal funds rate. 

Small Structural 
Model 

The small-scale model of the economy consists of equations for five variables: the output 
gap, the equity premium, the federal budget surplus, the trend growth rate of output, and 
the real bond yield. 

Large Model 
(FRB/US) 

Estimates of the equilibrium real rate using FRB/US—the staff’s large-scale econometric 
model of the U.S. economy—depend on a very broad array of economic factors, some of 
which take the form of projected values of the model’s exogenous variables. 

Greenbook-
consistent  

The FRB/US model is used in conjunction with an extended version of the Greenbook 
forecast to derive a Greenbook-consistent measure.  FRB/US is first add-factored so that 
its simulation matches the extended Greenbook forecast, and then a second simulation is 
run off this baseline to determine the value of the real federal funds rate that closes the 
output gap. 

TIPS-based 
Factor Model 

Yields on TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) reflect investors’ expectations of 
the future path of real interest rates, but also include term and liquidity premiums.  The 
TIPS-based measure of the equilibrium real rate is constructed using the seven-year-ahead 
instantaneous real forward rate derived from TIPS yields as of the Bluebook publication 
date.  This forward rate is adjusted to remove estimates of the term and liquidity 
premiums based on a three-factor arbitrage-free term-structure model applied to TIPS 
yields, nominal yields, and inflation.  Because TIPS indexation is based on the total CPI, 
this measure is also adjusted for the medium-term difference—projected at 40 basis 
points—between total CPI inflation and core PCE inflation.

Appendix B: Analysis of Policy Paths and Confidence Intervals 
 

Rule Specifications:  For the following rules, it denotes the federal funds rate for quarter t, while  
the explanatory variables include the staff’s projection of trailing four-quarter core PCE inflation (πt), 
inflation two and three quarters ahead (πt+2|t and πt+3|t), the output gap in the current period and one 
quarter ahead ( *t ty y−  and *1| 1|t t t ty y+ +− ), and the three-quarter-ahead forecast of annual average GDP 
growth relative to potential ( 4 4 *3| 3|t t t ty y+ +Δ − Δ ), and *π  denotes an assumed value of policymakers’ 
long-run inflation objective.  The outcome-based and forecast-based rules were estimated using real-
time data over the sample 1988:1-2005:4; each specification was chosen using the Bayesian information 
criterion. Each rule incorporates a 75 basis point shift in the intercept, specified as a sequence of  
25 basis point increments during the first three quarters of 1998.  The first two simple rules were 
proposed by Taylor (1993, 1999), while the third is a variant of the Taylor (1999) rule—introduced  
in the August Bluebook—with a higher value of r*.  The prescriptions of the first-difference rule do  
not depend on assumptions regarding r* or the level of the output gap; see Orphanides (2003). 
 

Outcome-based rule it =  1.17it-1–0.37it-2+0.20[1.04  + 1.76 πt  + 3.32( *t ty y− )  – 2.37( *1 1t ty y− −− )]

Forecast-based rule it =  1.16it-1–0.36it-2+0.20[0.89+ 1.74 πt+2|t+2.32( *1| 1|t t t ty y+ +− )–1.40( *1 1t ty y− −− )]

Taylor (1993) rule it = 2 + πt + 0.5(πt – *π ) + 0.5( *t ty y− ) 

Taylor (1999) rule it = 2 + πt + 0.5(πt – *π ) + ( *t ty y− ) 

Taylor (1999) rule     
with higher r* 

it = 2.75 + πt + 0.5(πt – *π ) + ( *t ty y− )  

First-difference rule it = it-1 + 0.5(πt+3|t – *π ) + 0.5( 4 4 *3| 3|t t t ty y+ +Δ − Δ ) 
 
FRB/US Model Simulations:  Prescriptions from the two empirical rules are computed using dynamic 
simulations of the FRB/US model, implemented as though the rule is followed starting at this FOMC 
meeting.  This quarter’s prescription is a weighted average of the actual value of the federal funds rate 
thus far this quarter and the value obtained from the FRB/US model simulations using the timing of this 
meeting within the quarter to determine the weights.  Confidence intervals are based on stochastic 
simulations of the FRB/US model with shocks drawn from the estimated residuals over 1986-2005.  
Information from Financial Markets:  The expected funds rate path is based on forward rate 
agreements, and the confidence intervals for this path are constructed using prices of interest rate caps. 
Near-Term Prescriptions of Simple Policy Rules:  These prescriptions are calculated using Greenbook 
projections for inflation and the output gap. Because the first-difference rule involves the lagged funds 
rate, the value labeled “Previous Bluebook” for the current quarter is computed using the actual value  
of the lagged funds rate, and the one-quarter-ahead prescriptions are based on this rule’s prescription for 
the current quarter.

Inflation Indicator Based on M2

Note: P* is defined to equal M2 times V* divided by potential GDP. V*, or long-run velocity, is estimated
using average velocity over the 1959:Q1-to-1989:Q4 period and then, after a break, over the interval from
1993:Q1 to the present. For the forecast period, P* is based on the staff M2 forecast and P is simulated using a
short-run dynamic model relating P to P*. Blue areas indicate periods in which P* is notably less than P.
Gray areas denote the projection period.
