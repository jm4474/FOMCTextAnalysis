a PAR 14 growth in m-1 and m-2 over the august - september period would likely be in annual rate ranges of 5 - 1/2 to 9 - 1/2 and 8 - 1/2 to 12 - 1/2 percent , respectively .
a PAR 14 other short- term market rates could decline rather considerably , since the market at present does not expect an easing in the system 's posture .
a PAR 14 given the recent data on inflation and unemployment , and the prevailing state of expectations regarding monetary policy , such a movement in domestic rates would likely lead to an appreciable weakening of the dollar on foreign exchange markets .
a PAR 14 purchases of treasuries by foreign official institutions associated with any substantial intervention activity might result in relatively larger declines in treasury bill rates than in private rates .
a PAR 14 in long - term debt markets , bond yields would probably also decline , though such tendencies would be limited if an easing in the funds rate were to strengthen inflationary expectations .
a PAR 14 thrift deposit flows would benefit from the decline in market rates , especially if bill yields fell enough to reopen a ceiling rate differential , and mortgage rates might edge downward .

b SENT -- the federal funds rate specifications of alternative b are centered on the currently prevailing 10½ to 10¾ percent range .
b PAR 10 under alternative b , m-2 growth is projected to expand at about a 10 percent annual rate during the august - september period , a some-
b PAR 10 what slower growth rate than in june and july .
b PAR 10 in addition to the slowing in growth of the m-1 component , it is unlikely that savings deposits will continue to expand at their recent rate , given the high level of market interest rates .
b PAR 10 nonetheless , growth in small time deposits should remain brisk , with banks continuing to attract a substantial amount of mmc deposits in the absence of an inter - institutional ceiling rate differential .
b PAR 11 as shown in the upper panel of the chart on page 10 , under alternative b m-1 in september would be above the level implied by the upper end of the committee 's 1½ to 4½ percent growth range for the qiv ' 78 to qiv ' 79 period .
b PAR 11 this would also be true under alternatives a
b PAR 11 however , as is indicated in the lower panel of the chart , if the longer - run range is adjusted to reflect the downward revision in the staff 's estimate of the ats / now effect from the original 3 percent to the current 1 percent , the projected september level ( under alternative b ) is within , though in the upper half , of the adjusted 3 to 6 percent range .
b PAR 11 for m-2 , growth indicated by the alternative b range would place the aggregate in september well into the upper half of the 5 to 8 percent range established by the committee for the period qiv ' 78 to qiv ' 79 .

b PAR 11 it may be noted that , assuming ats retards m-1 growth by 1½ percentage points over the year , m-1 would need to rise at a 4.1 percent annual rate between july and the fourth quarter to hit the midpoint of its longer - run range .
b PAR 11 growth in m-2 would have to be at a 5.3 percent annual rate over the same period to achieve the midpoint of its longer - run range .

b PAR 16 as noted in paragraph ( 9   , the staff currently expects that the public 's demand for m-1 will be significantly weaker over the remainder of the year than it has been in recent months .
b PAR 16 given the out- look for nominal gnp , and assuming that the committee adopts short - run alternative b , the projected behavior of money demand would permit a decline in the federal funds rate to around 9 - 1/2 percent by year - end with m-1 growth for the qiv ' 78 to qiv ' 79 period ending up close to the mid- point of the longer - run range ( of 3 to 6 percent , assuming 1 - 1/2 percent ats adjustment ) .
b PAR 16 however , should the public 's demand for m-1 not exhibit the anticipated weakening , m-1 growth might be well into the upper half of the longer - run range even if the funds rate were held at its current level .
b PAR 16 directive language 

c PAR 15 over the august- september period , m-1 probably would grow in a 4 - 1/2 to 8 - 1/2 percent annual rate range and m-2 between 7 - 1/2 and 11 - 1/2 percent .
c PAR 15 a further tightening action at this juncture would reinforce the view that the federal reserve is giving relatively heavy weight to domestic inflation and the performance of the dollar abroad in formulating its policies .
c PAR 15 the dollar likely would strengthen on foreign exchange markets , and while a rise in short - term rates could be anticipated , bond yields might increase rather little , if at all .
c PAR 15 given the already wide spread between bond yields and mortgage rates -- and the minor impact of the assumed short - term rate increase on thrift institution deposit flows -- mortgage rates probably might increase only moderately .
