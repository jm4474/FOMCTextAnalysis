a PAR 14 the federal funds rate would probably decline to 5 - 3/4 percent or a little above .
a PAR 14 the associated decrease in market interest rates would be expected to boost m2 growth to a little over a 10 percent annual rate over the june - to - september period , moving this aggregate to just below the upper end of its long - run range .
a PAR 14 there is a risk that m2 growth could be even more rapid if institutions prove especially reluctant to reduce offering rates on conventional now and savings accounts as market rates drop closer to the previous regulatory ceilings of 5 - 1/4 and 5 - 1/2 percent on these accounts .
a PAR 14 in any event , given the lagged effects of any near - term easing in market conditions , m2 growth in the fourth quarter could continue at a fairly rapid pace , absent a subsequent move toward more reserve restraint ; this would leave the aggregate around the upper end or even somewhat above its long - run range for the year .
a PAR 14 m3 would grow at around a 9 - 1/2 percent annual rate over the june - to - september period under this alternative , entering the fourth quarter near the upper end of its annual range .
a PAR 14 the risks of m3 running significantly above the upper end of its annual range , even in the event of a surge in ocds and savings deposits , would be limited by offsetting reductions in issuance of managed liabilities by banks and thrifts .
a PAR 14 m1 would be expected to increase at a 16 percent rate between june and september under this alternative , moving even further above the upper end of its range by the end of the quarter .
a PAR 15 short - term rates would decline appreciably , with the 3-month treasury bill rate falling toward 5 - 1/4 percent under alternative a . bond yields probably would also decline , but any sustained sizable drop likely would require signs of continuing sluggishness in the economy and lack of price pressures , as well as the absence of substantial weakness in the dollar .
a PAR 15 the dollar could come under heavy selling pressure with this alternative , unless key foreign central banks were also to take easing steps .
a PAR 18 draft language for the operational paragraph , with the usual options for alternative specifications of reserve pressures , is shown below .
a PAR 18 this draft follows the format used at the july meeting in specifying expected growth rates for m2 and m3
a PAR 18 but not for m1 .
a PAR 18 with respect to m1 , the draft retains language referring to the expectation of a reduction in m1 growth from the second - quarter pace .
a PAR 18 under all three bluebook alternatives , the staff is projecting some slowing in the rate of m1 growth for june to september relative to the previous three months , although the degree of slowing is not very marked , especially under alternative a . should the committee choose this alternative , it may wish to delete the language referring to the expected moderation in m1 growth , leaving the statement that m1 will be judged in light of the broader aggre- gates and other factors .
a PAR 18 with regard to possible intermeeting adjustments in the degree of reserve pressures , the draft provides for symmetry in either direction , as in the july directive , but could be adapted to an asymmetric approach ( with the appropriate use of " might " and " would " ) as in a number of earlier directives .

a PAR 18 this action is expected to be consistent with growth in m2 and m3 over the period from june to september at annual rates of about   to

a PAR 18 while growth in m1 is expected to moderate from the exceptionally large increase during the second quarter , that growth will continue to be judged in the light of the behavior of m2 and m3 and other factors .
a PAR 18 somewhat greater or lesser reserve restraint might ( would ) be acceptable depending on the behavior of the aggregates , the strength of the business expansion , developments in foreign exchange markets , progress against inflation , and condi- tions in domestic and international credit markets .
a PAR 18 the chairman may call for committee consultation if it appears to the manager for domestic operations that reserve conditions during the period before the next meeting are likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of   to

b PAR 9 federal funds would probably continue to trade in the 6 - 1/4 to 6 - 3/8 percent area .
b PAR 9 m2 growth would be expected to slow to around 8 percent over august and september , reflecting in large measure a leveling off in overnight rps as banks stop adding aggressively to their holdings of u.s .
b PAR 9 government securities in a more stable interest rate environ- ment .
b PAR 9 in addition , growth of retail deposits and money market funds is likely to moderate as offering yields come more in line with market rates around cur- rent levels .
b PAR 9 fragmentary data for early august suggest that expansion of m2 is indeed slowing from its rapid july pace .
b PAR 9 even with the anticipated moder- ation in m2 , growth would average 9 - 1/2 percent fran june to september and 10 - 1/2 percent on a quarterly - average basis in the third quarter , implying an unusually large drop in its velocity ( given the greenbook forecast for gnp ) of 5 - 1/2 percent at an annual rate .
b PAR 9 the projected moderation in m3 growth from its july bulge reflects less rapid expansion in its non - m2 compon- ent as well as in m2 . inflows to institution - only money funds should abate in response to the realignment of fund yields with market rates , and the expected deceleration in bank credit would act to reduce issuance of managed liabilities .
b PAR 10 growth of m1 , while diminishing over august and september under alternative b , is likely to remain quite strong at around 13 percent .
b PAR 10 both its demand deposit and now account components should still grow fairly rapidly in the near term , given recent declines in open market rates and , in the case of ocds , sluggish adjustment of deposit offering rates , which imply extremely thin opportunity costs at least for a while .
b PAR 10 the decline in the velocity of m1 would be at an 11 percent rate in the third quarter , nearly as large as the 12 percent drop in the second quarter .
b PAR 11 the money growth specifications of alternative b imply increases in both m2 and m3 from their fourth - quarter base to september of around 8 - 1/2 percent at an annual rate , with growth in m1 at nearly a 14 per- cent annual rate through september .
b PAR 11 expansion in all the monetary aggregates would be expected to moderate a little further in the fourth quarter , should interest rates remain close to current levels as in the staff 's greenbook forecast .
b PAR 11 in that forecast , nominal gnp is projected to strengthen only moderately in the fourth quarter , while the effects of earlier declines in interest rates on money demand should continue to diminish .
b PAR 11 under these circumstances , both m2 and m3 are likely to remain fairly high in their long - run ranges , growing perhaps around 8 - 1/2 percent from qiv 1985 to qiv 1986 .
b PAR 11 m1 expansion for the year might be about 13 percent , with its velocity registering a record postwar decline .
b PAR 13 short- and long - term interest rates are expected to remain around their current levels under alternative b , at least initially , though with federal funds continuing to trade in a 6 - 1/4 to 6 - 3/8 area some modest upward pressures on interest rates could emerge as market participants begin to reassess the odds on a near - term easing in policy .
b PAR 13 nevertheless , the dollar could continue to drift lower on foreign exchange markets .
b PAR 13 in addi- tion to the usual economic news , financial markets may be confronted with important developments in tax reform and federal budget policy that could significantly affect investor sentiment during the weeks ahead .
