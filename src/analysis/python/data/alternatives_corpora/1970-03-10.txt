a PAR 3 while the staff had expected some gradual improvement in time deposit performance under the less restrictive alternative a opted by the committee , the improvement developed more rapidly than projected partly because of an earlier and larger decline in bill rates than anticipated .
a PAR 3 much of the improved performance of time deposits was attributable to consumer - type deposits at banks outside major money centers .
a PAR 3 in addition , the attrition of domestic large negotiable cd 's came to a halt in early february , and inflows of foreign official funds into time deposits were larger than expected .
a PAR 7 if the committee wishes to continue on the growth path of monetary aggregates ( taken together ,and associated money market conditions , that are implicit in the policy stance adopted at the last meeting , it may wish to consider the following second paragraph for the directive ( alternative a   : to implement this policy , while taking account of [ del : the current treasury refundin possibble bank regulatory changes and ] the committee 's desire to see moderate growth in money and bank credit over the months ahead , system open market operations until the next meeting of the committee shall be conducted with a view to maintaining the somewhat less [ del : moving gradually toward somewhat less ] firm conditions that have been attained in the money market ; provided , however , that operations shall be modified promptly to resist any tendency for money and bank credit to deviate significantly from a moderate growth pattern .
a PAR 17 the anticipated weakness of the economy through the second quarter suggests that it will be difficult to generate much more growth in the money supply than indicated in alternative a without a substantially lower level of interest rates .
a PAR 17 at the same time , the continuing tight position of banks generally suggests that there would be a sharp expansion in bank credit if market interest rates dropped well below regulation q constraints , and banks thereby had the opportunity to regain their market position through time deposits .
a PAR 17 as best we can estimate the further easing in money market conditions specified in paragraph ( 16 ) might be associated with a march growth rate of 12 - 15 per cent , annual rate , in total time deposits , and possibly with an even further rebound in the spring quarter .
a PAR 17 the money supply might show only a little more strength , with most of that later in the spring as lower interest rates make it marginally more attractive to rebuild cash balances .
a PAR 17 mainly because of the rise in time deposits , the adjusted bank credit proxy would also be stronger than under alternative a , rising in an 8 - 11 per cent annual rate range in march and april together .
a PAR 17 it is assumed that the additional time deposits obtained by banks would substitute in part for funds now obtained through nondeposit sources .

b PAR 15 if it is the committee 's desire to encourage somewhat more growth in the monetary aggregates , and to move further toward less firm money market conditions
b PAR 15 , it may wish to consider the following second paragraph for the directive ( alternative b ) : to implement this policy , while taking account of [ del : the current treasury refunding possible bank regulatory changes and ] the committee 's desire to see moderate growth in money and bank credit over the months ahead , system open market operations until the next meeting of the committee shall be conducted with a view to continuing to move moving gradually toward somewhat less firm condi- tions in the money market ; provided , however , that opera- tions shall be modified promptly to resist any tendency for money and bank credit to deviate significantly from the anticipated [ del : a moderate ] growth pattern .
