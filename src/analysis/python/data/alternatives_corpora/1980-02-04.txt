a PAR 11 all of the alternative monetary growth rates for 1980 would involve a slowing from rates of growth in 1979 .
a PAR 11 in the case of m-1a measured growth in 1979 was 5 percent , but after adding back the estimated amount of outstanding demand deposits transferred into ats and new york state now accounts , growth of m-1a in an economic sense was probably around 6¾ percent last year .
a PAR 11 thus , as compared with the latter figure , even the mid - point of the proposed m-1a range for alternative a ( the easiest alternative proposed ) would involve a substantial decline in growth over the year ahead , though the upper end of that range would be above last year 's growth .

a PAR 19 2/ such refunds expanded by about $ 2 billion per year during the previous four years , but are expected to rise by as much as $ 12 billion more in 1980 as compared with the previous year .
a PAR 19 respectively under such a policy .
a PAR 19 this somewhat greater reserve supply would tend to be associated with some downward pressure on money market rates , with the federal funds rate possibly declining to the 13 percent area over the next few weeks .
a PAR 19 with an unchanged discount rate , the lower funds rate might be consistent with member bank borrowing of around $ 1 billion .
a PAR 19 on that assumption nonborrowed reserves would expand at about a 2 percent annual rate over the last two months of the current quarter .

b PAR 7 proposed targets for the year 1980 (
b PAR 7 8) at the committee 's preliminary discussion in january of targets for the monetary aggregates for the year 1980 ( qiv ' 79 to qiv ' 80 ) , preferences generally appeared to be encompassed by a narrow range of 4½ to 5½ percent growth for m-1a . against that background , the three alternative 1980 targets shown below for committee decision at the february meeting are indexed by m-1a growth rates in ranges centering on 5½ percent ( alt .
b PAR 7 i ) , 5 percent ( alt .
b PAR 7 ii ) , and 4½ percent ( alt .
b PAR 7 iii).1/ alt .
b PAR 7 iii growth in 1979 m-1a 4 to 7 3½ to 6½ 3 to 6 5.5 ( 6.8)2/ ( 9 ) the table on p. 7 shows ( in the first line of each panel ) key economic variables from the gnp projection in the green book , along with expected changes in income velocity of m-1a and in the federal funds rate , for 1980 and 1981 .
b PAR 7 this projection assumes growth in m-1a at the 5 percent mid - point of the alternative b range .
b PAR 7 as may be seen , a modest decline in the federal funds rate is expected in the course of 1980 , while the velocity of m-1a is projected to increase by about 2 percent .
b PAR 7 such an increase , while below the long - run trend , is still more rapid than has generally occurred in past periods of declining interest rates and weakening economic activity .
b PAR 7 thus , the basic projection assumes 1/ for comparative purposes , and in final farewell to the old money measures , the mid - point growth rates for alt .

b PAR 7 the tax cut pro- jection assumes a $ 10 billion cut in personal taxes in mid-1980 ; $ 10 billion cut in corporate taxes in mid-1980 ; and a $ 13 billion cut in social security taxes at the beginning of 1981 , through rollbacks of scheduled rate and base increases .
b PAR 7 a greater than usual desire on the part of the public to economize on cash-- an assumption that seems reasonable in the current environment of strong inflationary expectations , high nominal interest rates , and growing public awareness of alternatives to cash .
b PAR 13 m-2 targets for 1980 assume the continued rapid expansion of money market mutual funds and money market certificates and also that the new 2 -year floating ceiling certificate captures some funds that would otherwise have been lodged in instruments not included in the aggregate .
b PAR 13 m-3 is projected to grow only slightly more rapidly than m-2 in 1980 , mainly because moderating credit demands are expected to hold down issuance of large time deposits at banks and thrift institutions .
b PAR 13 shorter - run targets ( 14 ) shown below are three alternative targets for the monetary aggregates over the december to march period , with suggested continuations through the second quarter .
b PAR 13 also shown are proposed intermeeting federal funds rate ranges and implied growth rates for the aggregates in the two- month january to march period that are consistent with the basic three - month 1/ any shifts from demand to ats or other checkable deposits would , of course , be captured in m-1b .
b PAR 13 december to march objective .

b PAR 13 c intermeeting federal funds rate range 11 to 15½ 11½ to 15½ 11½ to 16 memo : ( 15 ) if the committee chose to continue the policy adopted at the previous meeting with respect to m-1 , it would imply growth in m-1a from january ( as a base ) to the end of the quarter of about 4¼ percent at an annual rate -- given the 4¾ percent annual rate of growth of m-1a in january ( which incorporates revised seasonal factors ) .
b PAR 13 the staff expects that a consistent growth in m-1b and m-2 would be 5¼ and 6½ percent , respectively , over the first quarter as a whole , and 4¾ and 5¾ percent for the remaining two months of the quarter .
b PAR 13 this assumes : ( a ) that interest - bearing checkable deposits expand at about the pace of the previous three months ; ( b ) that a substantial outflow of savings deposits alternative levels and growth rates for key monetary aggregates m-1a m-1b alt .

b PAR 13 qiv continues at banks and thrift institutions ; ( c ) that growth in small time deposits speeds up from the pace of recent weeks ; and ( d ) that growth in money market funds slows from the very rapid rate of january , reverting to the pace of late last year .
b PAR 13 the monetary base might be expected to grow at an annual rate of 5¾ from january to march , but total reserves may show little change ( assuming some decline in excess reserves and relatively little expansion in member bank deposits ) .

b PAR 17 18 ) unusually large personal income tax refunds projected to begin late this winter may pose a special problem for setting monetary targets over the next few months .
b PAR 17 in the past , these refunds have often added temporarily to growth in monetary aggregates , and to the volatility of transactions balances .
b PAR 17 impacts are quite uncertain , however , depending on how quickly returns are filed and processed and also on the nature of the public 's response to receipt of the funds .
b PAR 17 if the flow of refunds turns out as projected , it is possible that growth of m-1a in the months from february to april could be 1 to 3 percentage points higher , with offsetting effects in the ensuing three months .
b PAR 17 but given the uncertainty of impacts on the aggregates , no special adjustment was made to the money supply objectives presented in this blue book .
b PAR 17 however , in framing its policy and in guiding the manager , the committee may wish to recognize that m-1a and other aggregates might tend to expand more than targeted over the next few months because of a transitory factor whose impact can not be readily quantified in advance .
b SENT -- consequently , in order to achieve longer - run targets , policy would have to be more expansive in the second half of the year , leading to more substantial downward pressures on short rates at that time than under alternative b . 

c SENT -- as shown in the charts , alternative c implies that the money stock will be below mid - point paths in march and further below them in june .
