a SENT -- at one limit , ( alternative a ) , we have shown an expansion in monetary aggregates that involves essentially no change between now and the first quarter of 1973 in money market conditions from those recently prevailing .
a PAR 11 paths for the monetary aggregates consistent with the initial rpd and money market conditions shown in paragraph ( 8  are indexed below by rates of change ( saar   for m1 .
a PAR 11 detailed figures for all the usual monetary aggregates , including various measures of reserves , are shown in the tables on pages 8 and 9 .
a PAR 11 1/ the disappearance of cash items on banks ' books ( and also of float on fed books ) as a result of new regulation
a PAR 11 j will also result in an upward level adjustment in measured money supply .
a PAR 11 this adjustment will be made at the time of our annual revision .
a PAR 11 the adjustment will not affect growth rates .

a PAR 11 a , the committee would be aiming at a constellation of reserve and money market conditions -- essentially involving no change through the first quarter of ' 73 in money market conditions from those prevailing on average in the past few weeks -- that would reduce m1 growth only modestly from the rapid 10 - 1/2 per cent rate expected in the third quarter .
a PAR 11 some slowing in m1 demand in the fourth and first quarters would be in prospect from the lagged effects of the recent rise in short- term rates .
a PAR 11 but by the end of the first quarter , operations under alternative a would probably have set in train forces leading to quite rapid m1 growth as 1973 progresses , assuming the rate of expansion in nominal gnp remains strong .
a SENT -- ( 18 )  presented below are four alternative formulations for the operational paragraph of the directive , which might be taken to correspond to the similarly lettered policy alternatives discussed in the preceding section : alternative a " to implement this policy , while taking account of developments in [ del : capital ] credit markets , [ del : and ] international developments , and the effects of bank regulatory changes , the committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions that will support [ del : moderate ] some moderation of growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead .

b PAR 5 expansion of m1 and m2 in august exceeded growth rates thought to be consistent with policy alternative b in the last blue book by 1/2 to 1 - 1/2 percentage points ( after adjusting for a decrease in the july base   .
b PAR 5 in the case of m 1 the annual growth rate for august was 6 per cent , as shown in attached table 2 . however , data for early september suggest that growth of m1 will be rapid from august to september , and is thus likely to be stronger in the third quarter than thought at the last fomc meeting .
b PAR 8 for each of the four alternatives noted above , the following table shows rpd growth rates and associated money market conditions that might be used as operating targets between now and the next meeting of the committee .
b PAR 8 ( the tables in paragraph ( 11 ) and on pp.8 - 9 give longer - run paths for monetary aggregates . )
b PAR 8 a single maximum likelihood estimate is shown for the federal funds rate .

b PAR 9 the changes in regulations d and j , effective september 21 , affect the multiplier relationship between reserves and deposits , and in the transition period immediately ahead makes that relationship more uncertain than usual .
b PAR 9 for one thing , the ability of banks to waive penalties on reserve deficiencies ( up to $ 433 million initially ) will affect excess reserves to an unknown degree .
b PAR 9 to the extent that these potential waivers are not used ( either to run deficiencies or to reduce normal excess reserves ) , excess reserves will rise .
b PAR 9 1/ we have assumed that 50 per cent is used in the first week and that use increases to 80 per cent by the end of four weeks .
b PAR 9 for another thing , the effect on required reserves resulting from regulations d
b PAR 9 and j is particularly complicated .
b PAR 9 though regulations d and j together will lower required reserves for a given level of gross deposits , banks as a 1/ in our figures excess reserves , rpd , total reserves , and nonborrowed reserves have been adjusted to include the $ 433 million of potential waivers , since these are in effect reserves that can be utilized by the banking system .
b PAR 9 whole will have greater required reserves from the effect of regulation j alone , because faster reserve crediting will reduce cash items and hence increase required reserves .
b PAR 9 1 / but we can not be very certain at this point as to the distribution by individual banks of the regulation j effect on reserves and , therefore , of the effect on the reserve - deposit multiplier-- particularly given a totally new reserve requirement structure to evaluate .

b SENT -- " alternative b " to implement this policy , while taking account of developments in [ del : capital ] credit markets , [ del : and ] international developments , and the effects of bank regulatory changes , the committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions that will support somewhat more moderate gr wth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead .

d PAR 14 the funds rate , for example , would probably rise to around 6 per cent within a month and then level off .
d PAR 14 such a rise in interest rates would permit a reduction in the growth of m1 to about a 6 per cent annual rate by the first quarter of next year .
d SENT -- upward market rate adjustments would , of course , be quite sharp under alternative d . prooosed directives 
d SENT -- " alternative d " to implement this policy , while taking account of developments in [ del : capital ] credit markets , [ del : and ] international developments , and the effects of bank regulatory changes , the committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions that will support moderate growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead .
d PAR 19 in all four alternatives it is proposed to indicate that account is to be taken of " credit " rather than " capital " market developments in order more explicitly to encompass short- as well as long - term interest rates in the instruction .
d PAR 19 this is proposed on the assumption that the committee would want the manager to modify his operations in the event some unusual combination of factors subjects bill and other interest rates to undesired upward pressure .
d PAR 19 in alternative d ( and also to lesser extents in c and b ) the same language could be interpreted as calling for adapting desk operations as necessary to facilitate orderly market adjustments to the higher interest rate levels foreseen .
