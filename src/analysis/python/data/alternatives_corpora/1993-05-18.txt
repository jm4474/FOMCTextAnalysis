a PAR 10 the 1/2 percentage point reduction in the federal funds rate under alternative a would surprise market participants and should show through almost completely to other short - term interest rates .
a PAR 10 the three - month bill rate would fall to around 2 - 1/2 percent , and the prime rate probably would be reduced to 5 - 1/2 percent .
a PAR 10 with the economy likely to exhibit a bit more strength than otherwise over the inter- mediate run as a result of the easing , banks may feel a little more confident about the ability of borrowers to repay loans .
a PAR 10 as a result , banks might further ease other terms and standards on lending .
a PAR 10 risk premiums in short- and long - term market interest rates , already histori- cally narrow , would probably remain around their current levels .
a PAR 10 any initial decline in longer - term yields could be limited by concerns that the easier monetary policy stance indicated more emphasis on supporting the economic expansion and less emphasis on containing inflation , par- ticularly against the backdrop of the recent disappointing wage and price behavior and uncertainty regarding the outcome of the fiscal policy debate .
a PAR 10 absent corresponding actions abroad to ease monetary policy , downward pressure on the foreign exchange value of the dollar would resume .
a PAR 16 the lower interest rates of alternative a would be ex- pected to provide some added lift to growth of the monetary aggregates .
a PAR 16 banks and thrifts , while continuing to price their deposits unaggres- sively , likely would not immediately match the downward movement in market rates .
a PAR 16 yields on money market mutual funds , likewise , would lag the decline in market rates .
a PAR 16 the lower opportunity costs of deposits and money funds relative to short - term market rates should provide a small boost to the aggregates , even though attractive yields would continue to induce heavy inflows into bond and stock mutual funds .
a PAR 16 m2 growth over may and june would come in at about a 6 percent rate , with much of the additional strength resulting from its m1 component .
a PAR 16 m3 would expand at a 4 - 1/4 percent rate .
a PAR 16 despite the more rapid growth , both of the broad monetary aggregates would remain well below their annual ranges in june .
a PAR 16 m2 growth is projected to post a 2 - 3/4 percent pace from june to september , bringing the rate of expansion for the april to september period to 4 percent .
a PAR 16 even with the lower interest rates and consequent economic stimulus of this alternative later in the year , m2 would be unlikely to reach the lower end of its annual range by the fourth quarter .

b PAR 9 in light of recent price reports , market participants now generally seem to expect that the next change in the stance of monetary policy is somewhat more likely to be toward tightening than toward ease , but few appear to anticipate any move immediately after the may fomc meeting .
b PAR 9 thus , market interest rates are unlikely to react to the implementation of alternative b . the odds are that bond yields will retrace at least some of their recent back - up if -- as anticipated in the greenbook forecast -- the news on inflationary pressures proves more favorable .
b PAR 9 the ongoing budget debates and the prospective announcement of the administration 's health reform plan suggest that the volatility associated with an uncertain fiscal outlook may persist .
b PAR 9 shorter - term rates could rise some with the approach of larger auction volumes of bills and shorter - term notes .
b PAR 9 the value of the dollar on foreign 5 .
b PAR 9 further increases in the allowance for borrowing likely will be needed over the intermeeting period to account for expected growth in the demand for seasonal credit during the late spring .
b PAR 9 exchange markets probably would remain around current levels under alternative b . 
b PAR 13 under alternative b , m2 is projected to increase at about a 5 - 3/4 percent average rate over may and june , a considerable pickup from recent months.6
b PAR 13 some of the strength in may , and to a lesser extent in june , reflects reversals of previous temporary depressants involving tax effects , the late - winter lull in mortgage refinancing activity , and seasonal - adjustment distortions.7 apart from effects of these temporary factors , underlying m2 probably will exhibit a speed- up over the two months , owing to an abatement of the more fundamental influences that had boosted its velocity to a 5 - 3/4 percent growth rate over the previous two quarters .
b PAR 13 quarterly average growth of m2 for the second quarter is projected at about a 1 - 1/2 percent rate , with temporary factors having little net impact .
b PAR 13 thus , with nominal gdp expected to rise at about a 4 - 1/4 percent rate , m2 velocity would increase at only about a 2 - 1/2 percent pace .
b PAR 13 if the money market condi- tions of this alternative were maintained over the summer , m2 growth would be expected to move up still nearer to that of nominal gdp in the third quarter .
b PAR 14 m3 under alternative b is seen as accelerating to about a 4 percent rate over may and june .
b PAR 14 this speedup would stem solely from the pickup in m2 , as managed liabilities in m3 , including large time deposits , should resume running off over the two months .
b PAR 14 bank credit expansion is expected to remain moderate , with loan growth quite weak , 6 . m1 is projected to rise at an 18 percent annual rate from april to june .
b PAR 14 the expansion in m1 deposits should show through in rapid growth in required reserves , and total reserves would be expected to expand at a 19 - 1/4 percent annual rate from april to june .
b PAR 14 with currency growth anticipated at 11 percent over the two months , the monetary base would rise at an 11 - 1/4 percent pace .
b PAR 14 this year 's seasonal adjustment factors for february and march appear to be elevated artificially by the influence of system easing actions around year - end 1990 and 1991 rather than evolving seasonal patterns .
b PAR 14 and the balance sheets of thrift institutions are anticipated to con- tinue to contract .
b PAR 14 while inflows of core deposits are projected to meet most of the added funding needs of banks and s&ls , banks are likely to obtain some funding from abroad and from other nondeposit sources , in part to avoid higher deposit insurance premiums .
b PAR 14 looking further ahead , moderate average growth of m3 during the third quarter would be expected to accompany retention of the specifications of alternative b over that period .
b PAR 15 households and businesses are expected to stay cautious in using credit in coming months .
b PAR 15 in the household sector , mortgage refinancing activity is likely to remain brisk .
b PAR 15 overall mortgage debt , however , is expected to expand at about its first - quarter pace , as cash- out refinancing activity continues to be limited and home purchases rise only gradually .
b PAR 15 growth of consumer credit is projected to remain moderate , despite heavy promotion of credit cards with rebates and other incentives .
b PAR 15 given still - favorable conditions in longer - term markets under alternative b , issuance of corporate bonds and stocks should remain relatively heavy .
b PAR 15 with the shortfall of internal funds relative to capital expenditures remaining small , businesses are likely to con- tinue to use the proceeds of securities issuance to pay down higher - cost bonds and bank loans .
b PAR 15 treasury borrowing should pick up in coming months to finance a widening deficit , with more issuance in the shorter end of the market , reflecting the recent shift in debt management policy .
b PAR 15 domestic nonfinancial debt would be expected to move further above the lower edge of its 4 - 1/2 to 8 - 1/2 percent monitoring range through june .

c SENT -- federal funds would trade in the neighborhood of 3 - 1/2 percent under alternative c , in association with an initial borrowing allowance of $ 125 million .
c PAR 11 market participants also would be surprised by the policy tightening under alternative c at this fomc meeting .
c PAR 11 bond yields may well increase , but with the rise probably tempered by the sense that the federal reserve was moving promptly to head off a resurgence of infla- tion .
c PAR 11 bill rates likely would jump by nearly the increase of 50 basis points in the federal funds rate , and private money market rates could rise a bit more , reflecting widening risk premiums .
c PAR 11 banks would likely boost the prime rate by 1/2 percentage point .
c PAR 11 bank stock prices , which have benefited from wide spreads between short - term deposit rates and rates on longer - term assets , likely would extend their recent declines .
c PAR 11 overall stock price indexes probably would drop as well , and the result- ing capital losses on bonds and stocks could restrain inflows to long- term mutual funds , at least temporarily .
c PAR 11 the dollar would strengthen on foreign exchange markets .
c PAR 11 c growth from april to june m2 6

c PAR 11 3 - 1/2 3 m3 2 - 1/2 2 - 1/4
c PAR 11 2 m1 12 - 3/4 12
c PAR 17 under alternative c , the higher money market interest rates and opportunity costs would restrain the monetary aggregates .
c PAR 17 the restraint on the aggregates could be limited to the degree that capital losses on bond and stock funds prompt investors to shift back into deposits , but on balance the tighter monetary stance should act to slow monetary growth .
c PAR 17 m2 would expand at only a 5 - 1/2 percent rate over may and june , and m3 at a 3 - 3/4 percent pace .
c PAR 17 the moderate upward trajec- tory of m2 expected under unchanged interest rates later in the year would be trimmed , with growth from june to september likely at only a 1 - 1/2 percent rate ; and m2 would finish the year well below its target range .
c PAR 17 maintenance of the money market conditions of alternative c probably would induce m3 to contract on the year .
c PAR 17 directive language ( 19 ) presented below is draft wording for the operational paragraph that includes the usual options and updating .
c PAR 17 operational paragraph in the implementation of policy for the immediate future , the committee seeks to decrease somewhat / maintain / increase somewhat the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions .
c PAR 17 in the context of the committee 's long - run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth , and giving careful consideration to economic , financial , and monetary developments , slightly ( somewhat ) greater reserve restraint ( would / might ) or slightly ( somewhat ) lesser reserve restraint would ( might ) be acceptable in the intermeeting period .
c PAR 17 the contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with appreciable [ del : a resumption of moderate ] growth in the broader monetary aggregates over the second quarter .
