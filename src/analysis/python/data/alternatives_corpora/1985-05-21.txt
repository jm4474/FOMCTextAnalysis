a PAR 14 growth of m1 from march to june would be expected to be around 7 percent , bringing this aggregate to a level about 1/2 percent above the upper parallel band .
a PAR 14 the further drop of interest rates expected under this alternative could lead to substantial inflows into deposits and money funds , and growth in m2 and m3 over may and june would probably pick up into a 7 to 8 percent range .
a PAR 14 interest rates and exchange rates would decline further , with the three - month bill rate probably falling to near 7 percent .
a PAR 14 directive language 

b PAR 7 the specifications of alternative b involve slightly faster m1 growth over the three - month march - to - june period than adopted at the last cmmittee meeting , but much slower growth in the broader 1/ average growth in may and june , given actual growth in april , needed to hit march fomc paths .

b PAR 7 this behavior of the aggregates is expected to be consistent with seasonal plus adjustment borrowing at the discount window of $ 300 to $ 350 million , assuming that borrowing by privately - insured thrift institutions experiencing persistent liquidity difficulties is in effect extended credit .
b PAR 7 total reserves might increase at a 6 percent annual rate over may and june under alternative b , with nonborrowed reserves ( including extended credit ) increasing at 8 percent rate .
b PAR 9 the decline in interest rates over the past several weeks will be tending to boost money demand in may and june , and m1 under this alternative is expected to increase at a 6 - 1/2 percent rate over the march - to - june period , despite some weakening in projected nominal gnp growth for the second quarter .
b PAR 9 on a quarterly - average basis , m1 would increase at a 7 - 1/4 percent rate in the second quarter , which implies a second consecutive quarterly decline in velocity , although at a somewhat slower rate than in the first quarter ; such a decline is roughly consistent with model results .
b PAR 9 by june , m1 under alternative b would be about $ 1 - 3/4 billion ( or 0.3 percent ) above the upper parallel line of the band drawn from the fourth quarter end points of the 4 to 7 percent range for 1985 , with growth from qiv ' 84 to june at around an 8 - 1/2 percent annual rate .
b PAR 10 growth of m2 and m3 under alternative b would be expected to pick up in may and june to a 6 - 1/2 to 7 - 1/2 percent annual rate on average .
b PAR 10 much of the pick - up would be expected in rps and the other managed liability components of the broader aggregates , partly as treasury m2 are likely to expand more rapidly than the 6 percent pace of april , and net inflows to mmmfs are likely to pick up , given the usual lagged adjustments in changes in returns on these instruments relative to declines in market rates .
b PAR 15 draft language for the operational paragraph , with alternatives , is shown below with suggested deletions from the current directive indicated in strike - through form and proposed additions in caps .
b PAR 15 as in the past , it is assumed that the " degree of pressure on reserve positions " is indexed primarily by the level of borrowing at the discount window , excluding borrowing classified as extended credit .
b PAR 15 in the proposed directive it is also assumed that the " degree of pressure on reserve positions " excludes any special situation borrowing at thrifts that has not yet been classified as extended credit .
b PAR 15 on that basis , alternative b is suggested as consistent with maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions , although the associated funds rate is likely to be lower than during the past several weeks owing to the cut in the discount rate .
b PAR 15 bracketed alternative language with respect to the aggregates is suggested for consideration in view of the substantial shortfall in growth of the broader aggregates from expectations at the time of the march meeting .

b PAR 15 m2 and m3 , after showing little change in april , are expected to grow at annual rates of   and   percent , respectively , over may and june on average . ]
b PAR 15 somewhat lesser reserve restraint might ( would ) be acceptable in the event of substantially slower growth of the mone- tary aggregates while somewhat greater restraint might ( would ) be acceptable in the event of substantially higher growth .
b PAR 15 in either case such a change would be considered in the context of appraisals of the strength of the business expansion , progress against inflation , and conditions in domestic credit and foreign exchange markets .
b PAR 15 the chairman may call for committee consulta- tion if it appears to the manager for domestic operations that pursuit of the monetary objectives and related reserve paths during the period before the next meeting is likely to be asso- ciated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of [ del : 6-to-10 ]   to   percent .
