a PAR 14 a slight easing of the money market , as is contemplated by the mid - point of the 5 - 6 per cent federal funds rate range shown for alternative a , might be accompanied by some further declines in market interest rates .
a PAR 14 these declines probably would not be particularly large since many market participants may still expect rates to turn around later .
a PAR 14 such an expectation would be reinforced to the extent that incoming business news continues to be good .
a PAR 14 a larger decline in the funds rate to around the 5 per cent bottom of the alternative a range would of course trigger more substantial interest rate declines as the market 's assessment of future monetary policy and possibly also the business outlook changes .
a PAR 15 the staff expects that interest rate declines under alternative a would facilitate attainment of higher longer - run growth rates for the monetary aggregates -- typified by m1 growth over the next year in a 6 - 8 per cent range .
a PAR 15 the effect on money demands of these initial declines in interest rates are likely to be quite substantial , however , especially when considered in conjunction with expansion over the longer - run of transactions demands .
a PAR 15 thus , the federal funds rate under this alternative probably would have to begin rising again late in the year to keep money growth around the mid - point of the higher range .

b PAR 7 growth rates for m2 and m3 are lower , however , because slower growth in time and savings deposits is now anticipated , given recent experience and the expectation that market interest rates will again be under upward pressure late this year and early next year .
b PAR 7 1/ since m 1 grew at a 6.9 per cent annual rate from the second to third quarters of 1975 , the new proposed long - run rates of growth are calculated from a base level that incorporates a rate of expansion slightly above the mid - point of the committee 's current longer - run range .
b PAR 7 while achievement of a 6¼ per cent growth rate over the next four quarters would not include any adjustment for the higher rate of expansion in the third quarter , the problem in this instance would not appear to be of any real quantitative significance .
b PAR 7 for example , under alternative b the implied growth rate from qii ' 75 to qii ' 76 for m ( the committee 's previous target period )
b PAR 7 would be no more than about 6.4 per cent -- well within the committee 's range .
b PAR 11 the staff still believes that growth in m 1 will soon resume .
b PAR 11 we are now projecting growth over the latter part of october and continuing through winter , in view of the strong further expansion in nominal gnp , and hence in transactions needs for money , forecast by the staff .
b PAR 11 since the early october level of m1 is so low , however , this growth would not be reflected in the monthly averages until november .
b PAR 11 given current money market conditions , as under alternative b , the staff expects m1 to expand at more than a 10 per cent annual rate in november .

b PAR 16 this would return the rate to where it was at about the time of the previous committee meeting .
b PAR 16 such an immediate rise in the funds rate appears most consistent with adoption by the committee of lower longer - run rates of growth in the monetary aggregates , indexed by m1 expansion over the year ahead in a 4 - 6½ per cent range .
b PAR 16 also such a rise in the funds rate would not be inconsistent with the longer - run growth rates of alternative b .
b PAR 16 an immediate increase in the funds rate would retard money growth over the near term , but would imply somewhat less of a rise in the federal funds rate over the next year than shown for alternative b in appendix table iv .
