a PAR 15 nonborrowed reserves would be expected to expand at about a 6 per cent annual rate from july to september .
a PAR 15 market interest rates would probably decline substantially in response to the unexpected easing of money markets , with the 3-month treasury bill rate falling to the 8 - 1/2 per cent area .
a PAR 15 a considerable rally probably would develop in bond markets .
a PAR 15 with bond rates falling , business issuance of long - term obligations would burgeon once again , while borrowing from banks and in the commercial paper market receded .
a PAR 15 in foreign exchange markets , the dollar would tend to weaken , probably falling below levels prevailing around the time of the july fomc meeting .

b PAR 9 b most nearly correspond to the specifications for the third quarter adopted at the last committee meeting ; they differ only by a slightly higher growth for m1 balanced by a slightly lower growth for m2 , a change in relation- ship suggested by incoming data .

b PAR 9 base period is february - march i983 ravarmni for mi .
b PAR 9 c market conditions respectively .
b PAR 9 because the bulk of the third quarter is now behind , specified money growth rates over the june - to - september period do not differ greatly from alternative b , but the emerging differ- ence in money market conditions would more significantly affect develop- ments in the fourth quarter .
b PAR 11 under alternative b , the federal funds rate would be expected to trade around 9 - 1/2 per cent ( the 6 to 10 per cent funds rate range shown for that alternative retains the specification of the current directive   .
b PAR 11 recent strength in demands at the discount window suggest that borrowing would range between $ 700 and $ 900 million .
b PAR 11 total and nonborrowed reserves would be expected to show little change , on balance , over august and september - with a small decline in august offset by a rise in september .
b SENT -- growth in m2 and m3 would tend to be somewhat higher for the year as money market conditions remain easier than under alternative b , but they are likely to remain within their longer - run ranges .

c PAR 17 the federal funds rate under alternative c might trade in the 10 to 10 - 1/2 per cent range through the end of the quarter .
c PAR 17 discount window borrowing would tend toward the area of $ l-1/4 billion at the current 8 - 1/2 per cent discount rate , raising questions about the level of that rate . assuming no discount rate change , nonborrowed reserves might decline at about a 6 per cent annual rate from july to september .
c PAR 18 the size and speed of the tightening in money market conditions contemplated under alternative c is probably not currently anticipated in the market .
c PAR 18 as a result , interest rates in both short- and long - term markets would be likely to rise appreciably .
c PAR 18 bond issuance by corporations and state and local governments is already quite low com- pared to earlier in the year , but it could drop off even more .
c PAR 18 in the mortgage market rates on conventional fixed rate mortgages would climb above 14 per cent , with pressure on these rates accentuated by effects of rising mmda costs on the willingness of thrifts to extend mortgage loans .
c PAR 18 the dollar would come under considerable upward pressure on foreign ex- change markets , especially if foreign central banks continued to demonstrate a reluctance to raise their domestic interest rates .
c PAR 19 under alternative c , m2 and m3 growth over the june - to- september period might be somewhat below objectives specified at the last committee meeting , though m1 growth may be close to its 7 per cent third - quarter objective .
c PAR 19 however , should the higher interest rates cause sizable shifts of saving funds out of now accounts into instruments bear- ing market - related interest rates , m1 growth could slow substantially in september and also into the fourth quarter .
c PAR 19 growth in m2 and m3 would also tend to slow , though perhaps not as markedly as m1 , in the fourth quarter .
c PAR 19 the probable dampening effect of these higher interest rates on growth in money and income as the year progresses suggests the likelihood that attaining longer - run money and credit targets for 1984 would involve a substantial easing of interest rates later this year or early next year from the alternative c levels .
c PAR 19 directive language given below is a suggested operational paragraph for the directive , with the numerical specifications adopted at the meeting on july 12 - 13 shown in strike - through form .
c PAR 19 operational paragraph the committee seeks in the short run to ( increase slightly further maintain / decreased slightly ) the existing degree of reserve restraint .
c PAR 19 the action is expected to be associated with growth of m2 and m3 at annual rates of about [ del : 8 - 1/2 ]   and 8   per cent respectively from june to september , consistent with the targets established for these aggregates for the year .
c PAR 19 depending on evidence about the strength of economic recovery and other factors bearing on the business and inflation outlook , lesser restraint would be acceptable in the context of a significant shortfall in growth of the aggregates from current expectations , while somewhat greater restraint would be acceptable should the aggregates expand more rapidly .
c PAR 19 the committee anticipates that a deceleration in m1 growth to an annual rate of around [ del : 7 ]   per cent from june to september will be consistent with its third- quarter objectives for the broader aggregates , and that expansion in total domestic nonfinancial debt would remain within the ranges established for the year .
c PAR 19 the chairman may call for comittee consultation if it appears to the manager for domestic operations that pursuit of the monetary objectives and related reserve paths during the period before the next meeting is likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of [ del : 6 to 10 ]   to   per cent .
