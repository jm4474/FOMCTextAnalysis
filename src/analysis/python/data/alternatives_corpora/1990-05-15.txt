a PAR 11 the easing of reserve conditions under alternative a would tend to strengthen money growth over may and june to something more in line with rates incorporated in the committee 's expectations at the last meeting .
a PAR 11 opportunity costs would narrow even more , boosting m2 growth to nearly a 6 percent rate over may and june , leaving this aggregate notice- ably above the midpoint of its annual range .
a PAR 11 m3 growth would firm to a 4 percent annual rate , keeping this aggregate a little above the lower bound of its range .
a PAR 11 the easing of policy under alternative a would come as something of a surprise to most market participants , and money market rates would decline by the full 50 basis point drop in the federal funds rate .
a PAR 11 the dollar would come under downward pressure , and , absent incoming information pointing to a weaker economy or a distinct improvement in underlying cost or price trends , the decline in bond rates would be limited , resulting in a steeper yield curve .
a PAR 11 if , however , evidence sug- gested a softening in economic activity , perhaps reflecting more powerful credit restraint than now seems apparent , the drop in short - term rates would feed through to bond yields .
a PAR 11 the decline in market rates would tend to buoy borrowing and spending by those with market access , helping to offset the effects of tighter credit availability on spenders dependent on depository intermediaries .

b SENT -- under alternative b , federal funds would be expected to continue to trade around 8 - 1/4 percent , with an initial level of adjust- ment plus seasonal borrowing of $ 350 million .
b PAR 7 interest rates generally would be expected to show little net change under alternative b . market expectations now embody federal funds continuing to trade around 8 - 1/4 percent , as under this alternative .
b PAR 7 similarly , incoming information on the economy consistent with the green- book forecast would be roughly in line with the continued economic growth and moderation in measured inflation -- though with little improvement in longer - term price trends -- that market participants now seem to be antici- pating .
b PAR 7 rates on treasury bills and notes , however , could be subject to transitory supply pressures if rtc activity accelerates appreciably and with it treasury financing needs .
b PAR 7 a breakthrough in negotiations on the budget between the administration and the congress in coming weeks would be likely to spark a rally in capital markets , which after a time might induce a downward adjustment in the foreign exchange value of the dollar .
b PAR 7 absent such a breakthrough , the dollar likely would remain around recent levels on foreign exchange markets ; with the dollar stable and german reunification impending , a tightening of monetary policy in germany and japan before the next fomc meeting appears unlikely .
b PAR 8 projected growth rates for the monetary aggregates from march to june are given in the table below for all three alternatives .
b PAR 8 ( the table and charts on the following pages show more detailed data . )
b PAR 8 under alternative b , growth in both m2 and m3 would pick up over may and june from the sluggish pace of april .
b PAR 8 this pickup results in part from a cessation of the runoff of demand deposits and rps .
b PAR 8 in addition , the response of depositors to previous increases in opportunity costs would begin to wane .
b PAR 8 moreover , opportunity costs have already narrowed from april and , with market interest rates stable , this narrowing could con- tinue , buoying retail deposit inflows , as banks raise small time deposit rates , albeit slowly , in adjustment to increases in market rates on bal- ance this year .
b PAR 8 to an extent , the strengthening of m2 and m3 under this alternative rests on a rebound in bank credit growth and associated fund-
b PAR 8 ing needs in may and june -- given the evidence that reductions in willing- ness to lend are limited .
b PAR 8 again , the behavior of the rtc constitutes a major uncertainty in the outlook for money growth .
b PAR 8 to date in the second quarter , rtc spending still has been fairly modest .
b PAR 8 we have assumed pro- gressively more resolution activity over may and june , but well below rtc 's announced goal of 141 resolutions involving $ 50 billion of assets for this quarter .
b PAR 8 a surge in rtc activity could damp m3 growth as thrift assets end up on the government 's balance sheet .
b PAR 8 and it could affect m2 as well , if large volumes of retail deposits are transferred to commercial banks without accompanying loans and investments , reducing bank needs to raise deposit offering rates .
b PAR 8 on balance , m2 growth is projected to strengthen to a 5 percent pace on average in may and june , in line with average growth over the first four months of the year .
b PAR 8 m3 growth would remain quite sluggish as thrifts continued to shrink -- through rtc resolu- tions and through action to meet capital requirements -- but would pick up a little to about a 3 - 1/2 percent pace from growth of around 1 percent in march and april .

c PAR 12 the tighter reserve conditions under alternative c would be expected to keep money growth damped .
c PAR 12 m2 would be at the middle of its range by june and m3 just above the lower end of its range .
c PAR 12 short - term rates would increase by about the 1/2 percentage point rise in the federal funds rate , and the dollar would tend to firm .
c PAR 12 banks would raise the prime rate , and could further tighten other credit terms .
c PAR 12 bond yields also would rise , at least initially , in response to the reversal of the previous trend in federal reserve actions .
c PAR 12 however , in the context of only moderate growth in the economy , the higher short - term interest rates and slower money growth would be seen as a policy response to inflation pressures , implying additional emphasis by the federal reserve on its price stability objective .
c PAR 12 in this context , the credibility of that objective could be enhanced , to the benefit of bond prices .
c PAR 12 directive language ( 14 ) draft language for the operational paragraph , including the usual options , is shown below .
c PAR 12 operational paragraph in the implementation of policy for the immediate future , the committee seeks to decrease somewhat / maintain/ increase somewhat the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions .
c PAR 12 taking account of progress toward price stabil- ity , the strength of the business expansion , the behavior of the monetary aggregates , and developments in foreign ex- change and domestic financial markets , slightly ( somewhat ) greater reserve restraint ( would / might ) or slightly ( some-
c PAR 12 what ) lesser reserve restraint would ( might ) be acceptable in the intermeeting period .
c PAR 12 the contemplated reserve condi- tions are expected to be consistent with growth of m2 and m3 over the period from march through june at annual rates of about   and
c PAR 12 [ del : 6 and 4 ] percent respectively .
c PAR 12 the chairman may call for committee consultation if it appears to the manager for domestic operations that reserve conditions during the period before the next meeting are likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of   to
