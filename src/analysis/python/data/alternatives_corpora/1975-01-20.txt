a PAR 7 these longer - run growth rates assume the staff gnp projection and further assume that the funds rate reaches levels at about the mid - point of the ranges shown over the next several weeks .
a PAR 7 for alternative a , however , it should be noted that the lower interest rates are not assumed to persist throughout the whole first half of the year , as will be explained below .

a PAR 8 under this alternative the funds rate would be expected to decline to 6 per cent , or a shade below , between now and mid - february .
a PAR 8 growth in m1 by february would be expected to be considerably higher than in recent months , partly in lagged reaction to earlier interest rate declines , and partly because the behavior of money appears to have been unusually weak recently relative to nominal gnp .
a PAR 8 given the very low growth that seems in store for january , however , the m1 growth rate would be expected to be in a 4 - 6 per cent range for the two - month january - february period .
a PAR 8 ( 8) ( 2518 ) the committee agreed on a rpo range of 9.0 to 11.0 percent for the december - january period .

a PAR 14 similar assumptions to those for consumer - type time deposits at banks were made for deposit flows at thrift institutions .
a PAR 14 given the apparently weak mortgage demand , downward pressures on mortgage interest rates might be expected in the months ahead under all three alternatives , with declines in mortgage rates the largest , of course , under alternative a . under the easing alternatives , conditions leading to a reversal of such rate declines would tend to develop as time passes , though perhaps not until after mid - year .


c PAR 11 m1 growth in the january - february period under this alternative would be expected to be in a 3 - 5 per cent annual rate range .
c PAR 11 a pick - up in m1 growth would still be anticipated in february , but the rate of expansion would be less than under the two other alternatives .
c PAR 11 similarly , over the longer - run , growth rates for money supply would be slower ; for example , over the first half of 1975 m1 growth might be at around a 5¼ per cent annual rate .
