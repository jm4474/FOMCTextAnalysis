a PAR 16 an easing of the federal funds rate to around 6¼ per cent , as contemplated under alternative a , would be very surprising to the market in light of the weakness of the dollar in foreign exchange markets and recent indications of acceleration in the rise of wholesale and retail prices .
a PAR 16 in addition , if staff pro- jections are correct , such an easing action would be taking place in conjunction with publication of accelerated growth in m-1 .
a PAR 16 short- term market rates would decline , with the 3-month treasury bill rate possibly falling below 6 per cent .
a PAR 16 the value of the dollar would probably decline in international exchange markets .
a PAR 16 long - term interest rates would probably decline little , since market participants would likely view such an action as temporary .
a PAR 16 indeed , as noted earlier , interest rates would soon need to begin rising in order to restrain growth in the aggregates to the mid - point of their longer - run ranges , and by autumn would have to reach levels higher than under alternatives b and c. directive language 

b SENT -- under alternative b , the federal funds rate would be expected to remain unchanged over the inter- meeting period and then begin rising thereafter , reaching about 8 per cent by fall .
b PAR 9 against this background , m-1 growth is expected to accelerate in the weeks ahead .
b PAR 9 given the federal funds rate assump- tion of alternative b -- with the rate centered at the 6¾ per cent 1/ see appendix i for projected federal funds rate under each alternative .
b PAR 9 ii displays the implied velocities of m-1 and m-2 associated with each alternative .
b PAR 9 level prevailing since early january -- m-1 growth over march - april is likely to be in a 4 to 9 per cent annual rate range .
b PAR 10 growth in m-2 over this period is expected to be in a 6 to 10 per cent annual rate range under alternative b . as has been the case since last fall , savings deposits at commercial banks are projected to remain essentially unchanged .
b PAR 10 temporary inflows from larger than seasonal tax refunds may do little more than offset deposit weakness caused by the large differential between market rates and the ceiling rate on passbook savings accounts .
b PAR 10 with market yields also above the effective ceiling rates on all maturities of small denomination time deposits at commercial banks , such deposits are likely to grow only moderately in the march - april period .
b PAR 10 however , loan demands are expected to remain relatively strong ; thus banks are likely to continue aggressively to offer large denomination time deposits in order to supplement their deposit base .
b PAR 10 a major portion of these deposits is included in m-2 .
b PAR 10 consequently the interest- bearing component of this aggregate is projected to continue to expand at an 8 to 9 per cent seasonally adjusted annual rate .
b PAR 11 the modest pace of inflows to thrift institutions can be expected to persist in march - april under alternative b . growth of deposits at mutual savings banks and savings and loan associations , combined , may be around a 6 to 7 per cent annual rate .
b PAR 11 over subsequent months , the assumed increase in deposit rate ceilings would keep deposit inflows to thrifts from eroding further as market interest rates rise .
b PAR 11 reductions in thrift portfolio liquidity and increased borrowings from the federal home loan banks and from other sources are thus likely to continue in order to finance takedowns of existing commitments .
b PAR 11 moreover , further reductions in new commitment activity and in spot purchases of mortgages from mortgage bankers and others can be expected .
b PAR 11 ( 11 ) ( 12 ) ( 13 ) ( 14 )
b PAR 12 if the federal funds rate remains at the 6¾ per cent level contemplated under alternative b , short- and intermediate- term interest rates over the intermeeting period are likely to remain near their current levels .
b PAR 12 some upward rate pressures might develop as accelerating economic activity bolsters financing demands of businesses at banks and in the commercial paper market .
b PAR 12 in addition , treasury borrowing in short- and intermediate - term markets between now and mid - april will be relatively heavy .
b PAR 12 potential upward rate pressures in the short - term sector will tend to be offset , however , by market anticipation of the substantial pay - down of treasury bills following the mid - april tax date .
b PAR 12 moreover , rates on shorter - term treasury securities could remain low relative to other market rates , should foreign central banks continue to acquire large amounts of such securities as a result of their intervention activities in foreign exchange markets .
b PAR 13 under alternative b , mortgage rates might rise somewhat further in the intermeeting period as thrifts adjust lending policies in response to sustained weak deposit inflows .
b PAR 13 bond yields , however , are expected to be essentially unchanged .
b PAR 13 the forward calendar for corporate issues remains relatively modest and institutional demands large .
b PAR 13 furthermore , the forward calendar for tax - exempt offerings continues below the exceptional 1977 level and interest in such issues by fire and casualty insurance companies , commercial banks , and individuals are projected to remain sizable .

c PAR 14 growth in m-1 in the march - april period would probably be in a 4 to 9 per cent and m-2 in a 5 - 1/2 to 9 - 1/2 per cent annual rate range .
c PAR 14 although the market is expecting some tightening of policy later this spring , an increase in the federal funds rate over the near - term apparently is not being anticipated by market participants , given the recent moderation of growth in the monetary aggregates .
c PAR 14 the 3-month bill might move into a 6 - 5/8 - -6 - 3/4 per cent area , and there would be commensurate adjustment in other short - term rates .
c PAR 14 member bank borrowing from the discount window would rise substantially , producing expectations of an upward adjustment in the discount rate .
c PAR 14 such borrowing has been relatively low recently , and no banks are under administrative pressure at the window .
c PAR 15 the sizable increase in short - term rates likely to develop under alternative c would probably be accompanied by only modest upward pressure on bond yields in the intermeeting period .
c PAR 15 as previously noted , new bond offerings are expected to be modest and institutional investment demand strong .
c PAR 15 by contributing to slower deposit inflows , however , alternative c would add to near - term upward pressure on mortgage rates and increase the need for an adjustment in deposit ceiling rates .
