a SENT -- ( 7 )  the money market specifications for alternative a include a federal funds rate around 3 - 3/4 per cent , the most recent desk operating target .
a SENT -- ( 10 ) with money market conditions as specified for alternative a , the 3-month bill rate is likely to be in a 3 - 1/4 - -3 - 3/4 per cent range between now and the next meeting of the committee .
a SENT -- thus , attain- ment of the conditions specified in alternative a would be likely to re- inforce other trends in capital markets now expected to contribute to some further decline in long - term rates , as noted in the greenbook .
a SENT -- if the committee adopts this alternative , it may wish to consider the money market conditions noted for alternative a in paragraph ( 6 ) as a description of " prevailing " conditions , and for purposes of the proviso clause , to adopt the aggregate growth paths discussed earlier in connection with alternative a as the " expected " paths .

b PAR 14 this language is proposed for possible use if the committee decides ( a ) to formulate its primary instruction in terms of desired growth rates for the aggregates , and ( b ) to adopt as targets the growth rates ( including a 7 per cent second - quarter rise in m1 ) discussed earlier in connection with alternative b , which would be somewhat more moderate than the rates experienced recently , " to implement this policy , the committee seeks to promote somewhat more moderate growth in monetary and credit aggregates over the months ahead , while continuing to meet some part of reserve needs through purchases of coupon issues in the interest of promoting accommodative conditions in long - term credit markets .
b PAR 14 system open market operations until the next meeting of the committee shall be conducted with a view to maintaining [ del : prevailing bank reserves and money market conditions consistent with those objectives , taking account of the forthcoming treasury financing [ del : while accommodating any downward move- ments in long term rates , provided that money market ] [ del : conditions shall be modified if it appears that the monetary and credit aggregates are deviating signifi- cantly from the growth paths expected]. " accommodation of declines in long rates is not listed as a specific committee objective under this ( and the following ) alternative because of the likelihood that such rates would rise if the money market is firmed to the degree that would appear to be necessary to achieve the aggregate growth rates specified .
b PAR 14 however , a reference is suggested to purchases of coupon issues " in the interest of promoting accommodative conditions in long - term credit markets " on the assumption that even if the committee adopts this alternative it will want to index a concern with conditions in capital markets .
b SENT -- del : while accommodating any downward movements in long term rates , provided that money market conditions shall be modified if it appears that the monetary and credit aggregates are deviating significantly from the growth paths expected]. " this language differs from alternative b only in the use of the term " moderate " to describe the lower target growth rates for the aggregates .

c SENT -- a rise in long - term rates would seem likely if the federal funds rate were to trend convincingly above 4 per cent , with the rise in long rates largest if money market conditions were to tighten as much as specified under alternative c . possible directive language
