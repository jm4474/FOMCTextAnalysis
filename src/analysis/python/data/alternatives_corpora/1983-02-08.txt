a PAR 23 somewhat easier market conditions are implied by alternative a , which involves a drop in the funds rate to the 7 to 8 percent area .
a PAR 23 such a decline would probably entail a further ½ percentage point reduction in the discount rate .
a PAR 23 assuming a cut in the discount rate , the money market specifications of alternative a would generally be consistent with borrowing in the $ 150 million to $ 200 million range .
a PAR 23 both short- and long - term market rates would be expected to adjust downward .
a PAR 23 however , whether the decline in long - term rates would be sustainable will depend in part on whether incoming economic news and the budgetary outlook tend to raise market concerns about the sustainability of easier money market conditions .
a PAR 23 the dollar likely would resume its decline on foreign exchange markets .

b PAR 17 the table on the next page shows possible outcomes for alternative monetary strategies .
b PAR 17 strategy 1 is consistent with the long- run targets of alternative b for 1983 and assumes an 8 percent underlying m2 growth in subsequent years .
b PAR 17 the results shown represent the staff 's judgmental gnp forecast found in the greenbook , but extended to 1985 .
b PAR 17 the consequences of other monetary strategies are based essentially on differences derived from simulations of the quarterly econometric model .
b PAR 17 strategy 2 assumes higher m2 growth than strategy 1 in 1983 and 1984 - -by 1 and ½ per- centage point , respectively .
b PAR 17 strategy 3 slows underlying m2 growth to about 7 percent over the three - year period .
b PAR 17 strategies 4 and 5 are designed to help evaluate the implications of a possible decrease in the structural budgetary deficit from currently projected levels .
b PAR 21 under all three alternatives , we expect a slowing in the growth rate of the various monetary aggregates from their unusually rapid january rates .
b PAR 21 m2 growth , however , is expected to remain quite sizable .
b PAR 21 under alternative b , m2 is assumed to grow at an " underlying " annual rate alternative levels and growth rates for key monetary aggregates alt .

b PAR 21 actual growth is higher because of continued , though diminishing , shifts into mmdas.1/ m1 growth , which has been quite substantial for several months now , is projected to decele- rate markedly , partly as the lagged upward effects on growth of this aggregate of earlier interest rate declines wear off.- even so , m1 growth on a quarterly average basis would be around 8¾ percent , implying a slight further drop in velocity in the first quarter of the year .
b PAR 21 m3 growth over the february - march period is expected to expand about in line with its december - january average .
b PAR 22 other market rates are likely to change little between now and the next committee meeting under those circumstances , with the 3-month bill rate generally in an 8 to 8 percent range .
b PAR 22 borrowing at the discount window would remain around $ 200 million , with total reserves probably falling on the order of 10 percent , and nonborrowed reserves by about 7 percent , as required reserves contract mainly reflecting continued run - offs in large cds .
b PAR 22 1/ specifically , the staff is assuming that mmda growth slows to about $ 12 billion per week on average in february and $ 8 billion per week on average in march from the $ 40 billion per week pace in the last half of december and some $ 30 billion per week in january .
b PAR 22 this would carry the level of mmdas from $ 200 billion the week of january 26 to about $ 300 billion at the end of march .
b PAR 22 the staff estimates that shifts of non - m2 assets to mmdas cumulated to $ 42 billion by january 26 ; we are assuming that only a further $ 15 billion of such shifts occur by the end of the quarter .
b PAR 22 under these assumptions , and with an 8 percent " underlying " growth , m2 would expand at about a 12 percent annual rate from the last week in january to the last week in march .
b PAR 22 the more rapid two - month growth shown in the table in paragraph ( 20 ) reflects the difference between working with monthly average figures and month - end data in a period of rapid change .
b PAR 22 2/ we have assumed that the didc will not introduce any further new deposit instrument -- such as super - nows for businesses -- during the short - run tar- get period .
b PAR 22 corporate super - nows , as well as some other deregulation proposals , will be considered by the didc at its meeting on march 1 ; even if the didc were to authorize the former account , implementation would likely be delayed until april .

c PAR 24 interest rates would adjust sharply upward , particularly so over the short run in the treasury note and bond area where the market is in process of digesting a substantial refunding .
c PAR 24 private rates would also rise , and a portion of the recent improvement in quality spreads may be reversed , as concerns about the viability of major borrowers tend to re - emerge .
c PAR 24 borrowing at the dis- count window , given the present discount rate , would probably rise to around $ 500 million , and nonborrowed reserves would contract by about 13 percent at an annual rate .
c PAR 24 the dollar would probably rise on foreign exchange markets over the short run .
