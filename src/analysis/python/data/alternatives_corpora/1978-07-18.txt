b SENT -- under alternative b , v-1 is projected to rise by 4½ per cent over the qii ' 78-qii ' 79 period,1/ as compared with an increase of 3¼ per cent over the preceding four quarters .
b PAR 14 growth of m-1 in the july - august period is expected to be in a 5 to 9 per cent annual rate range under this alternative , largely in consequence of the step - up in m-1 growth that appears in train for july .
b PAR 14 with growth at the mid - point of that range , the level of m-1 will remain well above that implied by the upper end of the fomc 's current longer - run range , as indicated in chart 1 on the following page .
b PAR 14 and for the third quarter as a whole m-1 growth may be around a 7 - 1/4 to 7 - 1/2 per cent annual rate-- high relative to the longer - run range but slower than in the second quarter , mainly reflecting the current deceleration in economic activity and a lagged response to the appreciable increase in short- term rates this spring .
b PAR 15 expansion in m-2 under alternative b is likely to be in a 7 to 11 per cent annual rate range over the july - august period .
b PAR 15 growth at the mid - point of this range would maintain m-2 in the upper half of its longer - run range , as shown in chart 2 .

b PAR 18 if the federal funds rate were maintained at the currently prevailing 7 % per cent level , as envisioned under alternative b , most other short - term rates would likely show little net change over the intermeeting period .
b PAR 18 the recent rise in short - term rates as a whole has brought them roughly into line with the prevailing funds rate .
b PAR 18 moreover , short - term credit demands are not likely to add significantly to market rate pressures in the weeks immediately ahead .
b PAR 18 while the short - term credit demands of financial and nonfinancial businesses and of federal agencies are likely to be strong over this period , the treasury is not expected to add substantially to the net supply of bills .
b PAR 19 interest rates on longer term securities are also likely to be little changed under alternative b . corporate bond offerings are expected to increase in july , but the forward calendar for august is seasonally light .
b PAR 19 in the municipal sector , new bond issuance is anticipated to fall further over the summer , as the normal seasonal lull is reinforced by a continued lack of advance refunding operations , recently discouraged by changes in irs regulations and the previous rise in bond yields .
b PAR 19 over the intermeeting period , the treasury is likely to obtain a sizable amount of new cash in conjunction with a regular issue of two - year notes and with its mid - august refunding.- the market is in a good technical position , however , with security dealers carrying large net short positions in coupon issues .
b PAR 19 as bond yields remain little changed , while thrift deposit flows are sustained at around current levels , mortgage rates are also likely to stay fairly stable .
b PAR 19 i/ the terms of this refunding are to be announced in late july .
b PAR 19 the staff expects the treasury to sell $ 6 to $ 6 billion of new securities in this operation , rolling over $ 4k billion of publicly - held debt issues maturing on august 15 , and raising about $ 14 to $ 2 billion of new money .

c PAR 11 in view of the persistent tendency for m-1 to grow above its longer - run ranges over the past several quarters on 1/ we have assumed a 25 basis point increase in ceiling rates on all deposits with maturities of four years or more .
c PAR 11 average , a considerable moderation of m-1 growth over the next year would be required to compensate for such overshoots and bring m-1 growth to within a 4 to 6¼ per cent range over periods longer than one year ending in qii ' 79 . as can be seen from the lower panel of appendix table iii-1 , the 6¼ per cent m-1 growth contemplated under alternative
c PAR 11 b implies annual rates of expansion of about 7 per cent for periods beginning as far back as the fourth quarter of 1975 .
c PAR 11 however , constraining m-1 growth over qii ' 78 to qii ' 79 to a 5¼ per cent rate , as under alternative c , would produce m-1 growth close to the 6½ per cent upper end of april longer - run range for periods beginning with the second quarter of 1977 .
c PAR 11 as shown in the lower panels of appendix tables iii-2 and iii-3 , under all alternatives m-2 and m-3 would grow within their current 6½ to 9 and 7½ to 10 per cent longer - run ranges for periods starting with the fourth quarter of 1976 and ending in qii ' 79 .
