b PAR 9 even if m1 growth in february - march is as rapid as implied by the mid - point of the range stipulated for alternative b , m1 would expand at only about a 3¼ per cent annual rate from the fourth quarter of 1975 to the first quarter of this year .
b PAR 9 thus , given projected gnp growth of about 12 per cent annual rate , another sizable rise in velocity appears in store -- as would be consistent with a further downward shift in the demand for money .
b PAR 9 the staff is assuming only a small further downward shift after the first quarter , and as a result interest rates can be expected to begin rising in the spring if m1 growth is to be kept to around a 6 per cent rate over the year .
b PAR 9 the funds rate under alternative b is expected to reach an average level of around 6¾ per cent by the fourth quarter of this year .
b PAR 9 rate pressures would , of course , be stronger if the demand for money began strengthening relative to gnp .

b PAR 9 iv shows federal funds rates expected over the course of the year for each of the alternatives .
b PAR 10 m2 growth in the february - march period under alternative b is likely to be in a 10 to 13 per cent annual rate range .
b PAR 10 the rate of growth in time and savings deposits ( other than large cd 's ) may moderate over the next few weeks from its recent exeptionally rapid pace , partly in consequence of withdrawals in connection with payment for the new 8 per cent 7-year treasury note .
b PAR 10 a further slowing in such deposit flows can be expected as the year progresses in view of the anticipated rise in short - term market interest rates .
b PAR 11 little further change in market interest rates would be expected between now and the mid - march committee meeting under the specifications of alternative b . the 3-month bill rate could rise somewhat because a substantial part -- perhaps half -- of the treasury 's very heavy cash need of around $ 15 billion between now and mid - april may be raised in the bill area , where dealer bill positions are already large .
b PAR 11 upward adjustment of interest rates in the 2 to 7 year maturity area may also develop , since the treasury will be offering additional notes for cash in the forthcoming period ; a $ 2 billion 21-month note to be auctioned next friday was announced today .
b PAR 11 yields in the corporate bond market are likely to fluctuate within a narrow range , with little signifi- ca nt change anticipated over the next few weeks in the flow of new issues coming to market .
b PAR 11 the municipal market is still subject to substantial uncertainty because of persisting doubts as to how new york state and certain other borrowers will cover forthcoming financing needs .
