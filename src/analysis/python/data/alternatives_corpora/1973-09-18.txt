a SENT -- i ( 9 ) alternative a specifications include a 6-month growth rate for m
a SENT -- it also implies a smaller drop in interest rates than does alternative a . the 6-month growth rate for m1 under this alternative is around 4 - 1/2 per cent at an annual rate .

b PAR 1 rpd 's now appear to be growing around the mid - point of the committee 's august - september range of tolerance , but m1 appears to be well below and m2 is near the bottom of their respective ranges , as the table shows .
b PAR 1 in august the narrowly defined money supply experienced a small contraction instead of expanding slightly as projected , and growth of m2 at a 6 - 1/2 per cent annual rate was also substantially short of expecta- tions .
b PAR 1 the smaller shortfall from target for m2 as compared with m1 reflects the continuing expansion in consumer - type time deposits , particu- growth of monetary aggregates and rpd in august - september target period ranges of latest reserve and monetary aggregates
b PAR 1 tolerance estimates ( growth at saar in per cent )
b PAR 1 rpd 11 - -13 12.2 m1 -- 4 - 0.7 m2   6 - 3/4

b PAR 1 fed funds rate ( per cent per annum )
b PAR 1 10 - -11 9/12 10.74 larly the 4-year wild card accounts .
b PAR 1 the fact that rpd 's are growing around the mid - point of their range of tolerance , even though the money supply aggregates are low , stems from the committee 's decision to reduce ( by two per centage points ) the whole range of tolerance for rpd 's relative to that shown in the bluebook for alternative b , while dropping ( by just one per centage point ) only the low ends of the ranges for m1 and m2 .
