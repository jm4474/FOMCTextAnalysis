a PAR 18 as indicated in the charts , m-1a and m-1b would be somewhat above their long - run midpoint paths by june , implying less rapid growth of the narrow money stock ( and higher interest rates ) in the second half of 1980 than the other two alternatives .
a PAR 19 to achieve alternative a targets , total reserves might have to expand at an annual rate of 5¼ percent in the march to june period . assuming member bank borrowings of around $ 1 billion in the next few weeks , and gradually declining over the quarter to $ 1 to $ 1¼ billion , nonborrowed reserves would rise by a 22½ percent annual rate .
a PAR 19 such growth of reserves probably would be associated with a fairly substantial drop in the federal funds rate in the intermeeting period , perhaps into the lower half of the 12 to 19 percent range suggested for this alternative .
a PAR 20 however , questions may well be raised in markets about the consistency of a sharp further drop in rates with last month 's anti - inflation program , and these concerns would tend to limit rate declines in longer - term markets .
a PAR 20 nonethe- less , conventional home mortgage rates would probably retrace a large part of the sharp run - up of the last 60 days , as the further decline in short - term rates strengthens thrift deposit inflows this quarter .

b PAR 8 for the december to june period , bank credit growth under alternative b would be 9 - 1/2 percent .

b PAR 8 even though real gnp is expected to decline significantly this quarter , the rate of increase in nominal gnp is still projected at over an 8 percent annual rate , suggesting a need for appreciable growth in transactions
b PAR 8 balances.1/ however , given the restraining effects on money demanded of past increases in interest rates , and with real economic activity apparently slowing significantly , the may - june increases in m-1a and m-1b required under alternative b may lead to a decline in the federal funds rate to the 16 to 17 percent area , or perhaps even lower , over the intermeeting period .

b PAR 11 the december- june growth is about 1 percentage point below that adopted by the committee in march , as the expected continued sluggishness of money market mutual funds is not fully offset by stronger deposit flows .

b PAR 12 with the marginal reserve requirement on managed liabilities also discouraging bank credit expansion , bank issuance of large time deposits and other open market liabilities is expected to be somewhat lower than in the first quarter .
b PAR 12 m-3 growth under alternative b is projected at a 6½ percent annual rate over the march - june span , considerably slower than in the first three months of the year .

c PAR 15 this would imply growth in m-1a over the two months of may and june of about 7¾ percent , or more than 1½ percentage points less than alternative
c PAR 15 the funds rate would probably be in the area of 18 percent in the weeks ahead , or perhaps a little lower .
c PAR 15 shorter - term market rates are likely to back up a bit under this alternative , as market participants become more doubtful about the timing and amplitude of a cyclical downturn in rates .
c PAR 15 however , any tendency for longer - term market rates to rebound from their recent lower levels might be limited if the relatively tight monetary policy stance is construed as increasing the odds of controlling inflation and/or intensifying the recession .
c PAR 15 the dollar probably would not weaken further on foreign exchange markets and might strengthen a bit .
c SENT -- ( 16 ) as shown in the charts , alternative c implies that all of the monetary aggregates would be below their midpoint paths by june .
