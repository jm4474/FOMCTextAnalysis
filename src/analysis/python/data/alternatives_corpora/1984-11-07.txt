a PAR 14 growth of m1 over the last two months of the year would be anticipated to be around 8 - 1/2 percent , encouraged by growth of nonborrowed reserves at a 15 percent annual rate .
a PAR 14 over the three - month september - to - december period , m1 would expand at a 3 - 1/2 percent annual rate and m2 at a 7 - 1/2 percent rate - still below objectives set at the last meeting for m1 but on target for m2 .
a PAR 14 growth of m3 may turn out to be somewhat further above the currently specified 3-month growth rate , as an additional easing of market conditions encourages credit expansion .

b PAR 12 the aggregate specifications of alternative b are thought to involve pressures on bank reserve positions indexed by discount window borrowing of around $ 700 million .
b PAR 12 this is expected to be associated with a federal funds rate averaging around 10 percent , given the apparent considerable diminution in banks ' reluctance to borrow over recent weeks and also assuming that the " frictional " level of borrowing is , at $ 300 to $ 400 million , somewhat higher than usual .
b PAR 12 such an assumption for " frictional " borrowing appears consistent with the recent sustained level of seasonal borrowing at an unusually large $ 300 million .
b PAR 12 after declining sharply in october , nonborrowed and total reserves would be expected to expand at annual rates of around 9 and 6 percent , respectively , over the last two months of the year .
b SENT -- the language under alternative b partially restructures the existing directive as another approach to resolving the difficulties .
