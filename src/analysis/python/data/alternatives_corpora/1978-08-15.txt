a PAR 8 under the circumstances , m-1 growth over the august - september period is expected to accelerate into a 5½ to 9½ per cent , annual rate , range -- bringing the level of m-1 by september a shade above that implied by the upper bound of the committee 's newly adopted longer- run range , as may be seen from chart 1 on the following page . m-1 growth in june and july may have been held down by an unusually rapid run - up in u.s .
a PAR 8 government deposits , and such deposits are projected to decline in september .
a PAR 8 moreover , transactions demands for cash are likely to be fairly strong in the third quarter as a whole , when nominal gnp is projected to rise at about an 11 per cent annual rate .
a PAR 8 the projected m-1 increase for august and september would lead to an expansion in the third quarter at about a 6¼ per cent annual rate , and would imply a rise in velocity of 4¼ per cent at an annual rate ( see appendix ii ) .

a PAR 8 the interest - bearing component of m-2 may expand at about a 10 per cent annual rate over the period .
a PAR 8 this represents a slight slowing from the july rate of growth , but is more rapid than in the first half of the year .
a PAR 8 with inflows of deposits subject to ceiling rates remaining sluggish , banks are expected to sell substantial amounts of large time deposits -- both non - negotiable and negotiable -- to finance continued relatively strong credit demands .
a PAR 8 ( 8) ( 9 ) ( 10 )
a PAR 11 under alternative a , the recent upward readjustment of market rates , following the unexpectedly sharp decline of recent weeks , may continue , with rates returning closer to their mid - july levels .
a PAR 11 basically , however , demands on credit markets are not expected to strengthen significantly over the period .
a PAR 11 corporate bond offerings are likely to remain near their recent reduced pace , municipal volume should drop off , and treasury credit demands are not expected to pick up until later in the fall .
a PAR 11 in short - term markets , the 3-month treasury bill rate is still quite low relative to the federal funds rate -- a spread of about one percentage point -- and the bill rate should rise more than other short rates unless there is a substantial volume of foreign central bank purchases .

a PAR 11 preliminary and
a PAR 15 given below are suggested operational paragraphs for the directive .
a PAR 15 the language of alternative
a PAR 15 a is consistent with the specifications of alternative a discussed in the preceding section .
a PAR 15 like the directive adopted at the last meeting , it places main emphasis on money market conditions and calls for operations directed at maintain-
a PAR 15 ing the weekly - average federal funds rate within the range of 7 - 3/4 to 8 per cent .
a SENT -- during the period until the next regular meet- ing , system open market operations shall be directed alternative a at maintaining the weekly - average federal funds rate within the range of 7 - 3/4 to 8 per cent .

b PAR 12 if the funds rate were to move up to the mid - point of the 7¾ to 8½ per cent alternative b range , the upward adjustment in market rates would likely be prompt and marked .
b PAR 12 the 3-month bill rate should move toward 7¼ per cent , and pressures on the cd and commercial paper rates should generate a further rise in the prime loan rate .
b PAR 12 the rise of interest rates on treasury coupon issues would probably reverse all of the recent decline in such yields , and perhaps go somewhat further .
b PAR 12 and corporate bond yields may also rise fairly substantially given the prevailing narrow rate spread between treasury and corporate issues .
b PAR 13 growth in m-1 and m-2 under alternative b may be in ranges of 5 to 9 and 6½ to 10½ per cent , respectively .
b PAR 13 it is expected that continued issuance of the 6-month money market certificate by banks and thrift institutions will tend to moderate adverse impacts of rising interest rates on inflows of small - denomination time and savings deposits ; the beneficial effect is likely to be most marked at thrift institutions , if recent experience is any guide .
b PAR 13 neverthe- less , the rising marginal cost of time and savings deposits , if not an actual slowing of deposit inflows , is likely to exert additional upward pressure on primary mortgage interest rates .
b PAR 14 the staff still expects that interest rates between now and mid-1979 will have to rise beyond those contemplated under the short - run specifications for alternative b -- given projec- tions for gnp growth -- if m-1 growth over the one - year qii ' 78 to qii ' 79 period is to be around the upper limit1/ of the 4 to 6 per cent range adopted for that aggregate .
b PAR 14 federal funds rate projections through the second quarter of next year are shown in appendix i. 1/ abstracting from shifts out of demand deposits of savings accounts occasioned by the automatic transfer regulation which goes into effect on november 1 .
