a PAR 15 in the current environment , an easing in policy would take the market by surprise , and the initial reaction to such a development would likely be a rather sharp drop in both short- and long - term interest rates , particularly if market participants were to interpret the easing as the cyclical turning point in interest rates .
a PAR 15 in foreign exchange markets , the dollar would very probably come under strong downward pressure .
a PAR 15 the rally in bond markets might be constrained by a buildup of the corporate bond calendar , as firms accelerated offerings , and by continuing investor concern about the outlook for inflation .

b PAR 7 growth is expected to be slower in october than in september.and continued relatively moderate growth is projected over the balance of the year .
b PAR 7 the expected deceleration reflects the lagged effects of the tightening of money market conditions this summer and the reduction in transactions demand for money associated with the projected slowing of nominal gnp growth in the months ahead .

b PAR 10 the same would be true for alternatives a and c. ( 11 ) m-1 growth is expected to remain within its adjusted longer - run range over the balance of the year .
b PAR 10 expansion of m-1 in the fourth quarter is projected to be at about a 6 percent annual rate , even assuming some slight decline in interest rates later in the year .
b PAR 10 growth in m-1 over the one year qiv ' 78-qiv ' 79 period would then be about 5¼ percent , in the upper half of the adjusted range.- ( 12 ) m-2 growth also is projected to decelerate under alternative b , expanding at a 7 to 11 percent annual rate during the september - october period .
b PAR 10 most of the slowdown reflects the moderation of m-1 growth , but , in light of the current higher level of market interest rates , the rate of expansion of savings and small time deposits subject to fixed rate ceilings is expected to moderate .
b PAR 10 however , commercial banks should continue to capture a relatively large proportion of flows into 6-month mmcs .
b PAR 10 with loan demands likely to moderate only slightly in the near term , banks are also expected to continue to issue large time deposits and borrow from 1/ the fomc 's long - run m-1 growth range of 1½ to 4½ percent for 1979 assumed , when originally set in february , that ats effects would reduce m-1 growth by 3 percentage points .
b PAR 10 in july , when the range was re- adopted , it was estimated that ats effects for the year would be about half as large .
b PAR 10 at present , we estimate that such ats effects will reduce measured m-1 growth by a little less than 1½ percentage points .
b PAR 10 on this basis , an adjusted range of 3 to 6 percent , or even a little higher , would be comparable with 1½ to 4¼ percent .

b PAR 14 there may still be some expectation in the market that the federal funds rate will rise over the near term .
b PAR 14 thus , if funds continue to trade around the prevailing 11 - 3/8 percent -- the midpoint of the alternative b range -- both short- and long - term market rates could decline .
b PAR 14 however , any such movement is likely to be limited since aggregate credit demands are expected to remain strong in the weeks ahead , before edging off later in the year as economic activity weakens .
b PAR 14 business credit demands are likely to continue to be substantial in the very near term , mainly in short - term markets .
b PAR 14 in addition , the amount of cash raised by the treasury in the market over the next month is expected to remain near recent levels , with the sale of $ 1 to $ 2 billion of 15-year bonds and $ 200 million add - ons to weekly bill auctions .
b PAR 14 in the near term , new issues of municipal bonds are likely to continue sizable , given the large volume of mortgage revenue bonds still in the pipeline .
b PAR 14 with the federal funds rate unchanged and no significant decline expected in other money market rates , adoption of alternative b should in itself have no substantial impact on the value of the dollar in exchange markets .
