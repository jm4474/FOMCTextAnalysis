c PAR 13 the case for increasing the intended federal funds rate only 25 basis points as under alternative c would seem to hinge on the judgment that financial market participants have exaggerated the like- ly strength of future spending relative to the economy 's potential and hence of prospective inflation pressures .
c PAR 13 in this view , taking the fundamentals reasonably into account , the markets have gotten " ahead of the curve " and the risk of disappointing them should not be allowed to divert the federal reserve from a gradual course of 25-basis - point adjustments in the stance of policy toward neutrality .
c PAR 13 with the loca- tion of a neutral funds rate itself a moving target -- and lower to the extent that real long - term interest rates are higher -- such an approach would allow more time to assess the needed federal funds rate in- creases as new information on the economy and prices becomes avail- able .
c PAR 13 short - term rates likely would edge off immediately after a modest policy tightening .
c PAR 13 the initial reaction in capital and foreign exchange markets could be adverse if the small size of the move were seen as signalling a reluctance to move aggressively to head off an inflationary buildup .
c PAR 13 however , the odds on such a reaction may have been reduced by the recent favorable price data .
c PAR 13 in this context , market participants might be more inclined to interpret the smaller move as sufficient to counter coming inflation pressures and to project a lower trajectory of short - term rates , which would pass through to lower longer - term rates .
