a PAR 22 over the period from november to march , these two aggregates would be expected to grow at annual rates of 8 - 3/4 and 8 percent , respectively .
a PAR 22 growth in m3 may exceed the upper end of its tentative longer - term range .
a PAR 22 total and nonborrowed reserves would grow at 4 - 1/2 and 8 - 1/2 percent annual rates , respectively , through march .

b PAR 17 the specified m2 growth of 8 percent at an annual rate for the november - to - march period would be consistent with an expected pick - up in m1 growth from the pace of recent months offset by a slowing in expansion of nontransaction deposits ; the latter may have been boosted to a small extent in october and november by the effects of deposit chart 1 actual and targeted m2 confidential ( fr ) class

b PAR 17 expansion of m3 is likely to slow somewhat over the november - to - march period from its average pace since summer , perhaps in- creasing at a rate a bit below the top of the fomc 's tentative longer - run range .
b PAR 17 credit growth at banks and particularly at thrifts is likely to be slower in the first quarter than over recent months , working to limit demands for managed liabilities by depository institutions .
b PAR 19 borrowing at the discount window would be expected to aver- age around $ 650 million under alternative b , with federal funds continuing to trade in a 9 - 1/4 to 9 - 1/2 percent range , probably nearer the upper end ( and possibly a little higher around year - end   .
b PAR 19 with the renewed expansion of transactions deposits , total reserves would be expected to increase at about a 2 - 1/2 percent annual rate through march , and nonborrowed reserves would rise at a 4 - 1/2 percent rate .

c PAR 25 under alternative c , growth in m2 would be constrained to the lower half of its longer - run range .
c PAR 25 this would probably be associated with m1 near the lower limit of its range , while m3 would be held comfortably within the upper part of its range . assuming m2 growth from november to march of 7 - 1/4 percent and m1 growth of 5 percent , the tightening in money market conditions expected under this alternative may involve discount window borrowing rising to near $ 1 billion and the federal funds rate rising to 10 percent or a little above .
c PAR 26 the tightening in bank reserve positions under alternative c would be larger than now apparently anticipated by the market .
c PAR 26 as a consequence interest rates would increase substantially , with treasury bill rates moving up into a 9 - 1/4 to 9 - 3/4 percent range , and the dollar would move even higher on foreign exchange markets .
c PAR 26 cd rates would rise toward 10 - 1/2 percent , calling into question the current 11 percent prime rate .
c PAR 26 rates on the cds of some banks might come under particular upward pressure if the general movement of interest rates intensified concerns about international debt burdens .
c PAR 26 any upward response of bond yields , however , might on balance be somewhat muted , if the firming in money markets was viewed as increasing the odds on a significant slowing in the economic expansion .
c PAR 26 indeed , if economic expansion slowed as the year progresses to a pace below , say , the staff 's current forecast , interest rates would probably need to decline later to maintain money growth at a satisfactory pace .
