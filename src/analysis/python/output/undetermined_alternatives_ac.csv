With such an outlook, and with inflation data continuing to be benign, members might see it as appropriate to counter the effect of tighter financial conditions by easing policy by 50 basis points at this meeting, as in Alternative B. (21) The draft language of Alternative B repeats the observation from the August 7 FOMC statement that economic growth was moderate in the first half of the year. Alternative B refrains from making any explicit characterization of the balance of risks, stating that _x001A_The Committee will continue to closely follow timely indicators of economic prospects and will act as needed_x001A_ to attain its dual objectives. If members find Alternative B attractive, but wish to adopt an explicit statement of balanced risks, then they might insert the sentence _x001A_After today_x001A_s action, the Committee judges that the downside risks to economic growth are now roughly balanced by the upside risks to inflation_x001A_ at the start of the assessment of risk paragraph. With Alternative B putting 50 basis points of easing in place and suggesting at least some possibility of further rate cuts, this alternative would likely prompt a modest decline in short-term interest rates and the foreign exchange value of the dollar might edge lower. (24) The draft statement for Alternative A is similar to that for Alternative B, but with four main differences. As with Alternative B, the effect on equity, credit and term funding markets is ambiguous, but the negative growth outlook in this alternative might well spook investors and cause stock prices to fall and risk spreads to rise. (27) In the draft statement accompanying Alternative C, the assessment of the outlook for growth and inflation would be identical to that in Alternative B, but the balance of risks would point to the downside.",E,-0.25,,"FRB/US Model Simulations of Estimated Outcome-Based Rule Current Bluebook Previous Bluebook 70 Percent confidence interval 90 Percent confidence interval Greenbook assumption 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 Percent Information from Financial Markets Expectations from forward contracts Previous Bluebook 70 Percent confidence interval Previous Bluebook 90 Percent confidence interval Previous Bluebook Near-Term Prescriptions of Simple Policy Rules 2007Q3 2007Q4 2007Q3 2007Q4 2007Q3 2007Q4 1Ã‚Â½ Percent Inflation Objective 2 Percent Inflation Objective Memo Taylor (1993) rule 4.3 4.2 4.1 4.0 Previous Bluebook 4.5 4.5 4.2 4.2 Taylor (1999) rule 4.6 4.3 4.3 4.1 Previous Bluebook 4.7 4.7 4.5 4.4 Taylor (1999) rule with higher r* 5.3 5.1 5.1 4.8 Previous Bluebook 5.5 5.4 5.2 5.2 First-difference rule 5.2 5.1 5.0 4.6 Previous Bluebook 5.4 5.5 5.1 5.0 Estimated outcome-based rule 5.2 4.9 Estimated forecast-based rule 5.2 4.8 Greenbook assumption 5.2 4.9 Market expectations 5.2 4.7 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 21 of 49 Table 1: Alternative Language for the September 2007 FOMC Announcement Alternative A Alternative B Alternative C Alternative D Policy Decision 1. Under Alternative C, the policy rate would be lowered 25 basis points to 5 percent, and the statement would indicate that the downside risks to economic growth outweigh the upside risks to inflation. If the Committee finds the staff forecast to be both plausible and likely to be the best attainable outcome under the current difficult circumstances, then it may choose to ease policy 25 basis points at this meeting and issue a statement pointing to downside risks to the outlook, as in Alternative C. (27) In the draft statement accompanying Alternative C, the assessment of the outlook for growth and inflation would be identical to that in Alternative B, but the balance of risks would point to the downside. (28) With investors placing considerable weight on a 50 basis point cut at this meeting, the adoption of Alternative C would probably cause short-term interest rates to rise somewhat, even though the downside balance of risks would suggest that Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 30 of 49 further easing could well be forthcoming.",,,,"FRB/US Model Simulations of Estimated Outcome-Based Rule Current Bluebook Previous Bluebook 70 Percent confidence interval 90 Percent confidence interval Greenbook assumption 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 Percent Information from Financial Markets Expectations from forward contracts Previous Bluebook 70 Percent confidence interval Previous Bluebook 90 Percent confidence interval Previous Bluebook Near-Term Prescriptions of Simple Policy Rules 2007Q3 2007Q4 2007Q3 2007Q4 2007Q3 2007Q4 1Â½ Percent Inflation Objective 2 Percent Inflation Objective Memo Taylor (1993) rule 4.3 4.2 4.1 4.0 Previous Bluebook 4.5 4.5 4.2 4.2 Taylor (1999) rule 4.6 4.3 4.3 4.1 Previous Bluebook 4.7 4.7 4.5 4.4 Taylor (1999) rule with higher r* 5.3 5.1 5.1 4.8 Previous Bluebook 5.5 5.4 5.2 5.2 First-difference rule 5.2 5.1 5.0 4.6 Previous Bluebook 5.4 5.5 5.1 5.0 Estimated outcome-based rule 5.2 4.9 Estimated forecast-based rule 5.2 4.8 Greenbook assumption 5.2 4.9 Market expectations 5.2 4.7 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 21 of 49 Table 1: Alternative Language for the September 2007 FOMC Announcement Alternative A Alternative B Alternative C Alternative D Policy Decision 1. Alternative D would leave the target rate unchanged at 5Â¼ percent and report that the risks to growth and inflation are roughly balanced. In contrast, Alternative D recognizes the deterioration in financial conditions but repeats the judgment that moderate growth is likely over coming quarters. In Alternative D, the inflation assessment is unchanged from the August 7 statement. An unchanged stance of policy, coupled with an assessment that the risks have moved into balance, as envisioned in Alternative D, would allow the Committee more time to gauge the need for policy adjustments while leaving the flexibility for policy to be eased at the next meeting, if such a move appears necessary at that time. (30) The draft statement accompanying Alternative D retains the observation that economic growth was moderate during the first half of the year.

(23) If the Committee views the staff forecast, which is conditioned on unchanged policy through the middle of next year, as reasonable and acceptable in the circumstances and sees no compelling reason to change the statement materially, it may wish to leave the policy rate unchanged and issue a statement along the lines of that in Alternative B.

(24) In the statement under Alternative B, the rationale begins by noting that _x001A_Incoming information suggests that growth in economic activity has slowed in recent months,_x001A_ which is changed from _x001A_Economic activity expanded in the second quarter_x001A_ to shift the discussion to the current quarter and reflect the significant, albeit expected, deceleration that appears to be under way. The remainder of the statement under Alternative B is unchanged from that released by the Committee in August, indicating that the Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 30 of 41 substantial easing of monetary policy will promote economic growth; that the Committee expects inflation to moderate, but the outlook is uncertain; and that, although downside risks to growth remain, upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern. Investors read the statement released in August as consistent with an outlook for unchanged policy, so Alternative B, which is very similar, would probably not lead them to revise their views. In sum, short- and longer-term interest rates, equity prices, and the exchange value of the dollar would probably be little changed in response to an announcement along the lines of Alternative B.

(27) The discussion of economic activity in the statement proposed in Alternative C is similar to that in Alternative B. However, Alternative C cites the accommodative stance of monetary policy rather than past policy easings as a factor that should support growth in the future because policy would be tightened under this alternative.
