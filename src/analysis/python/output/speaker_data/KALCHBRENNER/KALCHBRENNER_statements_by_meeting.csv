11,1976-03-29,"  Thank you, sir    About 10 minutes, sir    [Statement--see Appendix]    They all have quite substantial errors on the order of $11  billion to $18 billion in M1  None of them is terribly accurate in precisely a monthly context   For comparison purposes, we have indicated in the appendix, in table 3, the month-by-month  errors for these various equations both for a one-month period and for a two-month average  In  the Stage I report, it is obvious, looking at the information that we have before us, that none of  these techniques promises very precise predictions of M1 or M2 in a one-month period     3/29/76 - 13 -     Yes sir    Yes sir    Plus or minus 4 percent, yes sir  In the absolute errors, [the  error for] nonborrowed reserves is close to 6 percent    Two-thirds of the time    No sir, the standard errors of the [unintelligible] measures on  all these equations are as large [as] on judgmental projections that we have looked at over time   They are, as you point out, substantial    At least that would be the amount of reserves that were targeted  and were not achieved because of the constraints--    It is not altogether true that that would be the case in the sense  that if the Manager was using the federal funds rate as the target, the reserves responding were  subject to the demand for money in the bank  That’s why the results you get--     3/29/76 - 16 -     Yes, but I thought the question was in terms of if there were a  constraint?    The estimating equations covered the period from 1969 through  1974    With monthly data we thought that was enough    Yes    Yes sir, you are  That is correct   SPEAKER(?)  But the Committee did not decide to move away from RPDs because of a  finding that its predictive relationship was inferior  Our basic reason is that this is a magnitude  that the Manager cannot control in a short-time, sort of [unintelligible]--    I don’t know what the current number is, we haven’t had time  to compute that, but we could certainly do it    Let me check the exact form of the equations that were used  I  can tell you that, sir    In the Shadrack Skinner equations, it’s the change in business  sales related to a change in M1    That is also the increment    Yes sir, we can do that     3/29/76 - 30 -   "
