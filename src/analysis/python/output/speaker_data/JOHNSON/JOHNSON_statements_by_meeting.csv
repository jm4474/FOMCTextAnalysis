2932,1986-02-11," Jim, I have a question about chart 21, too This is an exciting chart   You have a somewhat asymmetrical treatment of real output and inflation under the assumption of 1-1/2 percent higher money growth That 1-1/2 percent higher M1 growth feeds through as a 2-1/2 percent change in the deflator by 1988 whereas the effect on real output up front is only 1-1/4 percent The net effect is really a strong effect on prices That 2-1/2 percent seems awfully high given the 1-1/2 percent--   I assume that has an assumption of no change in velocity   I am generally not that far off from the staff forecast either I have about the same number for nominal GNP growth --about 7, 7-1/2 percent--although I too am a little more optimistic about the real side I see the economy moving closer to the 4 percent range for real growth, since I had the advantage of factoring in some of the recent information from the last month of two I do think things are looking a little better I don't expect any great inventory buildup but that should play into the situation, certainly for the first half of the year So, I see the mix more toward 4 percent real and I am really optimistic on the inflation side I see most of the spillover from the lower dollar maybe filtering more into 1987 than into 1986; so I see inflation closer to the 3 to 3-1/2 percent range for 1986 partially because of the oil price decline, [the effects of] which I think will show up fairly strongly later in the year  -20-    2/11-12/86  In addition to that, the budgetary situation looks very promising Although I am not betting a lot of money on Gramm-Rudman targets being met perfectly, I think we are seeing a change in the budgetary environment that we haven't experienced in the last few years Everybody has been waiting for this turning point on the budget situation, and I think we see it We are seeing it now as a consensus among budget estimators; CBO and Fed staff as well as the Administration and many other private forecasters are now seeing the structural budget deficit at a turning point I am not expecting this to do fantastic things but, given no further change in policy--locking in the [unintelligible] in outlays for 1986 alone--the CBO estimates show the budget deficits getting down to the $100 billion range toward the end of the planning period Relative to the size of the economy in that period, it's quite a different debt/GNP ratio than we have been expecting in the past I think that's going to have quite an effect on inflationary expectations Some of that already has been discounted; but even if this process doesn't work its way out completely, there is additional optimism being built into the inflationary expectations side One of the major factors creating concern in the past was the potential for the budget and political environment to pressure this organization into partially monetizing the deficit and then inflation might result from that I think some of that pressure is starting to subside and I am fairly optimistic about that Now, that doesn't mean that issue is no longer with us; it's going to be with us for awhile But I think the oil price situation along with reaching a turning point in the budget is promising, and that's why I see a little brighter inflation picture  I do worry a bit about the progress on productivity growth; that has been fairly discouraging I may be wrong but, if you look at that closely, I think one of the major reasons behind that is obviously the employment growth But you have to ask why we have gotten such a strong employment growth A company doesn't just go out and hire because it's fun to hire Obviously, the relative cost in this component of production is relatively cheaper If you look at the growth of wages at this stage of the economic expansion and compare it to all other postwar periods, you will find that unit wage costs are relatively cheaper than they have ever been in the postwar period at this stage of the cycle And I think that's one of the reasons why we are seeing a lot of substitution toward the employment side, despite some of the advantages to capital purchases [unintelligible], especially in the equipment area One of these days we are going to see all these computer purchases show up in productivity, I hope   But still, I'm fairly optimistic We are only at about 80 percent industrial capacity, and I think we still have a ways to go before we see that full employment unemployment rate pressure set in I don't know how far that is because I have no idea what the full employment unemployment rate really is But it's hard to match up 80 percent industrial capacity with 67 percent unemployment and say that we are there It just doesn't look like it to me, compared to anything I have seen in the past So, I think we have a fairly promising year ahead but I do worry about the dollar situation Most of the effects of that probably are going to show up in 1987 and I think we really have to watch that situation carefully    2/11-12/86  and [determine] what the lags look like in terms of commodity prices and how that filters all the way into other production prices   I think all of the important things have been said I agree with what seems to be a consensus that there are a lot of uncertainties around M1 velocity, that we need to keep our options open, and that the best way to do that is by a symmetrical widening of the bands I support something generally in the range of 3 to 8 percent for Ml; I think that's satisfactory But I think it's very important that we have language associated with this that makes it clear that the options available within the 3 to 8 percent range are not options for more or less inflation but in fact a range of possibilities that we think [appropriate] and that the need to move to the upper end of this range is still a non-inflationary alternative In other words, it depends on what happens to monetary velocity if we can detect it; and if we move to 8 percent M1 growth during some point during the year, or even well along the top of that range, that has no implications for price stability We simply would be moving the [unintelligible] associated with what we perceive to be continued abnormal performance in M1 velocity To me language like that is important because I think we experienced recently what a change in policy rhetoric can do with respect to the dollar I don't think the fundamentals associated with the dollar have changed that much, although they have some But there is a different attitude out there about the dollar simply because a lot of people who are in charge of policy are saying things differently We certainly don't want to create any impressions that we're leaning toward an easier policy and that that means we're trading off inflation for real growth It's very important to point out that we would not be making those kinds of trade-offs; we simply would be pursuing an easier policy toward 8 percent money growth because of velocity conditions and demand for money The closer we can come to language like that, the better off I think we'll be   You made an important point, I think If it's just slightly above target, we run the risk of having the markets take it very seriously--much more seriously than if it were running way above and it was fairly clear that it would be impossible to try to get it back into the target range as well as that it obviously was not a major concern I do worry about financial market uncertainties when M1 is hovering a percentage point or so above target and there is a lot of uncertainty about whether the Fed is going to try to take action to get back within the target or let it go I think it is important; how important--? There is a July hearing, right? Is it often changed then? I really can't remember   My point is that most of this is a forecast, but at least the data for 1-1/2 months of the first quarter don't look too bad Of course this could turn around quickly in one quarter, but if we are going to set a target, a wider path, we ought to take it seriously at least until midyear And if we have reason to change it then we can change it--unless we are going to put out some statements along the way that make it clear to financial markets that a slight amount of excess above target does not imply policy action There are uncertainties around not meeting it during this intermediate period I don't know what is going to happen either, but if we are going to set a target we ought to take it fairly seriously and then take some formal occasion to adjust it If July is a formal occasion for doing so, that might be a good time   Well, maybe that's the best way to do it to provide information carefully along the way about how seriously to take the level of M1 relative to the target We don't have to say anything if it is on target, but obviously we need a lot of communication if it is not   They ought to know how we'll respond that we've got to do something about that   On the borrowing range, what currently is our objective?   That is what I am getting at Projected borrowings on alternative A are around $150 million It sounds like we are actually close to that at the moment in reality I just wondered--   It sounds like what we really have is something below the $300-$400 million range you are suggesting   First of all, I don't see that much difference in the alternatives either; I also rule out alternative C But I am a little surprised that the difference between ""A"" and ""B"" is such a large difference in borrowings I think ""A"" goes a little too far, if that is really the kind of borrowing level that we have to go to But I don't want to close any options I agree with Preston Martin to some extent that we ought to edge toward the lower end of recent experience in actual borrowings and leave the option open for a potential discount rate cut based on what we might see in the near future I would like to keep that option open There's talk of another Japanese discount rate cut, which could make it possible to [cut our rate] without the exchange rate fallout that might result if we did it under the current Japanese interest rate structure We have some CPI data coming out, and it is going to be interesting to see what kind of CPI numbers or wholesale price numbers we get when we    2/11-12/86  start factoring in the oil price decline, which we haven't seen [in those numbers] yet   It may be too early, yes I don't know   When is that report?   There is some information there Also, I think we ought to look carefully at the yield curve and how the yield curve is responding to all this information Holding the funds rate at current levels and continuing to see the long-end rates decline and a further flattening of the yield curve--that is certainly not a warning sign of inflationary expectations If in fact we continue to see that yield curve flatten out under these borrowing levels, then we ought to take the lead on that And if the Japanese cut their discount rate further, I don't want to foreclose the option of another discount rate cut So I would at least like to keep that option open and err toward the lower borrowing range in alternative B   Yes   It encompasses where we are now, though   That's my point Given what we've been doing, some people could even interpret that as a tighter policy   That's a posture of [unintelligible]  SPEAKER(?) Take what you can get   If we talk only in terms of a borrowing level, those conditions would produce a lower funds rate Would we say something about the funds rate or would we adjust the borrowing level? It depends on which we emphasize   They're all the same "
2958,1986-04-01," Peter, what's the normal spread between the funds rate and the 3-month bill rate? It's about a point now, and I just wondered   Well, I will join the club too I generally am optimistic about the situation I also agree that the fundamentals look better than they have in quite some time, even though there are a few uncertainties out there It wouldn't be out of the question to see OPEC make another run at trying to support the [oil] price I don't think that they can do it with all the non-OPEC production out there, but I think that they could put some upward pressure on [oil prices]; that's always a risk To discount that completely would be making a mistake I do think the fundamentals look better than they have in a long, long time But at the same time I think that the US economy's future is more in the hands of our foreign trading partners than it ever has been in the last several years We have not had to rely on that particularly over the last four years, as we had a lot of domestic capacity and we didn't mind running up a trade deficit because we had a surplus in the current account going in--or at least we had a large creditor position Now, four years down the pike we have a $150 billion trade deficit and a depreciating dollar; so I think at this point we have to be more careful  The oil price decline is definitely very welcome However, the oil price decline benefits our major trading partners, Germany-- not Germany directly, but the EC in general--and Japan, more than it does the United States So, if oil prices have been good for us and have helped our interest rates decline, they also have helped Japan and Germany even more As a matter of fact, their interest rates should have seen an even more dramatic response If you look at Japanese rates on the long end of their market, they certainly have They have a negatively sloped yield curve right now where their long rates are actually below their short rates, indicating to me that there is tremendous pressure in Germany and Japan to pursue lower interest rates just to avoid a potential deflationary cycle in those two countries So, their fundamentals are stronger than ours And, unlike the staff, who I think are assuming a further depreciation in the dollar as a source of future growth in this country, I think the way it ought to be and what I would like to see is for our trading partners to move their interest rates lower and maintain the exchange rate alignment that we have now and not see the dollar have to weaken relative to those currencies We would get our export growth from their growth in demand rather than from the exchange rate shift, and that would obviously be the preferable way to see expansion here in the United States--to see growth pick up in Japan and Germany Since the elasticities are stronger from the demand effects on exports than the exchange rate effects, and we don't have the negative potential on the inflation side, that's really where we want the growth I wish I were really optimistic that we would see the kind of flexibility in Germany and Japan that we really need to get that done, but they seem to be fairly satisfied to run generally restrictive policies There is tremendous pressure, given the fact that Japan faces a negatively sloped yield curve and Germany is not much different than that, for interest rates to go lower there and the exchange rate not have to come under the kind of pressure that we might expect I think that's what we have to have to get the really good outlook in the future I am generally optimistic about it but it could come grudgingly; so I am not sure that I would put in the second-half growth effects as strongly as the staff has them because I think that may come a little slower    4/1/86   I suppose that happens in the second half?   Let me ask one thing What would the forecast look like in the second half if you didn't assume a further depreciation in the dollar--if you had the same exchange rate and, let's say, you already had a fairly reasonable expansion abroad? Would you say about 4 percent combined EC and Japan?   Closer to 3 percent   Yes, but--   Okay   It's purely demand   I just have one, Steve The last thing you said was that you would expect alternative B to restore some upward tilt to the yield curve That seems pretty uncertain   It just seems to me that alternative B--not that I have any problem with it one way or the other--would flatten out the yield curve rather than have any upward tilt It probably would put a bit of pressure on the short end of the market In the  -20-    4/1/86  context of current oil prices, I think maybe it would lead to further declines in the long-term yields and a rise in the shorter end   Even if those don't go lower, if you consolidate the oil price decline and don't let other relative prices    4/1/86  go higher than they currently are, you have a ratcheting down of the general price level In other words,--   You would slow the inflation rate It's just that if we try and hold monetary policy constant and let the oil prices decline, one would expect other relative prices to rise and the general price level to remain unchanged But if we stop that, if we don't let other relative prices show gains to offset the oil price declines, then I think we have ratcheted down prices   I tend to agree with that statement My feeling is that I don't see any reason to change sharply from the current reserve maintenance situation But I would like to have some flexibility at least built in on alternative B with a slightly lower borrowing target, given the way the yield curve looks now and the point made by Steve Axilrod and Peter Sternlight that there has been a discounting already in the market with the spread between the T-bill and the funds rate And if the Japanese were to cut their rates later for some reason, there might be an opportunity to let the funds rate ease some without any exchange rate implications and without any particular pressures resulting from that The other problem I have is that I am a little uncertain about this velocity issue Of course, my concerns are more on the down side When we met before, we talked a little about a zero rate of velocity growth as the most likely possibility during the year However, the way things are shaping up during the first half of this year, it certainly looks to me like nominal GNP is going to come in below our earlier expectations If we maintain the same amount of M1 growth or reserves, I would expect the weakness in velocity to show up more severely than we anticipated The first-quarter [velocity] looks like it's going to be minus about 2 percent an annual rate; in the second quarter it could even be more than that I think we are going to see more softness in the second quarter than we have in the first   Yes, the velocity was in there; I agree I am just saying that we are getting a lower nominal [GNP], implying a more negative velocity than we had before So I guess the issue is If that lower nominal is all on the inflation side, that's fine; we ought to consolidate our gains to some extent But I think we ought to be a little careful if we are still seeing the same trend in velocity that we've seen before, since we have had further interest rate declines and inflationary expectation breaks I don't know what the right amount of reserves is to offset that I see this as purely technical I am not talking about an easier policy; I am only talking about a purely technical adjustment I think we ought to be cautious and we ought to have some flexibility built into alternative B in case we see that develop   It all depends on the overall long-term inflationary expectation effects of that If one were to view this as a permanent change back in the direction that causes expectations to have to adjust, those balances people are holding in M1 might turn more into transactions balances relative to savings And we would want to take it out But who knows what the behavioral effects would be--whether they'd consider it long-term or short-term? If it really is an inflationary expectation adjustment, we'd have to tighten   Where are you, line 68?   I don't think the probabilities are symmetric in this thing I would still be in the ""B+"" category I realize that I'm probably in the minority on this, but I wouldn't want a purely symmetric statement that something like a borrowing target of $200 to $300 million suits me   I don't have any strong opinion   Consistent with 7 to 8 percent?   Well, the Bluebook has it a little different   5 to 10 percent isn't in the range of belief   5 to 9 percent centers it on where it is now "
2982,1986-05-20," Is that in keeping with what their estimate is?   I thought Germany had a more optimistic outlook than that    5/20/86 -3-   How do you think Germany will respond to such low first-quarter estimates, given the fact that even they, as you said, already have made it clear that even if they wanted to do something they're sort of boxed in by the French franc in the EMS?   What do you mean by easing on the fiscal side?    5/20/86   Worldwide velocity problems!   Which side of the trade account was revised? Or was it both?   I just want to make two brief [observations] I generally agree with what has been said so far on the staff's forecast, although there are a couple of areas on which I differ a little I am generally optimistic; I do see things picking up in the second half of the year But I think we are going to be disappointed on the trade side What I keep seeing in Europe and Japan indicates to me that we are going to get less growth out of the rest of the industrial world than we had been expecting and, therefore, our export markets are just not going to be there as strongly as we had anticipated So, to the extent that we built that into our GNP estimates, I think it is not going to materialize as strongly as we might have thought I do think things are going to look better domestically, although not as strong on our export side as we might have hoped  My other concern is that velocity, or the demand for money, still seems to be a major factor I think a lot of this is a carryover from the sharp decline in interest rates we have had and from the oil price situation, which has broken inflationary expectations another small notch So we're having an increase in demand for other checkable deposits as a result Just yesterday the staff was indicating that velocity growth has been around minus 9 percent for the second quarter That is really a hefty decline, so we're on a similar--if not even sharper--trend than last year I expect that to turn around a good bit in the second half of the year, but it has a lot of turning around to do My expectation would be that this velocity weakness will probably squeeze nominal GNP a little further, so I am relatively optimistic about it I hope that comes more out of the inflation side than the real GNP side;` but given what is going on and my expectation on the trade side, I think that we probably will see a lower nominal GNP performance and maybe some sort of balanced squeezing between inflation and real GNP in the second half  But once again, I think there is reason to be encouraged I just think we are going to be disappointed on the trade side because Japan and Germany don't seem to be willing to pursue the kind of stimulative policies that we might like I am talking about the fact that they have slack and potential from the oil price declines because they are major importers; I am not talking about demand driven type policies They have a lot of potential and a lot of slack Even if they are willing, they have some problems--institutional problems that [make them] resist being more stimulative Germany, as I said, is boxed in by the EMS; they are at the bottom on the currency [arrangement] so they are in danger of falling outside their range if they try to get rates lower unless France goes along Japan seems to  -13-    5/20/86  be resisting lower interest rates through their postal saving system and there are a lot of other institutional areas of resistance I think they are eventually going to adjust; they are just going to be slow to adjust I think political pressures will be brought to bear after the elections in Germany, but hopefully it won't be the wrong kind of expansion I am a little troubled by the idea of a public works project as a fiscal stimulus--being the source of expansion I think they will be slow to adjust I think our trade sectors are going to come around slowly   That's what I was getting at   I agree that that is something of a favorable offset It is just that the discussion we have had here and everything I've ever read suggest that the income effect is really much stronger up front than those exchange rate effects; and the lags are long on those exchange rate shifts It would be some time before we got an offset from that, if the demands were to fall seriously behind in Europe and in Japan   That trend is consistent with a decline in inflationary expectations I would think, so you're still left with that major question about velocity   I also would agree that alternative B is the right approach However, I generally agree with what Frank was saying on the directive I don't know exactly what the right language is, but I would prefer to be as neutral as possible on the directive I certainly wouldn't want to acknowledge the growth of M1 at this point because right now we are still trying to determine whether that growth is a response to the decline in interest rates and whether the demand for money might lead us actually to want to increase bank reserves, rather than cut back on the growth of Ml, to accommodate a further shift in the demand for money--at least an increase in the quantity demanded because of some [unintelligible] I certainly wouldn't want    5/20/86  to send out the red flag about the fact that we're concerned it is growing too fast when we don't even know yet whether this is a portfolio shift or whether what's going on is a result of declining interest rates and inflationary expectations or whether it is something to be concerned about There are only six weeks before the next meeting, and I'd say we certainly don't have to get stewed up about the aggregates when we can address this whole issue very carefully in July We can decide then what we are going to do about the targets when we have a better chance to judge whether anything is happening to the economy as a result Right now all around the table we have said very clearly that nobody sees any strong evidence that anything is going on We're still in this 2 percent pattern We are all hopeful with regard to the forecast, I agree; I too am optimistic about the second half of the year But until we get a little evidence at least in the orders data--or something to indicate that there's a pickup--I would like to remain absolutely neutral in the directive about where we want to go I wouldn't want to send out any signal whatsoever to the market at this point I would wait six weeks and see what we want to do then That's when we ought to have a little more time to decide whether the second half of the year is going to be the kind of situation we are hoping for   My only concern about that was that it implied that we might have lesser reserve restraint if there was a marked slowing in money growth I would say that we're so uncertain about the money demand situation that I wouldn't want to imply that we would ease if money growth slowed--even substantially If we take out any response to the aggregates, I would be happy with that   That would depend on whether we are seeing something happen in the economy by then   Well, everybody will have a different opinion I am just saying that's my opinion I would want to see if the economy was catching on as a result of this M1 growth that we have had The base is not really doing anything There has been big growth in M1 and I would like to see if that is catching on or if people are just deciding to save out of those other checkable deposits or what is happening In July, [unintelligible] if things were really starting to catch fire--if orders data and leading indicators were looking a lot stronger--I would say that would be a good indication that money was being used more for transactions than we had thought at this point   That was exactly the point I was trying to make If the economy were showing a lot of strength--even if M1 dropped off quite a bit and it indicated that the velocity really would rebound sharply--we wouldn't want to ease under those conditions I agree with that, but the opposite applies too The economy could be growing strongly but if velocity were showing continued weakness, we wouldn't necessarily want to tighten   I bet we could I wouldn't want to, but I think we could   I do agree with that point If we acknowledge the overshooting of M1 growth, which may be appropriate, I think we at least ought to balance our acknowledgement of the growth of M1 with the two possible meanings associated with that growth One is that we have a big bulge in money demand for various reasons associated with lower interest rates, declining oil prices, and all those things But it also can mean the opposite; it could be a warning of too much liquidity We don't know right now, it seems to me, which one of those meanings to apply to it   Well, we were just making an offering   Bob, I agree with what you are saying, but I am just asking How long have we been sitting around here waiting for the lags now? We have been watching   I don't know whether we are closer or not   Unless the inflationary picture--   The nub of the problem is that everybody starts guessing what growth rate that means What's the third-quarter number that will make us do that?   Well, I agree That's what I am saying   I am not really picky anymore I would be worried if this were to be released immediately   It grew about 13 percent all year last year   Okay, 12 percent  -40-    5/20/86   And for how long? If it were just a month or two, I could stand zero, but--   Are you going to strike the rest?   Once in a while   I might request a slightly less technical summary--maybe even just a one-page executive summary that would just sort of [unintelligible]   Can I ask you to clarify something for me? I assume we are talking only in terms of sterilized intervention, since otherwise it would have a bearing on what we just did earlier   The only question I have on the point that you made is that you have to be clear what you mean Does ""some coordinated intervention"" mean we are talking about a slight tightening of monetary policy here to support the dollar while they lower their interest rates? I am not sure we want to do--   I have no objections as long as it is consistent with the monetary policy agreed to by the FOMC I would think that we would have to cash those chips in few and far between to make it a credible change It would have to be a moment that was really creating the right psychological impression   I am still unclear as to what we mean by that Does that mean that we would let the funds rate drift up through our active intervention to strengthen the dollar?   Well, we'd only get away with this once in my opinion And we'd have to do it in conjunction with some support statements by all parties, it seems to me, instead of--   Okay, well--   Another--it may not [unintelligible]--prime opportunity later would be this If it does so happen that the aggregates are growing strongly and the economy is picking up quite substantially and we literally do decide in July or whenever that in fact we need to tap the brakes a bit, it would be a great opportunity to use that decision to buy dollars and--even though we're going to do it anyway--if Germany and Japan still are dragging their feet on stimulating their economies and it's clear that we are alone, we could  -50-    5/20/86  offer to support the dollar and see if that might lead to a better situation with the Germans and Japanese   They too-- "
3007,1986-07-08," Over the year, though--   I want to follow up on that same point too It's still hard for me to understand how in the forecast you can get rising prices in the out years, both domestically and abroad, when currencies--especially the G-10 currencies--are appreciating relative to the dollar I see how you can draw a scenario where prices tend to come back a little in the United States as a result of the appreciation of the dollar, with a lag as oil prices level off I still don't understand how you can get the same trend abroad with appreciation in their currencies relative to the dollar, especially with the fact that their currencies are appreciating even more dramatically relative to the non G-10 currencies against which the    7/8-9/86  dollar is also appreciating So, I am having a rough time with that scenario   10 percent   It still seems to me that it would be going the other way   I agree I just don't--   It's small, but I don't even understand the direction I was checking   Maybe we ought to start over I thought that oil prices leveled out in this--   And then against depreciating currencies--    7/8-9/86   But they are going down   Above?   I kind of agree with Frank I don't think we really know how to set a target at this point for the rest of the year A lot is going to depend on interest rates and we are not sure what is going to happen I think that we ought to emphasize M2 and M3, which is sort of what we have done I think we would be better off not setting a new target for [Ml] and playing Ml down while emphasizing M2 and M3 I think that makes a little more sense   Yes, 1986 A lot would depend, I think, on what we see in the demand for money by the end of the year But of course, we have to set a target now We could make--   I would shy away even from 1987 at this point, saying that we might come back to it if we see velocity stabilize at some point   Well, that is what I said I didn't say drop the target; I said maybe not announce targets for 1987 this year--not until we have a better look at what velocity is doing for 1987   Yes, that is the same I don't mind   I think there is some information in M1 relative to M2 and M3 What we have seen is a runoff in bank CDs into Ml--to some extent a shift in savings from less liquid to more liquid form--and I think it is important to monitor that I would be much more concerned about M1 if it were rising and M2 and M3 also started moving It has some relative significance, but I don't know right now whether we could set a target and make any sense out of it   We really need some time series on how much in NOW accounts are people's savings   I think what most people mean is that we monitor it but not really set a range   We could keep the 3 to 8 percent, but [unintelligible] July   I would change ""could be"" to ""is""   I think everybody has just about covered all the points, so I will try not to be too long-winded There are a couple of things I want to stress First, I was generally very optimistic too--in fact, I put in probably one of the stronger forecasts for 1986--when we first gave these forecasts back in February Of course, for 1986 my forecast is now down in the 2 percent range from about a 4 to 4-1/2 percent range What has happened between the two periods for me is a growing pessimism about the situation abroad in terms of the domestic growth possibilities in the other industrial countries There were strong expectations there; and I think our forecasts and the staff forecast were totally reasonable--exactly what you would expect if we had gotten reasonable performance abroad But things have been coming in substantially weaker than what we expected overseas; I think we were looking for something on the order of 3-1/2 to 4 percent real output growth in the non-US OECD countries I really am getting very gloomy about that; I never thought that they could sustain the situation politically in those countries with the kind of conditions that exist But not only are they sustaining it, their political strength seems to be growing, which is a really strange phenomenon in these days and times I don't think we can expect much on the export side of the market, and I think that what we put into the growth path as a result probably ought to come out That leaves the domestic economy much more dependent upon domestically generated stimulative factors and I think that becomes harder to do when no one else is participating in this real growth process, because it runs the risk of exposing our exchange rate and producing some pressures Of course, if the rest of the world is  -39-    7/8-9/86  going to pursue recessionary conditions, I am not as concerned about the exchange rate fallout as I would be otherwise  So, I think that is the dilemma we are in And under those conditions, I think price pressures won't be as great As a matter of fact, because of that, I think current nominal interest rates could translate into higher real interest rates than we now think exist It may be the case that what is happening now to the domestic side is that real interest rates are [higher] than we think they are I made this transition too I also have some concerns about the uncertainty associated with tax reform I think that will pass when we get a bill out of the way But still, there are a lot of factors like this that we have to deal with I would not be worried about the second half I agree with what Jerry was saying that everybody expected a weak second quarter We had been forecasting that all the way back since last year The problem is that the early indicators for the third quarter don't look good We are not seeing the kind of evidence that we would expect to see in making the transition from a weak second quarter to a stronger second half I think that's the problem and the reason that is the problem is what I mentioned earlier--what is going on abroad It is almost a helpless feeling to see what is going on abroad and not be able to feel there is something we can do But I think that is the situation   What has the velocity of M2 been?   I know it has been around zero   So an 8-1/2 percent upward bound would account for that pretty much   If we get a 6-1/2 percent nominal   Yes, I think we can afford to take it down a half point from 9 percent   I hope that's right   Well, there's not a big difference between the two I was just thinking of the psychological effect that [a half point reduction] may still be showing a commitment to getting inflation down at the same time that we may be abandoning Ml In other words, an 8-1/2 percent top on the range for M2 would still allow for a pretty explosive situation with Ml, if we have something that looks like what we got this year You're saying that M2 is growing at a rate of about 7-1/2 percent this year so far, is that right?   And we see what's happened to M1 If that pattern were to continue, we could still be within our M2 range even with that Ml pattern   Same here   On that point, it seems to me that it might work better to lower it now even if we have to give it up later, because right now we're talking about additional short-term ease and it might be good to offset that psychologically with some future commitment We can always play that card if it looks like we're in a situation when we have to later   Well, I think we would all agree with that   I agree with that The point is that it could be even greater Who knows what it could be? I'm just saying Why not [leave it]? I would prefer not to even tinker with that   I would almost like to treat that 1987 target as if we're not really taking it seriously at all until we get closer to that point Then we will look at it and maybe leave it there Just indicate in the language that we're leaving it there, but we're really going to address it when we get to that point   Yes; we could just have language like that   Can we make a big technological adjustment factor?   If we mark-to-market relative to household wealth, doesn't it look a lot better? It does We can play the capital gains game   Yes, I guess we waited too long--two days too long   I agree I would leave it in   ""The extent of Ml growth relative to the range""--well, that is still not saying over ""In excess of the range""   He has moderated his tone on M1 a bit, though I noticed when I went up for my confirmation hearing that he hit me hard on the growth of M1   He'll put something in the Congressional Record   If we leave it and they ask questions, you could defend yourself by responding that we haven't had good results relating it to anything that would explain why--   That's right, but at least there is some historical pattern of a relationship there; there has never been--   I guess it's rates as well   All of these things have been pretty good as long as the relative prices didn't change When they did--   The sentence sounds all right   I would just add on to that, though, that for the time being we are carrying forward--   You would want a higher level of borrowings   I agree wholeheartedly with what you are saying I think that's the whole issue It's almost a feeling of being held hostage by our trading partners [That's been the case] for almost five years now, really How long are we going to stay hostage in that situation when at some point we have various domestic concerns? You are right; there is the risk that you described But I am a bit more optimistic I agree that a half point on the discount rate, if it's followed by a $300 million borrowed reserve level, is not going to change the world by any means Still, I think it's more than just hitting the interest-sensitive sectors that are already running almost full out It was pointed out by the staff that to some extent the lower interest rates have been offset by tax reform and that the cost of capital really has been relatively unchanged And I think we could affect that efficiency of investment at the margin with an interest rate decline As you say, it's not going to change the world; but it certainly could do more for new orders than what we have been seeing That's the way I am looking at it--that hopefully it could add some pressure at the margin--even though it sounds like we are going to have to wait until the fall   There's no doubt about that The only other point would be the additional psychological [effect] I don't think    7/8-9/86  we want to look panicky; we want to look confident in what we are doing and not like we made a mistake and now are trying to get ahead of the ball game But you are right; a 1 percent discount rate reduction would exert more pressure abroad if it affected [their actions], but if they chose not to--   That's right   Yes, but I think we have to draw the line too on the potential I agree with that   That obviously can be carried to the extreme, to the point where one has done too much   We would have a growing disparity--   That's the problem There would be a growing disparity between the funds rate and the discount rate and we would have to [unintelligible] if we wanted to--   No, but the gap would widen   The only problem is that I think that might be interpreted very bearishly   I think the expectation is that Japan may do something They don't seem to be indicating that they want to do something, which may be of some surprise in the exchange market But that's the whole question   They would be setting their domestic economy up for a real ride   I think it will   Right   If they continue not to move and if they let their economic situation deteriorate domestically, at some point we conceivably could end up in a situation like 1983, when they were lagging so badly and our stimulative effects actually led to a strengthening of the dollar Boy, we would really get a trade problem out of that! In other words, it could be perceived that they were getting so weak that it would weaken their own currency And then we would have a strengthening dollar in a situation of the United States moving [toward ease] relative to those countries It might be a double whammy on the trade side   As a matter of fact, what funds rate would be consistent with that in your opinion? It should be about the same as the discount rate, but I just wondered if the--   May I? I don't know if I expressed my [view] I'm for alternative A, which is a $300 million level on borrowing   It makes a lot more sense   Do we have to quote a borrowed reserve target?  SPEAKER(?) No, we never do; just leave it out   I think the thing to do is to leave the sentence as we have it in the beginning and say ""decrease somewhat the degree of pressure on reserve positions"" We are not reporting the borrowed reserves target, so--   If we actually published the $300 million borrowed reserves target, it would be hard to interpret that as a decrease in reserve pressures But if we are not reporting the    7/8-9/86  borrowed reserves target and say ""decrease reserve pressures somewhat,"" then--   That's right That is just saying that the Committee is reducing reserve pressures and it is not saying how  SPEAKER(?) I think that is all we've got to do  SPEAKER(?) I agree with that  SPEAKER(?) That's right   But since we--   That is what we have been trying to avoid all these years   That is actually not true If the discount rate is lowered, we are not maintaining the same degree of reserve pressure   You are right But we have to spell it out then   Well, your language doesn't pin us down to a number   It still leaves uncertain what we would do in a situation where M1 continued to explode and M2 and M3 did okay and the economy kept declining I am just saying that is not covered in here; I hope we don't have to face that  -67-    7/8-9/86   Well, I was just thinking about this one sentence here that says ""Somewhat lesser restraint might be acceptable in the context of a marked slowing in money growth and pronounced sluggishness in economic performance""  SPEAKER(?) That's out   All that in the brackets comes out? I see   I think that is the safest   5 to 8 percent doesn't really fly Well, I don't know; I guess it is getting closer to the range   It is spelled out   I'll throw my vote in "
3033,1986-08-19," Who is this designed to impress?   May I express a partial Treasury opinion from my past?   It was always thought that it would be nice for the Fed to get into long bonds because the Fed always rebates the interest and that saves on the interest the Treasury owes   I agree with that I was unsuccessful in discussing that   Peter, I'm sorry, what [unintelligible]?   What is the issue about liquidity here? What do we need the--   $90 billion?   I agree I can see a time when a coupon sale would be useful   But that period that Frank described may have been a suitable time, I think I don't know   [And drive up] the yield curve   If we put out a press release that says we would sell Treasury securities in the same proportion that we buy them in these contingency situations, we could do that on a regular basis   That was the point I was getting at talking symmetrically about buying in the same proportion that we sell, along the lines that since we've been cutting back on the proportion of the Treasury's issues-- I think that would balance the market; maybe not   Well, I agree with that I'm not for changing just for the heck of it   I'd forbid that coincidence!   I think you're quoting--   I'd just add to this a little I agree that consumption seems to be doing quite well, but I think that we're probably putting too much emphasis on the G-10 trade-weighted dollar for the reasons that already have been mentioned We're doing quite a bit of trade with a lot of countries whose currencies are still depreciating relative to the dollar; Canada and Mexico, our border countries, are good examples of that It's not unreasonable to expect to see a continuation--well, there may not be a deterioration in our imports but, of course, if oil prices bounce back up a little we may see a further deterioration in imports And with all the relative weakness in European and Japanese demand we're certainly not going to see improvement on the export side of the market It is very difficult for me to see where this domestic production is going to come from I still think that we're probably overestimating the impact of the trade-weighted dollar against the G-10 countries I think that's the problem   May I ask a question? I heard a story the other day that there's a massive shift in demand into Canada for US autos--General Motors and Ford-type automobiles--and that they're having to put sanctions on the dealerships in Canada to keep the flow of traffic from going over the border, given the exchange rate shift, to buy automobiles I don't know if that's affecting the domestic sales level any, but have you heard anything like that?  SPEAKER(?) No   Yes, a huge [difference]   Yes, it doesn't--   I couldn't tell if that was the case or not, but it sounded like they were inundated with US crossovers and I just wondered--   Yes   Well, I don't know if manufacturer--   Yes Speaking from [the perspective of] somebody who tried to do that for about 2 or 3 years while we were working on it, it is too complex, definitely   One last comment to follow up on Bob Parry's question I'm not sure I can think far enough ahead to 1987; I'm more concerned about the rest of 1986 I'm not that pessimistic regarding the trade side except that my major pessimism lies in the area of growth in the industrialized countries It appears that Germany may be on a better track now, but I'd like to see those numbers in detail before I'm convinced that they're going to do better than 2 percent growth this year And Japan doesn't look like it's going to be improving So I just don't see the pickup there I think that Japan is at the beginning of a long transition process and that we're probably not going to see them improve dramatically for some time I may be wrong about that but it appears to me that they are not going to be making any major contribution to export demands The rest of Europe doesn't impress me all that much, but I'm hopeful that Germany is starting to pick up A lot of my opinion about 1987 and the rest of 1986 will depend on how solid this German growth is, but I'm not particularly excited I think we're doing reasonably well domestically but so much is being affected by the trade side   That is one of the problems if they just continue to resist on their discount rate   I don't think we want to create a psychology that would lead to a real impression that we were aggressively pursuing a lower dollar policy I think that is something we should try to avoid at all costs; at the same time, I wouldn't be that upset by some sort of symbolic intervention--because I think that is what it would be, basically   If we did that, that would put us in a posture like the last time the same borrowed reserve target and a lower discount rate and a lower funds rate   One-time adjustment to the change   Reduced interest rates--   We are following the market   Your target here does not assume anything on the discount rate?   Okay   I think you want to do something to the midpoint to reflect the discount rate change, not the funds rate range   Yes, okay   Wait Do you mean by that, Bob, that you are just interpreting ""B"" as consistent with $300 million of borrowing?   Well, that is what I think Don was--   That's my same sense except that I prefer to keep the borrowing level about where it is, at about $300 million And, I think something like a half point on the discount rate might be pretty good   Some people said alternative B without specifying a borrowing target I am a little confused--   I guess we could be very careful on the open market side but I am a little concerned that we could end up getting a pretty nasty effect in the bond market if we were to cut the discount rate and raise the borrowing level--maybe not, if we did it just a little around the edges in a way I think we might get a steepening of the yield curve from an attempt to raise the borrowing level at the same time we cut the discount rate I'd hate to see that   Well, you might   I would like to see at least what happens to the yield curve independent of any changes in borrowing Maybe if we think things are a little too aggressive as a result of that, we might want to change--   One other alternative is to just leave it at $300 million   Well, that's the alternative    8/19/86   Yes, I would sort of prefer that   Yes, just leave borrowing at $300 million whether we cut the discount rate or not   No, it's saying that you're willing to accept $300 million on borrowing regardless of what the discount rate--   What you're really saying is that there's not a whole lot of difference between $300 million borrowing and no discount rate cut and $300 million borrowing with a 1/2 point cut   I know I'm just saying that you would have to believe that that margin didn't mean a lot   Okay, I could see that That's fine   Yes, I would just leave that "
3059,1986-09-23," Is there any notion of what the Germans will do with all these marks that are being sold? Will they just let them stay out there? It would be fundamental to their monetary policy   Yes, somebody's got to be holding them   But if somebody else within the European--   If we run into a $90 billion problem we might as well turn in our badge   If we could get the Treasury to stop extending the term structure of the debt, it seems that a neutral policy would be to buy whatever they issue in the same proportion But they keep extending the number of long bonds without a real rationale that I can tell   Yes, I guess that's right   In proportion to what their needs were, which would mean we would be in the market on a regular basis but for small amounts   Have we bought coupons for a purpose at times?   I think we did   But we will go short on the refunds [unintelligible]? At what pace are we going to roll them over?   We could thin out the market [unintelligible], depending on the pace that we--   Okay   You have marked down some the G-10 countries' growth?   I haven't read the export numbers carefully enough to know Have they been changed much since the earlier forecast?   Okay, so something had to give there The growth abroad slowed Is that made up in what has happened to the exchange rate since that time?   I guess I should put in my two cents worth I really don't have much to add; I think everybody has covered most of the basics   That is right My own views are not that much different from the staff's, either I am a little more pessimistic on the trade side And looking a little further down the road in 1987, I worry about how this automobile situation is finally going to work itself out They are making a big contribution in sales this quarter, which is going to drain inventory and have a fairly neutral effect on GNP Even in the fourth quarter, it appears that their inventories are going to build back up because the incentive programs will go off and demand will slide What comes after that is somewhat of a concern Are they going to cut prices, which doesn't appear to be the case, or are they going to build in deeper incentive programs? How much have they borrowed from the future? My concern is that there may be some bigger production cutbacks ahead in autos, perhaps in the 1987 period The numbers are working out about right for 1986, it appears  The third-quarter trade just doesn't look like it is going to meet our expectations, at least if the July numbers are half correct I realize there is a gold sale phenomenon in the accounts but that does not make me feel that comfortable So I am a little more pessimistic, but I do see a turnaround I don't think you can have a depreciation of the dollar of around 40 percent against the major industrial countries' currencies and not see some improvement I think that we are getting close to the peak of the trade deficit and that some improvement will start showing up If it just stopped increasing, we could see a good improvement in the GNP growth rate I am a little concerned, too, as I have mentioned before, about some of the changed environment in the financial sector I do think a lot of it is associated with the turmoil over who is going to contribute to world growth There has been a good bit of expectation developing about interest rate reductions in Europe and Japan, which haven't materialized That has added to the argument of some policy makers in the United States that the only way to solve the trade deficit, as a result of this resistance, is through an ever lower dollar Obviously, that is going to create some anticipation in the financial markets that trying to solve the trade deficit through a substantially weaker dollar ultimately could be inflationary I think that is a factor contributing to the turmoil of financial markets Hopefully, if growth is stronger in Europe than we are thinking that will improve the situation and calm the environment a bit and exports will pick up I think that is the only thing that ultimately is going to calm that environment The outlook doesn't look that good in Japan; I think we have to place most of our hopes on Europe and hope that Germany is right unless they are planning to reduce their interest rates a little later Maybe this European exercise to support the dollar will help but I am still concerned about the mechanics of that and how that's all going to work out That is my two cents    9/23/86   $230 billion is about the forecast   That's a good point The smoke and mirrors that they are going through right now likely will add to that $50 billion and--   I am in favor of alternative B I'm torn about nuances I wouldn't mind having some language describing why we are pausing and seeking no change--language that would be associated with  -34-    9/23/86  the yield curve and with commodities and the dollar to at least provide some sort of criteria for a guideline Somebody else mentioned the fact that one problem is that people are starting to wonder in the financial markets what the guideposts are They don't think that we are paying that much attention to the aggregates, which we are not, and I think we ought at least to tell them what is important to us to some extent I don't know quite how to engineer that language, but I think it would be useful   My interpretation is not so much that I think how much attention we pay to the aggregates still depends on what velocity is doing; it's whether the economy seems to be catching on in the face of growth in the aggregates I am not that troubled by the aggregates performing strongly If we have another huge negative velocity number, I think the third quarter is going to come in about like the second quarter Given evidence of that, if commodity prices kept rising and the yield curve kept steepening and the dollar was still under pressure, that would be criteria for oozing up the borrowings a little in my opinion  -36-    9/23/86   Are you suggesting that we have a $300 million target that we just [unintelligible]? Are you saying that we work harder not to offset these other leakages?   So you're just saying leave some discretion on the borrowings   Well, what is ""C""? I don't want to ooze into alternative C   ""About"" goes with 8 and not with 7 to 9   ""B"" would stay right on the cone   That's what I am saying, 9 percent would be ""B"" It would be moving right along that cone line, since we are right on it now   I guess you are right   I assume that we are on the line and if we're on the line and the line says 9 percent--   That one still leaves the door open We can ooze in that way   Changing the ""would"" and putting ""might""   Split the two out   If the Germans lowered their interest rate--   I don't think it's likely that we would need to use the alternative for ease It just doesn't look like that alternative is going to materialize But I certainly wouldn't want to leave it out as a possibility; you never know The ""might"" and ""would"" nuance deals with it okay; I wouldn't want to just leave it out completely   Well, I don't mind giving signs that we didn't like what we saw in the financial markets I would like people to be able to look back and see that in the discussion "
3085,1986-11-05," Well, the words I've heard are literally that there was more pressure at one point to raise the discount rate because of the growth of the aggregates   I second   I think it's a modern times series model   I don't have much to add I think just about everything has been said The staff forecast is looking better and better The latest evidence is consistent with the pickup in exports, though it may be too early yet for that to be conclusive But I do think that the anecdotal [evidence] and some of the aggregate numbers are consistent with the staff forecast, so I feel fairly comfortable with that It comes just in the nick of time, really Some of the improved aggregate statistics on the trade side along with both the proposed change in fiscal policy and the drop in the discount rate in Japan were timed well I think [those developments] relieved a lot of the concern building in the financial markets about what was going to happen to the dollar, what kind of pressures that was going to bring on us, and whether the economy was going to remain weak All of that has led to some relief in the financial markets You can almost see it; you can see it in some flattening of the yield curve I think we have a little more breathing room now and I feel a little less pressured than I did last time looking at this situation Still, I think it is too early to pass judgment on whether we are out of the woods But certainly, the evidence is consistent with the projection that we have, so I feel better   How much of that is based on the oil price, and is it going to level off?   I would not mind suggesting one little nuance   The nuance I had in mind is that since the last FOMC meeting perhaps conditions have changed sufficiently to take the asymmetry out of our wording and either leave it totally symmetric or shift the nuance to the other side It would be fine with me if we made it totally symmetric, but I have a slight preference for shifting the nuance the other way I think we ought to change that nuance and that's about all   Take out ""would"" and use ""might""   No, ""mights""   I guess it doesn't matter as long as we use the same word on both sides   Yes, that's all right   If we are continuing to get a good tight economy-- "
3108,1986-12-15," What is the feeling about Brazil? Is there a growing feeling that they need a significant amount of new money?   But they don't anticipate any further adjustments to meet the financing as conditions [unintelligible]   They devalued a couple of times   Mr Sternlight does have a sense of humor   [Unintelligible]   One of the problems with the defense budget is that when you initially have a defense build-up and add to authority, you build up a lot of authority in the system; then, as you start cutting back that budget authority, the actual outlays start to speed up because you have a lot of backlog in the system And that can go on for quite some time It is a strange anomaly when you are actually cutting budget authority you see outlays increase But that can happen; I know that has happened a few times before   It really does happen   I have another question There is a further 10 percent depreciation of the dollar built into the 1987 forecast How important is it if that does not come about? Or is the lag long enough that it doesn't affect 1987?   On the import side   DRI has a somewhat [unintelligible] forecast I don't know if you know why, but they also have more improvement in the trade balance than we do   It is a similar forecast   The broader aggregates we never [miss] that badly As for Ml, a big question mark in my mind is whether we even want a target for next year I would hate to get into the same situation we got into this year with Ml That could really constrain the markets quite a bit at the beginning of the year--if we set a target assuming another stable pattern of velocity for the year and end up with something [close to this year] There just seems to be too much uncertainty about it, period The study even indicates that there is so much uncertainty around Ml that it doesn't seem to have any great advantage Maybe if velocity patterns stabilized a little more during the year we could re-establish a target at midyear   It has done better   [Unintelligible]   You mentioned the sensitivity of Ml to a change in interest rates But what about the spread between NOW accounts and time deposits?   So when you mentioned a percentage point decline in interest rates, you meant a compressing of the spread?   A decline in the opportunity cost   I thought you said--   I thought you said there was some opportunity cost --   I agree with that point I think Wayne has made a good point too You can visualize times when this relationship gives you a lot more accurate assessment of nominal GNP, and I can see a time when more stability would return to Ml When you have big shifts, as you say, from a high inflation, high interest rate economy to low inflation and low interest rates, you expect big changes and unstable conditions I wouldn't want to throw M1 out altogether; but I certainly feel uncomfortable publishing a target range for 1987 in the middle of a transition period like this And giving people the impression that we are going to make some attempt to hit that target really bothers me    12/15-16/86   I can conceive of a time when Ml would be [unintelligible] I don't want ever to get in a situation like this, but 1979 was a very convenient time for an Ml target It is a disguise, maybe, for a high interest rate policy; but it certainly avoids a lot of the politics of having to--   Well, I don't know If I remember right, M2 was right on the target   There is something to at least having a measured narrow aggregate that we can influence, if we can But I think the point is still this I don't see that the uncertainties around Ml or the base are any more improved than they were when we started out last year I realize that we didn't forecast the decline in interest rates that we got last year I am just saying--   That is right The magnitude is not as great, but it is there   Definitely   Who is to say, Bob, that we won't get a shock with energy prices or something What if OPEC--? We could get a big surge in interest rates and we would end up looking vicious on M1 and need to go, as you say, even temporarily to negative rates of growth   It's hard to say that demand deposits have been less volatile in this whole mess than OCDs Isn't that right?   I think that's a good point It looks like we are really starting to get desperate--fishing around for something   I would be in favor of continuing to study it if we can, as Governor Heller said Maybe at midyear if we felt more comfortable with a narrower target we might look at it   That is an interesting possibility, but my views are even more basic I would simply explain the problems we have had with M1 and then say that, given those problems and the uncertainties that still lie ahead on M1, we are undertaking a study on narrow aggregates in general but that under the circumstances now we are only publishing an M2 and M3 target Perhaps at midyear when we have had more evidence on whether velocity has stabilized for some of these narrower aggregates, we would have a chance to choose one of them--and maybe Ml is the one again--and we might publish a new target range I don't see that it serves us any good purpose to have a range at all for the first six months of the year As a matter of fact, if we published a range, I think we would all feel uncomfortable saying that we ought to have a range that includes 12 or 13 percent growth for Ml, even though that has been the experience [because] of velocity; I think we would be constrained to want to say something like 5 to 8 percent or 6 to 9 percent And then we would run into the same potential problems, it seems to me, of running above the targets initially in the year and having the markets ask What's the Fed going to do about Ml? Even if they don't believe we will do much, it could be a matter of weeks that they are uncertain about it It could affect the markets in a way that I don't think we would really want So, I would be in favor of announcing that we still think there is an important function for a narrow aggregate but we are going to study the issue; it could be that M1A or some other narrow measure responds    12/15-16/86  better than Ml And we could also get a better feel for velocity later But I am for going with an M2 and M3 target   An afterthought on what I said is one thing on the other side too If we were to establish something like a 5 to 8 percent or a 6 to 9 percent monitoring range, and if we did have an upsurge or sudden increase in velocity, it could really be just as appropriate to be thinking of 2 or 3 percent money growth We would be just as constrained by the minimum on that range as the upper side   Well, we can always say we studied it and didn't find anything   The one thing that might be possible, if we want to have any kind of picture at all to illustrate it, would be to have two sets of parallel lines imposed on the same graph instead of having a cone shaped target   You wouldn't need a three-dimensional graph; you could have one inside the other One would be associated with stable interest rates and the other would be associated with volatile interest rates   Adjusted for income and interest rates   There may be some reason to believe that I don't know how long this stock adjustment will go on either, because of the change in the environment, but it wouldn't bother me--and it might give off an important message--if we could find a way to lower those broader targets a bit   I think the elasticities for the broader aggregates are such that there is a lot of tolerance in the current ranges We can still see 15 to 16 percent Ml growth as consistent with 6 to 9 percent [growth in the broader aggregates] That's why I don't think a 1/2 point reduction, or some small symbolic reduction in the target, is a real danger   That sounds almost like General Motor's range   It is true, I think, that after-tax real long- run interest rates are even slightly negative If you take the marginal [income tax] rate off the nominal interest rate and then take  -38-    12/15-16/86  [out] about a 3 or 4 percent inflation expectation, you have a negative number on longer-term rates   I'm generally in agreement with the staff forecast, too I think there are some risks, as indicated by the sensitivity of things to the exchange rate That was illustrated yesterday by the notion about what's riding on the further 10 percent decline, to some extent But even if you cut back [growth by] 6/10ths it's not the end of the world After 4 years of expansion, I think it's very unusual and very comforting to know that cost/price pressures are as moderate as they are at this stage I don't think we have ever, at least in the postwar period, entered a recession with the moderate kind of cost/price pressures [we are seeing] at this stage So, I'm reasonably optimistic that the expansion will continue I think it's a question of by how much I think there is this continuing dichotomy in the [financial] system and in the economy that's still a bit troublesome But over time, the change in the dollar is going to improve that There's a long adjustment period still ahead to work out all of the inflation excesses of the past But I'm fairly optimistic that expansion will continue I'm a little concerned that the expansion in the first half of the year may show some transitory problems, and I think we ought to remain flexible for that; I don't think it's likely to be deadly So, I agree with the staff assessment but I think the risks are a bit on the down side   Service sector inflation is continuing to decelerate, I think, sort of gradually   I'll volunteer After condensing all of this-- what I hear and the way I feel--I don't feel strongly about changing monetary policy from where we were before I still think that a $300 million borrowing target is about right Although I favored [a tilt] last time, I feel a bit more strongly about it this time I think we might want some asymmetric language in the directive because of the potential I've heard mentioned for a little more downside risks this time, at least in the first half of the year I think the inflation picture looks a little less risky now than it did earlier, so we might want to change the mights and woulds in the directive to be asymmetric toward potential ease rather than tightness at this point But I don't feel too strongly about it; I feel a little more strongly than last time, but it's just a suggestion   That's a good point   If Henry were here today--   I think it all depends on what the economy is doing   I thought the tone was we could be wrong more in one direction than the other   I think that would depend on how the domestic economy was performing--whether it was really starting to show some signs of picking up   It seems like we can kill two birds with one stone with that I don't think the implications are great one way or the other but if some sort of asymmetry in the language would    12/15-16/86  represent our current feeling--and maybe I'm wrong interpreting it that way--that we actually believe that the economy is going to show weakness, the timing [of the directive's publication] would be associated with the actual event   I have a tough time telling the difference between ""slightly"" and ""somewhat,"" but I guess just for variation--   Yes ""slightly,"" ""somewhat,"" and ""would""   Yes, that was my suggestion   Yes, even I wouldn't want that   Yes, it's pretty-- "
3132,1987-02-10," They are also starting to admit that their domestic demands may not be as strong as they had thought   I think it leaves--   What is in our directive? We don't specify a borrowings number in our directive We have an understanding of about $300 million or whatever we decide But if we say constant reserve    2/10-11/87  pressure, what is that going to mean to us? Maybe we ought to institutionalize the borrowing number or the funds rate Are we going to--   Borrowing number, yes   Well, that's what I had assumed An answer to your question would be that we haven't changed reserve pressures   It would be interesting to know eventually why people aren't borrowing with the higher spread I would like to know that answer I am not--   One little clerk who's doing it all   I don't see how that would explain the change at the end of the year and the continuation now I think there is something over and above that CRR that is making them hesitant, because the funds rate was behaving fairly consistently before   It probably has been very timely, given what has happened to the dollar   Ted, what are some of the models actually projecting? I agree with you, I wouldn't--   I think that the biggest issue is that a lot of people you talk to expect most of the gains to come on import substitution, but we don't really show much there at all   So why do you get the further depreciation?   I will try to be brief; just about all of the issues have been covered Like Jerry, I just got back from Basle and, after talking to the other G-10 governors, I am a little less optimistic, I think, than I was when I left   I'll admit to being the guilty party among the Board members who estimated the higher real GNP growth rate I have been looking at the numbers, and I have been fairly impressed with several months of fairly good data There are some end-of-the-year problems there, but I think there is enough evidence to say that things are starting to pick up The staff's forecast on the trade deficit is looking pretty good As I said, I was even more optimistic before I left to talk to the Germans and Japanese about it, so maybe I would cut that back a little now But I do think things are looking better On the tax side, I will make one point one reason why demand may hold up a little better than some expect is that some people, I think, are overestimating what tax reform is going to do There was a big surge to avoid the elimination of the sales tax deduction at the end of the year I went back and checked the law and found that you really don't lose the sales tax deduction unless it's a special sales  -26-    2/10-11/87  tax item Any generalized sales tax is still deductible--at least that is what it says in the books If you calculate your sales tax from the state tax tables, you can still deduct it   Well, I went back and from what I could see it's still there   It will be interesting to know because that's what the accounting firms say in the books they put out   No I am just saying that it's interesting A few people may find that their deductions--   A lot of the interest deductions are being phased out, so it's not really a big hit all at once That issue aside, I am reasonably optimistic about a turn in trade but it may not be as strong as I originally had thought because I am a little gloomier about the growth prospects abroad It's going to be interesting to see  On the inflation side, I am a little more pessimistic I have marked up my estimate about a percentage point, I think, from last July but that's basically a function of the oil picture as much as anything The nominal inflation picture doesn't look that bad to me There will be some pressure from import prices But looking at the wage situation and the shift toward manufacturing--so at least there is some productivity away from the service area--I think it's going to be a little better So, I am fairly consistent with the staff on the inflation forecast but I do think we have to be extremely cautious in that area I agree with everyone else here that the psychology seems to be tilting the other way a bit What's been happening in the financial markets with the dollar and some of the nervousness in the bond market should be watched very carefully That's about it   You have to put in a set of interest rate assumptions to make it--   Alternative II is all right with me, too But I think it's important to give some signal that we're moving toward a little more restraint on the broader aggregates; at least, that is consistent with continuing to try to keep inflation suppressed And I  -28-    2/10-11/87  think there is enough room in that target to allow for that in a fairly significant way Given what M2 did last year, with an explosion in M1 and the decline in interest rates, it doesn't seem that it's that sensitive So, I think alternative II would be able to handle just about any event   What you're basically saying is that if velocity starts to rise we need to pay attention to it If it goes down we don't   Well, I think that's the problem--it would change that interest rate differential even if we hadn't acted to change short-term interest rates because of inflationary expectations affecting the long end; we could get a decline in the aggregates or a slowdown even if we hadn't tightened at all And we might want to tighten, and everybody would think that we had   I think something like variant I in combination with ratcheting down M2 and M3 at least gives that signal   It conveys that message   If it's as interest sensitive as it appears to be--   If M1 is really symmetric, interest-sensitive wise, we could be sitting around trying to ignore 2 percent M1 growth--   --when the economy was growing, just like we're trying to ignore 15 percent now when the economy is sluggish I think that lends some weight to what Bob Black has been talking about--more of a price rule I'm not sure how you do that either, but in a period  -38-    2/10-11/87  like this it seems to me that we have to be more sensitive to some sort of price signal   Well, I like variant I with maybe a proviso that we might bring M1 back on an intermediate-term basis if we need it and if conditions arose   I don't think it's very likely that we would   What would you say if the long end of the bond market had been deteriorating because of building inflationary expectations from a decline in the dollar or something like that and M1 was already decelerating quite rapidly because of the change in the interest rate spread I don't know what you should say   But we may want to tighten under those circumstances and yet M1 is decelerating sharply   We might see a rush out of liquid balances--if there's an interest sensitivity there--into CDs fairly quickly; I don't know When that change in interest rate spreads develops and all of a sudden M1 starts falling quite sharply, that would have an expectational effect on the long end   Well, that's their response to a tightening move I think that you can see bond buyers move on inflationary signals without moving the short rates at all   That's if the ""should"" doesn't come about   If the ""should"" provisos are violated, it would make it operational   Go into the second quarter   I think we'll be looking at the second half   But with April--   I don't know, given what's been happening with the dollar and the stronger data we've had--although I think there's a lot of year-end influence on those data, and we don't have a clear picture yet But I think, as Ed Boehne and some other people mentioned yesterday, there are some expectational effects out there that are starting to develop from a lot of this move in the dollar and some of the things that have been going on in the international sector So, I don't know I'm not for any major changes but I am for going back to tilting our nuances   Keeping a $300 million borrowing target but shifting the nuance back to asymmetrical language toward the tighter side   I think, Tom, that because of this supposed shift in the borrowing function--which may be permanent from what we know--we've added to reserve pressures and done some snugging without changing our borrowing target We've seen Treasury bills edge up toward the higher funds rate We've actually achieved that, I think, without having to change our borrowing target   Asymmetric language   Yes I don't think that's a problem given where the funds rate is   But if the weaker business news develops, I am not sure that we would want to stop it   It gives the right connotation   I think the markets are tuned in to this language   You can bet the currency markets will try and search for those levels  -56-    2/10-11/87   What is their postal rate?   If they are going to deflate, a zero rate [unintelligible]  [Secretary's Note A draft of proposed directive language, labeled ""Variant I for M1"" was circulated to the meeting participants at this point See Appendix]   That's why velocity is such a useful word It captures all those things   You could say ""In the context of many of the signs"" or something like that Or use a word that is all encompassing ""necessarily"" before the ""appropriate""   Accumulating signs, or many of the signs, or intensifying, or growing, signs   Well, you could say all these other things ""in the context of continuing economic--""   Oh yes, I'm sorry; that is already there   Or ""along with continued economic expansion""   But I have a big problem, too, with implying tightening just because the economy is expanding and none of the other things are occurring   No, it is overly reactive   Okay That would do   Don't stretch it too far If all these other things were happening, even if the economy weren't growing I wouldn't mind doing something about it   Then what you are saying is that there may be times when we want to deal with the psychology, if nothing else   Well, I think it's fair to say that if you could stabilize this interest differential that has created such a sensitivity and swings you would expect to see it run consistently I may be wrong, but under a stable differential I would guess that would be the thing more than anything else probably would be   Equilibrium could be a much lower rate of growth   They'll pay attention to the things that cause us to pull it off the shelf   We have had a run up in the price of assets--equity   It depends upon how much weight you put on market value   I'd be happy for us to carry on a campaign to allow [tax] credits for the dividends "
3156,1987-03-31," I would like to start this by nominating Chairman Volcker to be Chairman and President Corrigan to be Vice Chairman  SPEAKER(?) Second   I move the New York Bank as agent   Second   I move we adopt the minutes   Peter, you have advocated buying coupons in the past You said there was a possibility for an add need?   There has been some controversy over that issue in the past I just wondered if--   Like yesterday?   Well, that's what got kicked so hard yesterday   What's coming up, Peter, in terms of reserve needs? Do we have a seasonal draining or adding period?   That raises a point that I was asking about yesterday; I still haven't cleared it up quite in my head I got an answer, but I can't repeat it The staff's forecast for growth abroad was revised down by a significant amount, yet our GNP numbers haven't really changed I need a review of how we would make that up   But is that helping us on the trade side any more?   It's the speed of the depreciation that made a big difference in your mind?   [Unintelligible] the last comment I wonder if you have attempted to factor in this latest trade retaliatory measure that has been taken Is that going to have any effect, or do you have to make some assumptions about retaliation for--?   But you would expect some upward pressure?   I love this rationale, which is we [don't] want to put a tariff on the chips themselves because US producers buy those We will put it on the electronic equipment that's processed from those chips and [not] import it It's just unbelievable analysis   I think just about everything has been covered For my own benefit, I'll summarize my thoughts a bit I have heard from a lot of the Districts that things look better Production is picking up and employment looks a little better in the trade-related area and in some manufacturing I think the aggregate statistics reflect some of that and that is encouraging What concerns me a little is how much of this production that we are seeing is going into inventories How much of it is really meeting domestic consumption? There seems to be some circumstantial evidence of some involuntary inventory buildup It is more in the automobile area than anywhere else, but there are at least some signs of inventory pressure even in the non-auto area That may be just the rebuilding of stocks to more normal levels but given the low forecast that we have for domestic demand--which a lot of comments reflected around the room--you just wonder if all that production and greater optimism we are seeing are going to be permanent or if there will be a flash into inventories If so, there is some risk and a little concern as to whether this production activity is going to be continuing That bothers me a little, especially when we are marking down growth abroad and the potential for our export markets So, we may not be seeing the strength in the future from the export side that we had been expecting earlier  That is somewhat of a problem which brings me to the dilemma that I keep worrying about I think we all agree that the dollar is at levels where we wouldn't like to see it go particularly lower Having it go lower would make it counterproductive on the trade side as well as the inflation side at this point But I think the concern is should we get dragged down by trying to stabilize the dollar against some countries who are experiencing economic decline? I worry a bit about the overall macroeconomic effects of trying to stabilize the dollar against some weakening economy At the same time I am at a    3/31/87  loss for knowing what to do about it simply because I think there is a risk to our financial market stability, especially in the short run-- and maybe even for inflation in the long run--if we don't try and do something about the dollar It is a real predicament that we have to deal with and the protectionist sentiment that we are seeing surface is part of that problem now I just hope we don't have to get into a situation where we are defending the dollar because of a confidence problem associated with destabilizing exchange rates against currencies whose countries are showing continued decline That is a real risk; in my mind that seems to be the major problem and I just don't know exactly how we should deal with it   I think they are too high if interest rates pick up   Can I just comment on that? I think Jerry has a good point My only concern about it is that I think we might need discretion for something like that I would hate to see us make the fundamental move on monetary policy when I think [the move] even more clearly lies with the surplus countries So, I would only want to do that if we saw some tendency for them to let money market rates drift down so that we would get that interest rate differential we need To see the fundamentals change in the right way over there would seem to be the desirable feature   I agree with the statements that where the economy is headed is a little uncertain now So I don't think that we want to make any clear-cut moves in monetary policy That's why I support something like alternative B But I am concerned about some of the potential destabilizing activities that are going on in the financial markets So, even though I really wouldn't want a change in policy, I think that it may be necessary to at least reserve some potential discretion--or maybe the answer is to have the potential for a conference call--to deal with a situation that might require some uptick in the borrowing level I would reemphasize what I said before that my preference would be not to do anything like that, or at least to make our best effort to convince our trading partners who have these large surpluses to be less reluctant on their own domestic policy That's where I think the real problem lies more than it lies here I'd hate to see us dragged into their scenario by trying to defend the dollar when it's sinking against those currencies And that is a real risk But I think we have to deal with the destabilizing market activity There is a real threat of inflationary expectations surfacing if we let it get out of hand So there might be room for some discretion I'm not sure whether having the discretion to run the borrowings up to a certain level is the right approach We recently had some trouble figuring out what the relationship between borrowings and the interest rate spread is So, if we were to say something like a $500 million borrowing target, I'm not sure what funds rate would be necessary to produce that We might want to think more in terms of just adjusting the funds rate a little rather than trying to hit some borrowing level when we're not sure what funds rate it requires I don't know what that means exactly-- maybe a conference call or some sort of consultation The problem is that the developments that surface require quick action and I'm not sure there's always the time to sit around and have a conference call about it Maybe there's some room for some discretionary allowance there I think we ought to at least give this upcoming G-10 meeting a chance I hope we've got that much time without something happening in the exchange market to give us more of a problem, but--   Yes Hopefully we can maintain the current approach until after that meeting Anyway, that's the dilemma   As long as we don't spread the impression of seriously weakening the economy   I think the international situation only comes in to the extent that we see it affecting the domestic financial markets and inflationary pressures here That's where the feedback comes   Jerry makes a good point there; I'd rather build with some gradual changes in interest rates than have to force this with a big bang at some point  SPEAKER(?) I think it's axiomatic that there is some level of interest rates that would stabilize the exchange rate The problem is What level is it and what is the cost that goes with it?   That's probably about the best   How about something like this We would stick to the $300 million borrowing, but if conditions got disorderly we would let slide our reserve adding and that might spill over into a higher borrowings level We don't really know what that might be We would try to hit our $300 million on borrowing, but if we had to postpone--   It all depends on how the economy looks   If interest rates drift up we can expect to see those aggregates slow even more from what we're predicting   I mean from what we've been seeing   You are talking about final sales, which run about 1 percent in the forecast   Make it lower   Yes, I'd rather say more like $400 million, because of this problem with borrowings and the funds rate   Yes, ""might"" is the word   I agree with that to the extent that my concern about the dollar is its effect on the domestic economy I certainly wouldn't worry about it so much if I thought it was going to have a neutral effect on domestic inflation   No, I am just saying that in the long run it's got to have some feedback on the economy   I think we need to make it clear though   We don't give that impression because we do say that a growth rate similar to that is consistent with alternative C   What might clarify the M2/M3 issue is to say what we would normally expect for M2 and M3, assuming no change in reserves   Otherwise we may be assuming a change in reserve restraint If we put a number other than what we say is consistent with no change in reserve restraint we are assuming a change in reserve restraint   But that's not what the staff is projecting   We have a projection here for M2 and M3 under certain assumptions Assuming no change in reserve restraint, it's a certain amount; assuming differently it's a different amount And that's building in what already has happened to the aggregates   I am just saying I would be comfortable with changing those numbers if we said ""might"" or something--if we qualify it to say, assuming no change in reserve restraint, we would expect M2 and M3 to be 3 to 7 percent   All I am saying is that there is a projection consistent with a certain set of assumptions If you change those  -51-    3/31/87  assumptions you get different paths There is no doubt about it; if certain conditions arose I'd want to change the conditions affecting that   Under certain conditions   That's sort of extracting the midpoints That's a range of midpoints  SPEAKER(?) But we often do it   That's not true That's not what the staff says They have already built the March numbers into their projection   But then that means that you expand on either side of that uncertainty   Not if we had to restrain reserves   In this first sentence in the operational part of the directive we say maintain the existing degree of reserve pressure and we say there is a contingency there But if we are going to put in an M2 and M3 range consistent with that operational sentence, it should be what the staff has projected, what the statistical alternative would be We might follow that up with a sentence that says--   All I am saying is that we have these numbers in the directive that were [adopted] in the past and people could easily get the wrong impression   It might help to move that sentence up, like Bob said, to immediately after the first sentence on the aggregates    3/31/87   I think it's easier to assume that the aggregates would come in lower if the sentence on the aggregates is right after the first sentence and then we say ""Somewhat greater reserve restraint"" Obviously, somewhat greater reserve restraint means lower aggregates   Yes, I see what you are saying   I'd just say that we believe the staff projection [unintelligible]   4 percent is below what they project with no change in reserve restraint   It seems to me that if we are going to say ""this action is expected,"" we have to have some assumption that action is taken other than no change   I don't think there is a policy difference at all I certainly support more restraint, and I think you will get lower aggregates out of that restraint   Around 6 percent   Tell me what has happened in the meantime   I think that's true Of course, we haven't found M2 and M3 to be very interest sensitive They don't seem to be nearly as interest sensitive as M1 Maybe for M1, I would be   What's happening now is built into the projection of the staff, which is around 6 percent Now, unless you believe that it's going to continue this way--   I would say around 6 percent "
3173,1987-04-29," They didn't say it very loudly   Peter, what's happening in Treasury bills? Bill yields have been fairly stable to down Well, they did pick up a little, but they really stayed around the fairly low level And in many cases, bill yields were declining at the same time that bond yields were going up sharply I assume this has something to do with the Treasury paying down bills   Have they announced the refunding package today?   Have they cut back the long bond or not?   Okay "
3190,1987-05-19," I'll second   So moved   He said the last time we talked that they don't get excited there unless the unemployment rate rises He said it hasn't really gone up in the face of this weakening growth If it were to start to rise he would have more of a political problem Without it, will take the position he has   Do you think that's probably because borrowings have averaged about $700 million?   When borrowing actually turns out to be $600 or $700 million, I think they expect the policy to be there   I think we've got alternative C   Are we going around the table now? I wanted to ask Jim something before we did that   Okay The Board had a briefing yesterday on the Greenbook material I'm going to ask you to go through the points about employment and the full employment unemployment rate I think it's important that you try to reconcile again for everybody here this whole issue between industrial production and capacity and the unemployment numbers and work hours The statistics don't tell the same story And I've never gotten a really satisfactory explanation of which one makes the most sense   No, I just wanted that repeated because it is confusing in that we have a situation where the unemployment rate is projected to get down to very low levels and yet we're still at close to record levels of excess capacity and low industrial production I tend to believe the employment numbers a little more, but I don't know exactly how to reconcile them either I'm just saying that's a dilemma I think everybody ought to know about   Yes, I know; there's no doubt about that But given the way the forecast is shaped, we've got a situation where    5/19/87  there is low growth in the services area, which you already acknowledged, Bob, and a shift to trade-related, industrial-related, types of functions It's not showing up in the numbers even though we are feeling better about it Bob has just said he's feeling better about it, and I'm feeling better about it It's just not in the numbers And if there is going to be that re-composition, one would expect to see it in industrial production   Yes, I--   I must admit I am a little torn between which way things are going I don't have a clear view myself Obviously, the financial markets are indicating some inflationary expectations The question is--and it has certainly been the question here--whether we think they will be realized or not and whether we want to bet against the markets or whether we think something more needs to be done or has already been done  In terms of the Greenbook forecast, I agree with a lot of it except that one of the major factors feeding into the projection of rising inflation in 1988 in this forecast is further expectation of a weakening dollar Of course, that feeds right into import prices; so in the forecast you don't have a one-time adjustment in import prices that washes out over time You have a continuous feed-through of a decline in the exchange rate that is causing continued upward pressure on the inflation rate Now, if I really thought that was going to be the case, I would be a lot more concerned It may be possible, so I think that we need to concern ourselves with stabilizing the dollar at some point If I thought the dollar was going to deteriorate on a continuing basis, I would have some concern about the continued upward pressure on the inflation picture So, I would hope that we could achieve some conditions that would stabilize the dollar without a continuing deteriorating trend I think the question then is What does it take to do that? We now see some growing spreads in interest differentials between the United States and our other trading partners My own opinion is that, hopefully, we are getting to the point where the dollar is finding some legs under it and will have to stabilize I think the real question is whether we have done or are about to do enough in monetary policy to convince the markets that we are dealing with the inflationary risks in terms of the dollar and other domestic pressures on inflation As Peter Sternlight pointed out, borrowings--inadvertently or advertently--averaged $700 million over the last intermeeting period I am not sure whether we want to go further than that or whether I personally want to continue that sort of a borrowing assumption So I think the question is What does it take to stabilize these conditions? I don't want to overreact and deal with more than just what the inflationary risk is   You might point out that there is a special circumstance in it   Can I ask a question again? Alternative B is associated with $400 million in borrowing? Okay This is kind of confusing because, in some sense, ""C"" is actually a more modest borrowing level than we have been experiencing It is definitely below the average during this last intermeeting period I think the question is What would we expect to happen? Are we going to see a borrowing average of $600 million or what is it going to be? Are we going to try and truly target a $600 million borrowing level so that we are talking about a tightening of policy relative to the $400 million level that we sought? I guess that is what I am asking   Well, I don't think we truly sought $400 million I don't think that there is any doubt you can't go through an entire six-week intermeeting period with a $400 million target and hit $700 million and say you truly sought it I think we could easily have offset that; it wouldn't have been--   From $300 to $400 million; that is different from $300 to $700 million   I recognize the serious problem with the Treasury account at the Federal Reserve But as that continued and we could see that borrowings were going to run very high, we could have done more on the reserve side Given what was happening to the dollar, we shouldn't have But I am just saying when we are crossing over into something that is a change in policy, I would just like to clarify where that is At some point, going to $700 million borrowing  -26-    5/19/87  from $400 million or even $500 million seems to require something other than just saying--   I stand in the ""C"" category, mainly because I think that is basically no change in current policy operations I think that would be consistent with about a 6-3/4 percent funds rate, or something like that, maybe even less But I see two things that could be done with ""C"" that could involve both the adoption of a higher borrowings and a discount rate change, without a further move upward [in the funds rate] If we want to hold off on the discount rate, [saving it] as ammunition for a future event in terms of the announcement impact, we could go ahead and change the borrowing level to $600 million from the $400 million but have some sort of contingency where, if we decide a discount rate change is needed later, then we would lower the borrowing The discount rate change would be a substitute so that there is no additional pressure on the funds rate but we get the announcement effect of the discount rate So, it is not impossible to do both with the same policy I would support ""C"" assuming--and that is why I had the technical question earlier--that ""C"" represents basically current operating procedure, and I would add the option of the discount rate substituting for that at a lower level of borrowing at some point when we might want to use it I don't know what the possibilities are, but the Chairman made it clear that it is probably not very likely that we could work out some sort of coordinated move with Japan of Germany   Zero Yes, I think that is right My suggestion is that we go ahead and adjust the borrowing but then reserve the discount rate for a point when--maybe not this week but next week, or whenever, depending on developing events in the exchange market--that might be something that could be used So, to some extent, you get the dual effect of the announcement of the discount rate and the higher borrowing level within the same period without really having to make an adjustment That would be my preference I don't know what you would call that; I guess you would call that ""C"" with a variation   Yes, acute ""C""   Another question If we went for a discount rate change soon, and that was the policy, what borrowing would go with that?   Yes That is right Now that I think about it, it is in the Bluebook that way   My preference would be to emphasize the inflationary expectations issue I guess that is in variant I--it has the exchange rate mentioned in there but not as prominently as the indications of inflationary pressures   Okay   Say around 6 percent I don't care; I am not getting into this one again  -33-    5/19/87   I definitely think we should downplay that   No, I don't want to   You're going from a low base to a big April number and that is going to be--   You are still raising the base from which it has to--   It seems to me that this time there is no contingency; we are stating a change in policy ""Might"" and ""would"" are not necessary We just state what it is   As long as it is made clear that that is relative to what we sought   I do too I just think it should be made clear relative to what   No I think going from seeking $400 million to seeking $600 million is a pretty good change I agree from existing conditions it is not big; it shouldn't be noticeable in the funds market   We are tightening after the fact   That goes with ""C"" anyway   I am neutral; I don't care   I'm not against it   $600 million borrowing goes without a discount rate change; $400 million goes with a discount rate change   ""Given"" or ""in the light of""   Given what we are doing today, what would going immediately to $600 million look like in the market, in your opinion?   That is what I am asking You are saying $500 million What do people think we are putting in there? From what you said earlier, they think we are putting in something well above that   Yes So, I am just--   It seems to me that if we raise the discount rate and try to get to $400 million it would still seem like an easing of conditions in the open market  -41-    5/19/87   That is a good question Nobody knows anymore   I do have a request I agree with that completely But I do think that we have to get a better understanding of this borrowing/funds rate relationship I don't think it is acceptable that we continue on drifting, trying to figure out the relationship between borrowing and the funds rate if we are going to target borrowing as an approach to monetary policy If we don't have some better understanding of the underlying funds rate associated with that, we've got to change because--   If you don't understand it better   Well, neither do I   What I am suggesting is that we still don't know if the discount window is going to act in an erratic fashion relative to what our intended policy is I think that is an unacceptable degree of uncertainty It has been a lot tighter than that in the past   Well, I think there are times, obviously, when we are more sensitive to the funds rate It varies So, if we don't know what kind of funds rate is going to be associated with a certain amount of borrowing-- Am I right to say that that relationship has been much more stable in the past than it has been since the turn of the year?   Well, obviously, when there is special borrowing, you always--   The federal funds rate--   I am not sure I want to, but the relationship--   Okay, but there are studies--   There are obviously special borrowing [situations] that come up But, in the pattern of breaks that we have seen recently I don't think you can identify a special borrowing in each of those cases The staff's response was that the demand for borrowing had shifted That is something that I don't think we have a good understanding about   No   I don't want to waste too much--   I think there probably would still be a considerable debate at this table about which is more important to the conduct of monetary policy and which affects the economy more levels of interest rates or the quantity of reserves   I know  END OF MEETING     "
3213,1987-07-07," In discussions yesterday, the staff pointed out that for the second quarter we could get more negative current account numbers, which could have some effect on that sentiment I take it the oil-price situation has been driving a lot of the current account; it has been dominated by that Even though non-oil exports have been rising, the whole thing has been overwhelmed by oil volume, to some extent I take it the second quarter is going to produce a worsening current account balance number and that might add to some of the sentiment Is there any perception that--   I take it we're forecasting a worsening on the current account number?   Yes, but that's not that far away I'm just saying that September, assuming we're right, could be the period you're talking about, then Right now there is a good healthy two-way risk on the exchange rate, but I'm just saying that there might be some numbers in the future that hinge on that; I don't know If this is going to be an uneven path on the way to improvement, maybe the markets recognize that but maybe they don't   We're getting numbers next week?   As long as there's no major downside exchange rate risk that might be plenty   Yes   First, I want to say that I found this to be a really outstanding review of the issue and a very good report For our own purposes, it might be useful to go through this exercise every so often to re-address the issue and to feel comfortable with it I think it was very useful I don't have any major questions; the study pretty much explains a lot But a couple of things struck me as I read through this that I wanted to bring up today One is that I noticed, at least over the period I looked at, that there appeared to be an upward bias in actual borrowings relative to predicted This was only over about a 3-1/2 year period, I think--   Yes--relative to intended I wonder if you have a good feel for what might be causing that? I think the Chairman mentioned yesterday a very plausible explanation for certain periods obviously, when you get to very low frictional levels of borrowing-- when you're targeting something like $300 million or less--the bias is going to be on the upside because there's not a lot of downside opportunity But there's a positive bias that appears to occur over a long period Chart 2 summarizes the information, and it does tend to show that when targeted borrowing levels were fairly low, that's when a lot of positive bias occurred But I wonder if you went back over a longer period if you'd still see that positive bias and if it's related also to periods when targeted borrowings were very high   If you look at chart 2 you can see a positive bias there I just wonder what you sense there   Right And borrowings were averaging fairly low   Yes, I agree It just seems to me that that ought to be factored into the expected borrowings to some extent   It would be interesting to know that I have two other questions One major issue is this I realize that there's a standard error plus or minus--I'm talking about borrowings relative to the funds rate and the standard error you mentioned of about 60 basis points--that creates noise in the system If so, there's a certain amount of that noise that we have to accept; but that's plus or minus There's a difference between that and the long-term issue of when we detect some sort of shift I think the question arises there [unintelligible] policy shifts, that we're making a monetary policy adjustment whether we are doing anything or not And the question is If we detect a long-run shift in the borrowing function should we try and offset that in some way? Otherwise, we really accept a policy adjustment because nonborrowed reserves are going to be lower or higher   Well, yes, but nonborrowed reserves would be affected   Maybe borrowings wouldn't, but the nonborrowed path would be affected to some extent So I don't know--   My question is What do we do about it when we decide that there has been a long-run shift in the function or when there's a consensus that that has developed? I guess it's just something that ought to be brought before the FOMC, to acknowledge there's a shift and then--   Sure it has   Sometimes, though, we don't have enough information to decide whether it's just noise or real--   That's usually the case, yes The last question that I had was about seasonal borrowing It seems to me that there's always been a bit of a question about whether seasonal borrowing should be included and, if so, to what extent   But you're saying whether we include it or not, it's not really an important--    7/7/87   So you don't think that taking it out would have any effect on the standard error?   But I think we did say--   Yes   Well, that's what I was--   Well, maybe we should apply some adjustment factor to it to deal with just the seasonal element I don't know if that's possible; but if it is possible, we might be able to correct the seasonal borrowing for seasonal   Something like that I don't know if it's doable; I'm just saying it's worth thinking about   It's worth thinking about   Yes I know   I'm just saying that you might want to leave it in, but still make some adjustments to that number   Yes I don't want to send us off on some frivolous exercise; I'm just saying it might be worth thinking about if there's a way that you feel comfortable dealing with it   I guess the point is that even if we are, we still think of the funds rate as a check against the borrowings I know that from sitting in on the [daily] call Many times the funds rate is used as a check to gauge whether the reserve estimates are correct If the funds rate starts to move off from where we would have expected, given the reserve estimates, we seem to second guess our Treasury balance numbers and our excess reserve numbers and naturally assume that our reserve estimates are off because the funds rate is strange Therefore, the Desk tends to do more or less in the open market   Right   Yes, I agree And that's a short-term view versus a longer-term policy issue But I'm just saying that even if we were trying to target the funds rate, the question still remains Are we targeting the funds rate to affect the aggregates or reserves or are we just trying to stabilize the funds rate? In other words, we could target the funds rate at various levels over short periods that would affect the aggregates, and I think that's basically what we're doing, as one means of sort of trying to--   Yes  -13-    7/7/87   If you let the funds rate drift off somewhere, over the long run it's eventually going to affect the aggregates So you can't really look at one without the other   I think you're right   Ted, you said something about oil prices I thought you said something about rising oil demand so that we have potential upside risk on the price level But we have a very depressed level of world demand it seems; I'm wondering where the rise in oil demand would come from out of this whole picture   I also have are a comment on the interest rate picture and a word in terms of the deficit It's true that by your projection the deficit is not improving in '88 over '87, but you have about $300 or $400 billion more nominal GNP I think the deficit-to- GNP ratio declines by about 3 or 4 So you have a slackening of pressure there even with a constant number In addition to that, you're estimating the same degree of capital flows If I remember right, there is not a dramatic change in capital flows from abroad So, under your forecast there is going to be a still significant amount of foreign capital inflow [in relation] to the declining deficit-to-GNP ratio On the state and local front, Frank, your state and local numbers don't count the pension surpluses, which are very large So, I don't see in this scenario big interest rate pressures coming from the government side Now, if those capital inflows were really changing sharply you'd have a different picture But that's not the forecast And the deficit declines as a percent of GNP So, there seems to be an improvement on that side rather than a change in the other direction   Yes It's not dramatic but it's there It doesn't change at all in 1987 I don't think There is something in there--   Yes  -22-    7/7/87   Issue complete   I don't have too much to add The numbers I had in mind for 1987 and 1988, at least in terms of real and nominal GNP, and maybe even the deflator, probably are a little more optimistic Overall, the [Greenbook] GNP and deflator numbers are very close to what I had in mind Like Governor Heller, I had a slightly different view of the financial implications of that But there are so many ""ifs"" I really don't know the answer at all   Deflator number? I had 27 or 28 percent, something like that   Okay Well, maybe it is   All right Maybe I was thinking more on--   Yes Well, what does the staff have for the deflator?  MESSRS TRUMAN AND PRELL 3-3/4 percent   3-3/4 percent? I guess it is different But the main issue is that there are so many ""ifs"" I don't know where to start One story that's being told here that I think would alleviate some of the financial implications is that we're shifting resources into an area where there's a lot slack in the economy The whole trade area that we have growing here is one that has a large degree of slack We are shifting from a service base into trade-sensitive manufacturing areas where capacity utilization rates are extremely low I agree that there are some sectors that are doing quite well, like paper or others like that But basically, we're shifting resources out of the service area toward the trade-sensitive areas; and productivity has been high in those areas Employment growth has been very small, and whether employment demands will pick up in the area, I don't know But, given the utilization rates and the productivity rates consistent with those sectors, there's a good chance that they won't increase labor demand dramatically and that output will be satisfied otherwise If that's the case, we're [not] going to be seeing the kind of wage pressures that one might expect and we may not see a big reduction in the unemployment rate associated with the output growth that we're forecasting So, that's sort of my expectation; the direction things are shifting would tend to indicate  -29-    7/7/87  that the kind of pressures we might expect would not be as great That's just a notion; I don't really know   Well, I think just as--   I don't know the answer But if you just accept the principle--which I think we've all accepted up to this point--that the trade-sensitive sectors have been severely damaged by the changes in the trade imbalances, it seems to me that you have to accept that there's slack there in reversing it   Well, maybe it's not true that trade has been damaged   I'm just saying the total rate is around 79 percent and that's very low It seems to me that's got to be weighted toward the trade-sensitive sectors   One down, two to go   Let me ask One would have to look back at the February record, but I thought we had qualified our target by saying it was interest sensitive; we said something about the fact that if certain conditions developed, we might expect a more appropriate range to be-- Maybe I am wrong about that   I don't think I would change the range either I would leave it, mainly because I think it does imply some interest rate forecast If interest rates stay where they are then this target is probably appropriate And not knowing exactly what the course [of interest rates] is going to be at this point--that is more of a series of short-term policy decisions--I don't see any point   It seems to me that seeing the same target would leave the understanding that at the current level of interest rates we would get back to the target by the end of the year   That's the best guess   Yes, but that is your best guess   Well, it all depends If the implication is that we are just reducing the target to respond to interest rate levels in the past, that is one explanation If that is the explanation then I feel less uncomfortable about it But another plausible explanation is that you expect interest rates to rise in the future It would depend on which one of those we would use--   We expect an increase in velocity   I think some people would read through that   For 1988 I'd select alternative II I think it is important to continue to give the signal that we are adjusting the ranges to move toward price stability and I think that all of those  -37-    7/7/87  ranges are appropriate for what we expect for nominal GNP next year with some continued resistance against inflation   The only thing I would say is that I might favor just a 5 to 8 percent range on M2 instead of a full one point reduction to 4-1/2 to 7-1/2 percent I might be a little more comfortable with 5 to 8 percent rather than 4-1/2 to 7-1/2 percent   It all depends If you have stable interest rates next year, you've got--   Well, I don't know   Well, no I think the point, once again, is that we can't control precisely the mix of nominal GNP You have to have some idea of what kind of nominal it would allow for and hope that most of that growth shows up in real Most of the determination of the mix is structural   Good That's it, stable interest rates; it depends on what you say about it   No, that's not true No   It depends on your interest rate scenario   There are too many unknowns in this equation   You've got to make some assumptions We are making different assumptions   If interest rates rise as in the staff projection in the end, in January we'll build that into our M2 forecast for 1988 I don't think there is any doubt We are not saying that we wouldn't support the interest rate rise; it is just a matter of opinion about how the scenario is going to go   Once again, it depends upon your view of how this whole scenario develops If the growth is in the trade sensitive areas where there has been a lot of slack and the employment gains are not expected to be strong, then there might not be a reduction in the unemployment range consistent with 2-1/2 to 3 percent growth [in real GNP] I think that is a perfectly plausible scenario To remain competitive you want to maintain those productivity gains   It seems to me that what you want to say is given our modest tightening actions to deal with the inflationary pressures that have built up, interest rates have strengthened some; that has put some upward pressure on M2 velocity and M2 has weakened somewhat relative to the targets Assuming no further changes, I don't know what you say about future policy, but [unintelligible] it's still plausible I would want to say it is still plausible that we will reach the current target It is doable   I think that we can make that clear   It seems to me that we can say, assuming no change in current policy, that it is plausible that we could still come within the M2 target That is what the staff says   Okay, tolerate   What did we say at mid-term 1981 on M1? We were below targets then and we didn't hit the range by the end of the year   At least M3 is in the range   We could use similar language Is that why we didn't change the range on Ml?   Yes, that's what I--   I think that is fine We just need the explanation for why it dipped below, which is what happened in the past   Say ""at or near the bottom of the range""   You would have to have 2-1/2 percent velocity growth in M2, which would be the implication of rising interest rates That's what you would have to have to get the kind of splits you're talking about   Once again, to do that you have--   The only thing I can think of is that Senator Proxmire might react to that [by saying] Well you never really widened the range on M2 and M3 before; it was just M1 Now you are focusing on M2 and you are broadening the range on M2   If I were a Senator sitting on the Banking Committee, it would look to me like a gradual undermining of the Humphrey-Hawkins Act   I agree   That's what's inconsistent with alternative II  -55-    7/7/87   Well, that's 7-1/2; that's what it says   Yes   Still running--   ""Of 1986""   They're both going to be ""around""--   That's fine   The rest of that explanation sounds all right   What do you say to monetarists who have focused on M1A and tried to take out the highly sensitive interest component and still find a similar pattern--maybe even a more pronounced pattern--in M1 growth? I think you can still use the interest sensitivity argument, but it seems to me that it may come up in the hearing; there may be some focus on M1A Do you say take out the interest earning accounts and you've still got a pattern like--  -58-    7/7/87   Would you concentrate even further on compensating balances of corporations and their growing proportion of demand deposits?   I think it might be useful to say that because that would really take a lot of the wind out of that   Well, okay   I completely buy the staff study and--   Yes The only thing I can think of is that the monetarists would say that there's a lag and that to look at contemporaneous inflation and to adjust monetary policy is chasing the tail   Oh, I realize that, but I'm just saying that--   That's fine with me   All you need is that one sentence ""The issues involved in establishing a target range for M1 would be carefully reappraised""   There's a lot of uncertainty about the interest rate scenario that goes with these nominal GNP numbers   That's the same kind of range we were saying we had--   We have to have a target so we would-- Obviously, we wouldn't at all   That's what I get 7-1/2 to 10-1/2 percent  -63-    7/7/87   Say that again   Move toward price stability   I would prefer to have at least that sentence about why we're ratcheting the range down, saying-- "
3239,1987-08-18," In the absence of the Vice Chairman of the FOMC, I'll try to kick things off I think we need to begin, though, with nominations for the chairmanship of the FOMC And I'd like to nominate Mr Greenspan as Chairman of the FOMC   Are there any objections? [Laughter] Mr Chairman   I have one, Mr Chairman I was looking this morning at the Telerate A lot of the reasons given on the dollar's decline are that oil traded down yesterday and oil prices are dropping this morning in foreign markets And I wonder how much of an influence that is having on the exchange rate too; it seems to move in parallel fashion   Mr Chairman, I'd like to second that recommendation for the additional amount   Peter, on your concerns about September Are we anticipating, or is the Treasury anticipating, a cash balance problem?   The answer is, we want to be prepared if it does   I agree in general with what the Greenbook says and what I've heard about the outlook I do think it's picking up; it looks better and there is some growing upside risk However, I have a number of concerns that really cause me to question this view completely, and there are a few problems that I have with the Greenbook forecast, in particular So, I'm still uncertain, overall First, the growth that we see appears to be primarily due to the improvement in real net exports; export volume is causing the stimulus that we see right now And, if that is indeed the case--if most of the growth is coming in the external area rather than in domestic aggregate demand--you have to really ask yourself how much of the potential Phillips-curve type effects on pricing you can get from that kind of growth And that modest expansion in aggregate demand, I think, is being verified somewhat by the aggregates, as well as by other types of evidence for consumption You really have to ask how much inflation pressure can be produced by that type of a scenario When you look at the broader inflation indexes, the CPI, excluding energy, shows some pressure, but the PPI shows no influence outside the energy area As a matter of fact, it has been decelerating this year, ex-oil So you really don't see a broad buildup yet on the price side  -15-    8/18/87  The staff forecast has rising interest rates, and I think some of their policy assumptions are inconsistent with the forecast That rise in interest rates, at least if the aggregate models are correct, is going to produce a further weakening in the monetary aggregates Looking at a further weakening in the monetary aggregates, you have to ask yourself How much nominal GNP can you get out of those kinds of aggregate growth rates, and does the velocity number that is consistent with that make any sense at all to you? I don't think you can get too much from a rising interest rates scenario out of the aggregates to produce enough nominal GNP to produce a serious risk  The other point I have is on the movement of the dollar One problem I have on the dollar is what I pointed out yesterday in the Board meeting we really have had no net depreciation of the dollar this year Now, there's always the possibility, and I continue to worry about the downside risks on the dollar I know it has come off a little today; we've talked about some of the reasons But the fact of the matter is that there has been no net dollar depreciation this year and we're late into the year The forecast is contingent upon a 10 percent depreciation in '87 to produce the lagged effects on prices in '88 Of course, there are still four months of opportunity for that But you have to ask yourself, if you're not going to realize that kind of dollar depreciation this year, how are you going to get those lagged effects for '88? The other point is that if the oil price is expected to hover in the $18 range--and it's my feeling that the dollar is being influenced some by the oil price--an oil price in that range will keep the dollar high relative to the currencies of major industrial surplus countries like the mark and the yen And if the dollar stays stronger because the oil price hovers in the $18 range, how are we going to get the dollar depreciation? On all of these questions, I'm not saying that they can't be overcome, because I see the outlook picking up some, too But I really haven't resolved these questions in my mind and I think they are serious alternative issues to deal with So, given these problems, I don't think we have enough evidence to expect a big upward move   That's pretty awful   Sounds like a good case for early release   I guess I see some firming signals and, as I said, a little more upside risk than I did before But, a lot of the early warning signals--some of the financial market signals--are not showing us as strong a concern as they did at our last meeting So, I'm a little reluctant to see us stick our neck out too far I guess I'm somewhere around alternative B with asymmetric language to give us  -30-    8/18/87  the option of a potential tightening if we see firmer signs But, sort of like Wayne, I'm not sure I want to commit myself to anything on instinct; I've got to have a little more evidence When people read the minutes in six weeks, they'll look at what was going on when we made those decisions The thing that has happened since the last meeting is that the real economy is showing more firmness, but that's about all I see right now Maybe we'll be ready for a tightening move later, but for now I favor alternative B, with asymmetric language I am for deemphasizing the dollar a little because, as I said earlier, I see it somewhat influenced by the oil price; and I'm not sure that the declining oil price, which might send the dollar down, is something we should be worried about The dollar declined significantly, consistent with the decline in oil prices in 1986, and we saw inflationary expectations break in the face of that; we tried to resist the dollar's downward move; it certainly wouldn't have been a resistance against inflationary expectations I'd like to avoid that kind of a problem I think the dollar is still an important issue, but I think it depends on what's influencing it So, I would rather highlight inflationary expectations and just leave the dollar as a proxy for that   Yes, $500 million, with asymmetric language   I'd like to second what Jerry says   I agree with Wayne's point that it is likely that they could come in there I would want to change the whole language in terms of clarifying what we are saying if we go to 4 to 6 percent I would want to make clear that though we're assuming no change in policy, the aggregates may come in in the 4 to 6 percent range But that's not what it could imply So, I'd rather just leave it alone   Well, 5 to 6 percent may be okay   That has always been the range used in the past, just to convey within the reserve target--   That is going to lead to other [unintelligible] If it turns out to be an average number, you're going to have people low-balling it until it clears the average "
3264,1987-09-22," Peter, you mentioned the market being nervous I agree that there is still some of that, but I think we did achieve-- though I realize it hasn't been fantastic--some flattening in the yield curve out of the discount rate move Even though the long end went up to around 980 percent at one point, it has settled down around 960 percent; and we have seen a larger move on the short end of the market than we have on the long end, even though it has fluctuated   I wouldn't do that because [unintelligible] it could have been some fear of Fed tightening preceding it But I think the tone seems to be more inflation fears or psychology, or the dollar, and everything else, more than just-- I don't know how you sort all this out But still it does appear that there has been some flattening achieved   Second   I guess that was sort of what I was going to ask One other question I had in mind I'm not a big ""aggregates person"" but, in line with this whole issue of aggregate demand, it strikes me that this recent uptick in interest rates is going to have a further damping effect on the aggregates I think that is fine, but at some point, you have to ask how much aggregate demand is plausible in that scenario I think you are restraining it You have to come up with some fairly implausible velocity growth numbers to get aggregate demand outside of a range that would present a real breakout in overall aggregate demand It seems to me that we have it pretty well cornered here In the long run, you could have a couple of bad quarters under that scenario but, given these recent moves in interest rates, what are we projecting on the broader monetary aggregates?   You have about 4 percent  -12-    9/22/87   Why would it pick up with higher interest rates?   That's sort of what I'm getting at You have it cornered a little, it seems to me   What has the regional inflation rate been doing in New England?   But overall, I mean the broader--   The Boston CPI?   Well, I agree with most of the discussion on the economy It has been covered pretty well I do think the economy has clearly picked up strength, and there is very little downside [risk] in the economy now It is clearly in an expansion phase at a higher level than it was on before, but there's still an outstanding question--we've already discussed this and Mike went over it very well--as to how much of this is production-generated by the external economy and inventory building versus an overall expansion in aggregate demand I think that is the key to what we would have to do on the monetary policy side As I said earlier, I think that a lot of this seems to be trade-related Some of it is not I think there has been a buildup in inflationary expectations I am fairly pleased at the moves we have taken; I think they were proper and should have the effect of eventually moderating aggregate demand to a level consistent with the forecast Now, we are hedging against the plausibility of what kind of velocity number you could expect to go with those aggregates Like I say, I think we are close to having the thing cornered The lags are long; we may have to go through a few quarters of some pressure before we see the other side of that But, I don't see a lot of room for nominal GNP under the kind of monetary policy we have now The numbers don't seem to add up, except for maybe a couple of exceptional quarters, in the short run A couple of other points I think are interesting in spite of our concerns about the trade situation and the deficit--and I agree those are the major fundamental concerns--we seem to pass over those large deficit items I think that's because we are concerned more about the longer run; but we pass over the really tremendous improvement in the budget deficit this fiscal year over the last fiscal year, without a dime's improvement in the current account The amount of pressure that has been taken off has to be relatively substantial We have gotten no real reduction in the current account and a $60 billion dollar reduction in the federal budget deficit That has to be an important factor Now, whether that continues is another matter I think that is the question But, if anything, we have relieved pressures on the capital import side Maybe we are making up that difference on the domestic growth side and  -29-    9/22/87  the demands of government are shifting more toward the private sector But we have seen the dollar come down and we probably have seen net capital outflows  In terms of the question of long-term interest rates, I tend to think that what has happened is mostly inflationary expectations I think long rates have gone up primarily due to that My personal opinion is they probably overshot, and eventually things will settle back down a little in the market As I said, the flattening of the yield curve from our discount rate change was somewhat comforting; even though we didn't actually see a decline in long rates, we did see a flattening I don't see anything out there that would push up the real rate dramatically I think some of that inflationary expectation--I really don't know how much--is sort of a risk premium, but that could be put in the inflation expectations category I don't see anything that shocked the cost of capital that would, in a way, raise the real interest rate In other words, I don't see anything that has improved real returns on capital investment dramatically If anything, the repeal of the investment tax credit in the tax bill has reduced returns on equipment; and there probably has been an improvement in terms of inventories because of the lower corporate rate; but, overall, I don't see any big shock to the cost of capital So, I think it is mainly inflationary expectations and, hopefully, it will run off over time   I am sort of caught between the $500 and $600 million, but I am basically comfortable with alternative B with symmetric language I had thought about $500 million with a tilt toward tightening for the same reasons that Bob Forrestal mentioned; there is something in that, too But I don't feel strongly either way I would appeal to Peter, though, that in maintaining $600 borrowing--which I think is fine--we ought to do that as smoothly as possible, and not give any obvious signals that might confuse the market into thinking that this is a tightening move It is going to be perceived that way by some anyway, but I think that we ought to try to do it in as smooth a fashion as possible   Yes, it's in there   It's ""would"" either way   It says respectively, but you would take--   Yes   You want to say 4 to 6 percent for the M2?   This is what would have been consistent with $600 million borrowings, even before, I think   4 to 8   Well, Peter's skills will take care of that  SPEAKER(?) Good "
3280,1987-10-20," I agree with Peter on that I think that one of the problems we may run into, and we've already seen it, is a strong unwillingness to borrow And trying to force the borrowing target in that environment could result in an unbelievable funds rate So, I agree with Peter; he needs the flexibility, at least for a while, to manage that situation We just don't know what we're up against, at least for a while, in this kind of situation   I agree with what Jerry said When you really don't know where you're going to be, you might as well assume the same situation until you reassess at some point I think that's where we are "
3294,1987-11-03," I think they are more concerned about that than the dollar exchange rate They pretty much got all their trading partners pinned down in the EMS, and I think that's about all they care about If the EMS were to break up, you would see them concerned   Why don't they do something about it?   I'm just saying that's their responsibility rather than ours   At this stage, really, the perception in the markets, given the new world we are in, trying to defend the dollar with higher interest rates here--I think that's where you would see a tailspin   That's exactly what I mean There are a lot of things new here; there are a lot of changes in expectations We really don't know We are on uncharted waters   Maybe I'm off in the bushes somewhere, but I think it's clear to the market that the risk on the dollar today is mainly being caused by foreign central banks who are resisting the kinds of pressures on their markets and are forcing the dollar down For us to try and deal with that situation here would be catastrophic   Peter, my interpretation of what has gone on in the bond market lately is simply that it was just some backing off from some of the flight to quality When things were extremely sensitive and unstable, we had a lot of movement in the Treasury securities on the long and the short end--maybe a little more on the short end, but a lot all over the yield curve And I think as the stock market has shown some stability over the last several days, we probably have seen less pessimism there, and probably some movement back out of the quality assets--I don't know if back into the stock market, but maybe into other types of instruments I don't know what your reading is, but if that really is going on, it seems to me that maybe those excess reserves will start to wind down a little My guess is that quality spreads look a little better than they did before; maybe not, but that's my impression   I really don't have much to add but I'll put in my two cents' worth I basically agree with Ed Boehne's view about the domestic economy that it's too early to tell what the effect is going to be of all this We really don't have any serious data at  -24-    11/3/87  this point to evaluate the situation I think we are probably not going get data that we are going to feel confident about, in terms of being symptomatic of the effects of this, until a couple of weeks, maybe Retail sales data are three weeks away; we may have some early car sales data and things like that but the orders impact of this is down the road There's a lot of information that still is not available; the only thing we really have at this point is some of the sentiment indexes So, we don't know how to read the overall impact, although I agree with Ed that it's hard to imagine sentiment improving as a result of this I think it's pretty clear that there is an additional air of pessimism about the outlook that didn't exist before and that expectations definitely have changed What effect that's going to have is difficult to tell  If you look right now at the fundamentals in the economy, they do look good; I agree with Bob's point on that Things are adjusting fairly nicely in the way that we expected and in the way the staff had described in the forecast We are seeing a transition, I think, from domestic aggregate demand to more externally generated growth I think that is positive and it still seems to be continuing One of the things I worry about now--after the fact, with this change in the financial markets--is that that export-led growth may come under some pressure Even though the dollar is obviously weaker, it is going to improve, I think In that relative sense, other problems are going to [damp] the prospects for export-led growth One of the issues in the financial markets is that foreign stock markets around the world actually have fallen more than the US market In percentage terms, they have all come down by more than the New York Stock Exchange composite So, the stock market impact abroad is greater than it is here What that means is really not clear But combine that with [these other developments] the fact that interest rates in those countries are relatively higher because of the fall in interest rates here recently and the not very large adjustment in interest rates abroad; the fact that their currencies are appreciating, and therefore, damping their ability to export; and the fact that if income is going to be falling here, we are going to be demanding less in terms of imports from those countries So, not only is there going to be an income effect on them, there is going to be a substitution effect And I think the question is How strong are those economies going to be? And how strong is our external performance going to be under those conditions? I don't really know; I just think there are big uncertainties And I agree with what Jerry said we need some flexibility at this stage, but it's really too early to tell what is going to happen We need to maintain our flexibility, but we need to face the reality that the world has changed Sentiment and expectations are different, both in real growth and in inflation; and I think we have to acknowledge that   Just take whatever borrowing is consistent   That's what ""B"" says   What did Bob say? Did he say just take out that other sentence, or what did he mean?   By a variant of ""B"", did you mean the revised version of ""B""?   Okay, that's what ""B"" means from now on, right?   Yes, I think I'm right in line with everyone else alternative ""B"" as we have defined it, Variant I, Corrigan language, and asymmetric I think we are going to have a bit of a problem if during this intermeeting period we finally decide that we can move to a borrowing target Making a transition from funds rate targeting to that could be a little touchy, even though we don't know when we will decide all of a sudden that things are stable enough to go from a 6-3/4 percent center of gravity on the funds rate to a $400 million borrowing target, or whatever I don't think it's going to work that smoothly We may need to think about how we make that transition at some point; that might be a good time for a call  - I'm totally indifferent, but you might even drop the whole sentence    Yes, I'll just be agnostic   Somewhat lesser "
3317,1987-12-15," Yes, I agree with Bob on that Borrowings actually have declined under the same spread, or even a wider spread for a while   Just a technical question Based on the research, which has a larger variance in normal times--borrowed reserves or the funds rate?   Well, assuming that we're targeting borrowed reserves, is there more noise around borrowed reserves or the funds rate?   I know that, but I mean in terms of the percentage variation or standard error   I'm trying to think of some way to normalize it and I can't; I'm thinking apples and oranges but I'm just simply--   If we are trying to hit a borrowings target, I'm just asking whether we get as much variation around that target as we get around the funds rate that results out of that borrowings target I don't know whether there is any information there, but I still think it might be interesting to know   I don't know how you compare the two, but it sounds like similar magnitudes of variations   The funds rate? I guess what I'm saying is that if you could hit your borrowings exactly, it's really a loose way of targeting the funds rate There's only a certain band in which the funds rate is going to vary under a borrowings target And I guess the question is Can you pursue the same goals by a lot of adjustments in the funds rate versus a few adjustments in the borrowings target?   Well, the political risks are fairly--   It assumes you know a lot about money demand   No, my view would be that you'd only want to do that if you had the flexibility to adjust it very often in a way that met your larger goals I think the problem before was that the interest rate got so politicized that the Federal Reserve didn't really feel it had a political--   But I think that's true of the funds rate under the borrowing target Once the market knows the borrowing target, the funds rate is going to move in a narrow range It's only when you miss that borrowing target that you get a lot of variation in the funds rate   If you set a borrowing target, your ability to hit it depends on how good your estimates of other reserves are; if your other reserve estimates are off, then you're going to get a lot of variation in the funds rate, which is going to affect your borrowing and throw your borrowing off   Well, that's right, it can be off One of the vulnerabilities to targeting borrowed reserves is that you have to estimate so many things in order to decide what your open market operation should be for the day So you use the funds rate as information that your reserve estimates may be a little off   Yes, you can do it either way   Well, to even consider getting back to targeting borrowing, which I think is just as good an approach as targeting the funds rate, you have to have a predictable relationship    12/15-16/87  between borrowings and the funds rate You don't have that now You can't take any given spread right now and predict the level of borrowing that is going to result   Well, let's ask the experts   Not from what I've seen   That's right   I agree with that That's why I'm saying that, with all these instabilities, we probably need to continue to focus on the funds rate for a while until we feel more satisfied that we are back to normal I favor going back to a borrowed reserve target when we feel more confident about the relationship between the funds rate and the discount rate spread and borrowings But I just don't see any  -10-    12/15-16/87  evidence that we are there, and it certainly seems to me that we are not going to get any closer to it between now and the end of the year   What would you try to do as a first step? Would you try to take current borrowings and the result from the current funds rate-discount rate spread and try to target that unless something really changes dramatically? Or what?   I guess I'd worry that what Bob Parry is saying is right--that everybody has gone to the CD market to lock up their funds and that all of a sudden, if there is no willingness whatsoever to borrow toward the year-end, we could get extreme funds rate pressures out of that scenario   Yes, that's right   We don't really know We could see the funds rate collapse at year-end just as easily as we could see it soar   It seems to me that we are arguing about pretty trivial issues If you take a borrowing target and the possible variations of the funds rate around that--I don't know, maybe Don can help me--except in very extreme circumstances, where we grossly miss reserve estimates or something, there can't be much variation of the funds rate around that borrowing target   Yes Don has quoted you the standard error 20 basis points   Yes, but I'm just saying we're talking about angels on the head of a pin here   I understand what you said, but the only question I have is If there is a seasonal component to seasonal borrowing of any sort, why have it in there? If it has no effect whatsoever on the variation, what is the point of having it in there unless it's just more confusing or more complicated at this stage to pull it out?   To me, that implies that you have decided that there is more of that [interest-sensitive] component to it than there is seasonal   If there is more of a seasonal nature to seasonal borrowing, it seems to me that you'd want to leave it out just because it's seasonal   There's a large seasonal component and whether it has any effect on the--   Okay, I buy it I think a good argument for not taking it out is that it might be confusing to Fed watchers who  -17-    12/15-16/87  have gotten used to it being done this way But that's the only argument I can think of for not taking it out   Another vote for funds rate targeting!   One last trivial comment I agree that this is not the time to make a change, but is it too complicated to try to separate out the adjustment versus the seasonal component of seasonal borrowing?   Oh, that's what you--   Okay   You used the wealth variable in your demand equations too, right?   What wealth variable did you use? What was the one without the stock market?   What kind of coefficient is on that?   I see But, it had--   I'd like to comment on that   I think that's right [It would be desirable] to have a sense of credibility that we could set a target and hit it consistently But the problem is that I don't think the base velocity has done much better than the velocity of other aggregates So, if we consistently hit a target set on the base, we certainly would have credibility in hitting the target, but would that credibility extend to economic performance? There is still the question of where to set the target, and whether or not the target is accurately set relative to what we want to achieve in terms of the desired results for the economy And I think there is still a big problem with a base target from that point of view   Well, one of the problems is that the base is so dominated by currency; it's two-thirds of the base We have a period right now where there's a big surge in currency; and to hit a base target, even with some variation [allowed], we probably would have to drain a substantial amount of reserves   Yes   Would you believe it? I heard something on the radio that's just incredible that samples of currency were taken and 9 out of 10 of them had traces of cocaine on them   Yes Did you hear that report? It's just incredible that you can find significant traces of cocaine on 90 percent of the currency   You can argue that they hated it being a miss   It's the same problem base velocity and monetary velocity itself   But it's the same problem If you don't know how velocities behave, you still can't hit nominal GNP You have the same problem   Some are better than--   Isn't it true, Sam, that the dollar did not appreciate against those currencies very much?   Nobody really knows which way this is going but currently there is some downward [movement] in oil prices How is that likely to affect the currency markets? Last year it seemed to have put downward pressure on the dollar relative to the deutschemark and the yen, and some downward pressure on the pound sterling, too I don't know if you have any idea about that, given these low levels, but--   How is it affecting the pound?   Up until that oil price change, the pound had pretty strong upward momentum and they were really fighting to hold it down   That's not true Wayne Earlier, when the funds rate fell below the 6-3/4 percent level, we put off reserve add needs, giving a strong signal that we didn't want it lower either   But Wayne, what is policy? Policy was the funds rate range around 6-3/4 to 6-7/8 percent, not a borrowings target   Well, I think [unintelligible] postponed   Float?   Just what I said before When funds were on the weak side earlier, we postponed an add need, and that was a signal in the markets that we didn't desire funds trading below 6-3/4 percent   Wait! I think you have to ask yourself what the policy is What's the basis for adding or subtracting reserves under these conditions? The policy is to maintain the funds rate around 6-3/4 to 6-7/8 percent There's not any other independent factor deciding whether we have an add need or a subtraction need So with the funds rate trading at 6-3/4 percent, why would you? There is no add or subtracting need   I have a follow-up on that particular question My understanding is that you have a funds rate change in there of about that magnitude Is that right?   What would the forecast look like assuming no change in the funds rate?   Yes I was looking at your linkage model estimates and I guess I would have the same sort of assumptions Those estimates are -6 percent for the first quarter, and that's a downward revision since the last estimate, since supposedly it incorporates trade and retail sales numbers But I notice it has a standard error of about 3 percentage points around it, which means it could be anywhere from -3-1/2 to +2-1/2 percent, I guess; but the center of gravity is on the negative side I was just wondering what kind of discretionary factors you have added to that to bring it up to where you are   They have revised down and you revised up and that's why--   The linkage model forecast   Sure   All right On the housing numbers, I notice permits are still trending down I realize there's not much of a correlation, but do you read anything into the fact that permits continue to trend down versus starts?   It was down 07   Right   I agree with a lot of the comments I'm picking up the same thing that the export side of things is very strong You don't hear anyone complaining about orders coming in and their ability to compete at these exchange rates and the activity of their businesses at this stage, so I think that on the production side things do look very solid at the moment What's starting to trouble me a little though--and maybe I'm smoking something because I seem to be a bit out of sync with some of the other views--is certainly not on the production side right now but on the sales end of things We got revisions on October and September retail sales, which were down considerably and down relative to the Greenbook, if I remember right We have revised down the retail sales figures even [for the period] before the stock market crash; our view of domestic demand is weaker going into the stock market crash than in fact we thought before, relative to the forecast Now, I agree with everyone else I haven't seen the impacts of the stock market decline on consumption at this point Retail sales were actually up modestly in November; automobile sales seem to be holding up, although that's mainly an incentive issue But we haven't seen a really severe hit to domestic consumption since the stock market crash What I'm worried about a little is that we may not quite be seeing it yet but, given the fact that sales are running below what we anticipated them to be before the stock market crash, there's a little more downside risk, in my mind I think some circumstantial evidence is that we have seen weak credit demands in November How you translate that, I don't know; but it's the first time in a while that we actually have had a decline in overall credit demands for the month of November  I don't place a lot of emphasis on the aggregates but the fact that we are now projecting an actual decline in M1 growth in December, when we were hoping for an increase, is a little bothersome I can't really explain it and I don't want to have just a knee-jerk reaction, but it bothers me that I can't rationalize it either So I think there is some near-term risk, but I agree overall with the longer-run view that we have to see consumption run lower than we have in the past to get the adjustment we need I think the external adjustment is taking place; exports look very strong, and even adjusting out oil imports, non-oil imports don't look bad at all But my concern is that things don't sneak up on us on the domestic demand side--that while we are expecting slow domestic demand and we are sort of looking the other way, the numbers go down sharply I don't want to get caught in that side of things We do have to resist a strong expansion in domestic demand or we have to have a very conservative expansion in that area or maybe even almost flat; but that's different from a sharp decline But, once again, I don't see the sales numbers sharply weaker since the stock market crash I'm worried more that we went into that on the weaker side than we thought That's sort of where I am on the adjustment process What I'm worried about, though, is that if we end up with a sharp downward reduction in consumption as the adjustment mechanism, we're just simply going to replace private sector demands for financing with public sector demands for financing, because we are going to see a huge swelling in the budget deficit I'm not sure that our needs for foreign capital flows are going to  -65-    12/15-16/87  improve under that adjustment process at all, substituting government financing needs for private financing needs And the interest rate implications of dependence on foreign sources of capital flows are pretty scary   How was it done last time? We went to a funds target last time   Yes, I agree I didn't think we--   Symmetric or asymmetric language with that did you say?   No tilt, I'm sorry   I would choose alternative ""A"", I think, if I weren't somewhat concerned about the potential effect on the exchange rate and the fragility of the financial markets right now I still lean that way, but I guess I would be happy with something like alternative ""B"", with asymmetric language toward ease if events unfold in support of that Like Frank Morris, I would prefer current operating procedures in terms of emphasizing the funds rate So, I'd support alternative (1) until we see a stable relationship develop Once we see that, I'm for going back to our old procedures In other words, I'd stay with (1) and, when we are sure that we are back to a traditional relationship, go to (4) So, I'm at alternative ""B"", with the 6-3/4 - 6-7/8 percent range on the funds rate, and asymmetric language I have no real borrowing number because I don't see how we can decide on that   If we make it into what?   No, Jerry's talking about fiscal policy   You say unfunded liabilities I agree that they are unfunded to the extent that they're financing the deficit for consumption purposes They're not unfunded if they're private sector investments; they are funded   If there's a rate of return included in the interest rate it's not unfunded   There's not enough time   I so move "
3337,1988-01-05," I think the statement is fine I like the idea As you know from the last FOMC [meeting], my concern was that trying to ease into a borrowing target didn't seem to make a lot of sense to me Why wouldn't we just continue to pursue the same spread we had, and see if borrowings normalize, rather than try to hit a borrowing number we're not sure about? I think that sentence better characterizes that concern   No, he said the rest of the period   Well, the target is $300 million "
3354,1988-02-09," Did you need them?   I've been sitting here, choosing to be last because I feel sort of jet lagged I just got back--well, Jerry did too, and he was very articulate, so--   Yes, you did get a little earlier flight So, I'm not sure I can really get into some of the detail I don't think I need to, because I think all sides of the issue have been discussed I think the forecast is a perfectly plausible scenario, and I think it's well done and carefully detailed But, as with any forecast, its problem is that it's just a forecast and who knows what's going to happen six months to a year out My general feeling is that the fundamentals are basically good You don't see the kind of forces at work right now, it seems to me, that would lead to the kind of classic inventory correction that some people get hysterical about I agree with Bob Parry that you just don't see the kind of price pressures out of whack at this stage that would lead to some serious continuing deterioration But at the same time, I think you also have to look at the evidence that's before you and get the best reading you can from it After listening to all this, what I worry about a little I guess, is that we're going to work ourselves into some sort of macho chest beating--that we've got to hang tough through this--and ignore some of the conditions that seem to be developing I think a lot of what we are seeing has to do with the psychology that develops I agree with what Bob Heller says, that you may get what looks like a temporary inventory correction underway, but if a very negative psychology builds on top of that it can continue, and who knows what will happen I just don't want us to be asleep at the switch Our short-term function is to try and make sure that we keep things on track I agree with what Jerry said--there has to be an external adjustment to get that [outcome] and we can't let aggregate demand surge on us and waylay the trend that is developing now But at the same time, we can't afford a plunge in real spending I think our whole scenario hangs very fragilely on the saving rate/consumption issue and how real income develops So there is a lot of risk to this scenario If we are not asleep at the switch, I think chances are we will get on the other side of this inventory situation, and the fundamentals will remain good, and we can keep things going at a modest rate without inflationary pressures I agree with what Jerry said--that the long- run view has to be oriented towards keeping our eye on the inflation situation I think in the long run that's always the case, especially when the expansion is this mature I don't want us to fall asleep here   Have you actually tried to project the aggregates off of the Greenbook forecast--just to see what it looks like with respect to those ranges?   Okay, that's where those ranges come from   Looking at the forecast, you sort of have a U- shape in interest rates and you'd think you'd get almost a mirror image in the aggregates   And so it almost looks like a nonlinear target we have to accommodate that--   True   So the ranges would accommodate these?   You're right   Gary, are you assuming a stable demand for money? I mean, you have some assumption   But what you're saying is that the uncertainty is symmetric around zero velocity   I don't feel that strongly about any of these particular ranges I feel a little like Roger Guffey and others who have spoken on this issue However, I think there are signal issues, credibility points, that have to be made I do think, if we're going to be credible on our view of the long-term inflation picture, that through the midpoint of whatever range we establish for M2--I say M2 because I prefer not setting a monitoring range for M1, given my view that it has too many problems--we have to demonstrate that we are moving towards price stability, or a nominal GNP that's consistent with price stability So I am in favor of continually ratcheting down that midpoint It seems to me that the fact that we even establish a range means that we are trying to embody the uncertainties, in terms of all the things that can affect the aggregate; otherwise, we'd just have a line And so the ranges have to be somewhat credible to encompass what we think are the uncertainties And if we fall outside those ranges, it means that we weren't even certain about the uncertainties And that creates some problems My own personal view is that to encompass all the uncertainties we have to have a range that's wider than any that are here And I think that gives us a political credibility problem, to some extent, in their presentation I'm not really against the narrow range, even though I don't think it embodies all the uncertainties that we could face We would look kind of silly announcing a range that admitted the uncertainty that I think we are really faced with So I guess I don't really mind whether we have alternative II or alternative III; I'm sort of indifferent [between the two] I guess if I were going to be honest with myself, alternative II would be a little better; it allows a wider range and ratchets down the middle from last year But I'm comfortable with alternative III; I wouldn't resist that  On the basing issue, there are some implications from the base I think Governor Heller and Governor Angell made some important points But I think all of this can be handled in the language of the testimony and how we present this If we don't handle it carefully, we could give the message that the short-term implication of our target range setting is a tightening of policy That could conflict with what we might be trying to do in the short run and create some  -41-    2/9-10/88  confusion So, it seems to me that if we're going to go with alternative III, we have to be very careful about how we explain it when the Chairman testifies on this, because there could be some confusion about what we're actually doing in the short term and what this target might imply So I think the basing issue is important I think what Governors Heller and Angell pointed out is that we could take care of some of those concerns by rebasing I think you could also take care of those concerns with the right kind of language in the presentation I don't really have any strong preference for either, as long as we take care of it I think probably it's better to handle it in the language rather than to try and explain a rebasing--although I have some sentiment for maybe trying to normalize those last two months of the fourth quarter, November and December, which none of us can explain very well, and building the base off of some more normalized trend pattern in the fourth quarter rather than letting those last two months so affect the average But I don't feel that strongly; we can easily explain that in the presentation I think one way that you do that is by these tunnels that are built around the cone at the beginning of the year You've got these dotted lines that look like parallel lines building off of the cone, so that we are even saying we are not taking the Kohn cone too seriously at the beginning of the year--that's why we have these parallel lines because there can be some variation early I guess that can all be fit into the language And as long as we do that, I'm comfortable   Right   You mean you've had a lot of coffee this morning   Part of that was because borrowing was averaging about $150 million, as Peter said It was hard for it to show through   It was well acknowledged that there was a wire problem, wasn't it? I saw a couple of reports about a wire problem  -47-    2/9-10/88   Because the funds rate actually got down to 4 percent   You didn't? I thought there were references but I'm--   You hit on the key point, Jerry, which is errors and slippage--and that's what causes the variations  -48-    2/9-10/88   Well, you can overcome those things; it depends on what your objective is   Yes, I think you could reduce the range substantially   Well, it depends on what your objective is If your objective is a borrowing number--   Well,--   Oh, there's no doubt that that range could be reduced substantially   It just depends on--   Let me ask Are we just concentrating on the short-term issue or are we going to try to combine the whole thing at this point in the comments?   My view is that we have to be very careful in terms of the short-term direction of policy It's clear to me, having just come back from the BIS meeting, that the international situation would be too sensitive to [want to] trigger a discount rate reduction I think there's a much larger international implication from a move like that--not to say that forces which might require such a move might not develop over the next few weeks, if things looked more serious than what we anticipate I think under more serious economic conditions the international community could probably absorb something like that But right now we certainly don't have enough information, I think, to imply that I think also that we have to be sensitive to the international situation when we consider the short-term course of policy  So, my views, in terms of open market operations in the short run, don't imply a move on the discount rate unless some future developments point towards more weakening But when I say that, I still think that some slight tone of easing is necessary But I think that can be done without creating the expectation of a discount rate reduction, mainly because I think that the markets perceive that we are sensitive to the international situation and that we have been sensitive to the dollar And as a matter of fact, I've already seen a number of reports indicating that the Fed would not be likely to trigger a discount rate reduction because of international considerations And I think that's sort of the right tone in the market At the same time, it seems to me the market already has absorbed quite well--as the Chairman and others have pointed out--some expectations of a modest easing What they've actually absorbed is not totally clear yet, because there's still a bit of uncertainty as to where we are  But I guess my preference is somewhere in between ""B"" and ""A"", although closer to ""B"" What I'm thinking is that I would prefer something centered around a policy consistent with a 6-1/2 percent funds rate, maybe even a hint lower than that Alternative B is  -55-    2/9-10/88  associated with $250 million of borrowing; I guess I could accept $200 million of borrowing as something consistent with my view, although I'm not very confident in the borrowing number as projecting what I want I could accept the $200 million number, given that Don has described open market operations in the Bluebook as somewhat sensitive between the borrowing number and money market conditions, and that seems appropriate to me So, I guess that's where I come out on the short run--trying to avoid the implication of a discount rate reduction, although it may not be totally possible to do that Given a move like I'm suggesting, which is only just a slight move away from where we already are, I'm not even sure the markets would know the difference from where we already are and what I'm suggesting, because things haven't totally settled So I would go with something like a $200 million borrowing number, which is a tad below what is described as ""B"", with the kind of language on operations that Don implied in the Bluebook  In terms of the long run, as I said, I really don't have much of a preference between alternative II and alternative III, mainly because they're both centered on about the same point But alternative II has a slightly wider range associated with it, which is a little more consistent with my view about the uncertainties in terms of an M2 target I guess somebody else mentioned 4 to 8 percent instead of 5 to 8 percent, which is in alternative II, and that gets even closer to what I think is the right answer So I guess my preference would be something like a 4 to 8 percent M2 target range and a $200 million borrowing number And I think that somehow satisfies my concerns about the short term and the long term   Can I ask a question about what you said in talking about going more strictly to the borrowing number? I just want to ask Peter My understanding is that for the last few weeks borrowing has been averaging about $150 million; and I think the implication of what you're saying is that a continuation of that trend definitely implies a much higher funds rate, even in current conditions I don't know if you want to clarify that   Well, you may be right All it may mean is a big spike on the settlement date, Wednesday But it still implies a significant funds rate spike on or around the settlement day; and the maintenance period average would be considerably above what we are used to Maybe that wouldn't disrupt the market, but it will certainly change the tone of things   Don's language sort of says $250 million but with some room to adjust according to money market conditions So--   Even if it means a lower funds rate, at some point, than what you're saying, 6-3/8 percent?   Yes--   Mr Chairman, may I say one little word on this?   I sympathize completely with what Governor Angell is saying, although somehow I don't feel I've won But I do agree this has to get resolved We can't go on arguing over what operational policy ought to be It has to get clarified and then once it's clarified, I'm totally satisfied joining whatever team that turns out to be; I'll work within those rules But right now we are in a confusing period It's one of those times when I'm not sure it's clear But it has to be clear at some point   That's fine   Maintain the slightly--   I disagree with that If you vote on the funds rate why would you ever have to have another Committee meeting?   You could set a range   But if you read the rest of the sentence, the more normal implies more normal since right after the stock market [crash] And I agree that it's probably a little more normal than it was then--   You can do it either way "
3378,1988-03-29," I'd like to nominate Chairman Greenspan, of course, as Chairman of the FOMC to kick this meeting off So, I move Chairman Greenspan as Chairman of the FOMC   It looks like it's all done, Mr Chairman   Yes, I also move President Corrigan as Vice Chairman of the FOMC   Yes, I'd like to move that Governor Angell be the FOMC member in charge of [Freedom of Information Act] appeals and that Governor Seger be the alternate   Sam, what did you say again about the currency after the end of the [Japanese] fiscal year?   What kind of appreciation would it take for the rest of the month, or late in the month, to produce an average of the month below 126 [yen per dollar]?   The Japanese really haven't been intervening on the scale that they had before, right?   It's going to be mark-to-market for all of them after the fiscal year has ended, right?   And there will still be a strong incentive for them not to want the exchange rate [unintelligible] right?   I have one more question Maybe I've been reading too much into this, but it did run on the wires here that the Bank of Japan has decided to tighten up some They made an announcement that they were going to tighten up on money and bank reserves At least the way that I read it over the wires several times was that there had been some sort of announcement of slight tightening for short-term conditions in Japan It seems kind of strange that they would do something like that   I understand what they are doing I'm just saying that the market seems--   I think a lot of it depends on which way the fundamentals are taking the exchange rate, too It's a lot easier to have intervention speed up the adjustment if it's supporting the direction of the fundamentals If you're trying to fight the fundamentals, I think it's much more difficult--the seventies were a good example of that and, most recently, the last couple of years It does work even then on the psychology, but it's much more fleeting, I think   Maybe I'm wrong, but it could be, too, that this is viewed as a little more of a regional issue than Continental If I remember right, there was a lot of concern about Manufacturers Hanover at the same time and there was a great deal of concern that this might spread into the money center banks in general, whereas I think now the basic view is that this is a Texas or Southwest regional problem  SPEAKER(?) But didn't Europeans hold their paper more than the--   I didn't say that it was I said that was a perception  SPEAKER(?) In my own point of view, I think that perception might not be exactly right   I can conceive of circumstances in which it wouldn't be  SPEAKER(?) Maybe there's greater faith that you people can work it out down there, too  SPEAKER(?) Peter, we talked about seasonal borrowing before, but refresh my memory At a time that seasonal borrowing is relatively low, as it is now, it will take a higher level of borrowing to accomplish the [unintelligible] Is there a [unintelligible], say, in December or January?   First, I was going to say that I compliment everyone involved in this study for a very careful presentation of the issues I think it's very well done and balanced I also compliment the people preparing this for their remark on page four that says ""And it is money market rates, rather than the division of reserves between borrowed and non-borrowed components, that have the most direct impact on other financial variables in markets--such as long- term interest rates, exchange rates, and money growth--through which monetary policy is transmitted to the economy"" That's the point that I've been trying to make for a while, because it is the transmission through the funds rate adjustment that is the fundamental feature of monetary policy that we're dealing with here--whether it's the effect on money growth, or other relative interest rates, or whatever That's the transmission mechanism; it's not borrowed reserves Borrowed reserves are simply a mechanism by which we adjust the funds rate, and it's as simple as that  Now, I think there is a legitimate argument for doing it the way we are doing it I think the point is made in the memo that a borrowed reserve target does allow for some variability in the funds rate and for some market forces to show through However, my own personal view, and others may differ with it, is that the major reason for variation of the funds rate in pursuing a borrowed reserve target is not market forces--it's basically reserve estimate errors and problems associated with the reserve equation It is rare for market forces to actually be a major factor in variation of the funds rate, even though you might have some of that show up In trying to be more sensitive directly to the funds rate as a means of setting monetary policy, you can still allow for those market forces to affect the funds rate You don't have to go into the market three times a day to adjust the funds rate to keep it within some narrow range I think that all you have to do is what we are doing now--to some extent, what we were doing for a while earlier--which indicates that you are more sensitive toward the funds rate than the borrowing objective And you enter the market once a day at the normal time, but your operations are geared toward sensitivity of the funds rate and not toward some borrowing objective which really has no meaning other than to influence the funds rate  Chart 2 in the paper is a beautiful chart that shows some of the problems with the procedure that we've been following We had a paper prepared back in July, I believe it was, that was an excellent paper too--it pointed out there was a consistent bias of actual borrowings above expected levels We didn't know exactly why; we had a number of potential explanations for that But it's also illustrated in Chart 2 But more important than the upward bias in actual versus expected in that chart, is the fact that I don't agree with the argument in the paper that there are just very short periods of deviation of borrowings from expectations and expected funds rates, because it's clearly not the case One piece of information that is missing on this chart is how often there were intermeeting conference calls or arrangements with the FOMC that explain the variations from  -10-    3/29/88  expectations; I assume the expected line takes that into account For instance, there's a prolonged period in the spring of 1987--I think everyone here remembers this very distinctly--where you can clearly see in the early months of 1987 this huge spike in adjustment and seasonal borrowing over the expected range That took place for a two-month period That wasn't just a short fluctuation in borrowings relative to expectations That was a huge spike If I remember, borrowings averaged almost $800 million during the entire intermeeting period in which the expected borrowing was between $300 and $400 million That's not just a little fluctuation; that is a prolonged period of actual borrowing well above the expected level You can see the expected level tick up a couple of times there The only intermeeting conference call took place on April 30th, during which we adjusted the borrowing assumption from $300 million to $400 million But you can see that that doesn't nearly compensate for the actual borrowing You can go back for a longer period earlier--you can see in the middle of 1986--when borrowings clearly averaged well above expectations for a 4-month period; all of 1985 is another good example But you can see that on that chart  So, I think that there is a serious issue of whether we can actually keep borrowings on an expected path And my problem with that is What's the point anyway? The only point is to achieve some reasonable range for the funds rate, which represents the transmission mechanism of monetary policy into the economy So, I think that these charts and the data available here clearly show that there are some problems with this approach Now, I'm not sure that we have to do something drastically different I've been very satisfied with the way the operations have been run in the last several months But I don't see why we can't pursue a procedure more consistent with being sensitive to the funds rate rather than some borrowing objective It doesn't make any sense to me that we would do otherwise  The last point I would make on that is that I just can't buy the view that being more sensitive to the funds rate is what got us into trouble in the 1970s I wasn't here then--maybe some of you were--but from talking to people who were here and trying to study that period, from what I can tell, the mere fact that we were trying to be sensitive to the funds rate wasn't actually the problem I gather that money growth wasn't all that bad relative to targets during that period If anything, it had to do with a misunderstanding of money supply measures just like some of the problems that we have now Also, I think that it had to do with probably a slightly different philosophy But we're big boys and it's hard to believe that we can't sit here at this table and agree to set monetary policy where it should be, whether it's being sensitive to the funds rate or what And if we don't buy that, it means that we have to agree to a procedure that tricks us into the right monetary policy And I just can't buy it   That's consistent with what I said--I anticipate the problem would be money supply problems   There were interest ceilings in the banking system; you couldn't even effectively get the rate [up] Well, I'm not talking about--  SPEAKER(?) What part of the [discussion]--?   I agree But how is that different from a borrowing target? I'm just saying that the borrowing approach has the same problem with it If you agree that that was a problem in 1979, a borrowing target would present the exact same problem So I don't know--   But how does borrowing do that?   Then you're arguing for maybe as much fine tuning as several days' changes in the funds rate, in order to stay on some borrowing path continuously through the two-week period You know, I'm just asking; if everybody wants that, that's fine I'm just saying, you can look at the evidence and see for yourselves that there are long periods when the FOMC's policy directives have no meaning And if that's okay with everybody, it's fine with me   But what if you don't like the monetary policy that goes with that? What if you don't want--   Well, that's the other implicit issue associated with this procedure It's led almost by discount rate changes--using the discount rate as one of the primary mechanisms of monetary policy   If the FOMC doesn't mind being dragged along by the discount rate, that's fine   I agree that that is what's going on   But, Jerry, we don't talk about borrowing targets now for the times--   Well, I'm not suggesting we announce to the world that we're targeting the funds rate   We're going to do what we always do We aren't going to announce to the world today that we target borrowed reserves   But that's no different than today What is a change in policy today?   But that's all I'm talking about It's exactly what you do when you alter the funds rate because--   But it is   How is it different?   The directive would read the same way it does now   I wouldn't do that   I'd do exactly what we do now; the directive would read exactly the same We'd sit here and vote on a range of federal funds rates instead of a borrowing number or something like that And we'd do open market operations the same way we do them now   The directive would say slightly more, or slightly less, pressure on reserve positions   But we would still be targeting a monetary  aggregate   The same way we try to figure out what the  appropriate borrowing number is How do we know what the relationship is between borrowed reserves and monetary aggregates?   But what--   But what is this borrowing target? What does it have to do with monetary aggregates? It has nothing to do with them   It doesn't have anything to do with monetary aggregates   I'm simply saying, if you hit your borrowing target precisely--say you hit it on the nose the entire time--what monetary aggregate growth would you get out of that?   It's totally unpredictable--   I'd love to be able to narrow this argument from conceptual theoretical issues down to whether we want to use this procedure for various other reasons That's fine with me I just want to make sure we understand what--   On the theoretical issues of the procedure, I'm not convinced that's the case It sounds like a lot of confusion to me   You're saying zigs and zags in borrowing are productive?   I agree with that   I agree   I agree with what you're saying   I'm saying exactly what you're saying, Frank I'm saying do exactly what you're doing now, except that you avoid the big zigs and zags on borrowings instead of on the funds rate That's all I'm saying   You mean borrowing or what?   The funds rate Oh, I don't think you need to do anything different than what you're doing now You'd go in once a day, around 1140 am, but the action the Desk took would be more sensitive towards a rate protest than it would be toward a borrowing protest   That's the only difference that we would pursue As a matter of fact, we would do exactly what Peter has been doing for the last several weeks I'm saying I think it has been outstanding   I would too, if we're going to do exactly what we've been doing But I think that's consistent with what I'm arguing   Let me just suggest, Roger, if you look at chart 2, you're in for a lot of phone calls   Yes, well, that's what I was talking about   But that's a lot of phone calls, if you look at that chart   Yes, everything on that solid line is an official change   Well, that's what Don said I asked him; every consultation that was a policy change is on that solid line   Yes; that's what a policy change is   You're talking about the chart--the top of the chart   Top chart   What is a policy change if it's not a change in borrowing?   Well, that's fine; but Don is suggesting in his paper that $50 million to $100 million variation--   I don't see how that would be the case   But you say that's not a policy change Why wouldn't it be a policy change?   I just wanted to ask a question about the models and the natural rate What do they say about the kind of pressures that develop for wages as you approach the natural rate? I assume you get a lot of wage pressure after you pass the natural rate, but wouldn't you expect a good bit of pressure as you approach it?   I'm just suggesting that if we were, in fact, at the natural rate, you would expect to have seen a lot of compensation pressures as you approached it The interesting point is that we have not really seen a lot of upward pressure as we reached the 57 percent rate So it could be the capacity level I think we were starting to see some of those pressures maybe earlier last year before--   But that would suggest a lower natural rate   If they are fearful of their jobs in this environment, that means the natural rate is lower   I think that just about everything has been said I second what Frank Morris just said that if we are going to keep inflation under control, we're in a situation that requires taking some risk with policy ahead of the ball game, rather than waiting until the pressures start to show up I think everybody has already said what is obvious to me, too that the economy is doing better than most people would have thought after the stock market crash and that there probably are some significant risks that things could pick up and we would be close to some sort of inflation threshold I think those risks are there  However, we have seen since the stock market crash some pretty good improvements in the inflationary-expectation environment, although most recently we've seen some trends back the other way I don't know whether what we have seen over the last couple of weeks is simply a washing out of the recession forecast out of the market I tend to think that is what we are seeing Analysts and traders are looking at the situation now and are just scratching the recession forecast from their outlook, and the financial markets are reflecting that some But we have had, after all the major improvements in financial conditions since the stock market decline, some trend back toward firming up Long-term Treasury yields have gone up about 50 basis points relative to the funds rate, and some additional downward pressure on the dollar is starting to develop Commodities are sort of a mixed picture some are strengthening and some are not; oil prices are jumping around; the broader indexes are sort of flat, but some narrower measures of commodity prices are showing strength I don't really know what to make of this--whether everybody's breathing a sigh of relief that we're not heading for a recession or whether this is the beginning of some pressures that we need to worry about One thing that is clear to me, though, is that the stock market does not appear to be settled I think last week was a pretty harrowing experience again with the stock market losing 100 points So, I still don't get the impression that things are back to normal in the financial markets  I think that tells me that we're sort of on a knife edge, policy-wise We can make the mistake on the downside or the upside here But we have to take some risk My personal view is that there may be more upside risk, in terms of the beginnings of some pressures indicated by conditions in the financial markets and in the other real economic data But I think we ought to be very cautious at this point, because there are downside risks, as has been pointed out I think the stock market is very uneasy about the situation   You could just target the funds rate below the discount rate "
3401,1988-05-17," I'm sort of following up where I left off on the tail end of the last discussion I'd like to throw my hat in the ring and concur with what the Chairman just said When I came into this meeting, I guess my feeling was even a little more moderate than that; although I generally tend to be-- When I walked into the last meeting I was for no change and the discussion convinced me that we needed to move This time, I came into the meeting basically feeling that we just had voted for a $100 million increase in the borrowing average at the last FOMC meeting and we have made another $100 million increase in the borrowing average, which has just occurred And the markets have really just absorbed this move, I think It would be unusual, and probably a little risky, to immediately hit the market again here at this meeting with another $100 million or more, or something like alternative C, just as the market has absorbed--and I think favorably absorbed--our last move So, I guess where I was prepared to come out was something like no change, with asymmetric language that provides the flexibility to move toward a tighter policy of maybe another $100 million increase in the borrowing average during this next intermeeting period, which I think would probably be likely The important issue would be the timing I still tend to favor that approach, although I guess I could actually support a $100 million move now But I still think that it would be important to have the discretion about the timing on filtering that into the market rather than moving immediately at this meeting since we've just now absorbed a $100 million move on borrowing I would be strongly against going for alternative C for a couple of reasons One, I think this would be a shock to the markets; they are not prepared to absorb that, and I think they would even wonder what they're missing that we know I think we have better information, but I don't see the kind of evidence that supports that kind of move Secondly, I think it would raise immediately in the markets an anticipation of an imminent discount rate move Going up $200 million on the borrowing from this point-- taking borrowings up to a $600 million average, which would take the funds rate up probably into the range of 7-1/2 percent plus, maybe 7-3/4 percent--would immediately raise expectations of a move on the discount rate That's something I would like to avoid I'm not against ultimately moving on the discount rate if we have to, but I think the discount rate ought to be used mainly as an extra piece of ammunition, as an important symbol for an even more serious situation, if it arises I would prefer that it not be simply a technical adjustment to what has already taken place in the markets Then we lose the effectiveness of what we might want to do with a discount rate move later So, I would prefer not to create those expectations of an imminent move in the market We have leeway to do that still, but I think that we have to be very cautious    5/17/88  So my preference, once again, would be no change, with asymmetric language and the understanding that there probably would be an imminent move timed sometime within this next intermeeting period But I'd leave it up to the Chairman and the Desk to determine that A $100 million move now would be reasonable, but I would still prefer that the Desk remain very sensitive to how that was filtered into the markets, given the fact that they've just now absorbed a $100 million increase in borrowings in the last few days I don't know exactly where that puts me in terms of ""A"", ""B"", and ""C""; maybe I should say that it's probably somewhere around ""B"" Although I guess my preference is ""B"" with asymmetric language, I could live with a ""B"" that would involve a $100 million borrowing move, with some sensitivity on the Desk's part   Before we do, [please read the sentence]   We could be surprised The subjunctive is right; that's correct   It did mine   We can certainly clarify that   $100 million is not enough?   It's possible to have $200 million within the intermeeting period   But that's with [unintelligible] any contingency And we want to keep in some contingency; it's not very likely, but there is a contingency   There's not enough difference between any of them to matter much   Yes, I thought it was The way that statement reads there's a lack of contingency in there, but I may have missed something   Yes, he read ""initially"" the last time   Yes   Well, okay   Well, as others have said, I sympathize with the goal that Tom's seeking If we had a vote today on the price stability goal, we'd probably get a much larger consensus I'm not sure if anybody wants to take that, but I think it's critical that--   Well, what I was going to follow up with is that there's a much more difficult technical issue Even if you agree on the goal--if we had 100 percent consensus that price stability is what we all wanted, and I think probably almost everybody would say that today--you'd still have a whole lot of disagreement about what that means Agreeing on the goal is an important first step, but then you'd run into all kinds of problems, like Does that mean that we should jump with both feet on every big relative price swing? If there's an oil price shock, which is one big relative price in the economy obviously as it flows through, it's going to have some temporary effects But what do we mean by temporary? It might have a two-year effect on the price level as it works its way through What are we going to do about that? Does that mean every time one big relative price shocks the general price level on a temporary basis that we run out there and stomp it to death? We would get into all kinds of discussions about timing, about what price stability means, and what we would accept in the form of relative price effects that could affect the general price level for a while But if you run out and try to deal with every relative price effect--like import prices, which we've obviously agreed to absorb to some extent--what are you going to do? If you deal with every one of those, you're going to be chasing your tail, I think If you tighten up against a relative price shock, then you're going to potentially overshoot; as that filters through the economy, then it's going to create an overreaction on the downside at some point, and then you're going to be trying to work it back up  So, to me, price stability means a long-run concept And that may mean that you're never actually experiencing a perfect level of price stability where prices are hovering around zero It has to mean that the mean is somewhat around zero; but even then you'd have  -27-    5/17/88  to admit that you want to accept periods of deflation And I guess we could debate whether people think we ought to go through periods of deflation in order to keep the mean around zero You can get into all kinds of difficult debates about what the proper measure of price stability is Is it a broad index such as the CPI, PPI, the deflator? What is it? It's a difficult problem But I still think that a goal of price stability, rather than, say, trying to improve the unemployment rate or maximize real output growth, is a step in the right direction I think there was a time, probably, when that wasn't clear; some people would have said there was a Phillip's curve trade off and some acceptance of permanent inflation was worthwhile I don't think that's true anymore, but I still think there is a difficult problem  Before I get too hung up on the goals, I do want to say on this specific proposal, though, that I think it would succeed in damping the volatility of the base Having upper and lower bounds or constraints, I think, would cause monetary policy to adjust early as you're approaching the bounds rather than deal with big roller coaster effects, and would probably damp the volatility of the base growth You'd have a much more stable growth in the base; I think it would succeed in that But the question would be whether that gets you anything I think the ultimate issue as to whether this specific proposal would be worthwhile rests on whether the base is a better instrument of intermediate policy than any other aggregate or anything else we have Don had indicated that the statistical properties of the base make it somewhat equivalent to M2, although Bob Parry's people debate that My view is that even if you look at M2, you have serious money demand problems associated with M2 My big problem is that I am not convinced that money demand is stable, even in the long run Look at what we have experienced over the 1980s And there have been statistical studies in the past that have found long-run breaks in the trend in the money demand in the postwar period All you have to do is look back earlier than the postwar period; there were decades when monetary velocity was actually on a declining trend It only turned up in the postwar period And there have been several detected structural breaks in it even since the postwar era Nobody can predict when those breaks will occur, and that's the difficult problem You can feel very satisfied about the statistical properties of the base and all of a sudden there could be some structural adjustment--a long-term adjustment in the trend rate Even though it may stabilize around this new trend rate, you might go two years trying to detect it So, I think there is this fundamental problem with monetary aggregates But, in saying that, I think the goal of people who want to target the monetary aggregates is a highly desirable one That's why my preference has been to try and look at indicators like the interest spread, in conjunction with commodity prices and exchange rates These are financial market indicators but they provide a similar type of goal to what people wanting to target the aggregates would want I'm interested in the interest rate spread because I think that, especially under our operating procedure, that's how money is created and that's how liquidity is provided to the system It's basically the spread between the funds rate and other rates that creates the lending incentives that take place, and of course, that determines, to some extent, the expansionary effects of money It creates additional credit in the markets and that feeds back on the base The way we do it now, we change the funds rate through the borrowing target, which changes the interest rate spread,  -28-    5/17/88  which creates new loans and feeds back on the base through reserves And, you know, I think that that gives you some idea about the thrust of policy I think that approach--   Yes   Sure I guess all I would say is that, yes, the yield curve might change Obviously, as you got close to the constraint, long-term rate movements would probably be damped   It could, but I think still the question is going to be whether that aggregate-- You know, you can get all kinds of yield curve relationships associated with that You might get much better behavior on the long end of the market But it's not hard to get long bonds to behave well We could run the fed funds rate up to 20 percent today and I can assure you we'd get very good performance on the long end of the market I think it's pretty predictable; if you create expectations of a recession, you can invert the yield curve quite nicely But I don't think that's the ultimate goal, unless what you want is a level of expansion consistent with price stability-- whatever that is, exactly I don't know exactly what yield curve determines that, but it's not a negative slope It might be close to flat but who knows exactly I don't know where that leaves me, except that it requires a lot of discretion at the moment It really requires filtering a lot of information I think getting the goal right, and maybe even having further debate on fleshing out these goals, would allow this process to work even better You're always going to have differing opinions when you have 19 people sitting around a table But I've been amazed at how well this process sort of filters all that information into a pretty good consensus So where do we need to go? If we could get the goals down a little better, we would probably do all right   I don't disagree with that either  -29-    5/17/88   What I'm saying is that it's a proxy; that's always been the intermediate target to get to price stability, or whatever the goal was Money growth isn't an end in itself; it's only an intermediate step toward what your ultimate goal is I'm just saying that there are a lot of potential intermediate approaches to use to achieve the same end result If we all have the same end result, we could have a slightly different view about what the intermediate steps ought to be but still reach a consensus on policy that would probably make us all happy The base would probably perform better; my own indicators would perform better; Wayne's commodity prices would perform better I think we would all generally be happier   The problem is you would never get the market's response to the changes   The behavioral adjustments that would take place are not there that way   You could at least see when you would be faced with a decision   Yes, I do; I think it might be  -34-    5/17/88   I don't know I mean, you have to tell me what's happening on the demand side   If you make that assumption, I agree with you completely But I'm saying that's one hell of a big ""if"", because that's not what it has been doing the last few years   Well, it has been a long way from zero   Yes, if you go back--   No doubt about it   Don, since when has it been doing better? It's been what--a few quarters, right?   Can you predict the interest rate movements? Because if you can't, you're in big trouble   It just gets you into interest rate forecasting   No That's my whole point That's why I'm saying I've been looking at these other indicators that seem to do a better job than prices   How long did that one last? "
3424,1988-06-29," You say they didn't decide to short?   Because the dollar was under upward pressure, right?   I'm just saying that some fundamental--   Well, that's the point I meant   Something caused that to happen   It's 8 percent today   You mentioned that bond yields could have been affected by some expectation that there wouldn't be long-bond authority?   Recently, though, I've also seen speculation that the House is going to issue long-bond authority And to some extent, I think the bond market today can be reflecting the reverse of that   I just thought about one other thing I wanted to ask, which was mentioned by Bob Black The funds rate was generally trading slightly above even the narrow range that was suggested would be associated with a flat $50 million [increase in the] borrowing number And we haven't really been around that borrowing number very much I still sense that there is a bit of a problem with the borrowing function relative to what we might expect If we were to run at $550 million of borrowing consistently, would we see slightly higher funds rates than what we would ascribe to $550 million?   Okay Actually I guess that's still with us in your--   Okay   Second   Well, let me just say that I see things that are similar to many of the presidents First, on this growth issue, clearly the pace of growth we've had has shown itself to be too strong to be sustainable without an acceleration in inflation But what kind of growth is necessary to keep inflation from accelerating--or even to allow it to decelerate from current levels--I have no idea I would hate to get into trying to fix on any number to shoot for to set monetary policy I think what we ought to do is take action until we see the response we're looking for in terms of financial market expectations and the environment for decelerating inflation, regardless of what the growth rate consequences happen to be  But, like everyone else, I think the economy has certainly looked strong, with manufacturing at a high level and exports near a boom But I acknowledge exactly what Frank was saying that this year so far we've seen a leveling off and a beginning of a slowing in manufacturing; and orders have started to trend down Payroll employment growth rates have slowed We still have significant growth in employment, but it has slowed The housing market is certainly at lower levels Domestic demand is continuing to grow at the slow pace of '87 So, I think we're getting the kind of domestic demand growth performance that we've been seeking with our policy, and that's very encouraging  The markets themselves are starting to acknowledge the effectiveness of our policy, in my opinion We have finally, I think, seen the financial markets start to react to the firmness of our policies And in my opinion, we've seen a fundamental shift in the exchange rate, and it has been acknowledged in the bond markets to some degree That could all turn around if we get a whole set or series of bad trade numbers and if things don't look like they're continuing to progress some on the external side Nevertheless, I think that we've gotten the kind of response in the financial markets that we've been seeking with our policy  One of the things that concerns me a little and makes me want to be cautious at this stage is the fact that because we're getting that response, and the dollar has strengthened, and the yield curve has flattened out--all of which I think are desirable characteristics and exactly what we want to see from our policy--this response is  -25-    6/29-30/88  nevertheless going to put pressure on foreign central banks to tighten up their own monetary policies The Bundesbank raised the discount rate this morning I think that's probably desirable given the fact, as Gary pointed out, that some of those economies have been growing at a faster pace Nevertheless, it's going to have the effect of damping domestic demand abroad So, I think the stronger dollar in the United States and the response by foreign central banks to tighten, to shield themselves from the potential transmission of inflationary pressures there, are going to damp foreign domestic demand  The combination of our slow domestic demand and a more damped foreign domestic demand, I think, is what we want; but it's in the works There's going to be a lag there, and I think that we have to be very careful not to go the point where we're going to combine our fairly slow domestic demand growth with a decelerating foreign domestic demand and leave ourselves without a trade adjustment And I think there is some risk of that, although we can always get the trade adjustment by dramatically weaker US domestic demand for imports But I think that's not what we're looking for So, I think the lagged effect of our policy action is in the works and what we're seeing on the inflation side now is to some extent--as has already been mentioned--the lagged effect of past policy actions And what we've done in the recent past now is going to show through with a lag The financial markets, I think, are showing confidence in the fact that we have been effective in our policies; otherwise, I can't imagine why the long bond markets and the dollar would be behaving as well as they have  It's true that commodity prices have been accelerating sharply I attribute a lot of that to the drought conditions and they are less forward looking than the others; commodity futures, I think, only go out a couple of years And they can turn on a dime We've had two sharp declines--to the limit--on the CRB index the last couple of days just because of a little rain in the Midwest So I think we have to be fairly careful at this point because there are lags and we have to take them into account  On the wage side, once again, I don't see any acceleration in wages from the [published] numbers There are some slight curves in the numbers, but those don't look any wavier than they have since 1983 But I do sense some more nervousness We're 6 years down the road in the expansion and there's no doubt that industry is more nervous about the progress on the wage front from this point on But the Conference of Chairmen met here recently, and without exception, they all said that they saw no pressure on wages, just like you have all said Yet there was a sense that, if workers felt they were going to fall behind relative to price pressures and their real wages were to deteriorate for another year, you might see a much more militant labor situation   I think pointed out in that conference meeting that he had been expecting wage pressures in '87 They thought that they were going to arise because of the upward pressure on oil prices, which caused the CPI to grow faster than nominal wages that year    6/29-30/88   He said he was surprised that the pressure didn't materialize And I think that's what is going wrong with the models, for some reason I don't know how long you can get by with that, but the fact is, the wage pressures are not yet there But I think another year of accelerating prices relative to nominal wages might be a problem   Yes, I think that's right   He is   Right, he is   No, he is very responsible; I respect his judgment So, on the wage front, once again I say there's nothing yet, but you do get the feeling that something is out there At the same time, I think all of the strong good feelings going on now are a cumulative effect of the positive growth we've seen in the past And where we go from here, I think, is going to be the lagged response to what we've been doing over the last 6 months or so And so we've got to be careful I do think that probably the risks are still more on the upside than the downside as well But I think that we need to be very careful from this point on that we pay attention to the lags that are taking place in the forward-looking markets where we have been effective in my opinion   They never got up above the short rates   I guess what I'm saying is they never rose above the funds rate or short--   Yes   I think I can live with alternative III Don Kohn pointed out, though, that there is some risk that expectational adjustments will take place a certain way We can find ourselves going backward at some point And I think there's some risk that we might get ourselves in a situation where expectations do take effect and we end up with lower interest rates instead of rising interest rates; at some point we're going to get a velocity movement that's going to be in the opposite direction of what we anticipate To hit a 5 percent nominal GNP you're going to have to compensate for a potential decline in velocity growth--I don't think that's totally out of the picture as a possibility--for me to feel completely comfortable with alternative III; that's why I like a 5-1/2 percent midpoint  It doesn't bother me that we ratchet the targets down a half percentage point a year; we've been doing that for some time As a matter of fact, we didn't even move them for a while, and a half percentage point was always viewed in the markets as a reasonable amount of progress I must admit that, barring that scenario that I pointed out, the upper end of the alternative III range seems to give you plenty of room And maybe we do want to give that kind of message to the markets But simply because I am unsure about where we might be next February-- I would hate to end up having to back off next February   I agree with Governor Angell I am uncomfortable with alternative III, but I would not want to record a vote against it, knowing there's a majority for it I would like to show more unanimity than that   We've already been polled; we know where we stand   I would like to ask one more question [Unintelligible] I don't have any problem with that, but I'd like to clarify one more thing with Don Kohn I should have asked this earlier, but it is not going to change anything Going back and looking at the [unintelligible], the staff forecast is 6 percent nominal for 1989--   That's what I said--around 6 The central tendency of the FOMC members is around 6 The midpoint on this alternative III is 5 percent Anybody who looks at that is going to say, well, the trend rate of M2 velocity is zero, and that automatically means that the Fed is targeting higher interest rates Is that going to be obvious to people?   But they can draw that conclusion from what has already happened   I didn't want anything obvious I would be uncomfortable with somebody looking at the range and seeing a big interest rate increase just to get the velocity number Okay   Yes I was going to say--at some point I think if we decide that we have to lock in the structure, obviously that's what you want to do I think there's still enough uncertainty out there, at least on my part, that I wouldn't want to lock that floor in But there will be a point, obviously, when that needs to be done   It might be useful if they understood that, to some extent, movements in the funds rate were embodying what their preferences were   I think if they can understand that, then they shouldn't be disappointed on the discount rate--as long as we're getting it done one way or the other  -53-    6/29-30/88   Statement date   Maybe I should--is there anybody else?   I'm sort of like Gary Stern, Mike Kelley, Bob Heller and others who have said they would like no change at this point but that the risks are asymmetric My view is that that's where the greatest probability is My preference would be generally no change, but subject to review at some point with the probability that we might move However, the Chairman has indicated a willingness to go $50 million additional on the borrowing, and I think if there really is a risk of the funds rate settling back below the 7-1/2 percent, I can live with going with $600 million now to avoid that  I think the funds rate is important I've never viewed this as targeting fed funds unless you leave it stable all the time My view is that you want to move it, but you want to give a message with that funds rate, and I guess you should be willing to move it as you need to So, I think the 7-1/2 has a significant message, and basically I think the markets have discounted it, as Tom Melzer says And I wouldn't want to see them get a different impression from that So, if in fact going to $600 million means a 7-1/2 percent funds rate, roughly, I can support that I can also support the asymmetric language, but I would want to make sure that that doesn't mean it's automatic I think that the conference call should be purely for review, and there's no automatic move on borrowing at that stage We may actually feel totally differently when we review the evidence As long as that's well understood, I think I can support this directive   You've got a point on the reserve thing, but on the rates, the funds rate has basically led all the other short rates It's higher than the T-bill, commercial paper rates, and everything else Your point on reserves is well taken, but we've certainly been ahead on the short rate issue Some of that could be the supply problem but--   Involuntary--   I think I know exactly what you mean, Wayne I think what Wayne is saying is this If the record of that $50 million change is announced to the market as a further tightening move, even though the funds rate may not move at all from where it is, that would be [a concern to him] Is that what you're saying, Wayne? Obviously, if it doesn't move the funds rate, in my opinion, it's not a further tightening But I think you're saying you don't want to be seen on record as having raised the borrowing target at this point   Sure  -58-    6/29-30/88   I think we need some clarification, though, on what $550 million and $600 million mean   Before we get too deep into this To the Desk and to Don, what does $550 million mean? Is $550 million going to cause the funds rate to settle back down below 7-1/2 percent?   It has been depreciating since the beginning of the year, practically This recent surge is shorter, but the net depreciation from the beginning of the year is what Ted?  11 or 12 percent    We're only trying to clarify--   I was going to say something along the same lines We are changing the borrowing number, that is true And that normally has been associated, as Governor Angell says, with slightly   However, some people have a different view about how you measure reserve pressures And if we're saying it's not going to change the funds rate--we're only changing borrowing pressure and the funds rate basically stays stable around 7-1/2 percent--total reserve pressures are not really changed in the market All we have done is change the borrowing target; total reserves would be the same   This argument really wouldn't develop if we had asymmetric language and decided to discretely move, but later We are arguing about angels on the head of a pin here "
3445,1988-07-19," I have a couple of comments I'm with the Chairman all the way on his view I think we ought to wait a bit In addition, I'm not totally convinced that this dollar thing is temporary at all I think that the trade numbers have somewhat defied our estimates, and it's quite possible that the models may just be wrong about the kind of trade adjustments we can get at these exchange rates I also think that a stronger dollar is consistent with a tighter policy, and I don't see how we can avoid those consequences to some extent I think we can do sterilized intervention until the cows come home and not basically alter that fundamental To some    7/19/88  extent, I think the exchange rate is helping us out in the conduct of our policy restraint and it should be part of our policy I know we have international obligations and we should be sensitive to those; and I think we are, through our sterilized intervention actions But I don't see how we can take these actions and continue to restrain domestic demand and not see that show up in improvement on the trade side and a stronger dollar as well I'd like to see the lagged effects of that So far, we just continue to move without waiting for the lagged response I think we're getting into risky ground if we continue to move in that direction   Well, that's your opinion, Jerry I think we've done a significant amount "
3465,1988-08-16," What is the average in terms of dollar transactions per day?   Dollar transactions per day?   Well, worldwide   You don't know?   I think [theirs is] very large relative to what [we] do   I have sort of a technical question I'm not a purist on intervention either, although I think there are times when the signal is useful and there are times that it's useful for reasons of international cooperation, even regardless of the substance--   But the one thing I have been worried about recently is--this is a question I guess for Joan Lovett and Don Kohn and Sam Cross--when we are doing consistent interventions and it's working in the other direction from our open market operations, it does run the risk I think of confusing the federal funds market as to what our reserve needs may be If we have a larger drain need--say it appeared when we are tightening--if the market is not aware of our intervention actions to sell dollars, they may not know specifically or may considerably underestimate the draining requirements of the Open Market Desk And that can lead to some strange behavior in the funds market, it seems to me How do we deal with that? It seems to me that we don't want that kind of uncertainty in the funds market Maybe we want the two-way risk on the foreign exchange market, but we don't want this uncertainty in the open market operations   Seven days, though, can be important   But truly that's just as big   A good example, though, is this yen trans- action that we are doing, which is not constructed to be noticed I think   And that's reported with a 7-day lag?   Okay   I'll move   I wanted to ask Mike a question What percentage of the GNP growth rate is investment demand considered to be in terms of the components of the growth rate? Is that a big factor?   It's pretty significant   How big of a factor is PDE in that?   The reason I'm asking is because I was struck by the presentation to the Board yesterday and talking with Charlie Schultz earlier who made a comment I thought was kind of interesting He said that a lot of that PDE growth--correct me if I'm wrong--is the deflator The decline in prices for producers durable equipment is generating a lot of the real output side of that If you apply a fixed-weight deflator to PDE, I don't know that you get a totally different result, but what does it do?    8/16/88   Computers   I was noticing yesterday it was down about 3 percent, or 2-1/2 percent   It's not the whole show Well, say you apply the fixed-weight deflator though, how much would that take out of the growth in PDE?   Okay that, then   I'm not suggesting we should, but I'm saying I think that's a relevant measure But--   Okay But you're suggesting, though, that the potential number changes with the way you look at the deflator?   But you can't look at the fixed-weight on one side only It seems to me that you've got to be consistent And like you say, if you believe the deflator issue is important on the growth side, then you should be looking at the implicit deflator otherwise--   Well, it's almost an apples and oranges problem, though   Yes Okay, I will stop   That's right It doesn't change the overall story, but it does around the margin That's okay   They were waiting for the phone  -24-    8/16/88   Depends on which one you look at   Yes   It's the same with the Journal of Commerce But there are a couple of them that are much higher; there are a couple that are no change   Depends on what you weight it by, too   I don't know if it's relevant, but I've got a comment I think everyone has laid out the risks pretty well Almost everyone agrees that the risks are on the upside, and that's the way I feel I think the risks are tilted more toward the upside, although I don't think they're zero on the downside either We've seen that even with a half point change in the discount rate--it went from 6 to 6-1/2 percent, relative to where the funds rate is now And in the scheme of things, you wouldn't think that would be a big factor, but you see nervous ripples in the financial markets when you do that We've all seen over the last year or so how expectations can change fairly dramatically And I think we have to be cautious about that So, I think we should be concerned about the magnitude [and] the timing of the actions we take   Okay, I'll get away from that But the other thing I wanted to say on the overall view, in terms of actions that we've taken in the past and depending on what we do in the future I don't think it's going to be that easy to manage the adjustment process by the actions we take I think our moves, in the past, have had an effect of strengthening the dollar, and they would continue to do so They're going to affect both domestic and overall demand Either the exchange rate flows through and it weakens our competitiveness some, or foreign central banks try to stabilize the dollar and you're going to get a weakness on the foreign demand side I know Ted pointed out there are some lags But eventually that'll take place So I'm not sure we should believe that we can get the adjustment process at the same time we get the slowing down I think most of what we are seeing on the adjustment process is a result of where the exchange rate has come to this point We've had a substantial adjustment on the discount rate; we'll have lagged effects for some time to come But I think a price-stable economy here is consistent with a fairly large current account deficit I don't think you can get them both down unless you have--I don't know, maybe a major recession would do it But I'm not sure that's in our interest to do  -27-    8/16/88 -28-   Wouldn't you see that in bills? I don't think you've seen that in the spread of bills over the funds rate You've had a little bit of upward pressure, I think, because of supply conditions, due to the suspension of the long bond But you don't see a big spread developing in bills over the funds rate   But, Ed, don't you think if you have asymmetric language that the Chairman could just as easily choose to move the funds rate as he could a borrowing number?   I just can't comprehend that, I'm sorry   Yes   But you're saying the Chairman would somehow have illusions himself that a $50 million change in the borrowing is not moving the funds rate?   I think the Chairman said it; his statement is clearly consistent with mine As I said before, I think that the risks are still on the upside I think we need time to see how the market digests this discount rate change, but I think we should be prepared to move [on the basis of] the economy's performance-- especially if the inflation indicators continue to show pressure But I think at this stage, the appropriate action is to support asymmetry in the language and maintain the $600 million borrowing with the discount rate where it is Let's see how those winds blow   On Governor Angell's point, I wouldn't mind advancing the aggregates in the list a little bit if we all agree that they're behaving a little better But inflation pressure I think is number one, the major issue I'm sort of agnostic on whether the M2 demand is behaving that much better I somewhat agree with the possibility of what Governor Heller suggested--that M2 velocity has something to do with the stability--, the prediction accuracy on T- bills and short-term interest rates, to some extent So, I'm satisfied with where it is, but I can support moving it up; I'm sort of indifferent   [Unintelligible]   Because people believe that's what we are saying "
3489,1988-09-20," Second   Mike, what did you say your federal funds rate forecast was? Lee asked, and I forgot Did you say 9-1/2 percent?   Yes, I know   And you're saying about a proportional move up in the long-run rate to 10 percent?   The only question I have about that is that we haven't seen that kind of trend with our moves on the funds rate this year We've had a 1-1/2 percentage point increase in the funds rate and actually a sharp flattening of the yield curve Long rates stayed about where they were, maybe going up some, but much less than proportionally I think the yield curve has flattened from about    9/20/88  2-1/2 percentage points down to less than 1 percentage point What if that trend continues? What would the forecast say if the move to 9-1/2 percent on the funds rate was not accompanied by a proportional move in the long bond? What kind of differential effects would that have?   No, that's okay   I understand What I'm saying is, let's assume it's inflationary expectations being adjusted, and that's why the long rates haven't gone up Say that continues to be the case, but the funds rate goes up to 9-1/2 percent without much change in the long bond due to improvement in inflationary expectations or something like that What would be the differential impacts of that?   Okay, entirely, let's say, to debate the extreme   Your view is, though, that these expectations will be revised in the near future and that the long bond will move back up?   And if that's the case, then the long bond would be surprised into further upward moves   I really don't want to add much to any of that I think everything has been said We've seen recently some signs of slowing as everyone has pointed out That seems to have had a moderating effect in the financial markets and I don't know whether that's going to continue or not All I know is that it looks pretty good right now and certainly doesn't lend any weight to overreacting So I support what others have said   I agree with the recommendation I'll just add a response to what Don was saying earlier about the financial markets and some of the caveats that go with it I think that's right I think to some extent that the good behavior of financial markets has a lot to do with the credibility that we've established with our actions And I think that if there are signs of market wavering-- thinking that we are not credible on policy--then it'll show up and that's the time when we should consider further actions But I think now the signs look good, and we don't want to lose that credibility we've established with the financial markets I think clearly this is the right type of policy for now   No matter what "
3512,1988-10-17," On the monetary policy side, they're not excited, of course, about the prospect of having to take these substantially tighter actions, but that was one of the conditions for this bridge loan And so I think the feeling wasthat even though they had a wage-price pact that was trying to freeze prices, they weren't getting at the condition of [aggregate] demand in the country, which is still quite strong Good evidence of that, even though they have a measured lower inflation rate, is the seepage on reserves that has picked up substantially And I think the anticipation of a substantial devaluation, if conditions continued, is a pretty good indication of the underlying inflation problem in Mexico So, I think it's a perfectly consistent policy to have a substantial tightening to deal with demand and at the same time restrain the outflow of reserves I think they finally realized that they can't even hold the pact--their wage-price system that they've agreed to--together without additional restraint on domestic demand I think the central bank has been reluctant to take this action, but I think now they realize that it is necessary and, of course, they realize too that in order to receive this bridge financing that's a necessary action And they certainly have acknowledged that those pressures are there and something other than just a wage-price freeze needs to be done   Governor Angell, that isn't quite what the agreement is We're not suggesting a devaluation As a matter of fact, the whole purpose of these conditions was not to force them to a devaluation; it was to force them to take domestic fiscal and monetary actions to avoid a devaluation Those are, in fact, the conditions   That's what we're trying to stop   The fact of the matter also is, though, if they were to fail to live up to the conditions, the bridge wouldn't be disbursed We have complete control over the disbursement and if the conditions aren't met, then they wouldn't be able to draw the funds   On that, let me just say that [unintelligible] I agree these policies won't be particularly popular But at the same time, you have to consider whether the alternative would be popular And what Governor Angell was getting at is that their alternative is a major devaluation that would substantially diminish the real incomes of those people who have submitted to a wage freeze And so you have to take, as an alternative, a devaluation versus this And I think that with them seeing what their alternatives are, it makes it more palatable for them to be willing to pursue a more restrained monetary policy and take stronger fiscal actions and sell off more of their nationalized firms They're actually undertaking some fairly impressive privatizations--the two major airlines, two major copper companies, and I forget some of the other natural resource areas There's a long list that they have already received bids for and they're prepared to accept bids on So the numbers are fairly solid If all of them go through as expected, it would be about $2 billion worth of privatizations And a large part of that would be the two major copper mining companies, which are very large That is already pretty much sealed up because the bids are already in and it's a matter of accepting the bids   Well, there's no guarantee   I think what they're counting on is not the actual amount of this bridge, because as Mr Bradfield and Mr Truman point out there's not a lot of up-front drawing associated with this What they're counting on is the statement of support from the US on top of the strong actions that they're announcing on monetary and fiscal policy Really, in the short term between now and the time that we're really dealing with it, all the burden is going to be on monetary policy to stabilize their reserve situation through interest rates It's not like it's just a pure currency crisis with no inflation problem; they've got enough of an underlying inflation problem to need a substantially more restrained monetary policy, as the Chairman has pointed out Even though their measured rate is relatively low, it's purely because of the wage and price controls  -8-    10/17/88  situation There's a lot of underlying inflationary pressure in that country   We have some fairly significant assurances on the monetary side We probably laid out as conditions of this substantially more detail [unintelligible] As a matter of fact,  So, I think you would probably be pleased with the degree of scrutiny we gave the mechanism by which they would take tighter action "
3531,1988-11-01," What he means is, if you take it out far enough, you could probably wash all that out But the point I'm just making about this is that some people think it is a shorter period of time to [get full] adjustment and smoothness, but I have to think that in the short run it could be a very, very tumultuous situation This is very good in terms of the long-run picture, but in the long run, we're all dead   100 years   Our great grandchildren!   I was just going to make a comment on what Governor Heller said earlier It's interesting that last year we had the weakness in the dollar, and it appears we had a strong economic situation, stronger than some people saw at the time I think that led to feelings that the trade deficit wasn't going to improve-- imports were going to be strong--and that policy was going to be geared toward further dollar depreciation to the point of protectionist pressures So, there was a definite fear, I think, in the market of an orchestrated decline in the dollar and that tended to feed on itself But this year we have seen something different The deficit has improved, and the dollar started turning about the time we started seeing trade improvement And it has improved consistently up to recently On top of that were the expectations of rising interest rates because the economy remained strong and everybody anticipated a tightening monetary policy action Now, you've got a bit of a different perception I think the markets see the economy as not as strong as expected earlier and believe that rates may not have to go as high as anticipated earlier and that's taking the pressures off the exchange market And I think they've seen some slowing in the trade improvement It may be just an aberration, but all of that I think is sort of leading up to a weaker trend in the dollar I don't know where that takes you exactly, but that is how I would characterize the way things have developed   There may be some of that [unintelligible] feeling, but there also was a strong feeling that aside from that we'd do anything necessary, or the perception was that we want to maintain dollar stability It also was a perception that the central bank might be a source of the political cycle, too I don't know how you weigh those two out And they could balance each other   Well, I think it's a combination of the perception of things; they're all intertwined, with the perceived relatively weaker situation in the economy and the trade numbers are alll tied up together Although it's hard for me to-- What do the models show when you have a relatively weaker economic situation? I thought you'd get more on the import side than you'd lose on the export side   How does that fit into your view about inflation?   I think all those criteria for primary dealer- ships sound good except for two that Mr Sternlight mentioned--the number limitation and the geographical I assume that's just politi- cal reasoning on your part, but I can't see any other reason why you have those Maybe that's the right thing to do but that seems to invite criticism from parties that are perfectly qualified except for the fact that you've hit the number limit and the fact that they may be concentrated in some geographical region I'm not sure why you'd argue you are excluding by the limit basis   But I'm saying if you can insure these other criteria, which I think are good criteria, why would you use those other factors? If they are perfectly qualified by those criteria, why would you impose these quotas?   Sure   It seems like a way to do that would be just to tighten your criteria further   That's what I was getting at   But I'm saying that's the maximum number you can have   I just have one question that bothers me a little Those were good explanations, but one basic thing bothers me about the Greenbook forecast I've mentioned it before I'll refer to it again What bothers me is the fact that we put short-term rates up about 1-1/2 percent--the federal funds rate Yet long-rates are lower today than when we started that tightening move The Greenbook assumes sort of a parallel shift in rates And yet the economic data that we've seen, even though I think close to the Greenbook forecast, are definitely slower than what I would have anticipated at this level of interest rates, especially long rates I'm having trouble accounting for that How would you reconcile that kind of situation-- the fact that your interest rate forecast had one thing in it and yet the economic performance has been even more modest than you may have anticipated because you would have assumed the higher level of long  -24-    11/1/88  rates and maybe even a higher level of short rates? I have a lot of trouble reconciling this   I guess what you still haven't quite dealt with--I'm trying to look backwards at where we've come I agree that all those things could happen going forward; that's just prospective; it's something we don't know about But looking backwards we haven't had a move upward; as a matter of fact we've had a slight move down- ward in long rates at the same time the funds rate moved up You say that the long-rate effect may involve a longer lag than I'm giving credit for, but what's going to be the effect of that?   Now, you're getting into something I think you're saying that because the yield curve has flattened out and long rates haven't gone up that that's going to have a longer stimulus with a lag?   So you're saying real rates have actually fallen on the long end?   So you'd have to agree though that if that's the case, there has been some decline in inflationary expectations   And you're just saying it's temporary and ill conceived?   I agree that all those expectations are quite [unintelligible], but we've had almost a year in which those long rates have had a chance to wash out or adjust expectations and they really have held   That may have occurred earlier; I don't know about now The tax bill is passed I think that's [not affecting the long] end of the yield curve now Anyway, I don't want to address too much of this It's just that we've had this event over the last year and clearly it either has to be a decline in inflationary expectations or a decline in the real rate of interest And since we don't think it's the decline in the real rate since we've been tighter, then it has to be a change in inflationary expectations I know that can all change going forward, but at least I think you have to say at this point that's what the market thinks   You don't mean unit labor costs, you mean--   Can I just make a couple of remarks? I'm not sure where we're going from here Like everyone else, I think things look pretty good at the moment; whether it's good fortune or our good sense, it's hard to tell, but I'll take either one The situation does look fairly good at the moment, but where we're headed and what we'll be faced with is a little difficult to tell I guess I'm a  -41-    11/1/88  little more optimistic about the future--just on the basis of how well we have done in keeping domestic demand relatively modest Whether that's going to be enough, I don't know If foreign demand surges while we're so internationally competitive, we could put more stress on the manufacturing sector, but that's not evident Domestic demand abroad has at least been reasonably good, but if both Germany and Japan take some modest tightening action--Germany perhaps more than Japan--I don't see demand for our exports being out of control by any means And there's some evidence on the trade side of a slowing of exports, so I don't see that source overtaxing our capacity Growth of our gross domestic purchases, which is I guess the broadest measure of domestic demand, has been very modest--around 1-1/2 percent The other measures which are a little narrower, have been higher but they've been trending down And this paper that was presented today, and the comments about the loan situation, how much growth can you get out of that kind of a M2 picture? You can't get a lot There's only so much, even if you make some fairly optimistic assumptions about the kind of velocity growth you could get from M2, which has a long-term zero trend You can't get some sort of disaster out of that, and so I see the long run looking fairly good That may mean that pressures surface later to some extent, and if that happens we'll have to move Right now, things look pretty good   I want to follow up on your comment about oil prices I agree with a lot of what you said about that, but with that kind of increase in real disposable income, it might have an effect on demand that you wouldn't necessarily want to validate fully However, that still may mean that nominal rates would fall, even though you're saying that you wouldn't let real interest rates come down as much   Well, that's what I'm thinking, but if there were a real plunge in prices from this level, and they seem to be viewed as more permanent than this [unintelligible]   Yes, I'm just saying, though, I agree if we didn't appear to be trying to accommodate every bit of it you could expect that that still may mean that you would accommodate some of it  -44-    11/1/88   Well, that's the question I think Well, I think what he's saying--   That's the decoded part of it!   I also support this directive I think I can support the directive as long as over the next intermeeting period we're not likely to be confronted with any possibility of easing And I think that's probably a very good possibility But I do have a little sensitivity to what Tom Melzer said, because I don't think the probability really is zero that some unforeseen event might surface; and I think we may be living a little close to the edge, although part of it may be statistical aberrations The Chairman pointed out that the farm situation is subtracting from fourth-quarter GNP and adding to first-quarter 1989 GNP; I think estimates are for about minus 1-1/4 percent or something like that from the fourth-quarter growth rate And given the third-quarter starting point, the economy must grow a lot over the next three months to exceed the third-quarter's midpoint And I'm concerned that we might find ourselves, at least statistically, in a situation that would not lead us to change policy but certainly could create some perception problems Statistically, we could end up with a flat or slightly negative quarter in the fourth quarter with the drought adjustment; but I don't think that result will be anything fundamental and will be made up in the first quarter I'm comfortable with asymmetric language, but I think if we found ourselves in a situation where there was a need to ease--even if it were only a slight easing--it would be uncomfortable given that language So maybe we ought to consider that possibilty seriously, if things don't change by the time of our next meeting But I can live with asymmetric now "
3551,1988-11-22," It would be a disadvantage from my point of view This is Governor Johnson speaking I think it might be the case that the way borrowing is running, if you really tried to hit    11/22/88  $500 million, you could end up with something like 9 percent on the funds rate We're averaging about $300 million, as Peter mentioned But it has been running below that if you take out some computer problems and things like that, I believe But you know, I'm not sure we could actually religiously hit $400 million and expect to see an 8-3/8 percent funds rate I think this is going to be a period when we have to be more sensitive to the funds rate I'm all for a slight firming posture and wouldn't want anything else to show through, but the fact of the matter is that this borrowing relationship is pretty weak And I think we're trying to kid ourselves into hitting a borrowing number, unless we're willing to accept a lot of pressure on the funds rate Now, if you're willing to accept that, that's fine But that's not my understanding of what we're trying to do "
3569,1988-12-13," I think you're right I mean, that was a well done explanation And as you pointed out, what resulted was probably not much different, but I think that's because of the flexibility that was pursued by the Desk I really would hate to think of what the    12/13-14/88  result would have been if you had actually tried systematically to produce that borrowing target This is just more evidence in my opinion of the need for flexibility and sensitivity toward the funds rate in situations like this Since I've been here, there have been, in my opinion, more periods of instability in the borrowing function than of stability And so I'm not at all against this procedure as long as it's flexible But trying to blindly pursue that problem target is very hazardous   Actually, I'm not suggesting that I would disapprove of the way the Desk has managed lately I think it was handled with sensitivity--with a sensitivity that I wouldn't mind seeing [in the future] I mean, my concern has always been with a strict borrowing target   This might be too technical as an option, but what I always thought was a possibility would be-- You know, we have an estimated borrowing function; we go through quite a sophisticated analysis to know the econometric equation that estimates the long-term relationship between the funds rate and borrowings, and it seems to me that could be the basis for establishing some sort of expected funds rate range It seems to me that we could still set a borrowing target; however, if the funds rate were to start to vary outside the range predicted by this estimated long-term relationship, and we didn't really know why, then we ought to be more sensitive to the funds rate versus trying to hit some borrowing number That would allow us to pursue a borrowing procedure but be more sensitive to the funds rate when we get outside that expected band I mean, that's not money we are putting in--what Bob Black was saying--but at least there's some scientific reasoning, or rhyme, as to how we were to set the expected range And I think that actually that's about what we've been doing   And I think that's okay; I'm not opposed to it   Well, I don't know what the variants are  -11-    12/13-14/88   Plus or minus?   Well, something like that; we ought to at least look at what the standard deviation is and see if that's within our tolerance   But you know the reality is a point, as long as you move that point enough--that's what Bob is saying You could have an explicit funds rate target, but if you moved it often enough to deal with the problem-- The whole issue really is whether you're willing to move the funds rate And I guess Gary is saying that in the 1970s when this body had explicit funds rate targeting, for some reason it wasn't willing to move the funds rate enough It was always behind I think the question is, if we went back to that, would we be willing to move the funds rate more often? The only issue really is whether we would or not   True, but I tend to agree with Bob Parry The market knows exactly; they scrutinize the funds rate hourly  MR BOEHNE That's true, except if the market were totally logical about it, a half point increase in the discount rate ought to be just equal to a 50 basis point increase in the funds rate, and it isn't   I can see that there are certain announcement effects that are similar to the announcement effects of a change in the discount rate I think that's only because a discount rate change is viewed as an intention by the Fed to lock in the funds rate at that level and put a floor under it So, I think that's why it has that effect--of being considered a Fed decision to make that funds rate a permanent rate and it's not going to be flexible down   Temporarily   I'd say we are more rigid than that right now, even with the full borrowing target, even if we'd be within that   $105 to $106 billion   $1067 billion, something like that   One thing that bothered me a little about the forecast when combining the international side with the domestic side is that--I understand the point about the slowing of the trade adjustment and the expectation of some dollar depreciation--but I'm having a little trouble understanding how that's consistent with our interest rate projections in the forecast We've gotten into this before, but we are talking about a fairly substantial increase in short-term interest rates over the next year or year and a half, and yet there is dollar depreciation My question would be that I don't see those as quite consistent, unless you're arguing that our foreign counterparts move their interest rates in a parallel fashion So, I just wonder what kind of assumption you've got in there   I can understand that scenario if foreign rates were keeping up with US rates, but I guess my next question would be that if that's not the case, then I have some doubts about the exchange rate scenario in the Greenbook But if it is the case, then I was going to ask what we have built in for foreign demand?  -21-    12/13-14/88   But I think part of the reason for the 1987 decline was that rates were moving more sharply abroad than they were here   I think it's more likely than not that the trade balance is not really compatible with our inflation goals It would not surprise me at all if we are left with a fairly large trade deficit by doing the things we need to do to keep inflation down But that means there's a big structural problem and that's really the case You have a big savings-investment imbalance worldwide and that's basically it   I don't want to focus on the dollar entirely, but the conditions under which you get that--; I don't think just running a large trade deficit is going to do it in and of itself if we maintain a policy that keeps inflation down But the other side of that is that the trade numbers aren't going to improve either   Well, it may be possible to have a financeable current account if it's consistent with keeping the inflation rate level I'm not saying that's not possible, I'm just saying that's a close call But I don't know anybody that's saying we can get balance in a short period that's consistent with that  -25-    12/13-14/88   Well, I'm thinking about stable financing I agree that it's possible Central banks can finance the whole thing for a long, long time It's just not consistent with a lot of other stability   I agree with that   Does wonders for the trade account but--   --bad for the budget   Yes, that's true   I'm just following up on what you said there about the thrifts and another possible shock, and this is probably more for Ted, but this interest rate scenario raises questions about the LDCs How do we see that?   Well, what about this recent BA meeting? What did you make of that?   The only things I saw there were things like the headline that they agreed to work in unison this time more than ever in the past and that they [unintelligible]   I guess the question is, though, what happens under this scenario I'm just sort of asking   What I'm trying to draw out of you is a possibility of a shock If there's some sort of consortium in this situation and either a moratorium or something like that, what could be the interbank market effects of that? That's a potential shock I think we ought to be aware of   I'd generally like to associate myself with what Governor LaWare and Governor Kelley said I think everybody made a lot of useful comments, but they captured a lot of what I wanted to say I think generally that the economy is reasonably strong, a little stronger than I probably would have expected at this stage as well But we've all acknowledged that we see some signs of slowing and I think that's probably in the works but at a fairly high level I think we've done a good job in establishing the credibility of monetary policy during this period I say that because I think it is illustrated in the way the financial markets have behaved with long- term rates remaining stable or even showing some signs of declining Commodity prices, while they are at high levels, have plateaued and have trended down some from their peaks if you take them all together The dollar has been relatively stable except for this one speculative period after the elections, but I think it's still about 5 or 6 percent above where we started the year So, in general I think we've pursued a credible policy and haven't been behind the curve, although I agree with what John LaWare said--that part of what we see in the financial markets is the credibility that's based on what they expect us to do And so I think that if you want to maintain the degree of confidence in the financial markets that you see right now, some tightening is probably necessary I'm not opposed to that, but I think it's very important to consider the speed at which we undertake these tightening actions We have to do enough to be credible and to appear to be ahead of the situation, but at the same time we've got to be very careful to consider all of those contingencies that were mentioned by John LaWare, Mike Kelley, others here I happen to have some additional worry about a world-wide ratcheting up of interest rates because I do think Germany is about to move, and I think all of  -50-    12/13-14/88  Europe will follow because of the EMS I think that's already evident out there if you look at the markets and what they are prepared to do Europe is prepared to ratchet up rates right away As a matter of fact, one or two countries already have moved up their discount rate Whether Japan follows or not, I don't know But we are about to move the world level of interest rates up in general and that obviously is going to have some effect on the LDCs It's going to feed back on the thrifts here, equity markets, and all of those things So, taking all these things into consideration, I still think it's probably a necessary move, but we should be very careful about a sledge hammer effect We need to be careful in the pace, that's all   I agree completely with the Chairman's scenario That's the one that I had in mind when I came into the meeting I think it's certainly worth discussing the discount rate, and maybe I can be convinced, but I still feel the best option is the one the Chairman outlined In part, I think if you move on the discount rate, you will run the risk of its seeming to be part of a coordinated world-wide upward ratchet in rates about which I have already expressed some concern But I also have a little concern that if the [new rate] is considered to be sort of the peak [in rates]--I realize that may not be the case for a lot of you--but if it is expected, given the yield curve, that we really have made the final move and the next move will be to lower rates, I think that's going to put some pressure on the dollar Moreover, I don't think it's a bad idea to leave the discount rate hanging in peoples' mind as a means of support for the dollar And so, I see the scenario the Chairman painted as the best one   ""C-""   The third or fourth week   That's a good point because that might be the time  -63-    12/13-14/88   6-1/2 to 10-1/2  -64-    12/13-14/88   I certainly don't care "
3594,1989-02-07," Just one question On this first alternative forecast, what happens in a case where you don't have compensating money growth to try and stay on the base line real GNP forecast and you have an unchanged dollar?   What's the improvement on the price side?   That's why I asked that first question   That's why I asked my first question about the result if we didn't compensate on the money side    2/7-8/89   One last question How much of the base line forecast for real growth is accounted for by net exports? Do you know?    2/7-8/89   I've forgotten what's the implied dollar depreciation?   I have a perspective similar to Governor Heller's I'm just looking at a lot of different things here First, on the unit labor cost side, I realize we've had some acceleration this year; but looking at the charts on the handout we're not at the rate that existed at the end of 1986 And then there was a deceleration in 1987 with some fairly strong growth in the rate of unit labor costs So I don't think there's anything given about an acceleration in unit labor costs If you look at the pattern, it has been fairly sawtoothed since 1984 on this chart; it doesn't show any sign of any particular direction Compensation is up because of non- wage compensation but I don't know whether that will continue Wages are still in pretty good shape, so I don't think there's any accelerating trend on the wage front if non-wage compensation doesn't continue to accelerate  On the employment side, we've had some strong employment numbers But I went back and looked at some of the previous periods and turning points The obvious one is in 1984 when growth was very strong in the first half and then the economy slipped down to 2-1/2 percent and then below 2 percent in the second half of the year We had payroll employment growth averaging over 300,000 all the way through November, even after we hit the turning point; so I'm not sure we're going to get any leading signals out of the employment numbers And there is something else interesting over the two-year period in which we averaged about 2-1/2 percent real growth average payroll employment was about 240,000 per month Now, that doesn't say a whole lot for productivity growth, I admit; but still, I'm not sure what we can read out of the employment growth numbers  There are some other signs of slowing that I see even looking at the charts We have a much slower pattern of new orders, looking at the charts in the nondefense capital goods area; I know that excludes aircraft, but that's a volatile element we're assuming aside Vender performance has been improving Export growth has slowed, thank heaven; it has slowed from a rapid pace, but it certainly has slowed Surveys of plant and equipment spending for 1989 are lower and that's showing in the numbers; from purchasing managers' reports it certainly looks like things are slowing And surveys of other  -19-    2/7-8/89  outside forecasts that have been made indicate that they're similar to the Greenbook's, with some even a little weaker But the important thing is that most of them assume lower interest rate patterns even from here They certainly don't assume the interest rate path that we have built into the Greenbook The Bluechip forecast, which is sort of a consensus forecast, has a similar pattern of growth in inflation but that forecast actually has the funds rate declining later this year So, you get a similar path with a totally different set of interest rate assumptions than ours  Other people have pointed out the financial indicators Real M2 growth and nominal M2 growth are both very modest; real M2 growth is even negative The yield curve is inverted Long bonds are quite well behaved; long-bond rates are well below the funds rate, especially on a coupon basis There are certainly no signs of accelerating inflationary expectations in the financial markets in commodity prices, bonds, or the dollar One thing that worries me a good bit, too, is the fact that a critical part of the Greenbook forecast is the dollar forecast That depreciation in the dollar, as I said, [accounts] for three quarters of a percent of the growth rate in 1990 and that's assuming about a 10 or 13 percent dollar depreciation And that is assumed in spite of the fact that we're assuming about a 1-1/2 percentage point appreciation in short-term interest rates from current levels Not only that, but the interest rate appreciation we assume is not matched by foreign interest rates So I see no way, with relative interest rate appreciation in the United States compared to other countries, that you can possibly have a dollar depreciation with that kind of pattern of interest rates I think if you turn that dollar path around you get a totally different picture out of the Greenbook forecast It was pointed out in some of the alternatives--if you look at the one that assumes no change in the dollar, and I wouldn't even bet on that with the kind of interest rate path we have built into the Greenbook--that if you don't accelerate money growth to offset the impact on the real sector you get substantially weaker growth and moderation in the inflation rate from these levels That's a scenario that looks more plausible to me than the one we have built in there So I would say, trying to take into account those lags and being conscious of some of these other possibilities, that we ought to be very cautious about them   What velocity assumptions go with that?   Right   But a decline in the rate of change--in the growth rate of velocities--right?   I was just thinking that I would expect the rate of growth maybe to settle down to the zero rate   Yes I'll start off by saying that I prefer that same option for a couple of reasons One is that it's still a full percentage point reduction in the midpoint of the range from what we had last year, which I think is a stronger statement than we normally make Going from a 4 to 8 percent range to a 3 to 7 percent range is a strong statement by historical standards I realize that M2 growth, certainly if the interest rate scenario that we follow ends us being close to the Greenbook forecast, puts us closer to the bottom of that range But that interest rate path assumption is an extreme case, in my opinion And that's allowed for in the 3 to 7 percent range; it still leaves us 1/2 percentage point above the [bottom of the] range, based on our estimates of M2 growth I think it's possible that we may hit a peak in interest rates at some point this year short of what the staff has forecast If interest rates stabilize, or even fall because of some weakness in the economy or whatever else we run into, we could see more M2 growth Certainly that would be offset by the velocity adjustments to that and we would want to be able to allow for that It seems to me that a 3 to 7 percent range accommodates all those specific concerns As Don pointed out, the one thing it doesn't seem to accommodate is an even tighter policy than may be allowed for in the Greenbook forecast In that case, I think we'd see much slower M2 growth But I think that outcome is very unlikely and 3 to 7 percent or something like that fits clearly into my point of view I even think that's a pretty strong statement in and of itself 3 to 7 percent   If it's the savings part of M2 it could just as easily go into T-Bills   It doesn't have to go into transaction accounts   Yes, that's an important sentence   Of the aggregates  -41-    2/7-8/89   I would prefer not to say that   Well, let's--   You can always say that if it's necessary to take interest rates higher we will end up at the low end or if interest rates stabilize or go lower we'll end up in the upper part  SPEAKER(?) Why say that?   Well, we don't have to say it But I'm just saying that we could say there's some basis for why we would end up in different places  -43-    2/7-8/89   I'm not worried   9 to 9-1/8   Thanks I also support what the Chairman said I'm comfortable with maintaining current policy but in an asymmetric way I still think the risks potentially are on the up side I just think that with the existing information there isn't any basis at this time for further tightening We may have to tighten further but I think we ought to leave that to some sort of discretion, some sort of judgment about how events unfold as time goes on Based on today I certainly don't see that as necessary, for a lot of the reasons that I said yesterday which I won't go back over again I do have a view, though, that on the long end of the yield curve--even though the nominal rate has come down--we have had a fairly significant appreciation in long-term real rates Now, there are different ways to look at that and I don't want to suggest that any one way is better than the other My general view, though, is that there has been a significant rise in long-term real rates If you follow the Hoey survey, it suggests that the 10-year bond rate has gone up 2-1/2 percentage points in real terms since mid-1987 And I don't think that's insignificant It depends on how much stock you put in the Hoey survey; it's just one particular measure But I think Don made a good point in his briefing that the slowdown in corporate bond issuance is also a pretty good indicator that long-term real rates are not completely neutral in this whole process People wouldn't be  -52-    2/7-8/89  cutting back on corporate bond issuance if they thought their internal rate of return was better than the existing long-term yields So, I think that's a good point I don't think there's anything sacred about the yield curve in terms of inflation expectations I think basically all that says is that the markets are betting that short- term rates in the future are going to be lower than they are today I think you really have to isolate more on the long bond itself to get some sort of notion of what they're thinking It doesn't necessarily mean lower inflation expectations; it does mean that they think the short rates are going to be lower in the future for various reasons Maybe it's just that they think they are not going to keep up with movements in the short rates It's not the be-all/end-all of the evidence; there's no doubt about that  Putting it all together, I think you're absolutely right, Jerry, about the dollar Something does eventually have to give if the dollar keeps appreciating But I think the central point there is that if the dollar does keep appreciating what will ultimately give is the current account and the economy, to some extent My point is that if the dollar is going to be appreciating I don't see the scenario that's in our Greenbook forecast You would have a much weaker economic picture under that kind of a scenario than you would under one with dollar depreciation--and totally different implications for the domestic economy and inflation rate And that certainly leaves you with a worsening current account in exports under those conditions That's some risk But that leads me to want to be very cautious at this time And I think an asymmetric position is probably the best one   I assume that there's an implied management approach by the Desk that goes with ""B"" It's what Don reported on    2/7-8/89  Now, I don't know what that means It means being more sensitive to the funds rate but obviously there's some play in it   It doesn't mean any persistent upward pressure But I think everybody agrees it doesn't mean a decline in rates from the current level   That's what's in there   Asymmetric language always means that "
3620,1989-03-28," This is the meeting when officer nominations are usually made So, I'd like to open the meeting by asking for nominations for the Chairman of the FOMC and then the Vice Chairman We're open for nominations   Let's get on with this   All right We have nominations for Chairman Alan Greenspan and Vice Chairman Gerald Corrigan All those in favor?  SPEAKER(?) Enthusiastically   I think it goes without saying that we have some outstanding nominations We're ready to proceed, Mr Chairman   Second    3/28/89   I'll second that   So move   Second   I heard what you said, Sam, about Germany but that explanation still doesn't strike me as justifying completely why they have been so reluctant to move A lot of people seem to be scratching their heads about Germany's behavior relative to inflationary pressures and the fact that they have been sitting back and letting the mark depreciate I know it has been pretty stable over the intermeeting period in general But I think the feeling has been What's going on in Germany compared to their previous behavior?   But isn't it, though, just the Danish that are down there? The lira--   It just still seems strange, given that nobody paid too much attention when the Italians were way below the band and just hovered there for heaven knows [how long]   Well, it was a special arrangement    3/28/89   Not to prolong this, but what's rotten in Denmark?   They probably believed the long-term rates were going to rise   I don't know that you look [unintelligible]   Well, by definition a hedge is a hedge It  just depends [on whether it was] something they thought was a hedge   A couple One Just looking at the forecast, which has been revised since last time although it's not dramatically different, you have real GNP slowing significantly by the third quarter of 1989 It averages about 12 percent from the third quarter of 1989 through 1990 We have gotten into these arguments before about what potential is but I think everybody agrees that that's well below whatever anybody is thinking of as potential And that's for a fairly significant period of time Yet we don't see any improvement on the inflation side The lags are longer I guess than would show up on here But exactly what do we expect, ultimately, on the inflation rate from a forecast that has that kind of slack built into it over a prolonged period? Clearly, it's not showing up in the numbers here When does it show up?   I know, but there's a year of that kind of slack And I just wondered--   But if you're just saying that we're moving to the natural rate why would you get below potential growth on that?   Yes, I know I'm--  -12-    3/28/89   Again, what happens ultimately? What is the ultimate inflation path that we get out of this scenario?   There is one other point I wanted to ask I asked this last time but I'll ask it again I was looking at our forecast compared to the Bluechip consensus I know what was circulated showed some other forecasts besides the Bluechip one, but those are all contained in the Bluechip so I'm comparing that one with ours We have very similar forecasts on real GNP and inflation But once again they expect a decline in short-term interest rates by the second quarter whereas we're saying they need to go a percentage point higher Any comment on that?   I don't really have much to add We got a rash of weaker indicators for the month of February, where almost across the board all of the data suggested a weakening But we don't know  -31-    3/28/89  whether that is weather-related or not because of the strong data for January There certainly are some signs of slowing I agree it's too early to assess whether things are significantly slowing or whether this is establishing some sort of trend Real personal consumption expenditures seem to have been on a modest track for more than just one month and the order books on capital goods seem to have been moving at a moderate pace for several months now So, I think those are promising signs But I don't think there are any indications of things going overboard on the weak side Or, at least if they are starting to slow down quite a bit, we only have one month's observation It's too early to make any judgment one way or the other on that I think the inflation news recently has been disappointing; but at the same time we knew these lags were built in Those forces were set in place long ago and we've got to look forward So the question is whether we have put in place strong enough policy that, with a lag, we're going to get the results we're looking for That's the key question I don't think anyone knows this for sure; but we have moved quite significantly over the last intermeeting period and we will just have to see Economically, I think we are in an uncertain period   Just one On the Hoey survey, was that last survey taken before or after our discount rate [action]?   It's a February survey number   Okay That's all I need   I'd just follow up on that, Mr Chairman That's pretty much the way I see it As I said in my statement just before the coffee break, I think there are certainly some signs of slowing but not enough to feel that a clear trend has been established, although I think we have enough observations on new orders and in the real consumption area to suspect that things are at least slowing or moderating Whether that will be sufficient is  -34-    3/28/89  certainly not clear at this stage But, given the fact that we have just recently moved fairly significantly on policy, I think we at least ought to wait a while to see how those lags work out I think it's probably still true that the risks are somewhat asymmetric, so I can certainly go along with an asymmetric policy position in terms of our pause "
3646,1989-05-16," Sam, you mentioned that one thing that may be driving this is the expected capital gains, given the anticipation that the peak in interest rates is close You may be right, but I guess one of the things that bothers me a little about that explanation is that the bill market and the bond market have been anticipating a turn of events for a while That's why long bond rates are below short rates, or the funds rate, right now; and bill rates have drifted down on the expectation of lower rates I guess my question then is Are the capital gains already there? They are already taking capital gains; would there be a further advantage that would cause people to rush into bonds at this point?   So move   Just one, related to the intervention activity You may have mentioned it and I just missed it but have all the dollar sales had much of an impact on our open market operations?   I guess what I'm asking is Has that added any uncertainty to the market in terms of what our reserve need is?   Okay   So move  SPEAKER(?) Second   Mike, I can't resist asking this question again that I've been asking every time I'm not just looking at the Blue Chip forecast but I'm reading the financial markets and what they seem to be saying They have been giving us a slightly different picture for some time now and I've been asking this question You have been saying basically that you think the market will come back to the  -13-    5/16/89  forecast--that the market is probably wrong and that you are sticking to your forecast I just wondered if you're still willing to say that; it sounds like you're hedging a little more The Blue Chip forecast has the funds rate peaking this quarter and then going down, but they have about the same GNP forecast You suggest that the data available recently are showing maybe a slightly weaker case, although what will happen over the next few quarters is uncertain, of course But I just wondered if you feel any differently about the market's reading of the outlook as compared to the forecast?   Yes As a follow-up to that, I think maybe you're a little less concerned that this slowing relative to the forecast is a permanent feature You think it might bounce back some and, therefore, you've got this further rise in interest rates built into your assumptions But--   I think I know what your answer would be, but let's just assume that the economy is running below your forecast It seems to me that an additional 75 basis points or so on the funds rate, if you project that against this weaker forecast, puts you in the recession category Now, I don't know what you think, but it seems like that would clearly tip the economy over; maybe it wouldn't   Sure I'm simply suggesting that if the data continue to come in weaker than the forecast, I think your interest rate scenario would go with a stronger interpretation  -14-    5/16/89   But that interest rate scenario would be, I think, somewhat tougher to follow   I'd like to associate myself with those people who generally view the current environment as satisfactory The evidence clearly is showing a slowing in economic activity In my opinion it has gone beyond the stage where this might be a temporary situation I think it is [likely to be] sustained And I think the slowdown in domestic demand or consumer spending is a desirable feature that we've been looking for Like Governor Angell, I think getting that excess demand out of the economic system with our policy frees up our capacity for other uses in our export sector and capital goods, which is something we've desired The inflationary picture looks more promising than we might have expected, although I don't want to make too much of any one month's number But going beyond just the April CPI, I think the wage patterns are better than what we might have expected, even taking into account the Bethlehem Steel [settlement] I've seen some reports--as a matter of fact I asked the  -28-    5/16/89  International Division to report on this because I wanted to know if the VRAs had anything to do with the wage pattern The report I got back was generally ""no""--that basically this wage settlement involved some catch-up on big productivity increases in the past and some of the very slow wage growth or even give-backs that had been imposed earlier So I think there are some one-time features in there The actual change of the wage base, I think, is very small At least the report I got back was that that was not a discouraging wage negotiation There are a lot of good signs The April PPI, of course, was a real positive feature If you add that one month in, the trend in the PPI, excluding the [volatile] components like food and energy, so far this year is below last year I think that's an encouraging sign At the very least you can say that ex-food and energy the underlying producer price growth is not accelerating It may even be a bit more modest than last year  As others have said, the risk has certainly shifted from being on the up side to being more balanced I put myself in that camp and maintain more of a neutral position at this point But I do want to emphasize what Governor Angell and others have said It would be a risk to perceive a neutral policy, and one that is balanced, as one with a steady funds rate To me the great success of our actions last year in achieving what we wanted has been our ability to move the funds rate Some people want to talk about this in terms of the aggregates; but my view is that our willingness to be flexible on interest rates and to move them subject to changing conditions has been the reason we have been able to stay ahead of this process and contain inflationary pressures That means that we show flexibility with respect to interest rates rather than targeting some interest rate level And I think that is important to keep in mind That means that a neutral policy in a weaker situation or a slowing situation is not a steady interest rate, just as steady interest rates weren't the answer when we were restraining policy We need to keep that in mind because as credit demands start to slow we could easily see maintaining the same level of interest rates as a drain on reserves and ultimately on the monetary aggregates--if you want to look at it from the point of view of the monetary aggregates Anyway, that's my point of view   Don, that was an interesting briefing What did you say in the beginning about the yield curve? I didn't quite hear that   Is that the dotted line?   Oh, I see I'm sorry  -30-    5/16/89   Okay I've got you   Wouldn't you say more that they're expecting some easing?   Okay Also, one other thing on these inflation expectations measures those were April surveys?   So they don't really contain any of the April data?   Okay   Yes, I see   Okay, thanks   I have a technical question, though, that I need to ask as a follow up on what you said Going back to the open market operations report and looking at the borrowing, we've been operating under a $500 million [borrowing assumption] for a while and borrowings actually have been running close to $600 million since mid- April Is that right?   The weekly averages here are $612, $612, $582, and $581 million What I'm saying is If we didn't concern ourselves with the borrowing target then, why should we be concerned about it now? We ran at $500 million and didn't worry about it [coming in higher]   All right Just for the record I wanted to make it known   That's what the markets say   '87   Oh, '88   I have some sympathy for what Tom is saying However, I certainly support the Chairman's view for symmetric language My concern is also Exactly what does no change in policy mean and what do we really mean by symmetry? But I basically support ""B"" Again, I'm not hung up on the borrowing number whatsoever I would define ""B"" as a 6-3/4 percent funds rate--I mean 9-3/4; I hope that's not a Freudian slip--a 9-3/4 percent funds rate and I would like to be more clearly focused on centering it there rather than letting it edge towards the upper end of that I am concerned about this neutrality issue; if bill rates and other short-term interest rates stay down over the intermeeting period and don't show a tendency to bounce back toward the funds rate, I certainly would think that trying to remain neutral would imply bringing the funds rate more in line with those rates I would like to think that symmetric language would mean that the Chairman would have the discretion during the intermeeting period to make some adjustments there I certainly think that that fits into a symmetric and neutral policy But for the purposes of listing my position it would be ""B;"" 6-3/4--rather 9-3/4 percent; and symmetric I wrote that 6-3/4 percent down for some reason! "
3671,1989-06-05," That shows up in the [index for] wages, Bob   No, it went down   Yes, I would like to back up what Governor Angell said and also acknowledge what Bob Parry said I see this as an appropriate move and not at all inconsistent with our long-term goal of getting the inflation rate down I think we can easily make the mistake of seeing the fed funds rate and the level of short-term interest rates as a target and not an instrument I thought we all basically had taken the position in the past that we don't want to target the level of short-term interest rates--that we see movements in interest rates rather as an instrument of our long-run goals If that is the case, there are going to be times when we see the funds rate come under both downward pressure and upward pressure I don't see having to reverse this at some point--if in fact that's the way things develop--as inconsistent at all I think it would be a much worse mistake simply to worry about stabilizing the level of interest rates and to view any change from that level as a tightening or easing of policy I don't think it is at all "
3688,1989-07-05," So, you're talking about whether there is a limit as to how much sterilized intervention we would do as a matter of policy   But that question, it seems to me, involves our relationship with the Treasury as agent and whether we could do anything we wanted to That's a big legal question and it gets into all kinds of issues; I've asked those questions before too It's not very clear   I don't think that was what Lee was saying He's saying, as a matter of policy, is sterilized intervention something that you want to do and are there limits to that? I don't think he's talking about capital gains   Still, the interesting question would be, just hypothetically, if we stated that the Federal Reserve would no longer do any intervention for [unintelligible] what would that mean? I'm not sure it would make any difference   That's the problem   Seconded   I'd like to follow up with a question I keep asking every time The interest rate assumptions behind this forecast are generally for higher interest rates into 1990--both short and long rates, but more on the short than the long Still, if you go back to the February FOMC meeting, I think there was an assumption of a pickup in long rates of up to 1 percentage point from about the 9 percent level then prevailing and of about 1-1/2 percentage points on the funds rate Since that time interest rates appear to have peaked; long rates are down about 75 basis points from where they were then, instead of up Short rates appear to be peaking out well short of that range If the economy has slowed more than anticipated--although I'd have to go back and check that--and if the inflation forecast is maybe even a little lower than anticipated back at that point, what has changed? How do you explain that?   On that point interest rates on the long-end have been trending down for a while, yet the economy hasn't shown any signs of being stimulated by that   Well, I think there's--   Okay But I think there is some modest downward trend in long rates; if you draw a line through the fluctuations, I think you can see that The other point, though, is that rates are considerably lower relative to where you were forecasting them and yet you have weaker GNP   That's fine But why haven't those relatively low interest rates had some stimulative effect, with a lag? They have  -10-    7/5-6/89  been lower than you forecast for a considerable period of time I assume what you're saying is that the dollar has offset that   So going forward, assuming the dollar is not going to appreciate--you even have some depreciation--are you saying, then, that that represents a decline in real interest rates and some stimulus to the economy?   Okay, I'm having a little trouble assuming--   I think I understand your logic   I just had to, Mike!   I'd say much more after today   But all that's within a month   The one-month forward funds rate is closing in on what?   Okay   If you look at the bill market they are   I'm getting a little more concerned about the economic situation since we met last time Starting on the same day that we made our modest change in borrowing, June 5th, we got a whole series of data that I think have become a little more troubling On June 5th auto sales came out and were marked down from May over the previous April by about 2/10ths of a million units Today when we get the report for June I think the numbers will be down again And auto production schedules have been cut back some since that time On June 13th we got reports on real retail sales, which were down 7/10ths of a percent; and that was the fourth month in a row of negative real sales On June 15th industrial production came out and had increased 0 percent Capacity utilization was marked down On June 16th we got housing starts, which were down for May by about 21 percent And permits stayed unchanged at a fairly low level On the 23rd of June we got new orders for durable goods, which were down 4-1/2 percent for May; nondefense capital goods orders were down 86 percent for May, and excluding aircraft they were down about 32 percent Real  -19-    7/5-6/89  personal consumption, which came out the same day, was down 03 percent, and real personal income was down 02 percent On June 28th we got leading indicators, which were down 12 percent; they were down in three out of the last four months Then, most recently, we got the purchasing managers' survey, which showed new orders for June actually negative for the first time in a long time Vendor performance for June for the first time in a long, long time showed actual faster deliveries, not just a slowing in the rate of increase [of backlogs] Prices paid were also down below the 0 line, showing an actual decline for the first time That's a whole string of data And that's starting to look like a deterioration  These data are all just series of information that are incorporated in the financial markets even more We have seen it build up over the last several weeks The yield curve has gotten more negative Bond rates now are down quite sharply; they closed in on the 8 percent rate for a while and for the 30-year bond they're still around 812 percent, or something like that If you put the fed funds rate on a coupon basis, the yield curve is inverted by almost 2 full percentage points The markets are clearly expecting lower future rates by a considerable amount The bill market has even started to discount more sizable moves than I would imagine Now, maybe it's just a lot of noise lately, but the bill market is down 20 basis points today Looking at the traditional relationship between rates on bills and fed funds, which builds in a spread of about 3/4 of a point, if you take into account where bills are today the market is discounting almost a full percentage point decline in the funds rate There may be some noise in there, for sure But the fact is there's a fairly sizable discounting going on in the markets, based on a string of data like this and a lot of information that's coming through What worries me about it is that once that psychology starts developing--and the longer the short end of the market is held up--the more future interest rate declines are anticipated Once you get that psychology in the market investors start postponing investment projects expecting rates to go even lower Consumers quit financing consumption because they expect to finance consumption at an even lower rate in the future And this situation starts feeding on itself The postponement of activity due to expected future declines in rates will continue as long as the short end of the market is being shored up so high above the long end I think that's one of the risks Now, if nothing happens what worries me is that markets could become disorderly at some point A string of data like this and a feeling that the market is not realigning itself on the short end with expectations on the long end at some point could make the stock market vulnerable to flight That's what I worry about Whether this will continue is not clear But I see a very troubling series of trends going on   Don, I need a review; you may have mentioned it but go over it one more time One of my concerns is that if we are beginning a period of declining interest rates, clearly, we're going to see behavior in velocity symmetric to the increase we've had over the period of rising interest rates; we're going to see a declining velocity growth Would you review again, just as a rule of thumb, what the lags are on, say, a 100 basis point decline in interest rates? What would that do to M2 growth or to the M2 money demand I guess is the way to put it? What kind of lags are there before they catch up?   So 100 basis points would yield 2 percentage points in growth over a couple of quarters?   One of my concerns is that, given the lags, if we started a sustained period of declines in interest rates--even if we were shooting for 5-1/2 percent or so nominal growth next year--we might end up having to absorb 2 full percentage points or more of extra M2 growth because of the effects on velocity just to hit that nominal target If that's what you think--   That's what I was saying   I'm in favor of extending the existing ranges   So move   I agree with a lot of the other comments I favor extending the current [M2] range of 3 to 7 percent for 1990 I find that acceptable, although I do think there is some risk that we may test the upper end of that   Yes I'm just saying alternative II; I can't remember now what the other two were   Alternative II is what I favor; I can live with that I agree with Gary that I don't see exactly how we make this twist on M3 and debt but I've never paid any attention to those anyway I can accept alternative II   That's right; I would take that too I do agree that in the long run the ranges should come down I think Governor Angell is right that 1 to 5 percent probably makes sense in the longer run If you're going to have nominal GNP that's consistent with something like price stability, and if the long-run trend on M2 velocity is around 0, then you want an M2 range that has a nominal GNP associated with price stability and you've got to be in that area somewhere But I think we're a ways from that And I think, as Ed Boehne said, one of our major functions is to avoid destabilizing the economy in the process of seeking this goal of price stability So, for those reasons, the 3 to 7 percent range for '90 makes some sense, even though I think we could find ourselves well above that target if we go through a sustained period of declining interest rates But I think it's a reasonable target and worth trying to hit  I can't help making one last comment, though, on this whole exercise about monetary aggregates The way in which we conduct monetary policy, these monetary aggregates are simply passive proxies for what the economy generates through money demand This is not a money supply process We are setting interest rates and the economy  -40-    7/5-6/89  is reacting to those interest rates and it's demanding money; and that's the way it works We are not setting any money supply goal and supplying that amount of reserves to make sure [we achieve it] I'm not saying I disagree with that; I'm simply saying that that's the way it works And we shouldn't kid ourselves and think that we're supplying levels that are being generated through our policy I couldn't help that last comment   I'd have to think about that   So move   I'll just follow up on that I agree--   Well, this is a reaction to that I think it's true that the market is discounting a fairly immediate 25 basis point move But if you go a little further out--and I agree with what you're saying, Tom--the market is discounting more than a point in the bill market And I don't--   There is normally about a 3/4 point spread, if you just take the average between the Treasury bill rate and the fed funds rate; and the Treasury bill rate now is about 775 percent   What is the rate?  SPEAKER(?) 88 percent   Okay, I'm sorry   Sure What I'm saying--   Yes, I think that's about right I'm saying that's what the bill market has built in Now, it clearly looks like an overshoot to me of where we want to be; but I'm simply saying that's where the market is   It did You've got--   Well, it closed the spread quite narrowly a couple of times   No, not quite that much; but when we were perceived [as] behind by the market in catching up to inflationary expectations we did get a fairly significant closing of the spread   I don't think it ever has been discounted a point over the funds rate   You could argue that that's related to the speed with which the Fed moves with the market   How would you feel if we moved 25 basis points and bond rates fell further?   Yes   I think that's right Maybe it would stiffen it; I think that would be the impression   Okay That's what I'm saying   No, I think that's--   You recalibrated the $650 million for what alternative?   Okay, right   It doesn't sound like the old formula, but that's okay   That's all right   Yes, okay   But, Wayne, this is ex-oil Would you be forecasting an ex-oil CPI turning point?   Well, I think it's reasonable   I agree with the Chairman on his proposal, although my preference probably would have been 50 basis points on the funds rate phased in over two periods, because I do think caution is certainly needed in the immediate period I think we ought to test how the market absorbs 25 basis points before we consider any further moves As Don Kohn pointed out, if you go further out, the market clearly has discounted well over 50 basis points in terms of what they expect us to do over a period of time, which is certainly within the  -55-    7/5-6/89  period between meetings So, my preference would have been to plan to take another step based on how the markets developed between here and there I generally think asymmetric language would be preferable, but I can go with the symmetry I still want to express a concern, though I think we always became quite concerned with where we were relative to the markets when we were tightening--when the markets perceived us to be behind on the inflation fight--and we moved fairly aggressively to catch up and even tried to stay ahead at times, which I think was critical to our gaining credibility I think that problem works in reverse If we lose the confidence of the markets that we are going to pursue a stable policy and keep up with changes and events, we're going to run the risk on the down side that we were worried about on the up side I don't think we're there; but I think that problem is simmering out there for us I don't think we're anywhere near finding ourselves in a situation like this, but the problem I worry about in the back of my head is that the Fed drove interest rates gradually down to 0 in the 1930s and it didn't do a blessed thing to stop the economy's decline Getting into that kind of a mentality is a risky situation, so I think we need some [asymmetry] both on the down side and the up side But I can go along with your funds rate   I agree with that   Well, the reality of it is clearly ""slightly""   I would prefer ""somewhat"" but that would go with a different change "
3714,1989-08-22," All of Europe is on vacation   Second    8/22/89   But [unintelligible], I think, is the issue   Compounding   At least two   Following up on that Do we know how much of that authorization has been borrowed already?   I think borrowings may be $5 or $6 billion Is that where it--  -13-    8/22/89   Yes, I understand, but I mean relative to what you had expected   Yes   Difficulties and errors   I'd wait 'til the end of the day   Just a couple of things First, you mentioned that you thought demand was going to be rather buoyant, and I'm having a little trouble with that I see it picks up somewhat in the second half of the year and I think some of that is auto related--certainly, the third quarter is Then you have it coming off in durables in the fourth quarter, but nondurables are much stronger relative to the past What's causing that nondurable consumption [growth]? It has been trending down and all of a sudden it leaps up in the second half   But that's a level adjustment You were talking earlier about unchanged growth rates, and I'm wondering why that would affect the growth rate   Okay, I see it   It's jumping all over the place   Yes, thanks   Now, let me ask What is the difference between gross domestic purchases and just the private domestic final purchases? Is that taking out imports?   Okay Another question I had was on your mention of housing starts and some potential pickup There have been some really marginal upticks in [starts], but permits have continued to trend down Even with the Board staff's adjustment, they're still somewhat below starts I just wondered, with permits continuing on that trend, whether starts would show a turnaround I know they are both sort of contemporaneous indicators but I would think that starts would adjust to permits, not vice versa   That's what I meant to say, statistics   No, except that they haven't shown any turnaround   Well, that's sort of what I wanted to follow up on, Mike I can understand what you're saying, looking at the permit trends and realizing that you've got a turnaround in starts and  -20-    8/22/89  housing investment, but in the broader picture on total investment-- even when you take into account some of the revisions on orders--the orders data are very weak And when you look at the fact that long- term interest rates have been down for quite some time now and have been trending down over a fairly long period--I guess they peaked out last August, about a year ago--   Right But there certainly has been no expectation of long rates rising more than expected They had been trending down gradually, and then more recently declined more, I guess Yet there is no sign of a pickup in orders or anything that looks like that's having [an effect], forward looking, on investment demand   The level is about the same   Regardless of the zigs and zags, if you just look at the current level--even taking today's numbers into account--I remember that the level looked about the same as it was 8 months ago There has been some volatility month-to-month, but the fact is that the level is roughly unchanged over a half a year   Yes, well--   Yes If you look at it over a long period of time, I think you can run a regression right through the turning points and get a nice upward slope But the point is that we have to worry about the [turning] points   True; and I don't disagree with that Now, I have one other question, for Ted You talked about the widening of the current account later on, and that leaves some of the reason for the dollar depreciation assumptions out With the revisions, the current account and the trade numbers are dramatically down with the deficit I just wondered Why doesn't that really work in the opposite direction and support a stronger dollar over the horizon?   All I'm saying is, if you take that seriously, that we would have hoped the models were predicting 110 on the yen a year ago or so   Yes But I would say that the perceptions created by numbers like that [are one of] the reasons why interest differentials have worked one way and the dollar is going the other way to some extent It's surprising I think everybody has been grasping for reasons why the dollar has continued to hold up this well and even strengthened when interest differentials were working against it And I would venture to say that improvements on the current account both in actuality and prospectively may be a major factor in that; rather than working against the dollar it may be one of the things supporting it   No, all I'm saying is that you may be at a point where people say Hey, this thing is ultimately financeable now How the financial burden, if we proceed--   The current account deficit   Yes, that's what I was alluding to   However big it is, Ted, it's a lot smaller than what people thought it was earlier, I think   Well, it's smaller So what I'm saying is that the market people see the financing requirements as less than they did before   Well, if you play that scenario out you come up with all kinds of [unintelligible] But I think it matters what it's being used for, what you're doing with it There are plenty of countries that finance that quite easily as long as it's going for sustainable private-sector investment   But it's all relative to the return on the investment   The recent revisions of some elements of the lagging data suggest that things certainly have been decelerating as much as would have appeared earlier I'm comforted by that; it made my vacation a little easier knowing that the situation looked a little better than I had expected But even taking that into account, all the forward looking data still are pointing toward a further decelerating situation--not that I think it's decelerating at an accelerating rate As a matter of fact, I think it may even have slowed its pace of decline But my view is that the forward-looking data still show [a deceleration] except for maybe the growth numbers in M2 recently, which have shown some turnaround I think that is interesting and positive, yet the reserve aggregates and the base don't really show that kind of turnaround; there's some uptick but not very much at all So I just wonder how much noise there is in terms of shuffling of accounts in the M2 numbers and the response to the change in opportunity costs from the recent decline in the funds rate  But I am generally encouraged by the situation We have been seeking moderation in the pace of domestic demand and I think we are seeing that It's what we want, and I think that over the longer run we're going to see the inflation results I'm more optimistic that we're going to see that in the intermediate term and not have to wait quite as long as in the Greenbook forecast But if we're going to see that we're going to have to remain in a fairly restrained monetary policy posture My major concern, though, is that we still may be in too restrained a posture The yield curve is still inverted; the commodity prices are starting to shift sides and breaking on the down  -37-    8/22/89  side; the dollar is continuing to show strength My basic concern is that as long as the funds rate is the highest rate in town we're going to continue to run into weakness on the expansion side as we continue to absorb money and credit, at least in base terms Credit aggregates are continuing to decelerate As I said earlier in my questions, I still don't see any real signs of a pickup in investment on the horizon I don't see signs of a turnaround; there may be a temporary pause and some slowing of the deceleration My worry is that that will continue on I guess the good news is that we have more time to think about that than we did in the past But we still have to be vigilant on that front   I totally agree with that and my sentiments on policy directly relate to that The biggest mistake we could make is to get ourselves into a situation where we are over-stimulative with monetary policy and end up aggressively easing But, I have a slight preference--well, I shouldn't say slight--I have a preference for asymmetric policy toward ease I agree that alternative B is the right stance for now I base that mainly on the notion that I still see our policy as relatively tight The funds rate is still well above other rates If you look at the movement of other market rates that react to expectations of future funds rates, as Don and Peter and others reported, the market is still anticipating some easing of policy based on the existing data that they have seen, including the recent revisions Now, those expectations have been postponed, I think, from the immediate future out to one or two months ahead But  -42-    8/22/89  those expectations still clearly fall in the intermeeting period So, my concern is that the market is still poised for some easing rather than a neutral policy And I think it's basing those expectations on the data [market participants] have seen on the economy and what they think appropriate policy would be Not that that's always right; obviously, the markets are wrong from time-to-time But I do think that the markets, including the stock market, are poised for what they expect to be lower future funds rates; and as Don pointed out I think, they are expecting to see that some time during the intermeeting period We could easily cause the markets to back off If the data come out suggesting that that's the appropriate policy, that's okay But I think the stock market and the bond market would be somewhat vulnerable if those expectations are frustrated with no change in the trend in the daily [unintelligible]  So, my concern is that the economy is still gradually winding down and that that requires an asymmetry There are some slight downside risks and we need to be prepared to be flexible during the intermeeting period, in my opinion, to lean toward an easier policy By all means I want to stress that I don't think we should be aggressive in that I think we are not running a neutral policy now, but a relatively tight policy, and that's still going to have lagged effects on the economy I would like to get us to a neutral position, one where we're not stimulative but we're certainly not restraining the economy at these levels What we see now looks very good, but I think the trend is still headed down So, my preference is asymmetry; but if the consensus is for symmetry I certainly wouldn't vote against that   Yes, I'd like to hear the language one more time   No, the progress toward--   Yes, I know I wanted to hear it just one more time   Okay "
3740,1989-10-03," Sam, there were a couple of things that I thought didn't come through quite clearly in your report First of all, the G-7 Communique said it looked like the dollar was out of line with existing fundamentals I certainly disagree with that, but I guess one could debate that point But what the Communique also said, specifically in follow-up language, was that the G-7 would consider it counterproductive if the dollar rose above current levels or fell sharply In terms of exchange rate strategy, my understanding was that there was certainly no implication in there about a concerted attack on the dollar You mentioned that the strategy was generally to resist upward pressure, but there were times repeatedly when there was a concerted effort to drive the dollar lower and then, as it ratcheted down, to hammer it when it even started to show any upward pressure from lower levels So, I think it's a bit of a semantic issue to talk about resisting upward pressure when in fact it was a clear strategy to ratchet down the dollar Even though there were not massive levels of dollars sold, that kind of strategy--especially when we've never participated in Far Eastern markets on a regular basis--in my opinion was just grossly destabilizing I thought it was a scary event, and I can't see us condoning that sort of a strategy I think it's potentially very, very dangerous    10/3/89   Well, let me ask a question Is there any kind of technical agreement within the G-7 on a targeted band on exchange rates now? I'm certainly not aware of any And if there is, what is it specifically?   There is no quantitative understanding about ranges?   Well then, how did you know where you were going?   What was your objective?   But where?   Just put yourself in the position of somebody in the market If the market concluded that what the Communique meant was that the G-7 wanted a lower dollar, that is [not the same as] resisting [a rise] from current levels So they're trying to figure out where the fundamentals are; what is the target that goes along with the fundamentals? It sounds like even we don't know There is not even an understanding about where the dollar ought to be   Well, since there was no notion on where the dollar should be but there was a commitment of dollars, what would have happened if the dollar had collapsed and yet you'd only spent a third of your commitment?   You would just keep spending it?   But where do you stop?   Well, if that's the case, I think it's even more dangerous than I thought it was when I first started this conversation We spent $400 million and we intervened five times in the market yesterday with the dollar down to around 139 for the yen and 187 on the D-mark, and yet we don't know where we're going   Well, up a fraction   Hearing this description, I think there's a risk that risk premiums are going to continue to grow With as much uncertainty as there is in here, you can imagine the uncertainty that might be out in the market if we can't even figure out what's going on   Well, I realize there is a resistance to a lot of the [intervention] strategy here [among Committee members], but I think we ought to step up that resistance   The market thinks so   I don't say that I recognize that there are imbalances The question is whether they can be financed or not; nobody knows The market is deciding they can and we are trying to second guess the world economy--   But why should central banks be participating in this exercise? First of all, we've been making statements about price stability now to the point where I think we have almost been a ""johnny-one-note"" on that issue And people, I think, are starting to believe us For us to be countering that with this ridiculous approach just doesn't make sense; [it introduces] a potential doubt out there If central banks continue to participate in this kind of strategy and show even a compromise on it, I think to some extent the markets are going to say this is a joke--in fact, they are balancing the goals of the current account versus price stability Now, my position is well known in wanting to go gradually on this goal; but I sure don't have any current account goals ahead of our goals on price stability And I think we'd be announcing to the world that we are at least equally concerned about bringing the international current account into balance as we are about conditions of domestic inflation   But that is the question   Let me say, Bob, that if that's the case, I think we're going through a silly exercise in approving limits What's the FOMC meeting on this issue for? Why do we even care about it? Let's just turn over open market operations on foreign exchange to the Treasury What are we going through this silly exercise for if we don't have something to say about it?   But it is just--   Well, we have an account in which we acquire exchange reserves and we are supposed to have authority over that account As Bob Black said, we certainly we have a responsibility to serve as agent for the Treasury in their actions on foreign exchange And the last thing I would want to do is question that authority We can certainly do what they instruct us to do on their account; I would    10/3/89  never resist that But acquiring exchange reserves on our account when we are totally opposed to the direction of policy that takes implicates us in the policy, I think Now, I'm not for confrontation either As a matter of fact, I consider myself to have been simmering a long time on this issue because I've generally been approving these things all along both at the Subcommittee level and at the higher FOMC level I have never felt that dealing with disorderly conditions or resisting pressures in one direction or another was something worth fighting over It was worth cooperating and maintaining this whole atmosphere of coordination and cooperation But when I perceive that we're getting to a point where we are literally taking risks and we are moving in a direction counter to our whole philosophy, it seems to me that we've got to stand up and be counted here This whole thing runs the risk of implicating us in something when we are out there saying we are standing for price stability Now, I think we can have a debate here about how fast we want to go toward that goal; but it's going to take even longer if we participate in these kinds of activities And I just think that at some point we have to give a clear message on what our point of view is on this Continuing to acquire exchange reserves and exposure on our own account is really risky, especially given what I know about people over there running things at the Treasury I don't think it's Nick Brady myself I think you have a green-eyeshade person in David Mulford over there who doesn't know what he's doing And I think it's very risky to turn over policy to somebody like that I think Secretary Brady is capable of being brought around on this issue and maybe that's where [we should go]; I know the Chairman has been effective in talking to him before I wouldn't be making these points if I wasn't worried I think this strategy that we are pursuing is very risky and it makes us look bad   What do we do if this continues?    10/3/89   But what if they don't? If they don't, what are you going to do?   I agree with that, but I can't buy the scenario in which that's going to happen in a credible way Is the Treasury going to go to the Congress and say that somehow we are acting against the national interest of the country?   But how is that going to work, Ted?   I'm just asking How is that going to be an effective argument?   Well, as I said, I think confrontation has its risks too You have two scenarios one is that we confront the markets and we can say interest rates are going to be higher than what we forecast because the Fed is going to confront the Treasury And they are going to resist with interest rates any attempt that the  -10-    10/3/89  Treasury makes on the dollar Now, I'm sure that that would throw some heat into the markets   But it certainly would [give] comfort on the price side   I don't understand Look, the markets have a right to be concerned if the Treasury and the Fed can't coordinate policy That's what it's all about here   I don't disagree with that   But I do think there is a risk for us that we're going to be implicated in talking out of one side of our mouth about price stability goals and yet agreeing to constantly flooding the market with dollars trying to get the dollar below where the fundamentals are taking it with relative interest rates Now, you can argue about relative real interest rates--   You can still get there with Treasury pursuing what they have been pursuing, but at much higher interest rates--   --and much lower growth, and even a recession Maybe that is what we will pursue   They can go on forever, Roger, when we keep warehousing their currency   That's good  -13-    10/3/89   What about the Canadians? They are not happy about it either, are they?   Well, as a matter of fact, I am going to be out of town I'm going to be hiding out   Yes, that's what I mean  -14-    10/3/89   Sure, but--   And all I'm saying, Jerry, is that I don't know; I don't think anybody knows It's a debatable issue But to try and say beforehand that the dollar has to be at some level that some committee decides--   But it's not; it's the same  -15-    10/3/89   A committee is a group of people   Well, since I dissented [before] I don't know how I could-- How do I vote in favor of previous transactions?   I think Sam has done his job very well   Okay   Yes It was very good in mechanics, but--   All right Well, I certainly want to make sure that that is the way it's written and the way it's understood   What does the sentence say again--in terms of what we're voting for?   Well, how about the manner in which you conducted the transactions? Really, that's a different statement   Yes, but I voted against that   But I abstained on the warehousing [vote] as well   I'm still trying to understand what this is all about   Okay, is that the way it reads?   As long as that's the way it reads, I agree that there is no problem   Okay   So move   You mentioned that you expect some stimulus to the housing market but you are forecasting weakness in investment Earlier, in previous FOMC meetings, you had said that declines in long-term interest rates stimulated investment in the housing market Yet this hasn't seemed to occur How long do you expect the lags to be after a decline in long-term interest rates before you see something in the investment in housing? You mentioned that the level of houses for sale was revised up But I don't see any pickup in housing And nondefense capital goods orders, excluding aircraft, seem to be at a lower level in the third quarter than the second quarter I just see nothing out there that points to a pickup in capital spending and yet we have had this decline in interest rates   Okay, I agree with that, I think But what you're saying, though, is that this decline in long-term interest rates hasn't had a stimulative effect on this   I want to follow up on one last thing that I was talking about yesterday in the Board room when we were discussing [unintelligible] and I still want to try to understand this You indicated then at the beginning of your presentation the need for some slack to get inflation down further in the economy But I'm still trying to understand conceptually how that works to some degree If monetary policy maintains nominal demand at potential output or at the full employment unemployment rate--say it maintained nominal demand consistent with potential output growth--is the need for slack because of the rigidities in the system? Does the adjustment process cause you to get more inflation mix than a real mix temporarily?   Okay I want to understand what you're saying, though Is it that even if we bring nominal demand in line with potential output, that actual output has to slow for a while relative to potential because of the contracts [and other] rigidities in the system? Okay, that's the--   Yes, well I can't either But I'm still trying to get--   Everybody understands that we have nominal demand that is greater than that; that's why we have 4 or 5 percent inflation in the market But if you were to work nominal demand down  -21-    10/3/89  gradually in line with potential output and you maintained it there, I guess I would have a little trouble understanding why you would necessarily have any inflationary experience   As I say, if you were to lower nominal demand-- just lower it, even if it's currently above potential output--why doesn't that lead to some slowing in the inflation rate even though the real economy might be slowing but still not performing relative to potential?   Well, I think the historical record does show that if you reduce nominal demand there is a mixed effect--that you get a little of both   The more flexible the markets are, the better the mix   I'm just saying that, given all that, it's still not clear to me why the economy can't grow around its potential rate while you're restraining demand even though the mix does [unintelligible] I think that's a central debate   I don't disagree   On the real economy, growth seems to be continuing at a fairly modest rate as compared to what looked like a slippage earlier So, as far as the economy's performance, there is some inertia there that is satisfying, I think I don't see it much different than the Greenbook has in terms of the pattern that may be developing Did you say, Mike, that manufacturing inventories were coming out this morning?   As opposed to a stronger--   And that is a good sign  -31-    10/3/89   Well, that's a good sign in that the bulge in inventories in July did not carry forward   Right, but there was some uptick even ex autos, if I remember, before July   Yes In spite of all that, I still see it like the Greenbook forecast--some winding down in the economy I don't see any signs of acceleration, taking all the regions on balance; I still see some gradual slowing going on So, I perceive a little more downside risk than upside risk But I want to associate myself with Gary Stern and others who earlier indicated a little optimism on the inflation front--that inflation seems to be looking better and it seems to go beyond just the food and energy components But as even Mike Prell said, a lot of the ex food and energy improvement seems to be associated with the dollar, to some extent I'd be quite alarmed if we continue to contaminate the environment we have for improvement with a drop in the dollar I'm not saying we ought to be targeting the dollar, but given the fact that we are at high capacity levels, we don't have a lot of fudge room there unless the economy were to slow further and we could absorb some decline in the dollar So, that is a big, big worry And even though I think the risks are still toward the down side, the current environment is not very promising for any flexibility on policy   I wish I had said all that That's good   Yes, I'd like to associate myself with that view I'm not sure I'd explain it the same way My major concern right now--even though I think there is a downside risk and we ought to be prepared to use our flexibility to ease at some point--is that the atmosphere is not right I think there are still some questions going forward and we ought to wait and look My major reservation at this point is what is going on with the dollar and the fact that any attempt to ease now, even if we thought it was the right thing to do, would have great risks because the perception [would be] that our goals were associated more with some dollar level than our view about inflationary risks And I really don't want our policy tied in with that So, I prefer to maintain our flexibility going forward   I think we ought to [respond] as the FOMC   Plus, it seems to me that there has always been a [unintelligible] definitions which has to be addressed as well You could probably go around this table and find half a dozen different views about what price stability is I know I have one   How about Bill [unintelligible] might testify? He had-- "
3758,1989-10-16," Can I just make one? Jerry, how did CHIPS do? Were there any problems settling there this morning at all?   Yes   Okay, thank you "
3765,1989-10-17," I have one question   Peter   One concern I had yesterday, and some others I think expressed it here, was that doing a customer RP yesterday--even    10/17/89  though it was fairly small--with funds trading around 8-1/2 percent looked like we were sort of confirming 8-1/2 percent in the market I noticed there's a Wall Street Journal story this morning that says that that might be the case and that we might go up to 8-3/4 percent I'm a little concerned, given that customer RP, that the market--or at least half of the market--may be thinking more like 8-1/2 percent and that now any attempt to discourage them from that is going to look like a ""whoops, sorry"" thing At least that's the impression I get What's your impression?   Yes I was just making a comment because I did see a few comments about the market on the screen prior to our action suggesting that there might even be a mild draining need There was some perception of a modest drain necessary in the market and that's why I was asking   Okay, thank you "
3774,1989-10-18," I'd like to ask Peter a question You mentioned that funds opened around 8-3/4 percent I thought we had regarded our market participation in the last couple of days as somewhat liberal, coming in with customer RPs when funds were really close to 8-1/2 percent Why do you think that funds have opened up firm? Does it have something to do with the earthquake or what is it?   Okay, thank you "
3789,1989-11-14," But a year ago, Sam, their producer prices were running minus 5 to 10 percent; now they're running plus 3 or 4 percent   Did that improve?   I graciously point out that your forecast was accurate, but under a different interest rate scenario And since I ask this every time, to the extent that I follow them What reasons would you give as to why the forecast will stay on course with a much different interest rate path? What would you say are the major factors?   By rising rates do you mean the funds rate?   But long rates didn't rise, really; they bounced around a little but they generally trended down, I think   Yes So, it was the dollar mainly And what was the other one?   That's what I thought   One other point I'd like to raise is about profits Corporate profits, of course, have been reported as weak I was wondering How closely does the profits picture compare this time to, say, 1984--I don't know if you have this at your fingertips--when I remember we had a similar sort of picture developing in that we had a weakening situation occurring in manufacturing, and I think profits were weaker in that same period; a similar type of squeeze occurred The funds rate had been raised up until mid-1984, or something like that, and then eased off   So you'd characterize this as a much weaker profit situation?    11/14/89   Well, some of the things I wanted to say have been said But I'll say a couple of things I made that point about the forecast because a couple of things still trouble me about it even though I think the Greenbook forecast has been on track pretty well In terms of the overall [picture] I don't think it's just the dollar that's the difference; if that were true, I think you'd expect to see most of the weakness in the exchange rate sensitive sectors In fact, even though interest rates have been much lower than the scenario that we've been forecasting, interest sensitive sectors of the economy are the ones that are quite weak Housing is down; automobiles are weak Generally, the domestic interest sensitive sectors are part of the weak sectors in the economy So I don't think it's just the fact that the dollar is strong; as a matter of fact if the dollar was that strong you'd expect more import demand than we're seeing as well, with the interest rates as low, and we're not seeing that either So I think real interest rates at least are high enough to be causing a general slowing and that is feeding through to the inflation rate I know it's not dramatic progress, but if you look at the core inflation rate changes, the CPI excluding food and energy was 47 percent in 1988 and it's running about 4 percent this year The PPI ex-food and energy was about 48 percent last year and it's running about 4-1/2 percent so far this year Intermediate prices ex-food and energy were 72 percent last year and are down to 17 percent so far Crude materials are about the same Those are all positives I think the question is really how much risk we want to take It's true that labor costs have not done as well as some of the improvement on the overall inflation rate Labor costs seem to be running at about the same pace as last year When I look at total compensation in nonfarm business or in the whole private sector area, that is running close to what it was last year both in the goods producing and the services components But that's what's causing the profit squeeze and, as was pointed out, profits are falling significantly And I think that's part of the process that has to work to hold the line on prices and actually get the benefit on inflation that we want Again, I think the key question is really how much risk we want to take and what kind of timing we want for the improvement We could get it all at once, but I'm not sure that's a risk we really want to take   I was just quoting the numbers ex-food and energy If you look at the totals it's not quite as clear   I agree with the Chairman's proposal for ""B"" with asymmetric language I think that's really where we are The risk is clearly on the down side and I don't mean just on the real economy If I didn't personally think that we weren't going to make better progress than the Greenbook has indicated on inflation, I wouldn't want to tilt that way As the Chairman said, we're at the stage where we have to be very cautious and not risk tipping the economy into a major recession because I don't believe the general public is going to understand our causing a major disruption to get a percentage point or two out of the inflation rate when we're already around the 4 percent range So, I'm a gradualist in that sense and I wear that band pretty proudly I think we ought to be very careful and try to make gains in a sensible way I don't think we have much more easing to do; I agree with Governor Angell on that point What we're seeing in the economy now is the result of policy months ago and I think we're getting closer to where we ultimately want to be Clearly, when the funds rate got down close to 6 percent in late '86 or early '87 it was too low I think a lot of us thought oil prices were going to stay down better than they did So I don't think we want to return to those types of interest rates But at 8-1/2 percent on the funds rate we've still got a ways to go; and the markets are certainly anticipating that we have a ways to go, but not a lot though And I think that's the point The longer we wait, if the economy deteriorates on us, the more we're going to have to move And that's something we ought to try to avoid [We ought to be] seeking out where we ultimately want to be, getting there early enough, and then letting the lags work their way through I think we're close to that stage but we ought to be positioned to make another modest move because I don't think there is any upside risk to that I think that's where we should be "
3816,1989-12-18," Just one question When you compare these sacrifice ratios from the models with the historical experience you use an unemployment rate I guess that's one way to do it But it doesn't seem to take into account that there will be changes in    12/18-19/89  productivity and substitutions of capital for labor I was just wondering [unintelligible] It struck me that even though the cost was fairly significant--in real output terms you lost about 2 percentage points of real GNP growth--the change in nominal GNP was dramatic and the decline in the CPI inflation rate was from something like 12 or 13 percent annual rate down to about 4 percent in one year Now, I know I'm not talking about relative to potential, but GNP was growing at about a zero rate in '81 or so and the change in the growth rate was from about zero to minus 2 or something like that over the '81 and '82 recession I'm not sure that that's the best example but that one just strikes me as something quite significant We saw the inflation rate come down from what people thought was a core rate of 10 percent; people were talking about projecting 10 percent out indefinitely The actual rate was running 12 to 13 percent, I think, at an annual rate And we had about a 9 percentage point change in the inflation rate in one year with about a 2 percentage point change in the real growth rate That struck me as a significant adjustment without the kind of dislocations that might be implied here If you're looking at cumulative effects over the whole cycle on unemployment, I know the unemployment rate got a lot higher But the real output sacrifice in terms of growth rates wasn't very large at all when you consider the dramatic change in the inflation rate   Right   Right   I agree, but I'm just saying--   That's what's so striking about it the fact that people were projecting continued [increases in inflation] I'm still amazed thinking back on that I remember how painful it was sitting there going through it But I'm still struck by what appears to be a fairly small sacrifice when you consider what people thought it would take to unwind inflation like that The only thing is the baggage we've been left with all the debt buildup in the '70s that resulted from that and the exposure to the safety net that resulted from cracking it   Well, I don't disagree with that completely But I would say, if you look at that Hoey survey--and I agree that a survey is a survey--the fact is that it has been trending down consistently You're looking at a point in time as opposed to a trend; you [extrapolate] the trend in expectations and we're coming down So I would say that if the Fed has been gaining credibility all along over the last several years, instead of looking at it at some particular point if you project that trend forward and assume we continue to behave in a credible way you are getting long-term--   Well, I don't know   I have no idea All I'm saying is that the trend has been coming down And it has been coming down on the 10- year survey at times when the one-year expectations and the actual inflation rate have been rising   I don't know what it's going to do in the future I'm simply saying that it's plausible that we're gaining credibility If I remember right, and I better go back and look at it, aren't there a few periods when--?  SPEAKER(?) Exhibit five   Exhibit five  SPEAKER(?) That reminds me Just one other question on your forward-looking model Was that a down [unintelligible] expectations?   My point here is that 10-year inflation [expectations] in the last year have been trending below the actual inflation   Whatever I'm simply saying that the market clearly was looking through that phenomenon and saying it's credible for the long run; we're not worried about these supply-type shocks   I agree; that's a good point  SPEAKER(?) I think it's a very good point   If we bite off more than we can chew and we are viewed as failing, we've lost a lot   For M2?   What I want to say sort of follows up on what you said I definitely agree with the whole concept of price stability; I think we ought to state it as a goal and it ought to be a real goal I really do think there's something sort of even moral about it--that basically people ought to be able to expect some stability in the purchasing power of the currency and not have to conduct a lot of high search costs associated with the anticipation of    12/18-19/89  prices But having said all that, there are a couple of technical things I wanted to ask First, even if one agrees with that, I still have trouble deciding on a definition of price stability I think what we came up with in association with the language in the Neal bill was reasonably acceptable, because I honestly do have trouble with trying to say it's the level of the CPI, or the level of the PPI, or the deflator There are so many difficulties associated with pinning it to any particular strict quantitative measure that I'm not sure it's realistic So, it seems the definition of price stability has to have some flexibility associated with it within a narrow range Now, I don't know exactly how to do it, but I think if we agree on price stability we really ought to spend a lot of time on how we want to define it Secondly, I think it is important to distinguish the benefits between stabilizing the inflation rate and stabilizing at some concept of price stability In theory, I think if you assume that people could always anticipate inflation growing at a specific rate I'm not sure the cost of pegging the inflation rate is that much greater than the cost of stabilizing the price level But I don't believe you can do that this way; I'm not sure you could stabilize the inflation rate But the fact is that if people could always be assured that prices were going to grow at 4 percent, they could take that into account just like a stable price level The question I have is Are relative prices somehow better behaved in a stable price level environment than they are in a stable inflation rate environment? I don't know; I'm asking Is there a reason empirically or theoretically to believe that relative prices of goods and services are more predictable in a price level stability environment versus an inflation rate stability environment?   Let me just repeat the last question I left on the table, which I think relates directly to your question about what are the benefits of an inflation rate target versus a price level stability target I was talking to Bob Parry during the break and raised another question, which is If you have an exogenous shock, a supply shock that changed the level of prices either up or down--it doesn't matter which way you look at it, I guess--would you want to go back to the old level or would you want simply to move forward in terms of stabilizing the new shock level? And what are the costs and benefits of that? But I wanted an answer to that question I had about relative prices   What do you mean?   Let's say a big shock   Well, yes I would think so   What about the shock?  -28-    12/18-19/89   Why is there a reason, though, to believe that those kinds of shocks will be different than random--or biased to one direction?    12/18-19/89   But I think we're talking consensus here Theoretically, [if] we pursued a zero inflation rate target and we were not influenced by the politics that were coming later or whatever, why would we expect those shocks to be anything but random?   Well, you haven't talked to my mother-in-law! They're way too low for her   Well, I don't know what the probability is I can't think of any reason why the probabilities of negative or positive shocks would be any different   Well, I honestly believe, personally, that there's a higher probability of a downward price shock in energy than an upward one right now   I believe that is true if--   But you're saying we wouldn't aggressively ease or tighten if there were supply shocks?   I'm thinking of the negative type shock like debt--anything that would shock the level down I think you've got to be willing to say that   Okay, so you'd aggressively ease in that case?   Deflationary impact   Hey, I was born before the '50s!   But the country was on the Bretton Woods standard; there was a law in place   But I'm saying those rules of the Bretton Woods arrangement were followed and there was a discipline in place   I'll start it off Off the top of my head, without having thought this through very much, to me the way you build political support is first--I agree with Lee--that you have to educate I think it's very important for us in our hearings and our speeches and everything else to take an approach that tries to point out the benefits of what we're trying to achieve and how we interpret those It would be best if we could come to some consensus and all say the same thing I'm not sure that's possible But if we decide on that, we ought to try and coordinate it, because coordinating it would be very important for the public Secondly, and substantively, in terms of reality in the economy--and for this reason I am somewhat of a gradualist but I don't think a 5-year time frame is unrealistic-- I think that we cannot afford to have the public perceive us as choosing the tradeoff of accelerating disinflation at the expense of much higher unemployment I think it's another matter if the public sees us defending our inflation goals if inflation is accelerating and the economy is weak and we're not perceived as having any good choices It's one thing to try to fight an acceleration in inflation because the economy is weak; I think the public can take a recession in that environment where, say, external policies have been bad, productivity is very low, prices are accelerating and we're not left with any choice except to let inflation accelerate or to stop it and inflict a recession But I think it's another matter entirely to force the economy into recessionary conditions to accelerate the improvement in disinflation I don't think it's a big factor to argue about how fast the economy continues to grow or whether employment growth is a little slower or a little faster, because I think the public generally is not very sophisticated in understanding what's happening when the economy is growing more slowly relative to what otherwise would be the case But I assure you they're very keen on noticing when more people are unemployed and when people are being laid off They would be saying Well, the inflation rate is low and actually coming down, but [the Federal Reserve] is going to accelerate this [decline in inflation] from 4 percent to 1 percent and the cost is going to be higher unemployment So, my view is that we have to be sensitive to the real economy We have to be patient enough to pursue our goals consistent with avoiding recession unless inflation accelerates If inflation starts to accelerate, we don't have any choice That's the way I see it Of course, if dividends come with [greater] credibility, then we can get there faster without the potential losses in real output and employment I think we should state our goal of price stability and I think there is a time frame that's realistic But I certainly don't think that means--even if we were to say we have a 5-year time frame in which we think we can get to conditions of price stability--that tomorrow the discount rate has to go up 1/2 point It certainly does mean, though, that we have to set a steady course in getting there and take advantage of the positive dividends and resist the negatives   Is that what you hear in your board rooms?   I'd like to make just one brief point that I forgot to mention that was on my mind In terms of the speed of adjustment, I've already laid out what I consider to be an appropriate strategy But along with that is the notion that in the past when we have had fairly significant inflation, a lot of debt built up Of course, a lot of debt was created even in the '80s when inflation was low, which is kind of interesting But that was especially true during the '70s I think we cannot force inflation down any faster than the safety net can bear the burden In a sense, our lender-of- last-resort function is exposed from time to time; if you cause inflation to decelerate so fast that you create a debt bomb, we end up with the whole banking system falling into the safety net or huge debt problems that dramatically expand our lender-of-last-resort function In fact, it's hard enough to arrange collateral now And if there's no collateral to take, we're going to be limited to some degree So I  -52-    12/18-19/89  think we ought to keep in mind--at least if we pursue restraining policies--just what we think we might inherit through the discount window or, in general, our safety net   Being one of the members of the FOMC who generally has supported more disclosure--I admit I'm in that camp--I asked Alan to let me say a few words about a certain type of problem about leaks that I do think is serious I wanted to make an appeal myself I realize there is a debate going on within the Committee about policy disclosure and I think that's still a [valid] debate But my big concern about the types of leaks that I've seen is that, along the lines of what Alan mentioned, I think it's very destructive if the confidential deliberations of the Committee end up in the press If we can't sit here and have a dialogue and be honest and actually say things back and forth across the table to each other in an honest way without worrying about those discussions being disclosed at some point, then I think we have problems I have been and continue to be generally supportive of the idea of accurate, timely announcements of our policy decisions But our deliberations and how we get there have to be confidential The thing that bothered me the  -54-    12/18-19/89  most was back in February of this year when we were deliberating over whether to raise the discount rate and there was a Wall Street Journal story that announced a future FOMC meeting that was coming up in a few days That just literally announces to the world that we're deliberating over the discount rate and anyone is free to--   Yes, a Board meeting; sorry, I said an FOMC meeting But I think we had a conference call scheduled to discuss how we were going to approach this and even that was made public So, I would like to make an appeal myself on the confidential nature of internal deliberations And I separate that issue from the whole issue of announcements of policy We have to preserve the confidentiality of deliberations because otherwise we eventually are going to come in here and read a script and not have a dialogue   Okay   I'm not opposed to the [proposed] increase of $1 billion [in the limit on System holdings of foreign currency balances] I agree with your point about interest [accruals] but, as you pointed out Sam, this is a particularly sensitive period And in my opinion, I can't foresee a situation developing where we would want to be selling dollars over this intermeeting period It could occur, but I don't think there's much doubt that the Japanese are about to move on their discount rate--even though I'm not sure why--for their own domestic purposes I think it's more political than anything else But I can't see a situation in which we would want to be selling dollars into this market with the economy moving slowly and the DM and other European currencies strong and probably the yen showing some strength against the dollar There already have been anticipations--rumors in the market--of a discount rate move, which weakened the dollar/yen rate some yesterday Even if they move on the discount rate, I'm not sure whether that's going to be enough really to change things permanently or anything like that Can you foresee a situation, Sam, where we would want to be selling dollars in the intermeeting period? I think it's okay to approve this   Peter, you may have said this and I just missed it Even after we added reserves on that Wednesday with the funds rate slightly soft, we did that on the basis of an anticipated firming later in the day because of the reserve need, right?   Yes, I remember funds slipped a little further in that period   So you think there was some anticipation already growing in the market after our call, even before the news stories came in?   Where did the funds rate end up that day?   So on that Wednesday it got down to 8-1/4 percent even before the stories?   How did the call go? Was there a broad consensus on what to do on the call?   Yes   When this issue came up before I think the argument was that perhaps seasonal doesn't present a problem for us when it's mixed with adjustment borrowing But even if it's shown that it has some noise in it, to separate it out to a point--  SPEAKER(?) [Whether to] have it in there--   [Do we] want to have it in the reserves?   I agree with that But it's just another minor noisy item or potentially noisy item   Sounds like a heck of a sacrifice ratio to me   I'm not sure It seems like a lot lost on the real side and nothing [gained] on the inflation side Although there may be a tenth or two, it's hard to see   It might be useful to try to separate that out   Well, I agree with that A couple of points You mentioned the Blue Chip forecast I agree they are not predicting a recession, which I think is interesting, but they do expect significantly lower trends in the funds rate   Right I think most of the forecasts that are not predicting a recession have the funds rate path coming down   I agree with that Another point was made about the dollar when you were talking about the dollar depreciation forecast having a positive effect on the real side Doesn't it matter how the dollar depreciates? It's one thing if it results from lower rates here; but isn't it another thing if it results from higher rates abroad as to the relative impact on the real side here?   No, a lower dollar If the dollar is lower because of higher rates abroad, let's say   Don't higher interest rates abroad mean that foreign demands are going to be weaker?   So you're suggesting to me--   Well, let me just get it straight after all that I asked the question If the dollar is weaker in the forecast because of higher rates abroad, since we're not projecting--   Yes, but [unintelligible] The last question I have is the one I keep repeating--I know you're sick of hearing this but I'm still looking for an answer too And that is A year ago or even less than that you had a slightly stronger forecast I realize if you go back to last April's FOMC or so that most of the weakness in the values projected [were showing up] in early 1990 rather than this year The economy has softened a bit more toward the tail end of this year than you had forecast in those earlier projections and you actually were forecasting about a 10-1/2 percent funds rate and about a 10 percent long bond as of now Yet rates are fully 200 basis points lower than they were when the forecast was for a real economy that was expected to be a little stronger than it is today I'm still trying to find some way of reconciling that--how that has occurred when the interest rate scenario has been totally different and we've had much lower interest rates If the economy has been slightly weaker than the forecast, I don't think it could be the dollar Exports have held up pretty well in this whole forecast In fact, I thought the lags were longer on that; at least that's what we've been saying So it's not on the export side Where has the weakness occurred? Or why has the forecast borne itself out generally, with a structure of interest rates that is 200 basis points lower?   Since when?   Well, what about my point on exports? Am I wrong that exports have not held up according to the forecast?   Is that right?   Is that enough to account for the difference in interest rates?   No, I mean is that difference in the export projection enough to--   Right   Okay I think that's all   Just about everything has been said I agree with a lot of it And some of the recent comments were along the lines of what I was thinking The economy is currently weak; I don't think there's any doubt about that And I agree with Tom that it's not totally unanticipated Some of what we're seeing now is what we knew would be coming down the pike from our tightening actions months ago So it certainly is not a time for us to panic over what we see now; it shouldn't be a surprise to anyone and there's nothing we can do about it now for these couple of quarters There is nothing in current policy that is going to alter what we're going to see develop in the next few months However, financial markets are much more forward looking and much more sensitive to current policy and can certainly turn on a dime on the basis of what they think our current policy means for the future On that front, I'm somewhat with Governor Angell--my views are not quite as strong as his--in that the current financial market data don't seem to be showing any certain pattern of [striking] concern about the degree of tightness in current policy down the road The bond market is relatively stable; commodity prices are gradually weakening, I think, although oil keeps bumping those prices around from time-to-time But I think the trend is clearly down, though not dramatically, in overall commodity prices It is true that the dollar is weaker on a trade-weighted basis, but I personally tend to dismiss most of that as a result of what's going on in Germany and the fact that they have tightened their policy quite dramatically The dollar is not really weak against the yen and it's not really weak against the Canadian dollar or pound sterling But it is weak against the EMS countries and Germany because they have run real interest rates up quite substantially and [unintelligible] also over the east European problem  But I do agree with some of John LaWare's comments I sense a sort of snowballing effect in the real estate market that's bothering me I don't know how negative an effect that's going to have on expectations as home equity values come under pressure and housing prices or other real estate prices decline But it is on the order of [unintelligible] systemic, I think I wouldn't go so far as to bet the ranch on that now, but it worries me And I certainly worry about having a deteriorating situation down the road with a worsening economy and finding ourselves in a mild recession I'd be willing to face the threat of that if I didn't think inflation was improving some and if we had some flexibility But I would disagree with those who don't think that there's any improvement on the inflation front or that we haven't made some progress Certainly the actual inflation data that I've seen over the last six months show an improvement It's not just food and energy [prices]; the central tendency of this Committee back in July when we made our estimates  -87-    12/18-19/89  [for the Humphrey-Hawkins report] was 5 to 5-1/2 percent on the CPI Now, with one month left, it looks like it's going to come in around 4-1/2 percent or something like that It's running 47 percent right now Some of that is an improvement in food and energy prices; but ex-food and energy, there has been progress over the last six months as well--both in producer prices and consumer prices relative to expectations So actually, I think we do have some flexibility here I don't think that the market is expecting a whole lot out of the Fed in terms of a further easing I think we have gained some credibility and the last thing I want to do is to lose that But the market is expecting some modest easing of policy in a way that fits into our scrooge-like approach to monetary policy in terms of protecting the inflation environment We're worrying about where the economy is going to be six months down the road and we don't think there's an element of danger of a pickup in inflation or, in fact, inflation has continued to improve So we're in a position to have some choices; I don't think we're faced with no choices   Would you repeat that?  -88-    12/18-19/89   Okay Just looking at the charts that you handed out on real interest rates--it depends on which survey one looks at, but--in the short-term end they really show very modest declines in real interest rates since the peak of our tightening period And in some of them there is even a recent uptick in real interest rates because of the improvement in inflationary expectations in the short run If that's the case, one of the worries is that even though the funds rate is lower in [nominal] terms we really haven't eased policy recently We are down from the peaks, I think, but not by very much   Okay, thank you   Listening to the tone of the conversation, my view is close to what I hear others saying It's a close call I don't think there's an overwhelming case to ease; and I think the people who have made a case for staying asymmetric are making reasonable points as well But I certainly tilt toward the Chairman's view and I can support his recommendation for a couple of reasons, which I want to emphasize again First, I guess I'm a little more optimistic about what we've achieved and where we're heading on the inflation environment I don't see us making a trade-off here at all As I've said, I think we have the flexibility and I referred back to the charts from yesterday that showed long-term inflationary expectations almost consistently trending down over the 1980s and continuing to trend down to the point where they actually have been lower than the near-term inflation expectations I don't see this kind of move endangering that trend in long-term inflationary expectations at all In fact, I refer back to the charts on short- term real interest rates that were just handed out today a few minutes ago and I'm a little concerned that real interest rates aren't really lower We really haven't eased much in any relative sense for several months So, I think it's riskless; as a matter of fact, I think it's  -98-    12/18-19/89  prudent to offset what I fear is a growing concern in the financial markets I agree with the Chairman that policy can be transmitted in the very short-run sense in terms of financial markets and the expectations for orders and things like that But of course I was referring to GNP performance, which has a long lag But obviously we can set the gears in motion very quickly, which I think is important to do I think the economy and the financial system need something to be a little more optimistic about and this could be useful I don't think it threatens any long-term inflationary trend or expectations If I did, I really wouldn't be for it although I can understand those people who are concerned that it might It's one of those close calls   Can I mention one thing?   What you're proposing is to move the monetary aggregates to number two?   After price stability?   I don't mean to muddy the waters further on this language but there's one thing that bothers me about moving the monetary aggregates to second I can support it but--and this may sound too complicated but it's important to me--I'm a little worried about emphasizing the monetary aggregates in the very short run if we're basically picking up the opportunity cost effects of changes in interest rates In other words, I could live with emphasizing the monetary aggregates if it's in the context of something like long-term monetary aggregate trends relative to our price stability goal But I don't want someone to get the impression out there that M2 for one quarter growing above target because of the interest sensitivity effects is going to be something that the markets should panic over So, to me there's a big difference between the short-run and the longer-term trend in the monetary aggregates   Just as long as that issue is there so people could see that and not overreact to--  SPEAKER(?) Sure   But did we have the monetary aggregates number two [in the directive language] during that weakness? I'm saying moving it makes it-- These people focus on every little twist in the  -103-    12/18-19/89  directive and if they see we've changed the order of the phrase on the aggregates they're going to say we're focusing short term on where those aggregates are And they're going to say we've moved the economy back in the order so we're going to put our concern in the short run on stabilizing the monetary aggregates over our concern about the economy If we get that message across that it's the long- run trend in monetary aggregates that we're concerned about that's just fine with me   We can capture it in the policy record, I think It's fine as long as it's spelled out clearly But I'm just worried about people saying ""Hey, the Fed decided to chase the monetary aggregates over the economy in the near term""   Not the aggregates I've never said anything about the aggregates   If you can find it show it to me   Let me say that I'm confident we can capture my concerns in the policy record, so that's okay with me   What's standing is a vote on the aggregates right now as number two And I-- "
3843,1990-02-06," First to Mike Given the fact that the inflation picture remains stable in spite of slower growth, I was looking at the profits trend and it's down There is quite a profit squeeze going on If we hold nominal demand pretty much in check, given the profits picture, doesn't something have to give? Wouldn't you expect labor costs to come down, maybe through layoffs or something? How can those weak profits persist when there's no avenue for changing them in terms of nominal demand? Shouldn't there be a cutback in costs or at least a recession or something?   Okay, thanks A question for Ted on the dollar, and this is something I raised yesterday too [at the Board briefing] I realize the dollar has depreciated from the peak in 1989, but I don't think it really has depreciated over the whole year There have been a lot of wiggles since the dollar sort of settled down in 1987 I just have a little trouble with the secular depreciation in the staff forecast I realize that the external claims issue is a theoretical issue that may support the dollar depreciation, but of course monetary policy may have something to do with that In looking at these international trends, even though you're projecting slightly lower inflation for the foreign countries, based on this recent dollar depreciation, than for the United States, what we see right now is almost complete convergence in price trends It's prospective, I think--going forward to what the inflation trends will be What I'm struck by is the lower left panel on Chart 17, which shows that right now we have almost complete convergence in prices I agree that expectations play a part in that, but with convergence in inflation rates we still have a slight interest differential advantage It has narrowed quite a bit and I guess you have to look at the changes as one factor But if prices converge rather than break apart like this, given where interest rate levels are now--we're still slightly higher than Germany in terms of nominal interest rate levels and we're still considerably higher than the Japanese even though that has narrowed-- I'm not sure that dollar depreciation is in the cards I would say that, obviously, if inflation diverges again, maybe to the degree you have [in the forecast], there is some modest [depreciation] in the works But what do you say to that?   But we're talking about the trade-weighted dollar   Okay One last question, Mr Chairman, on this recent turnaround in bond rates I noticed in reading some of the commentary that was submitted to the FOMC, and in Steve Axilrod's comments and some others' too recently, it has been argued that the turnaround in bond rates--since most of it is real and not nominal-- represents an effective tightening of policy I don't know what policy necessarily can do about it, but the fact is that some analysts are saying that it represents a relatively tighter situation, let's put it that way, in the economy I just wonder what you think about that To me that's almost the other side of the coin of the question I have been asking for a long time here Given the fact that long-term real interest rates were coming down, was that stimulative? I'm a little skeptical about the notion that the [more recent] turnaround is an effective tightening--as much as I was skeptical about the downtrend in long rates [being an] easing--because the implication is almost that the funds rate should come down further if we want an effective tightening What is your response to some of that commentary about the turnaround in the long rates? Suppose most of it is real   It's a difficult question The move has been too sharp The long-run inflationary expectations surveys have ticked up slightly, but not very much At least the only one I've seen-- Hoey--has hardly moved   I guess so Okay But I think most people would say there's a significant real component to it even if you do worry a little about the upturn in inflation expectations One plausible explanation is that some sort of positive real rate increase is not necessarily contractionary There are the developments in Europe; export markets may be looking better   No, but a combination of some--   Right What I'm thinking is that to the extent that is part of the story, that's not necessarily a contractionary phenomenon   But I think you could argue that inflation expectations in those other industrial countries have gone up significantly   I also think that the Greenbook forecast is a reasonable forecast It's closer to my view of the world than it has been in a long time I am a little more hopeful on the inflation front, although I think the Greenbook scenario is plausible Among the reasons why I'm a little more hopeful are some of the concerns that people--Jerry and Governor LaWare and others--are sharing about the real estate problems and debt problems and the restraint that that is going to place on overall inflationary behavior It bears watching I think there is a sense of unease, but I don't see anything systemic to that, certainly not at this point That's probably one reason I'm a little hopeful on inflation I also think the problems are [unintelligible] So far the dollar does appear to be stable to slightly weaker, but I think the weakness is more a special D-mark problem associated with the optimism in Germany and Europe than anything else Commodity prices have been stable to slightly weak, although the oil situation is an uncertain issue I actually think the turnaround in bond yields bears watching I think that is to some extent a perception of a bottoming out of the economic conditions and some optimism about Europe and the Soviet Union So, to some extent it could [reflect] an improvement in perceived real returns, which may not be a contractionary force but a positive one It could also be, partially, some inflationary expectations surfacing; but that's not necessarily borne out in some of the other financial markets Certainly, it's enough of a development for us to be very cautious and it certainly bears watching I'm generally optimistic in that I can start to see the light at the other side of the slowdown But I think this is a period to be cautious if we're going to consolidate what I hope are gains on inflation   I notice that even in your tighter scenario, the M2 growth rate for 1990 is still higher than the midpoint of the tentative ranges You have 5-1/2 percent and I think the midpoint on the tentative range is 5 percent So, as Bob Parry is saying, that scenario is fully accommodated within the tentative ranges But a question that I have relates to your comment that real interest rates would have to be slightly higher over time to reach this 5-year path Do you have any estimates for that or--   It is a problem I agree that that's the way you have to look at it But, as the Chairman said, if inflationary expectations are just a little better than you anticipate, that doesn't necessarily imply a rise, or at least a substantial rise, in nominal rates   Yes, I agree with that For M2, alternative II makes perfect sense It's consistent with this strategy II of getting inflation down over time I wouldn't mind at all going with the alternative III ranges for M3 and debt But for M2, certainly, alternative II makes more sense to me And I would think that the strategy II scenario is consistent with the alternative II ranges-- even though those may be the actual inflation trends--moving down toward 2 percent over time, assuming that that's the trend What could accompany that downward trend is actual inflation expectations that really could achieve what the Chairman has described as price stability anyway Obviously, there may be a lag in adjusting the actual inflation rate But over the '80s we had a consistent downtrend in 10-year or long-term inflation expectations And even more recently, those long-term increases have moved below the 12-month inflation rate So, it's quite possible that inflation expectations would be lower than the actual inflation rate along that path and that we would be accomplishing a lot of what we are looking for   Since I was the first one to say that even though I supported alternative II on M2 I thought the range in alternative III would be appropriate for M3--given what's happening in the broader aggregates and given the staff's forecast, which is even in the lower [part] of the alternative III range--I'll make the motion that we go to alternative III for M3, 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent   But it seems to me that this is not the time to worry about that The time would be '91 to worry about stabilizing that range and maybe carrying it forward   Yes   I agree that that may be the significant issue the next time we meet over this range   I think that's a very good explanation; at least that makes sense to me May I ask one question that has popped up in my mind over the last couple of days? In the paper this morning there was talk of Germany going for a monetary [union] between East and West Germany It appears that the Bundesbank is a little concerned about this The political events are moving faster than the central bank in Germany would like Now, I noticed that the dollar has depreciated a little more against the DM, possibly showing some anticipation of a big surge in demand for marks because of this monetary union I've read some comments that the government is pressuring the Bundesbank to provide DM at a conversion rate for GDR marks that is well above the market exchange rate That worries me, and I think the Bundesbank is worried about maybe having to convert GDR marks to DM at an exchange rate that is not appropriate to the market If that were a big concern in the market, it seems to me that there would be a depreciation of the DM rather than an appreciation What is going on there? Do you know any more than what is in the paper?   I can see going to a DM standard, but I can't see exchanging--   I have seen some reports of 3 to 4 percent   [Unintelligible] calls from a lot of very important politicians wanting to do this   If they win, yes   --in the stock market   I agree with you, Mr Chairman Your prescription of the situation is pretty much in accord with mine I'm starting to see, I think, positive signs in the leading-type data that show the economy may have reached its weakest point Going forward I think we are going to see some improvement, although I also agree that the situation is fragile and that there certainly is credit rationing going on That may grow as a problem and affect attitudes and expectations as time goes on So, we ought to be very careful about how we position ourselves I'm also perhaps a little more optimistic about the future on inflation than some others I noticed that last July our forecasts for 1989 indicated increases of 5 to 5-1/2 percent on the CPI and in fact the CPI came in at 4-1/2 percent I don't think anybody was too confused about what special factors were at work on the inflation rate at that stage Everybody knew in July that we were getting some benefits from the exchange rate and some other things, yet we still thought inflation was going to come in at about 5-1/2 percent for 1989 and it came in significantly below that I notice the central tendency for 1990 is now running at least 1/2 point below what we estimated it to be for 1990 back in July I think that's improvement Our own expectations have improved whether we really think inflation has or not The [forecasts] show that So, I think what has happened is that our standards have gotten tougher as we've moved along I don't think that's bad; it's probably good It means when things work out a little better we can stay tough and get to our goals that much quicker I agree that the news on inflation is going to get a little worse before it gets better because of some of the short-term pressures, especially the January numbers But I  -50-    2/6-7/90  think, or at least I hope, that the year is going to be fairly good From my perspective, the situation calls for alternative B; I also prefer symmetric language even though there are some potential risks associated with the credit situation spreading I think that's balanced by the slightly more positive leading data on the economy So, that leaves me somewhere in the symmetric category   Second   We're free "
3867,1990-03-27," Second  SPEAKER(?) It's too early to tell!   Jerry, don't we have a legal authority to set terms and conditions for primary dealer status when they do business with the Fed?   So, if they don't want to be part of that club, they don't have to   So it's not like we have regulatory authority; they don't have to be a primary dealer and buy and sell securities with the Fed    3/27/90   Is there any legal issue about the terms and conditions we might set for a dealer to do business with us? Legally, could we say we don't like the rest of your business and we're not going to do business with you?   I don't know if we ever have I'm just saying, as Peter pointed out, that as far as our business relationship with the dealer goes, I think we could probably set any conditions we wanted to   But of course they don't have to do the business   I was just looking at those credit data yesterday What's interesting is that everybody talks about the contraction going on in real estate financing, but in fact from what the data show that hasn't slowed down at all It's really just the business credit that is slowing down, which is quite disturbing That is the source of the credit slowdown; it's not in the real estate area   Until they're all drawn?   I think I was looking at both, but it was the total that I was talking about   I know I looked at both of them But I was thinking of the most aggregate numbers If I remember, those numbers    3/27/90  were still clicking along at 15 to 25 percent annualized growth and it was business credit that was really slowing down   Right What's real estate doing there?   Yes, I was wrong; it's about 10 to 12 percent annualized   Yes, it could be That doesn't show any sign of deceleration, to me at least There is that weak January relative to trend but February is as strong as ever in there   Okay   Yes   I just want to follow up on some of the comments on the international side First of all, responding to what Bob Parry said, I agree that the trade-weighted dollar is still--I don't know if it's down but it may be down slightly It depends on what point you're talking about but--   From when?   Okay You're right; one can play those base games But what struck me was the trade-weighted dollar going back to the end of this huge swing in the dollar When I pull out that chart and look at the long-term trend in the dollar in the last three years, since 1987, it looks like noise It just looks like little fluctuations around a flat or maybe gradually upward drifting pattern Pull out a long-term chart of the trade-weighted dollar sometime and you'll be struck by what you see; in the last three years it looks like just a little fluctuation And it looks a little soft, too I can't believe that anything can result from those kinds of fluctuations one way or the other But going forward, I think there is a shift, at least in the atmosphere, along the lines of what Ted Truman indicated At least it seems so to me But what that tells me--and I'd like a response on this--is that there is a trend of upward pressure on the dollar, and maybe it won't materialize, for the following reasons But as you said, Ted, there's serious doubt now about the deutschemark being the anchor for the EMS They seem to be willing to accommodate the unification in Germany at the expense of some inflation I don't know how much, but the fact that they haven't moved rates relative to expectations already is raising some serious  -15-    3/27/90  doubts And the DM has even weakened; the dollar was at 164 and now it's around 171 from the low point If you look at the Japanese situation, obviously, there's a lot of turmoil going on There are a lot of expected inflationary pressures, financial market problems, governmental weakness--all those kinds of things When I look at that setting, it's really hard for me to see the trade-weighted dollar depreciating in that scenario Even if rates rise there, as you pointed out yourself, there's a good chance that those will be nominal rate moves that aren't even keeping up with inflationary pressures And we've already seen that nominal rate differentials have narrowed dramatically against the dollar and the dollar hasn't weakened There has been a rise recently in the trade-weighted dollar, but that's mainly because of the DM The fact is that the dollar has come down against the DM over the period [since] last fall, but other EMS currencies have been tied into that to some extent Looking forward, as long as we maintain our anti-inflationary policies, I can't see anything but upward pressure on the dollar Explain to me how the dollar is going to depreciate in this environment   Yes, but I would argue that that effect has already taken place That's why the dollar is down about 15 percent or so against the DM, from 19 to 17 But going forward, if they're going to have an inflationary experience out of this, then--   I can see it's definitely uncertain I would say that's one plausible scenario; what seems to me equally plausible is that the dollar becomes strong from this point on   I certainly agree with that in the short run   Just trying to create a little noise   One last point, just following up on what I think Governor Angell was suggesting--I'm not sure if it's in the [vein] of stirring things up again--on what might be the way to go about this since everybody, I think, is frustrated with the price numbers they keep seeing in your scenario Why not take an improved price scenario and tell us what kind of interest rates and economic performance go with it? And then let us make a decision about whether that's an acceptable risk or not  -19-    3/27/90   [Unintelligible] that people want to see some improvement in this period of '90, '91, and '92 and they don't see it And the fact is that they want to know what the cost is of achieving it They basically are saying ""Look, this is what goes with no progress What goes with the progress?""   I agree with that, but the problem is--   I'll comment Actually, I've been impressed too that the economy hasn't shown signs of slowing to the degree that people had forecast earlier It's still a little hard for me to tell at this stage how much of that can be attributed to our luck with the weather and how much is really a pickup after smoothing through those kinds of seasonal--unseasonal I should say--developments Nevertheless, when you do smooth through it, you still have a picture that looks like sustained growth at a lower rate that doesn't look particularly scary  I also hear these stories--as a matter of fact, I'm bombarded by such stories--of a credit crunch I have hosted at least three or four different state bankers associations here over the last couple of weeks and have been besieged by people saying that that is going on But it's very hard to find evidence in the data that that is in fact the case You hear a lot of anecdotes about it and that's what they bring to the table, but you don't see any kind of general credit crunch going on I agree with others that there is clearly a commercial real estate overhang It's all over the country; a contraction is going on there I'm sure because of the S&Ls that there is a lack of availability of credit from the S&L industry to developers; you hear that everywhere But actually, that's healthy; that's not something to be afraid of That consolidation really has to take place There still may be something in the pipeline on this credit crunch; it's just not obvious in any data that we see Our quality spreads surely don't show it on interest rates In fact, you would expect, if there were some sort of pullback in banks' willingness to lend, to see upward pressure on bank rates If demand were still there and the supply was being restricted, why wouldn't short-term market rates come under upward pressure? It certainly doesn't look like there's any dramatic upward pressure relative to the funds rate On the other hand, you don't see a tendency for demand to be that weak either because you don't see these short-term rates falling against the funds rate either Things actually look fairly stable around the short end and quality spreads actually look very good--unless you're trying to find some junk bonds that aren't quoted in the market Compare those to AAA corporates and I'm sure they don't look good  So, I think the economy is doing okay, at least in the period that we can see ahead I don't have any disagreement with the Greenbook; I think it's about right, although I wouldn't want to project anything beyond six or eight months from now just because it's  -33-    3/27/90  too uncertain On the inflation front, as I said, it's a little disappointing that there hasn't been more progress, although I do attribute most of the short-run pressure that we have had to seasonal developments I think the effect that the cold weather had on food and energy costs in the December period is the primary factor on the total CPI and PPI numbers If you actually look at the producer price index excluding food and energy, you do see some progress In fact, the 12-month rate for the PPI excluding energy is now down to 37 percent, which is better than previous 12-month rates in the PPI What is disappointing is the consumer price index, which doesn't show any signs of easing off; even excluding the food and energy components that still seems to be strong As a matter of fact the [increases for the] last two months, at 6 and 7 percent, are very troubling You can always find some special factor like apparel or something else that has had a major impact, but there's always something I can live with separating out the food and energy components because those are volatile elements that are somewhat beyond our control in the shorter run But as for these other factors, you have to draw the line somewhere The fact is that the CPI doesn't look all that good It makes me wonder, though, since the PPI seems to be improving, if there is just a lag before it eventually shows up in the CPI; I don't know  The economy looks stable, although there's this atmosphere of concern about debt, a credit crunch, and things like that But international events are developing, it seems to me, in a positive way You can question how slowly or how fast [the changes in] Europe will develop, but unless the political climate changes dramatically-- say, the Soviet Union gets tremendously tougher--in the longer run and maybe in the most immediate short run, that has to be positive I don't know But I'm convinced that East Germany is going to boom because West Germany is going to make it boom; they're going to throw money at it So I think that is a positive in terms of external sources of economic pressure Japan doesn't seem to be weak from a productivity point of view and I think their major problems are that they have been pushing the edge of capacity constraints and they have had a speculative bubble and all that is sort of fermenting over there along with the weak government But I don't see external evidence of sources of depression coming from outside of the United States So that should be positive And the inflation picture seems to me to be somewhat stable but not improving I don't know what that says for the immediate term for policy, but I think it does say that if we want to make progress in the upcoming period, we're going to have to have a tough look at that   Today?   Yes; that's why I was curious   Well, my preference was for something along the lines of ""B"" asymmetric for some of the same reasons that already have been mentioned by Roger Guffey and others But I can certainly go along with the Chairman's suggestion for symmetry I don't feel that strongly; I have a mild preference for asymmetry There are a couple of things on my mind along the lines of what Lee said If we didn't have to worry [unintelligible] quite so much, then I think it would be a great opportunity to gain some credibility by shocking the foreign exchange markets But in fact, I can see a lot of difficulties with that; I can see that that would be a difficult problem that we need to be more sensitive to Along with what Don Kohn said earlier, I interpret what has happened to long-term rates as mostly real rate  -44-    3/27/90  pressures from some pickup in the economy, although in my opinion it could be because of some of the events that have taken place worldwide and not just domestically It could be improvement in potential output and something like an increase in the net real return on capital And if that is the case, the current funds rate would be a relative easing of policy Although if it's an increase in potential, that wouldn't necessarily create a long-run inflationary problem But it's impossible to sort all that out It's just theoretical reasoning We have to look for the data as they come in I wish we did have a political setting in which to enjoy the advantage of having a strengthening dollar here and be able to get more bang per buck at this stage with some firmness But I agree that it's not in the cards We do live in a political economy, not a simple abstract situation So, I can go along with ""B"" symmetric   [Unintelligible] the current account deficits will make it work the other way? [Unintelligible] selling dollars with a large current account deficit   I think in fact it can complicate the sterilization process Technically, we can definitely do it, but we already have found that we had some collateral pressures Now, I know we could suspend that and reinterpret our collateral, but that complicates the process Also, in my opinion, at times it can create a significant amount of uncertainty about policy in the open market because if the market doesn't know the degree to which we have undertaken exchange rate intervention then it can confuse the market's understanding of what the reserve need is on any given day That can add volatility in the market and it can confuse the market at least in the very short run   Yes, absolutely; because it comes out eventually in the reports But I think it could have a substantive effect if we ran into serious collateral problems If we try to change our definition of collateral and expand what we consider collateral, we could open up a whole Pandora's box of questions about the substance of our policy   Well, I'm saying we still have to change it [even if] it was self-imposed   You could raise a lot of questions about that   I couldn't agree more All I'm saying is that it can complicate the sterilization process Tentatively, that's true  -50-    3/27/90   It could quickly become an issue if it looked as if we were bailing out the currencies of other countries   Mr Chairman, that raises a very important point along the lines of what Ed Boehne was talking about initially It seems that there ought to be some understanding in the Committee about where we cross over the line from just providing intervention to resist disorderly conditions and at what point we decide that it has gotten out of control and the fundamentals are really working against us It seems to me that if we accumulate $20 billion in foreign exchange reserves over a relatively short period of time, that's a signal that we've crossed over the line   I guess the question is What do we do, if they keep doing this? We have $20 billion of a $45 billion total What if they keep wanting to sell dollars?   Okay   Well, that may be true as an empirical matter; but the potential is certainly there for it to create mysterious volatility problems, especially if we're intervening in large amounts I concede that empirically that may not have been the case so far, but potentially it clearly could be And that's something we should take into account But I think we ought to go back to what Bob Parry was saying I wouldn't worry so much about this whole thing if I thought it was totally ineffective I think generally sterilized intervention is grossly ineffective But there are times--and I think even this research shows that--when it can be effective at least in the short to intermediate term The time that it is effective, at least temporarily if not even into the intermediate term, is when there is concerted multilateral intervention, which basically gives a signal to the market that there's a coordinated effort by all the major industrial countries to achieve some exchange rate level Now, whether they ultimately achieve it or not, it creates in my opinion potential turmoil in the market in the short to intermediate term And it can even change the psychology of the fundamentals in my opinion   Well, I can cite you an example that I have cited before You can argue both sides of that I think there have been times when we have been effective playing the game and there have been times when we have been totally ineffective A good example is from my experience when I was at the Treasury I have mentioned this to Ted and others before When I was at the Treasury, Beryl Sprinkel was Undersecretary and there was a policy of non-intervention Yes, there was some modest intervention at times when the Treasury decided that it was useful, but only when they decided it was useful The Fed's views during the whole period were completely shut out From my experience, I don't remember any cooperation or any plea by the Fed during that period having any effect whatsoever   Yes   Sure What I'm saying, though, is that you probably could cite other times in the past where playing the game has not gotten us anywhere And there are times where you have to draw  -53-    3/27/90  the line and say you're going to make a stand I would completely agree that playing the game up to a point is a practical thing to do The question is What are the guidelines as to where we draw the line and when we decide to make a stand?  SPEAKER(?) Can you know a priori?   I think we can have some guidelines to say in general what kind of intervention we find acceptable No, I wouldn't tie anyone's hands It ought to come to this table and there ought to be a discussion once we cross over some threshold we consider to be outside the frontier of what we thought was reasonable We ought to decide it, though   Well, I'll be honest My view is that we've had considerable influence standing firm The fear at the Treasury of the Fed pulling out of this process in my opinion has been as strong a disciplinary force as anything else   Well, there are several things we can do I'm not saying I would prescribe these, but we have a lot of tools One is that we don't approve any further intervention limits or intervene on our account We say, okay, Treasury, you have independent authority to intervene as a matter of Treasury policy and you can do it for your account But the other point is that we also have the authority to approve their warehousing of foreign currencies Now, they can warehouse, as the Chairman says, in other places possibly I'm not sure where   Other central banks?   But I can't conceive of the BIS doing that   But the point is there are tools First of all, we don't have to do it for our account and that becomes clear to the market We don't have to warehouse their foreign exchange reserves Those are basically the disciplinary tools we have And I think before the Treasury would risk confronting that, they would listen to us But we've got to be willing to use those tools or we're not going to get them to listen The Chairman has been very effective in my opinion in getting them to listen at times, but I think you would concede that they have been pretty stubborn    3/27/90   Messrs Mulford and Sprinkel fall in the same category   But I feel that it was the fear of our pulling out of the process that scared them more than anything else   But then I think it would become clear to the market if we got to that point If I were a market participant and I were sitting out there seeing the Federal Reserve talking about price stability and yet selling massive amounts of dollars, I think eventually I'd decide that was a joke as a policy It seems to me that our policies have to be reasonably complementary and that we have to make some stand ultimately if the amount gets beyond the point of reason I'm not saying that within a range we should not participate and act in a practical way on disorderly markets, as Ed Boehne said But what do you do when you build up $50-$60 billion of foreign exchange reserves?   The Bundesbank would be happy   No, I agree with you   But, Jerry, there is still the question Say that that was the trend, that the dollar was rising toward 200--  -59-    3/27/90   Let me pose this question to you Look, I don't disagree with that, but I think the question is What are we in for? Let's say that the yen was weak for whatever reason--I could name half a dozen reasons why the Japanese may have continuing problems--and the dollar does continue to strengthen against the yen It could turn around tomorrow But say it [weakens] and we already have $8 billion of yen reserves   All I'm saying is that the Chairman should be able to go into a meeting like that with some demonstration to the Treasury and the G-7 of where we [unintelligible] acceptable path   I still want to finish this example just as an illustration of what we might be faced with Let's just assume that the yen continues to weaken against the dollar and we already have $8 billion or more of yen reserves And let's just say that the reasons  -60-    3/27/90  the yen is weak are internal to the Japanese market they're not confronting inflationary pressures; they have a weak government, without much credibility; their stock market is overvalued I could name off a few others Let's just say they have all those problems and yet they don't want to confront those problems They want us to help them on the foreign exchange markets What do we say if, let's say, the Treasury wants to go along with that?   All right, you've answered that But what if the G-7 wants a multilateral concerted effort to drive the dollar to lower levels?   You've answered my questions There's where you draw the lines   You're talking about monetary policy cards, though   The historical work shows that it wasn't until 1962 that we even got involved in intervention   Why do they want us in?   No That's what scares me   It's one thing to hold that view, which I think is an acceptable view in terms of the theory, but it's another thing to try and force it to happen with exchange rate intervention If you believe in theory that it's going to happen, not--   But if you believe that that equilibrium adjustment has to take place, you wouldn't believe that intervention can change that   I agree that there are But reconcile for me this notion of the belief that the current account deficit requires some equilibrium adjustment and that intervention matters   Okay   But I'm saying If you believe it's got to happen why would you intervene? Why don't--   Maybe I'm missing something Is there some simple mathematics on the size of the debt that you're talking about?   But, Ted, I still want my question answered about why the Treasury wants us involved   Well, but that's the question Why do they want us involved?   But that just tells me that that's the reason we should be worried They want us involved because they want us to be partners in this crime   Protect the gold stock   May I ask one question, though?  -69-    3/27/90  [CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN] Sure   I would feel a lot more comfortable with that proposal if it had one extra provision, which would be related to what Jerry was saying about where we draw the [line] What do we say if there were an effort for concerted intervention to put the dollar at lower levels? I'm not saying that would happen, but what do we say?   Okay I'm for it   Well, I agree   We could win that Exactly   But I can tell you we'll have hearings There were hearings over this G-7 exercise last September when the foreign exchange reserves had built up after that I had to testify right after David Mulford and Mulford was roasted in both houses of Congress over that very issue So I can tell you on the political front, the Chairman is right Taking the position of [not] debauching our currency is something that we can win every time   Mr Chairman, may I just ask Ted Truman a technical question on warehousing?   In the past has there normally been some sort of maturity associated with a warehousing instrument, similar to a swap agreement?   I was just asking what the history was   How far would the $25 billion put us over, Peter?   By when would you say?   The thought of holding Argentine australs as collateral against the dollar--well, who can say? Eventually, one day it might be--   But who knows in 10 years   It's the most important part of-- "
3901,1990-05-15," Second   Did the recent numbers change your outlook any? I gather that you put a lot of this together before the most recent numbers   The other question was on the budget You implied that strong action on the budget would restrict the economy Is that assuming that what goes with it is a drop in real interest rates? I just wonder Wouldn't that be a source of stimulus to some degree too? How are you coming to this restraint view?   Could this trend also be in addition to the improved efficiency? That would be a good sign on the inflation expectations side It could imply that the real cost to carry is pretty high and that there's no speculative inventory built in That would be consistent with--   Actually, I feel a little better today about the inflationary risks than I did maybe a couple of weeks ago, with some of these more recent data But once again, you can't tell much from one or two months of numbers I still am generally concerned about the outlook, but these recent numbers cloud it up a bit Consumption has been fairly modest, but the first-quarter real GNP number looked stronger than I would have expected We see investment plans running at 7-1/2 percent, which is pretty strong; I don't know if that will actually materialize, but the plans are running fairly strong My concern is that with inventories fairly low--and I realize  -23-    5/15/90  that there are incentives to keep them that way--demand seems to be sufficient both on the investment side and the consumption side that the economy is poised to pick up if demand pressures develop And my concern is that they might develop from external sources I didn't hear too many people that concerned about export demand, but having just been overseas and having talked to people there I still have some concern about that I feel more comfortable that the Bundesbank is going to deal with the inflation risk in Germany Still, we see rates coming down in France and other European countries; and in fact, even though I think East Germany and other east European countries are going to be facing recessionary-type conditions, I think all their consumption is going to turn to the West Even if it's lower than in the past, they're going to be buying goods The outlook for the Soviet Union is grim because I don't think they're going to be able to sell anything They may be able to barter a few things and they will be able to sell energy and some of their raw materials, but nobody is going to buy any consumer goods from the Soviet Union All industrial countries are strained in terms of their productive capacity Japan is still growing strongly in spite of their financial shake-out And Europe continues to show signs of strength So, I'm fairly optimistic about our export prospects and the improvement in our external position But I do worry about what kind of pressure that's going to put on the inflationary situation going forward So, I do think there are some risks Some of the financial indicators suggest it Even though long-term interest rates have come down more recently--almost a half percentage point from where they were--they are still up over the intermeeting period And as Governor Angell pointed out, commodity prices have been under some upward pressure They look a little milder now, depending on which index you look at, but still they are up What worries me the most is that the trade-weighted dollar is turning down Even though the dollar had shown strength against the yen, a lot of that has changed recently As someone reported, the trade-weighted dollar is down 14 percent from its peak last year If that kind of trend continues, we may be faced with some pretty significant external strength, and I don't know how much room we have for that So, that's a worry  I'm not as concerned about the credit crunch issue; I have heard a lot of anecdotes and I think it is a potential risk, but just listening to what people have said around here it seems like some of that is [unintelligible] The aggregates have turned weaker, but I would argue that that has to do with some portfolio shifts that have occurred with the change in interest rates more recently, and I think that will subside and we will see a return to more significant growth So, I think we have to be very watchful and cautious I think the risks are on the inflation side, but given the more recent data I don't know if it's worth pressing immediately   My preference is for ""B"" asymmetric But I certainly wouldn't make a big deal over that, given your preference for statements in the policy record showing our concerns It's splitting hairs to make that point However, like Dick Syron, I'm a little worried that if over the intermeeting period we get a few stronger numbers, our credibility could slip rapidly I was very concerned for a few weeks before this meeting that we were right on the edge of totally losing our credibility when we got the CPI and purchasing managers' survey results; all the data were coming in strong Of course, the more recent numbers have to some extent bailed us out Maybe that's an indication that there was an illusion in the data Still, even if we go for symmetric with a slightly stronger record of our concerns, we should be prepared--if these numbers slip in the intermeeting period--to be able to swing all the way to an intermeeting move I think we're in a situation where if, say, the credit crunch concerns start to dissipate and all of a sudden we get one or two strong numbers, we may not make it to the next meeting with our credibility intact We ought to be flexible enough to be able to react to that   I understand, and I agree   The facts  -31-    5/15/90   Sure   Sure, I understand That's why I'm saying I agree with what you're proposing "
5377,1995-07-05," [Statement--see Appendix]   We actually have explicit interest rate paths built into what we have to say about these countries I guess I would invert the question just a bit I will deal with Europe first and return to Canada These are countries that, as we perceive it, were exhibiting considerable momentum around the end of last year and even into early this year So, the questions I ask myself are What has slowed these economies in the first half of 1995 and will that persist? Will policy action be needed to stimulate those economies? In some cases that may be, but I think the answer that we get for some of these countries is ""no"" For example, in Germany the impact of the tax surcharge, which for reasons that I can't fully explain did not seem to have been anticipated, was not visible in the earlier data But when the tax surcharge went into effect in early 1995, one does see it in the data; we expect to see that reversed in early 1996 when other taxes are reduced Some effect of the exchange rate appreciation is certainly a piece of the story in Germany and maybe even in France, but there are flip sides of that in Italy and in the United Kingdom We got GDP for Italy this morning, for example, and it was very strong in the first quarter So, I guess what I am left with by way of describing our forecast is to say that a piece of this policy story is that the tightening that we thought would come on line early in 1995 has been postponed And that, in a sense, is monetary easing relative to the baseline from which we were starting And at least several of the factors that we see as explaining the slowdown in the first half of 1995 we view as having transitory characteristics They are either already built in, as in the case of the German taxes, or are not seen as persistent enough to require a real policy response  Canada is quite different The drop in Canada was far stronger than I think I can rationalize in these terms It was related in part to the US economy, but it certainly was of an amplitude far greater than we experienced in the United States I suspect that there will be a need for more monetary policy easing in Canada for recovery really to take hold again We have seen actions by the Bank of Canada already, so I think some of that monetary easing will in fact be forthcoming   I did not mean to suggest any pejorative notion by using the word ""deflation"" I meant it literally as just that the rate of change of certain prices was negative Now, it is certainly true that it is happening in the goods sector because to some degree what you described has happened That is, we have opened up--a little maybe--Japanese markets to world trade For example, if you use Japanese national income account data in real terms, the share of imports to GDP has risen sharply In that sense, imported goods and the competitive pressures that they can apply through market phenomena are having an effect of the sort you might want I'm not so sure that I see that as much of an explanation for why land prices have been falling and are still falling Nor do I see it really as an explanation for the stock market behavior So, the asset price story, which had its own special factors on the up side in the late 1980s--a speculative bubble kind of story, fueled perhaps by what in retrospect seems like a too easy monetary policy--has a different story on the down side as well I am not particularly alarmed that Japanese goods prices are responding to competitive pressures from the outside world I would think that it might be easier on all concerned if it happened through an end to the upward pressures on the yen rather than through falling prices of Japanese goods But I am not aware of any rigidity stories, for example, that suggest that because prices have some downward rigidity all sorts of problems are being created I am merely suggesting that in that environment Japanese monetary policy looks to be a bit tight, given what we know about capacity utilization, the behavior of wages, and what is happening to asset prices All the pieces fit together to suggest that the stance of monetary policy could be eased a bit in an effort to get that economy growing again   True, but I am taking into account the other things we know about what is going on in Japan "
5881,1998-02-03," Financial market turbulence in Asia has dominated events abroad over the past six months We have attempted to foresee how these events will influence prices, global trade, and thus output growth both here and abroad during this year and next Despite our best efforts, uncertainty about exactly how these variables are linked and about how the key financial variables will behave in the near term is a major source of risk to our forecast  Your first international chart reports interest rate changes and developments in exchange markets, along with our forecasts for selected dollar exchange rates The top left panel shows the change in the value of the dollar in terms of the yen and the mark since mid-1997 We believe that the relative strength of economic activity in the United States accounted for much of the rise in the value of the dollar over the year Dollar assets also provided some security in a turbulent world With US output growth expected to slow, and given our assumption that the crises in Asia will not give rise to additional major surprises in that region or elsewhere, we look for the dollar to remain near recent levels in terms of these currencies In terms of the Canadian dollar, on the right panel, we look for the US dollar to retreat a bit from recent all-time highs We expect the dollar to rise slightly in terms of sterling, which has been particularly strong recently  As is shown in the next row of panels, three-month interest rates have moved up since July in foreign industrial countries, particularly in Canada and the United Kingdom, where official central bank lending rates have been increased Ten-year rates have generally fallen, however On balance, long-term rates have moved down less in Germany and Japan than in the United States, perhaps reflecting capital flowing into US instruments in search of safe-haven opportunities  The next panels show a range of selected Asian currencies, expressed as the US dollar value of those currencies In nominal terms, the Hong Kong dollar has to date successfully maintained its peg to the US dollar, and we project that will continue The Korean won and the Thai baht have lost about one half of their market value at the start of 1997 The drop for the Indonesian rupiah is even larger There undoubtedly will be more volatility in these nominal exchange rates But, as shown on the right, on balance over the forecast period we expect that    2/3-4/98  rising domestic inflation will impart an upward trend to the real exchange rates of the heavily depreciated Asian currencies For the Mexican peso, bottom left, slowing domestic inflation and some nominal depreciation should prevent further real appreciation  A broad measure of the exchange value of the dollar in terms of 29 currencies --weighted to reflect the competitiveness of US exports and adjusted for relative consumer prices--is shown in the bottom right panel Taken together, our projections for dollar exchange rates imply that, for this measure of the dollar, the extended real appreciation that began in early 1995 will give way to some modest real depreciation of the dollar  Your next chart translates our outlook for exchange rates and foreign prices into prospects for US import prices The top left panel presents what evidence we have of the effect to date on US import prices of the events in Asia Prices of imports from the Asian NIEs and from Japan continued to fall rapidly through the fourth quarter, in contrast to prices of imports from other industrial countries  The right panel shows some results of our efforts to use models to calculate the contribution of foreign consumer prices and exchange rates to average US import prices Our research shows that it is useful to separate prices in the foreign industrial countries--translated into dollars using nominal exchange rates (the black line)--from prices in the nonindustrial countries, also expressed in dollars (the red line) The very sharp declines in the exchange rates of many countries in the latter group result in the much steeper drop during 1997 that is evident in the red line In addition, in our analysis of import prices, we need to allow for impulses from non-oil commodity prices (in the middle left panel) and oil prices (the middle right panel) Non-oil commodity prices are expected to continue their downward trend throughout the forecast period as supplies of these commodities generally remain ample and as economic distress in Asia weakens global demand Oil prices have already decreased significantly and are expected to edge down a  bit further before partly retracing their decline The present softness in oil markets reflects additional oil supply from some Persian Gulf producers and mild winter weather in several regions that has depressed demand  The bottom panel reports results of our efforts to take account of these factors in forecasting the prices of core imports--that is, imports of non-oil goods other than computers and semiconductors, shown by the black line--and prices of total imports of goods and services, the red line The solid black bars show the model's calculation of the contribution of prices in foreign industrial countries to the forecast for core import prices; the open black bars do the same for prices of the nonindustrial countries Our analysis suggests that the extreme depreciations in some Asian currencies were an important influence in the decline of import prices late in 1997 and will continue so in early 1998 However, our estimates suggest that the effect of a given percentage change in dollar prices in the    2/3-4/98  nonindustrial countries on US import prices is about one third of the effect of the same change in prices in foreign industrial countries Thus, the disinflationary impact of price developments in Asia on US import prices is limited Prices from both groups of countries are projected to switch to exerting slight upward pressure later this year  Our outlook for output abroad, the subject of your next chart, incorporates our judgment about the implications of financial developments in Asia for activity in that region and our estimate of the spillover effects of those developments onto growth in other regions Growth abroad, the red bars in the top left panel, is estimated to have dropped sharply in the fourth quarter and is projected to remain weak this year before recovering partially next year As can be seen in the top right panel, swings in projected growth in the Asian developing countries account for the lion's share of the fall in average growth abroad Growth in the Latin American developing countries and in the industrial countries is expected to be weaker this year and next than in 1997, in part the result of spillovers from events in Asia  As reported in the middle left panel, the Asian developing countries account for nearly 20 percent of US exports Our reading of developments to date is that output growth in Korea and in several southeast Asian countries will be pushed into negative numbers as domestic demand is severely reduced by the financial market turmoil, higher domestic interest rates, restricted availability of credit, and macroeconomic policy measures put in place in these countries We look for recovery to begin in 1999 in response to strong external demand and success on balance in implementing the structural reforms now under way In ""greater China,"" some asset market disruption and loss of export competitiveness as a consequence of currency depreciations by neighbors is expected to weaken growth this year and to restrain the rebound next year  This forecast incorporates the substantial improvement in external balances in Asia that we believe global financial markets are demanding The bottom left panel compares our forecast for the aggregate current account balances of the Asian region in the current Greenbook (the black bars) with that prepared in September (the red bars) when it appeared that adjustment would be limited to one or two smaller Asian countries We now estimate that the aggregate Asian external balance for 1997 already has adjusted significantly Substantial further adjustment is expected to be accomplished quickly during this year; the emergence of sizable surpluses should reassure markets, thereby easing credit availability and permitting moderation of some policy measures Growth in domestic demand should then resume You can see in the right panel for the Latin American countries that only a small positive revision has been made to our forecast since September This aggregate masks substantial changes since September in our forecasts for individual countries Nevertheless, we are    2/3-4/98  assuming that these countries will not experience the kind of financial crises that would force substantial external adjustment  Chart 6 contains our forecast for the industrial countries and some of the factors that lie behind it Real GDP growth in most of these countries, the top left box, is expected to slow this year, in part as a consequence of weaker export demand from Asia In Japan, large direct effects of downturns in the troubled Asian countries came on top of domestic factors that weakened domestic demand and the result was little growth on balance last year We expect only limited recovery during the forecast period as the move from fiscal contraction to a more neutral stance yields a bounceback in domestic demand that is partially offset by weakness in the external sector The panel on the right shows measures of the yen and the mark calculated as weighted averages based on their exports and adjusted for relative consumer prices These measures suggest that, in effective terms, these currencies appreciated in 1997--with the yen moving further over the year as a whole This effective appreciation should act as a drag on the external sector for much of the forecast period Our exchange rate projections imply some real effective depreciation this year and next, especially for the yen, that should help to boost the Japanese and German economies in 1999  The extent to which the other industrial countries are vulnerable to spillover effects from Asia is suggested by the data in the middle panel While Japan exports a fraction of its GDP similar to that for the United States, a far larger share of its exports has been to the Asian developing countries The European Union members, when taken together so that intra-EU trade is excluded, closely resemble the United States  The bottom panels show the available information on business confidence The downturns evident for the Canadian, UK, and Japanese measures in the second half of 1997 likely are at least in part a response to the Asian crises In the European countries shown on the right panel, business confidence leveled off in late 1997 In France, where we have a reading from January, confidence remained at a high level but there were some reports of lower foreign orders, perhaps a hint of Asian effects to come  The final international chart presents our conclusions about the path of real net exports over the forecast period The black line in the upper left panel, projected growth of core imports--the volume of non-oil goods excluding computers and semiconductors --is shown slowing on a four-quarter change basis through the end of 1999 Our models decompose the contributions of US GDP (the black bars) and relative prices (the red bars) Through part of 1998, the stimulative effect of the recent dollar appreciation increasingly boosts import demand, partly offsetting the restraining effect of slower US GDP growth From mid-1998 through mid-1999 both variables are working to decelerate core imports    2/3-4/98  In the upper right panel, projected growth of real core exports--the line--drops sharply, starting now Relative prices are working to cause exports to decline throughout the forecast period The robust contribution of foreign growth to our export performance that occurred in 1997 is projected to be followed by significantly diminished contributions this year and next  Growth of total exports and imports is depicted in the lower left panel As you can see, the slowing that we expect in export growth--the black line--greatly exceeds that projected for imports--the red line--a consequence of the real dollar appreciation that we have seen In addition, we have not extrapolated into the forecast period the surprising strength in real export growth that occurred in the first half of 1997--the part not explained by the bars in the upper right panel With real imports growing significantly faster than exports throughout the forecast period, the contribution of real net exports is negative As the data in the box show, real net exports likely will subtract nearly one percentage point from real GDP growth this year and about half that in 1999  Mike will now continue our presentation   I don't have a precise numerical answer to that question If we  were to generate higher export growth in our model by exogenously stronger income  growth abroad, then we would go through a process involving certain interactions whose  result would be to produce a net positive impact on US GDP    2/3-4/98   That implies a multiplier of 1   Yes, 1 to 1-1/2 is usually what we use as a rule of thumb in our  calculations   To a degree The swing in exports in our forecast, as our  models depict it, owes to the relative price term more than to what we are saying about  the slowdown in the growth in foreign GDP   Yes Forecasters do vary in terms of the speed and strength of  the reaction to changes in exchange rates that they put into their models I don't think we  really are an outlier in terms of the nature of our model being radically different from  other models Our forecasts are comparatively a little weak on some countries, but I do  not think we are radically different We do systematically take relative price effects into  account, and I think we see them as quite elastic on the export side Through both 1998  and 1999, the exchange rate has a significant effect in slowing exports    2/3-4/98  The other missing piece is the decision on our part to utilize a forecasting strategy  that we have wrestled with since the middle of the year That relates to how we evaluate  the very rapid growth of exports that occurred in the first half of 1997 and how to  incorporate that development looking forward We have taken a middle course About  two Greenbooks ago, we indicated a change in our strategy, as it were, in the sense that in  forecasting growth rates, we were going to be guided by the fundamentals We were not  going to assume that because the growth of exports had exceeded our forecasts for the  first half of 1997, we should extrapolate that forward This strategy was adopted partly  because we concluded that we did not understand some of the elements that had driven  the high numbers in the first half of 1997 In addition, we had tested our model in as  many different ways as we could, and we thought that on average it was robust and  therefore that we should be guided by it So, we have not added, if you will, an  unexplained factor to the growth rate in 1998 and 1999 That causes a very rapid  deceleration in our forecast We should see it soon and we should know soon whether or  not this was the right strategy to take with respect to forecasting export growth  The data that we have, particularly the data we just got for the fourth quarter, had  slightly higher exports in them than we had written down in the Greenbook but not by  much or enough to make us think that this strategy of not assuming an additional  unexplained element to export growth was the wrong thing to do I think we felt  supported by the Beigebook stories that we have been hearing, by the purchasing  managers' data that were released today, and by the information obtained through the  extra calls about the effects of Asian developments that we made with the help of our  Reserve Bank colleagues There are responses from members of the private sector    2/3-4/98  suggesting that there is some evidence to date, along with increasing uncertainty and  concern, that export growth is, in fact, going to slow dramatically   The actual data will be complicated by a residual seasonality  problem If history repeats itself, the first-quarter data, as they get announced to the  world, will show weaker exports because the fourth quarter is one that we estimate has a  big positive residual seasonal factor I think such a development in the first quarter might  change the expectational climate a little  I took this moment to check our forecasts of growth in the industrial countries  compared to the outside consensus Again, we are not radically different on the economic  outlook for those countries Our forecasts for the Asian countries are somewhat weaker  than a reading of what others are saying But the difference is small, and we felt we were  behind the curve for a long time on that and we wanted to catch up to reality or what we  thought it was Mike's point is quite well taken We already are seeing evidence of  substantial improvement in the trade balances of Korea and several of the other Asian    2/3-4/98  countries that have released trade data for December We even have, I believe, a January  number for Korea   We asked our analysts to calculate mentally, econometrically, or  indeed using any other estimating device they have available to them, how much they  have lowered their economic forecasts for Canada, Japan, and major European countries  in response to the events in troubled Asian economies Of course, the answer varies  depending upon the country The most pronounced effects were on Japan We used  September as the benchmark month on which to base the assessments because that  appears to be the month before the world generally began to recognize the scope that the  Asian problem would eventually take on In Japan, the weakening impact on GDP is on  the order of a full 1-1/4 percentage points for 1998 and almost 1 percentage point for 1999    2/3-4/98  We have written down the Japanese forecast considerably since September, and we  attribute that almost in its entirety to the Asian effect; there are other factors but they tend  to be offsetting one way or another  For Europe, running my eye down the column of estimates, I would say the  number tends to be about 1/2 percentage point of GDP We have estimated an elasticity of  one for our export demand from these economies If their GDP slows by 1/2 percentage  point, we translate that using an elasticity of one into their demand for our exports For  Canada, which is not to be overlooked because of its importance in our trade, the  write-down has been significantly less But it is still several tenths--2, 3, or 4 tenths--that  analysts would attribute to the Asian effect In the case of Canada, that has been offset by  other factors to the point where the actual forecast has not changed by that much  Obviously, had the Asian slowdown not happened, we would be getting more demand  from Canada because the domestic Canadian economy is quite strong So we have  repeatedly asked people to be very aware of the Asian impact both with regard to its  effect on the exchange rate and on the real demand for our goods They have come back  with numbers on this order of magnitude   I guess I did not follow the question too well I think if one  looks at Chart 3--   In putting together the Greenbook forecast, we have not  extrapolated the strength of the dollar We saw the dollar rise from the spring of 1995  into 1996 Our view was that to some degree the rise was warranted because in the spring  of 1995 the dollar was exceptionally weak, and there were good reasons for it to rise I  have not done this exercise and I cannot quote numbers to you, but one can look back at  the forecast as it was presented a year ago today Indeed in a briefing that was delivered  yesterday, a copy of which I believe you have received, staff in Research and Statistics  did precisely that In January 1997 we were not expecting the dollar to continue to  appreciate the way that it has, and we were not expecting the US economy to be as  relatively strong as it has been So, most of the appreciation that you can see in Chart 3    2/3-4/98  from the beginning of 1997 to the beginning of 1998, which was quite considerable, was  a surprise as it evolved  We have gone back and looked again at how best to parse that into the relative  exchange rates for the price terms that we put into the export equation and the relative  price terms that we put into our import equations We incorporated more currencies than  we had before because so much of what was taking place that caused the dollar to  appreciate involved currencies that we had not been systematically using in our  calculation We added a couple of currencies and then we decided that we should  perhaps look at them individually The end result of that analysis is that a great deal of  the slowing that we are seeing is projected to come through the relative price term The  bars on that final chart, Chart 7, tell you what our model was telling us, namely that the  appreciation of the dollar pushed up imports and will continue to push up imports for  some time Concurrently, it is going to slow exports through the end of the forecast  period in 1999  If the dollar appreciates further, we will send out a March Greenbook that  includes an even weaker foreign sector I don't know how else to adjust our forecast in  response to the ongoing appreciation of the dollar If the dollar simply stays as high as it  is, which is loosely speaking what we have assumed, we are depending on price inflation  in Asia to cause some real appreciation of the currencies there to offset some of the  appreciation we have experienced Until that comes on stream, we have these relative  price terms that our analysis is telling us have powerful effects on exports and imports  Export demand price elasticities are not quite at 1 but are between 07 and 1 with some  lags, and the lags in our exports are longer than those for our imports    2/3-4/98 "
6074,1998-11-17," I had a conversation with a fairly high-level staff person at the Bank  of Mexico They are still persuaded that it is useful for them to have this swap line They  believe that the market sees them in a different light from the other industrial central banks The  language that we are going to use, suggesting that the long period of disuse and the changed  character of international financial markets makes the swap lines no longer necessary, does not  apply to Mexico They would like this swap arrangement to continue   As we stated in the Greenbook, our forecast this time for the external sector is not much changed from that in September We have chosen not to assume that the depreciation of the dollar during the intermeeting period will be significantly reversed As a consequence, our path for the dollar going forward is about 3 percent lower in the near term, and about 2 percent lower toward the end of the forecast period, than last time  Such a change in our outlook for the dollar by itself would tend to stimulate exports and restrain imports Offsetting this stimulus for exports to some extent is a somewhat weaker projection for real output growth in our trading partners  By far the biggest downward revision in our outlook for growth abroad has been to our view on Japan We now expect that the trough in real output will not occur until sometime in 2000 This more negative outcome is expected despite injections of fiscal stimulus of about 1-1/2 percent of GDP next year We are thus expecting continuing declines in private domestic demand, particularly business investment, with little or no help from the external sector Since the Greenbook was published, we have learned some additional detail about the latest fiscal package proposed by the Japanese    11/17/98  government The package contains 6 trillion yen of personal and corporate tax cuts, an estimated 6 trillion yen of ""real water"" expenditures, and an additional array of measures that are expected to provide little direct economic stimulus Accordingly, the actual stimulus contained in the package is probably not more than half the 24 trillion headline value and is broadly in line with the Japanese fiscal assumptions in the November Greenbook Given the lags in implementing these packages, we expect that the effects of these measures will be felt during the second half of 1999, as the effects from the April 1998 package, which we think are now becoming visible, begin to wane  The other country of particular interest in this forecast round is Brazil In putting together the forecast, our strategy has been to assume that the international rescue package for Brazil succeeds in the sense that no abrupt change in the exchange rate regime is forced upon Brazil, and no contagion in that respect spills over to Argentina or elsewhere Real GDP in Brazil is expected to decline this quarter and through 1999, but the trough is now projected to occur in early 2000, and some recovery begins that year This contraction results from the high interest rates already in place, which are projected to ease some, and the fiscal restraint that is part of the policy program Brazil has announced We have built into the forecast some contraction of output elsewhere in South America as well  There are many pitfalls in the months ahead that could put the Brazilian program off track In the near term, Brazil and its private creditors must reach an understanding such that most, but not necessarily all, of the short-term external credits to Brazil are maintained Domestic creditors also must refrain on net from moving capital out of Brazil The fiscal agenda must proceed; in particular, the Brazilian Congress must enact crucial proposed measures so that an IMF review planned for February 1999 will be successful We recognize that it is far from certain that all this will proceed smoothly In the Greenbook, it seemed to us more useful to present in the baseline the implications for the foreign sector under the assumption of ""success,"" as at the moment that outcome is being actively pursued by officials in Brazil and at the IMF We did include as an alternative scenario, a model-based version of the impact of ""meltdown"" in Brazil and contagion elsewhere in the region In that event, with no policy adjustments here, US GDP growth would be reduced 1/2 to 3/4 percentage point in 1999 and in 2000  On balance, we look for the external sector to subtract nearly 1 percentage point at an annual rate from US GDP growth this quarter and about half that in 1999 and 2000 This is a bit less than we had been thinking in September, particularly for the current quarter    11/17/98  We would now be happy to take questions   You might remember that the US economy is growing much more  strongly than many of these overseas economies, and that is supporting profits and growth of  M2 One might think that shipments to these countries have risen some but that they just have  not risen as much as demand for currency in the United States has risen That is not the  benchmark that would determine them   The standby encompasses different ways of financing the sum of  money involved A substantial portion of the initial tranches will be done under what is called  the SRF, which is actually a facility that was created at the time of the Korean crisis Now there  is a variant of that under discussion, which would have contingent elements to it It was referred  to in the G-7 communique and has been discussed in the press and elsewhere The contingent  element was not really in play for Brazil because events overtook the debate, so to speak, but the  characteristics of the SRF part are that it will be at a penalty rate and it will be disbursed in large  quantity initially in an effort to discourage contagion and speculation and so forth But that is  under the umbrella of the standby arrangement The term ""standby"" can refer to financing this    11/17/98  way or financing through some of the other devices at a different pace In that sense, it is not  absolutely new But, yes, this option will be used for Brazil   Yes   They will The first tranche will be disbursed upon the vote of the  executive directors of the IMF, and that money will come immediately The conditions of that  first tranche have already been met They were set and they had to do with some of the items in  the fiscal package that were already announced and actions that the Brazilians have already  taken, so that is a given The next tranche will come up for review in February of 1999   I certainly take your point The 8 percent number was somewhat  unexpected We have not really had the opportunity to look into it, and it is hard to do so with  China because we don't get a lot of detail and can not get behind the scenes I am skeptical but I  can't cite good reasons for that skepticism other than that we know Asia as an economic area is  in trouble, and it is hard to believe that China is escaping as it would seem We will certainly  view this as something that we should look into and get more information through various  channels and give it to the Committee   Yes, capital controls and the like We expect them to be able to  maintain the present exchange regime into 1999, something we had assumed previously with  some trepidation, and it seems to be happening But I think we probably do need to question the  sequence of events and the policy choices they are making and ask some hard questions about  that We will try to do more about it   While you're at it, the timing as well! [Laughter]   I think the next three weeks are crucial for at least the initial success  of the Brazilian program The time between now and the signing of the letter of intent, which  will be on one of the first days in December, is the first hurdle that has to be gotten over People    11/17/98  even less cynical than I might think that chances are that what is needed to get a positive vote at  that first hurdle will take place because it is in the interests of many parties to have that happen  The critical feature is whether or not the private creditors of Brazil, both those within the country  and external to the country, appear to be carrying their fair share If so, the governments that  have money to be extended both through the IMF and through bilateral mechanisms will feel that  it is appropriate to vote ""yes"" and the program will go forward So, one might think that that will  happen, although I would not characterize it as 100 percent sure by any stretch of the  imagination But it certainly is still possible that things will unravel between then and February  of 1999, and one way it will become obvious that things are unraveling is if Brazil again starts to  lose reserves rapidly  I would guess the likelihood that the baseline Greenbook scenario will occur is in the  neighborhood of 50 percent, maybe a little more We thought it had a good chance or we would  not have given it any credence The meltdown scenario is a fairly contained one; it has spillovers  for Argentina, it has some implications for Mexico, and it would be messy Exactly how this  would take place is not clear It might include a combination of some unilateral actions on the  part of Brazil, some forced exchange rate adjustment, and then a return to the IMF and an  attempt to restart negotiations--all of which would certainly play out over some period of time I  guess I would give this scenario a big chunk of the remaining probability So, if the probability  of the Greenbook scenario is 55 or 60 percent, this alternative may be another 25 to 30 percent  But there is at least a 5 to 10 percent probability that Brazil could fall so hard that  Hong Kong, for example, would become threatened again, a possibility that is not in this  scenario Hong Kong is the other fixed exchange rate regime that has been tested repeatedly  since this crisis began If Hong Kong is forced off of its peg, then the progress that we have seen    11/17/98  to date in Korea and Thailand might be called into question because capital markets would again  become skeptical of their viability, and the citizens of those countries would begin to feel that  they should move their capital elsewhere That could trigger a worse scenario that I would not  give a lot of weight to, but one whose probability is not zero by any means "
6097,1998-12-22," We received October trade data after the Greenbook forecast was prepared, so I would like to start by describing the implications of those data for our understanding of the foreign sector during the current quarter Both exports and imports surprised us on the upside, but the surprise was significantly greater for exports In terms of trade categories, exports of machinery--other than computers--and industrial supplies both surprised us by the size of their increases The miss was not in aircraft or other items where large-size transactions can introduce noise into monthly data This surprising strength in exports may be a signal that recovery is proceeding a bit more rapidly in some parts of the world than we have allowed for in the forecast, but we have no direct evidence of that yet and hesitate to put too much weight on one month's trade data  The October data nevertheless lead us to expect fairly robust growth of exports in the fourth quarter, after three quarters of decline Combining stronger exports with a small revision to our outlook for imports results in a downward revision to our estimate for the quarter of the negative contribution of net exports to US GDP growth from 07 percent at an annual rate to 03 percent For 1999 and 2000, we still look for the drag from net exports to ease from about 1/2 percentage point next year to close to 1/4 percentage point in 2000 after an estimated 1 percentage points for this year as a whole  Our expectation that the drag exerted on real GDP growth by the external sector will diminish over the forecast period depends importantly on the modest rebound of exports that we are forecasting The impetus for that rebound lies partly in the waning effects of past dollar appreciation and partly in the strengthening we anticipate in average foreign output growth, which has been exceptionally weak in 1998 In the Greenbook, the recovery in foreign growth entails a return to low but positive growth in the developing countries of Asia, some slowing in Latin America but not collapse, and a substantial reduction in the rate of decline in output in Japan For each of these regions, our forecast is relatively conservative in that it is less optimistic than is the latest consensus forecast  As in November, our outlook for developments abroad incorporates the assumption that the international financial package put together for Brazil, including successful implementation of the macroeconomic policies laid out in the IMF program, restores market confidence As a consequence, although real activity in Brazil declines sharply, the Brazilian exchange rate regime remains in place and contagion to other economies in the region or elsewhere is kept to a minimum As we indicated in the Greenbook, we    12/22/98  view the risks to this baseline forecast of a less favorable outcome in Brazil as somewhat greater now in light of the failure of the Brazilian Congress to pass all the elements of a public sector pension reform package put before it earlier this month Moreover, capital continues to flow out of Brazil on a net basis most days  Last week, Brazil made an initial drawing on both the funds available through the IMF program and the funds available on a bilateral basis, for a total of just over $9 billion These resources have been added to Brazil's international reserves The Brazilian government has announced its intention to resubmit to the Congress next year the measures that did not pass in December and to proceed to implement the other elements of the IMF program We look for those steps to put a halt to private net capital outflows and to contribute to improved financial market conditions, but we recognize that a return to crisis conditions in Brazil, and spillover to Argentina, Mexico, and other emerging markets, is still a distinct possibility For that reason, we again included in the Greenbook an alternative scenario that incorporates a more pessimistic projection for Brazil, including a break in the exchange rate regime and the spread of contagion in Latin America That scenario implies that US real GDP growth would be 1/22 to 3/4 percentage point lower in 1999 and 2000, respectively  Mr Prell will continue our presentation   Yes, but not by much The import equation has been doing fairly well    12/22/98   Not convincing evidence yet, no The thought is in my mind, given  the enormous changes in potential GDP growth everywhere The fact that we see potential in the  United States going up--and we certainly have written down the potential for Japan and other  countries a great deal--suggests that whatever the deeply embedded fundamentals that give rise  to these elasticities are, they may be changing, too We can look at that question again, but there  is nothing about the past six months or so of data that would cause one to think that that must be  happening "
6148,1999-03-30," The basic picture from the external sector is very  similar to that in the January Greenbook We expect net exports to  continue to be a drag on GDP growth, but to a diminishing extent going     3/30/99 8   forward In the very near term, exports are a negative factor as some  elements that boosted exports strongly in the fourth quarter of last year are  unwound That combined with the upward revision to US activity and  thus to import growth results in a more sizable drop in net exports for the  first half of this year than we expected in January Exports should rebound  in the second half of this year and grow moderately next year, even after  we take into account the somewhat stronger level of the dollar that we now  see as likely   Two developments in particular since January inspire some  confidence in our positive view toward the prospects for exports One is  the move in Japan to significantly more aggressive monetary ease, coupled  with signs that financial sector reform is proceeding Although we  continue to have activity weakening in Japan through the middle of next  year, we now are looking for an upturn to begin during the second half of  2000 Financial market participants seem to have applauded the latest  policy moves in Japan more than we would, and ample downside risks  remain there Nevertheless, there are reasons to see developments in Japan  over the past two months as movements in a positive direction   Recent developments in Brazil have also lent credence to the view  that meltdown can be avoided in Brazil and, therefore, that the risk of  contagion to its neighbors is limited As a consequence, we have revised  slightly upward our outlook for Mexico The Brazilian real has retraced  some of its decline in terms of the dollar, even in the face of a reduction in  the overnight interest rate by the central bank of Brazil Thus far, support  among Brazil’s bank creditors is holding up, and last week one Brazilian  bank was able to return to the global market and raise voluntary funds with  a one-year maturity The reform program still faces many hurdles, and  success is not assured, but events in the past several weeks have been  encouraging   There are still places in the world where new economic crises could  erupt We have seen one such case in Ecuador, but so far it seems  contained, with no signs of further contagion A potentially more serious  case is China, where major domestic problems would no doubt have greater  implications for its neighbors We see real output growth slowing this year  in China and have built into the forecast a gradual move in its exchange  rate next year A more severe deceleration, or a more abrupt change in the  exchange rate, would threaten the signs of recovery now evident in the  developing countries of Asia and could risk another round of financial and  real macroeconomic turmoil in emerging markets Finally, there is now the  possibility of the events in Kosovo triggering some financial market  reaction or undermining consumer or business confidence sufficiently to     3/30/99 9   affect economic activity, particularly in Europe At the moment, any  economic consequences seem very limited, but further escalation of the  conflict could change that    The compromise forecast of a basically flat nominal dollar-­  or an upward tilt in the real dollar, which is what matters in the forecast--comes about   primarily because US inflation is projected to be slightly higher than the very, very low   inflation we expect to see in most other industrial countries So in some sense, we are   forecasting a generally flat nominal dollar as the offset of forces whose size we can’t   really project Therefore, the notion that the dollar will likely be flat is somewhat of an   agnostic forecast rather than one in which we have great confidence   On the one hand, we see the European and Japanese economies as still quite   weak We expect monetary conditions in Europe to be eased at some point and we   expect Japanese monetary conditions to remain very, very aggressively easy The sense   that the US economy has experienced positive surprises that are not going to end   abruptly vis-à-vis the monetary easing that we expect abroad might actually have led us   to forecast an appreciation in the dollar What stopped us from moving that far is our   concern about the ongoing widening of the external balances So we have put together   those factors--one likely having positive effects and one likely having negative effects-­  and have tried to come up with a neutral compromise by positing a flat nominal dollar   and a rising real dollar In fact, we even have the euro coming back up some on the   grounds that weakness in Europe is not so pronounced and that our external deficits will   become a more important factor     3/30/99 10    I have posed the essence of your question to a lot of people   The question I have pondered is If technology, productivity, computers, internets, or   whatever are the fundamental explanation for why the US performance has been better-­  not just for 1998 but for about the past three years--why is it that we don’t see it   elsewhere? One might expect to see it especially, say, in Canada, where we see it a little   but not a lot We actually are looking into how much of it is apparent in Canada When I   ask this question of Europeans, I get answers that have a lot to do with the well-known   structural problems that beset the European economy, but I also sometimes hear   surprisingly optimistic accounts that at the micro level people are beginning to see a   change I have even had similar accounts about Japan from people who have been to that   country recently and to whom I have posed this question   My contacts say they have heard stories from people they talked to last week   or last month that suggest that at individual firms and in selected industries this   phenomenon is beginning to make its way into the economies of Europe and Japan That     3/30/99 12   makes some sense in that we know from studies of past major innovations--the   introduction of electricity to replace steam, for example--that the actual economic impact   came long after the invention It took a very long time for people to figure out how to do   things differently and how to exploit the particular advantages of the new technology as   opposed to just mimicking the old technology Given the structural problems in Europe   and the degree to which risk-taking and mobility are limited there, it is not implausible   that it would take longer in Europe than it might take in the United States I honestly   don’t know how much credence to put in the stories that, in fact, there is something   bubbling under the surface and that a global technology event really will become visible   But it is at least a little reassuring that, in some micro-type anecdotes, there is an echo of   what we see in the United States that suggests there is hope for Europe  "
6193,1999-06-29," I think that “zero” is the magic word Whatever intervention   the Bank of Japan chooses to do, whether it is in domestic assets or in foreign exchange-­  and the latter is what they have been doing--they no longer have room on the downside at   the very short-term end of the money market to lower interest rates any further So in   that sense there is no such thing as unsterilized intervention because there is no place to   go There are lots of people out there arguing about whether or not allowing the   monetary base to continue to expand under those circumstances has expansionary   influences, and through what channels We are obviously looking for the latter in Japan   But in the most ordinary sense of sterilized and unsterilized intervention, both in terms of   what happened on the balance sheet and whether it did or did not affect short-term money   market interest rates, the answer would be that they have sterilized    At this point, the change in the Japanese monetary base doesn’t   seem to be having any particular implications At least changes of this order of   magnitude can’t be perceived as being followed by changes, for example, in better   lending conditions and increased bank credit creation    I will defer my comments on that until after the Chart Show,   since we are going to go into some of those issues as we return to honest-to-goodness real   economics! [Laughter]    The general tone of developments abroad since the  February chart show has been favorable On balance, the repercussions of  the spread of the global financial crisis to Latin America have not been as  dire as we feared in February; signs of recovery in Asia have added to the  sense that the crisis, as such, is at or near its end Nevertheless, there is no  lack of risks embedded in the current foreign outlook   A major element of the more sanguine outlook for the rest of the  world is the perception that various financial market indicators are  signaling progress in the real economy Chart 7 shows selected real  exchange rates and stock market indexes   The top pair refer to the major industrial countries The black line on  the left panel shows that on balance during 1999 the dollar has risen in real  terms relative to an average of the major foreign currencies In large part,  that rise reflects the strengthening of the dollar relative to the euro (the  blue line) The dollar has also risen on balance in real terms against the  Japanese yen during 1999, but it remains far below the value it had  reached in the middle of last year In the forecast, we expect a gradual  depreciation of the dollar in real terms against these currencies, as relative  macroeconomic conditions become less supportive of the dollar and as  market participants become more aware of the growing US external  imbalance--a topic to which I shall return at the end of my remarks   Stock prices for these countries, on the right, are among the financial  indicators signaling optimism during the past several months Although  they declined sharply last August and September during the turmoil  following the Russian debt moratorium, they have increased on balance so  far in 1999, including the Japanese index     6/29-30/99 19   The middle panels show the same variables for selected Asian  countries In real terms, the dollar has reversed much of its appreciation  against the Thai baht and Korean won that occurred as the crisis spread in  1997 Most recently, those currencies have been fairly stable in nominal  terms and inflation has been quite contained, developments that we expect  will continue We have incorporated into the forecast a stable Hong Kong  dollar peg to the US dollar, but some nominal appreciation of the dollar  against the Chinese renminbi in 2000   With US inflation generally above that in Hong Kong, the result is  slight real dollar appreciation in both cases in our outlook Asian stock  market indexes are among the most euphoric and may be overstating how  much progress has been made in addressing the structural problems laid  bare by the crisis In recent months, the foreign sector of the Chinese  stock market (the black line) has risen particularly sharply   The three major Latin American countries are shown at the bottom  We are projecting that the Brazilian real will remain near current levels in  nominal terms With Brazilian inflation contained but above US rates,  the real should appreciate some in real terms, ie dollar depreciation  Controversy over the Argentine peso convertibility regime abounds  Proposals for dollarization are still actively discussed, yet there have been  market rumors of ending the peg With little firm basis to judge how this  issue will be resolved, at least until the election in October, we continue to  expect the peg to hold In that event, with Argentine inflation expected to  remain below US rates, the dollar should rise slightly in real terms  against the Argentine peso The stock markets in Brazil and Mexico have  shared in the optimism being expressed elsewhere In Argentina, ongoing  market concerns have restrained increases   Your next chart presents our outlook for foreign growth, with some  details on the industrial countries As is evident in the top left, we  anticipate a convergence of US real GDP growth with the average of that  abroad in 2000 Our view that real output growth abroad should pick up  this year is bolstered by the surprisingly robust first-quarter results that  have been reported for some countries, including Japan We see some of  that strength as transitory, however, and so look for some offset in the  current quarter and, in general, have not extrapolated even stronger growth  performance into next year As can be seen at the right, the lion’s share of  the improvement is expected to occur in developing Asia, with somewhat  less acceleration in Latin America Industrial country growth is projected  to firm   In the middle left panel, the latest data on industrial production reflect  the somewhat lackluster performance in Europe in recent quarters in     6/29-30/99 20   contrast to the vigor in Canada The latest data for Japan show some  improvement, but not enough to explain the 79 percent annual GDP  growth in the first quarter that was recently announced Our projection for  sustained expansion in these countries rests in part on the accommodative  monetary conditions that are visible in the middle right panel Some  improvement in business confidence, seen in the lower left panel, is  another factor leading us in that direction The Japanese Tankan report for  the second quarter is due to be released shortly A significant move in the  positive direction is widely expected, especially in light of the fact the  survey was taken shortly after the strong Q1 real GDP data were released   The top panels on Chart 9 document the recovery that is unfolding in  the Asian crisis countries Industrial production has been rebounding  since the middle of last year, with production in Korea moving above its  pre-crisis peak Dollar interest rate spreads have moved back down,  though not to the levels of early 1997 This narrowing reflects improved  market confidence in these economies, but also the recognition that  spreads before the crisis were too low   The recovery in the developing Asian countries remains vulnerable,  and a major disruption elsewhere could renew pressures on them  Although we are expecting that China will experience sustained moderate  growth and financial stability, developments in that country are one  possible source of renewed volatility in Asia The middle left panel  highlights some external issues The Chinese trade surplus (in black) has  been shrinking since mid-1998 At first, a sharp drop-off in exports  narrowed the trade balance; in recent months, exports have recovered  somewhat but imports have surged The higher rate of recorded imports  may reflect anti-smuggling initiatives taken recently by the Chinese The  red line shows foreign direct investment in China While there seem to be  seasonally low inflows in the first quarter, the data for this year are below  those for the first quarter in both 1997 and 1998 Foreign direct investment  has tended to go into the export sector and to support investment in the  non-state sector The real depreciation of other Asian currencies has put  pressure on the Chinese export sector and may weaken inward direct  investment The right panel illustrates the deflation that China has been  experiencing, another symptom of the depressed demand within China  Industrial production bounced back in the second half of last year from  some slowing earlier The most recent months’ data suggest that  production continues to expand moderately; as a consequence, our forecast  is for somewhat slower growth in China than has been the case in the past,  but we are not looking for a deflationary spiral to become established   The lower left panel suggests some risks for the developing Asian  economies The emergence of recovery and the return of financial market  confidence could undermine the momentum behind the reform process In     6/29-30/99 21   Korea and other countries, where difficult issues of industrial relations and  corporate governance need to be addressed, moderate growth may lessen  the sense of urgency and the political will for reform In many of these  countries, banking sector problems continue and non-performing loans are  still a large share of total bank loans Moreover, the corporate sector  needs resolution of these debts so that private investment can resume  efficiently In addition, weakness in the Chinese economy might spark  political turmoil there and could derail recovery in Asia in general   The Latin American countries are featured on Chart 10 As you can  see in the upper left, production in Mexico has largely withstood the  spread of financial volatility to Latin America In Brazil and especially  Argentina that is not the case; production has been significantly reduced  For all three countries, the stripped spreads on dollar-denominated Brady  bonds have moved back down following the previous spikes The most  recent segment of all three of those lines shows the backup in spreads that  has occurred in response to uncertainties in Argentina about the  government’s fiscal program and the commitment to the peg of the  currency to the US dollar Market nervousness was heightened by the  announcement in May of your move to a tightening bias and the possible  implications of a slower US economy and higher dollar interest rates for  Latin America   The middle left panel illustrates that improvement in the external  balances of these countries has been limited despite currency adjustment  in Brazil and Mexico and slower domestic demand Continued  dependence on capital inflows implies that these countries remain  vulnerable to events that might disrupt global financial markets Still, on  balance, events in these countries have been more favorable than we were  expecting in February One bit of evidence is that Brazilian domestic  interest rates have come down, without negative repercussions, as shown  in the middle right panel Lower domestic rates are critical in keeping the  domestic debt in Brazil from swelling at an alarming rate The  surprisingly moderate response of inflation to the currency decline, shown  by the red line, has been an important factor behind the decline in  domestic interest rates   The immediacy with which market spreads reacted to disappointing  news in Argentina suggests that the situation in Latin America remains  fragile If key financial variables shift abruptly, the forecast of moderate  growth on average in the region could be derailed The major risks appear  to be those listed in the lower left panel Some of the fiscal steps taken to  date by Brazil were one-time measures Evidence of significant forward  progress on a permanent basis is lacking If markets sense continued  fiscal problems in Brazil, they will be quick to move rates, which in turn  will exacerbate the fiscal problems In Argentina, both domestic and     6/29-30/99 22   foreign investors are essential to the maintenance of the currency peg and  to the financing of Argentina’s external deficit Despite some insurance  that the government has taken out against financial contingencies,  Argentina remains vulnerable to a loss of confidence Elections this year  in Argentina and next year in Mexico add to the markets’ sensitivity to  any indications of policy missteps by those governments   My final two charts focus on US trade The top panels of Chart 11  show exports and imports for selected trading partner regions Exports to  developing Asia stalled in 1997 and then declined; exports to Latin  America followed suit a bit later Exports to Europe and Canada have, on  balance, grown in nominal terms, but not by much In contrast, US  imports from these regions have been a source of expanding demand that  has helped them to sustain expansions or mitigate declines of production   In the oil market, an agreement in March among producers to restrict  supply and some evidence to date of compliance with that agreement have  been successful in raising spot oil prices We expect that US oil import  prices will follow this path, but that both those prices will move back  slightly as some producers succumb to the temptation to increase output at  the higher prices Non-oil commodity prices fell sharply in 1998, in part  in response to weaker global demand As Mike noted, we do not expect  that disinflationary element to be present going forward   The bottom two panels explain the elements of our forecast for core  import prices--that is the prices of goods other than oil, semiconductors,  and computers We look for those prices, the red line, to move from  showing small declines to showing small increases by the end of the year  Next year, core import prices should rise, but less than 2 percent for the  year as a whole This acceleration in import prices owes to the  disappearance of the downward effect of global commodity prices, shown  as the bars in the left panel, and to a shift from downward to upward  pressure imparted by the combined effect of foreign prices and the  exchange rate, the bars in the right panel   The top panels of Chart 12 decompose the elements of our forecast  for the quantities of core exports (goods excluding agricultural products,  semiconductors, and computers) and core imports (goods excluding oil,  semiconductors, and computers) For exports, we look for foreign GDP  growth to return to being a strong positive factor while the negative impact  of past dollar appreciation wanes and ceases to be important For imports,  stimulus both from US GDP growth and from relative prices (largely the  exchange rate) lessens over the forecast period; accordingly, we see core  import growth slowing to about 6 percent     6/29-30/99 23   If all those pieces do fall into place, real net exports, the middle left  panel, will continue to exert a negative influence on US real GDP growth  but to a diminishing extent The nominal trade deficit will continue to  widen, however And despite a boost from some revisions to data for our  investment position, and therefore some adjustments to estimates of flow  income, the current account deficit will continue to expand, reaching some  very large numbers Relative to GDP, the current account balance is less  startling, but we anticipate that during the current year it will breach the  low reached in the late 1980s   If global recovery proceeds more or less along the lines we have  suggested in the Greenbook, so that no new crisis elements command the  attention of markets, then the rapid pace at which the US external deficit  is widening and the magnitudes that it is reaching may receive more  attention We revisited our slightly more aggregated model that simulates  longer-term relationships The continued strength of the dollar and the  relative cyclical strength of the US economy over the past two years have  made the starting point of our analysis relatively unfavorable Evidence  that the potential rate of growth of the United States has increased  recently, while that abroad has not, imparts an even greater sustained  tendency for the US external deficit to widen over time than  conventionally accepted   The panels at the bottom of the chart show the current account  relative to GDP, on the left, and the net international investment position  relative to GDP, on the right The baseline assumes that both in the  United States and abroad, output returns in the near term to equal potential  and then grows at potential rates thereafter We have also incorporated  some sustained real dollar depreciation into the baseline, 1½ percent at an  annual rate Nevertheless, the baseline shows chronic widening of the  current account and deterioration of the net investment position   Such an outcome implies the underlying variables are not mutually  consistent and some adjustment in one or more of them would be needed  The parameters of this model, based on historical experience of the past  two decades, suggest that, were the adjustment to come solely through the  price competitiveness of US goods, the real depreciation of the dollar  would have to average 4¼ percent per year in order for these ratios to  stabilize as shown by the red line Alternatively, adjustment could come  from income channels rather than price channels If foreign industrial  output were to move to a higher rate of potential growth, perhaps as a  consequence of some of the factors that have increased productivity in the  United States, and if US imports were to shift over time to being less  responsive to US income growth, then the adjustment path shown by the  blue line would result Clearly, actual adjustment will likely entail both  channels These results suggest to us that greater market attention to the     6/29-30/99 24   path for US external balances is likely although the timing of that  attention is still uncertain   Mike will now complete our presentation    The baseline starts with the Greenbook forecast and the initial   extension that is sort of implicit in the Bluebook    The baseline brings growth in activity abroad and in the United   States back to potential and then holds it at potential That is of critical importance to this   particular model because the minute we decide what that growth rate is going to be and   multiply it times elasticities, we’ve answered a lot of the questions about what is going to   happen to trade The elasticities are given so that there is no scope within this model for   any type of feedback between the factors that might be driving demographics or driving   savings and investments to change the propensities to import and to export But we did   in the blue line sort of exogenously adjust those to see what would happen if we thought   there were reasons to believe that they might move back in a favorable direction We   were addressing the questions of “how much would that have to be?” and “what would it     6/29-30/99 29   look like if it happened?” But otherwise it’s our best guess of what potential is in the   different countries that we modeled, plus the Bluebook assumptions with respect to the   United States and a 1½ percent real appreciation of the dollar Embedded in that also are   some assumptions about interest rates and the like that have to be there to flesh out the   current account    For the United States it is approximately 2    Well, the model that is embedded in these two charts was put   together by the International Finance Division two years ago And it came to somewhat   less fearsome conclusions because the dollar is two years’ worth of appreciation lower   now and we have not had two years of full-blown US deficits piling up and so forth   We said the same thing then, and in fact the world went completely the opposite way   Even though we said then that the current account would begin to get alarming and the   projections were inevitable, the numbers have gone in the other direction for two years   So there is no sense in which I mean this chart to be telling you what is going to happen   starting tomorrow    I’m only flagging the problem that is out there, which is that to   the extent Japan’s economy turns down, there is some possibility that markets may react   negatively once the dust is all settled and what is really going on is clear And if Japan   continues to drag its feet about some of the more important policy adjustments, we could   indeed see yet more years in which the problem in fact gets worse before it gets better  "
6216,1999-08-24," Yes Dave Howard has been a member of the Board’s Division of   International Finance for almost 25 years and has worked in several of the areas of the   division Recently, owing to the passage of time and the departure of some people, he was   promoted to Deputy Director of the division He has a PhD from the University of   Virginia, is very well rounded in open economy international macro issues, and is a very   thoughtful economist I think he would be an asset to the Committee and I recommend him   to you    There are two elements of the external picture that I  believe need to be highlighted this morning One is the shift in our  thinking toward the view that recovery among many of the crisis  countries has taken hold; our outlook for output growth abroad for the  rest of this year and next year is now stronger than we previously  thought This more optimistic tone is present in the Greenbook, but I  think it merits some comment, including some cautions Second, since  the Greenbook forecast was finalized, we have received the trade data for  June Those data showed more imports than we were expecting, and we  would shade our forecast of the external sector just a bit from that in the  Greenbook as a consequence   Additional data showing very strong real output growth in several  developing countries have convinced us that activity in some of these  countries is rebounding sharply from the depressed levels reached last  year For several important Asian economies, including Korea and  Malaysia, we have raised our estimates of the level of output reached in  the second quarter and have extrapolated firmer growth over the forecast  period There have been positive surprises with respect to some Latin  American countries as well, in particular Mexico and Brazil, and we have  revised upward the average growth we expect for that region but less  markedly than we did for Asia Taken together, these upward  adjustments imply output growth for developing countries that is 3/4  percentage point stronger at an annual rate during the second half of this  year and a percentage point stronger next year than we had in June   Although we now read the signs of recovery in many emerging  economies as more persuasive, downside risks remain that should not be     8/24/99 37   underestimated In Asia, the economic and political situation in China is  clouded With output growth slowing and deflation continuing, market  talk of an imminent devaluation of the currency has resumed We are  anticipating a gradual decline in the nominal value of the renminbi during  next year If, instead, there is an abrupt adjustment, financial stresses for  other economies in the region could result Given China’s substantial  holdings of international reserves and capital controls, we believe that  officials are in a position to manage this decision, but we cannot rule out  that circumstances could force their hand   Downward pressure on the Brazilian real over the past four weeks  appears to be a sign of heightened market concern Despite very strong  real GDP performance in the first half of the year, progress on permanent  fiscal reform is questionable, with both court challenges and political  commitment continuing to pose problems The government of Brazil has  struggled to normalize access to global financial markets The agreement  of Brazil with its major bank creditors to maintain their lending positions  is about to expire, and Brazilian authorities have announced that they  have no plans to draw on the third tranche of their IMF or bilateral  support funds However, with the external accounts still in deficit, Brazil  is dependent on attracting foreign capital; a further loss of market  confidence could trigger a swift resumption of contractionary forces  Financial markets in Latin America are generally somewhat skittish The  recent announcement by Ecuador that it may miss a payment due shortly  on its outstanding Brady bonds had a moderate effect on spreads  elsewhere in Latin America and could lead to further volatility if talks  with the IMF make no progress   Although we see the situation in some parts of the global economy as  still fragile, the overall picture is nonetheless considerably brighter than  in June With the significant positive revision to the forecast for output in  the developing countries and a small upward adjustment to that in the  foreign industrial countries, we have output abroad growing at 3 percent  over the forecast period, about the same as forecast for the United States  Stronger growth abroad should boost exports some, and we have raised  their projected growth accordingly   The nominal trade deficit in June, which was released after the  Greenbook forecast was final, revealed slightly more exports and  significantly more imports than we had incorporated into the second- quarter estimate All categories of imports were buoyant, and no special  factors or statistical anomalies seem present We are inclined to adjust  the level of imports--and exports--in the second quarter, but to retain our  path for quarterly growth rates over the forecast period The higher level  of imports in June implies that the negative contribution of net exports  remained substantial in the second quarter Going forward, with foreign     8/24/99 38   output growth solid, and the path for the real exchange value of the dollar  trending down slightly, as we have in our forecast, the negative  contribution of real net exports should diminish   The positive surprise to imports of capital goods in June suggests that  the level of PDE in the advance second-quarter release should be revised  up somewhat Taken together, these data revisions imply an annual  growth rate of 15 percent for second-quarter GDP, compared with 19  percent in the advance release  "
6239,1999-10-05," The basic message from the external sector this round is  that economic activity in the rest of the world seems to be strengthening even more  than we--and most other forecasters--had expected There were several positive  surprises concerning activity in the second quarter, such as small, positive real GDP  growth in Japan and double-digit growth in some emerging market economies in  Asia Some signs to the contrary--for example in Brazil the recent weakening of  production and court decisions just announced on Monday that appear to be at least  a partial set-back in the fiscal reform process--have tempered our optimism  Nonetheless, on balance we have raised our projection for foreign output growth  through next year and we expect additional firming in 2001   As described by Peter Fisher earlier, the yen/dollar rate fluctuated quite  widely during the intermeeting period In part, these fluctuations reflect swings in  views on the current cyclical position of the Japanese economy and its outlook for  growth over the rest of this year and next The positive change in second-quarter  real GDP reinforced the impact of the very large first-quarter number and  contributed to a general reassessment in asset markets and among forecasters,  including the staff Moreover, some indicators that have been released since the  Greenbook was completed suggest that we may still have been overly cautious in     10/5/99 11   our thinking about the very near term for the Japanese economy During August,  industrial production surged and housing starts posted an unexpectedly strong  rebound from July’s steep decline Unemployment edged down in August   However, the Tankan survey of business confidence, just released yesterday,  seems to have partly disappointed the markets Whereas there was a sizable,  positive swing in sentiment for large manufacturing firms, outside this sector and for  the total index the shift was much less Importantly, firms in the survey continue to  plan large cuts in fixed investment expenditures, consistent with their outlook for  negligible sales growth   On balance, we judge our upward revision to the forecast for real output  growth in Japan to be appropriate and we might even shade up the numbers for the  rest of this year and both 2000 and 2001 in response to the additional data  Nevertheless, we retain the view that expansion will slow from its rapid first-half  pace to around 1 to 1½ percent over the forecast period That assessment reflects  our continued serious concerns about the underlying strength of Japanese domestic  demand, particularly private investment, given headwinds from corporate  restructuring, persistent difficulties in the financial sector, and possible loss of  confidence as a result of yen appreciation over the past year   There have also been some additional positive indicators for near-term  activity in Europe and Canada in the past few days Canadian production in the  third quarter appears to be above expectations The latest survey data for the United  Kingdom and the euro area reinforce the upward revisions that we made to their  forecasts and suggest possible upside risk for real output growth in Europe   This recent evidence confirms a stronger picture for prospects in the industrial  countries and complements the substantial upward revision we made to the  Greenbook forecast for the Asian developing economies With foreign output-­ aside from small fluctuations owing to Y2K--set to grow somewhat below the  extremely rapid rate of the first half of this year but at a robust pace over the forecast  period, we see US export volumes expanding at rates much above the pace of last  year and the first half of this year   The change in the relative cyclical positions of the United States and our  trading partners is one of the factors behind our thinking in incorporating a  depreciation of the dollar into the forecast With other global problems attracting  reduced attention, we expect that the large and expanding US external deficits will  contribute to market sentiment for declines in the dollar as well With no basis on  which to predict the timing of an abrupt dollar change, we have projected a  moderate move down in real terms of the exchange value of the dollar spread over  the forecast period This dollar depreciation should add to the projected  improvement in our export performance As a consequence, we see the external  sector as continuing to subtract from GDP growth, but at a much reduced pace, over  the forecast period     10/5/99 12   We’d be happy to answer any questions    Well, I think the directions are consistent Generally speaking I would   attribute it to expectations about the interest rate consequences of stronger activity in the one   economy, not necessarily weaker activity in the United States The relative change is all that is   needed If the rest of the world begins to operate closer to capacity, those countries will experience   a rise in interest rates owing to demand effects and to possible monetary policy responses that will   come We’ve already seen rumors in the markets about action by the European Central Bank, with   some people even speculating that it will come as early as Thursday That seems to be very early   in the process of some strengthening in Europe But it’s that expectation of relative monetary   policy moves and relative interest rate changes that would feed through into the exchange rates    Well, more important, less important The current account goes the same   way in that such a move in exchange rates would tend to lessen surpluses that are apparent in   Europe and Japan and remedy to some extent deficits in the United States So in that sense these   factors are not in conflict but are just reinforcing one another    In our view, the Chinese authorities will make a discretionary decision   about the renminbi Because of their very strong reserve position and the fact that they are still   running surpluses, we don’t see market forces triggering an event there So the decision that they   will make at some point in time to introduce some flexibility in their exchange rate is something     10/5/99 13   over which they have more control than some other monetary authorities might have Even so,   they may decide to make a one-step adjustment We are not presuming to rule that out It is just   impossible for us to know whether that could be their choice and when they might actually act So,   for forecast purposes we tend to put in a smooth adjustment, but in no sense does that mean that we   are betting that that is the way it will necessarily happen and that it will not happen in one or two   steps It is the political process within China that might lead to a quicker reaction, as slower   growth creates pressures on employment and standards of living and political support for different   factions in China As the effort to continue reforms for the state-owned enterprises is in conflict   with that--and to create a source of demand to offset perhaps the spillovers from the dilemmas with   the state-owned enterprises--I think they would choose at some point to introduce some exchange   rate flexibility But exactly when and how is more than we are prepared to take a position on    I hesitate to attempt to do the arithmetic on the spot My guess is that we   would probably say that 10 percent is too large an estimate of the output gap in Japan, in part   because a whole decade of largely reduced capital accumulation has had a bearing on the size of   that gap And with labor force growth essentially zero at this point, we see Japanese potential as   radically different from what it had been in previous decades-- perhaps as low as 1½ to 2 percent or   something like that But let’s say for the sake of argument that Japan could grow at 5 percent, the   gap is 5 to 6 percent, and its rate of growth could rise steeply It could be 2 or 3 years before they   close the gap Japan’s propensity to import is not as strong as that of some other countries, and I   think it is probably unit elastic on income That would be my guess, so an increase in imports   could well occur The dilemma is that to the extent Japan can close the output gap, that feeds   through and no doubt has a positive effect on the US economy Indeed, our stronger export   picture in this Greenbook does lead to our net export contribution becoming almost zero by the end   of the forecast horizon But for Japan, the greater vigor that such a scenario--growing at 2 to 3   percent for three years, closing the gap, and then growing at potential--would impart to the   domestic economy, would make Japan a much more attractive place for Japanese investors to   invest than the United States Thus, their investment in the United States would slow So even   though there is a reduced current account surplus, each and every month Japan will have to make   net investments in the rest of the world And that will fight the tide, as it were, of a Japan that   seems to be the place that is gaining cyclical vigor but where interest rate and exchange rate   adjustments nonetheless make it look like a good idea for them to invest abroad So while it is true   that these adjustments through the income channel in some sense add to the capital account   problem, there is a need for interest rate and exchange rate adjustments that attract money out of   Japan despite its cyclical strengthening How all that balances out will depend a great deal on risk   premiums, expectations, and investor preferences And we do not claim that the number we’ve   written down is in any sense the result of a truly analytical calculation We have tried to indicate   what we think is the general direction and we put a magnitude in there that will show through But   the econometric art of balancing these things and their effect on the exchange rate is in the Dark   Ages somewhere    Right     10/5/99 15    Of course, that attracted much attention over the weekend of the G-7   meeting and the preceding week and was a factor in some of the buffeting of the yen/dollar rate that   occurred At the moment they apparently have no plans for intervention Just today, for example,   a Japanese official--I’ve forgotten exactly which one--was quoted as saying that if the yen were to   stabilize in the 105 to 106 yen/dollar range, intervention would not be necessary So that was the   latest statement from them And that’s perhaps indicative of the fact that their propensity to talk is   higher than might seem constructive   We see fiscal policy coming through with a supplemental budget large enough to yield the   forecast that we have put in the Greenbook We have a view of when it will happen and how much   it will be, but that is designed to give us the forecast that we have here We believe Japanese   authorities have committed certainly to an additional supplement this fall And we believe that   they will have another next year, given the huge negative shock that would occur were that not to   happen We think that such a policy will have smooth sailing   The Bank of Japan seems to be considering some alternative monetary policy measures in   order to get reserves out into the economy more effectively than with their present procedures; the   latter leave a lot of excess reserves in the banks and in these broker firms called Danchi who just   tend to sit on them In their mind that practice is futile There is no point in adding to those   reserves; they are not doing anything And the Bank of Japan has stated on several recent   occasions that it does not want to do that So they have suggested that they are considering some   alternatives that might be available to them should they decide they need to find a way to ease even   further They have discussed perhaps doing foreign exchange swaps, which would be to some   degree focused on the yen/dollar exchange rate But those actions would be at the discretion of the   Bank of Japan and its policy board as opposed to a decision of the Ministry of Finance   In the last couple of days, they have been leaving 1½ trillion yen in excess reserves in the   system instead of 1 trillion yen, which is something they said they would not do or did not see the     10/5/99 16   point of doing And they have been explaining those on the grounds of seasonal factors relating to   the end of the half fiscal year So in principle they could leave in 1½ trillion instead of 1 trillion   yen or maybe decide to implement some of these additional tools I think they are at least trying to   give the market the impression that there are other possibilities They are stepping back a bit from   the statement they made on September 21st that suggested there were no options and they were not   thinking about any options There will be another meeting of the policy board on October 13th I   don’t know that we will get a statement from them that soon, but we might get one indicating that   they are prepared to take certain actions if needed That’s what I would look for At the moment   the market seems to think that such a statement or such a modification in their policy course is a   possibility  "
6261,1999-11-16," The news about the global economy that we have received  over the intermeeting period has generally been quite favorable The signs of  strengthening activity, particularly in Asia, that we saw earlier in the year  continue to be confirmed, and positive developments in real output growth now  appear to be widespread across other regions of the globe as well, including  importantly the other industrial countries  Taking into account what production  data we have so far for the third quarter, along with indicators for the remainder  of the year such as orders figures and confidence measures, we have revised up  our estimate for total output growth in the rest of the world during the second half  of this year from about 3¼ percent in September to 4 percent in the current  Greenbook     11/16/99 9   In updating our forecast, we had to wrestle with the implications for 2000  and 2001 of these signs of more robust activity abroad Embedded in them likely  is some boost from transitory precautionary demands reflecting Y2K concerns on  the part of households and firms abroad Present also, at least for some countries,  is the spurt of activity that can come in the initial phase of a cyclical rebound as a  result of swings in inventories, the release of pent-up demand, and the stimulus of  favorable financial conditions Some moderation from the initially very high  growth rates is normal under these circumstances More fundamentally, some of  the robust indicators we are now seeing no doubt signal strength in underlying  demand Moreover, to the extent that confidence is bolstered by the current  strong growth, demand may expand further in the future   We have balanced these factors by revising up the near-term level of foreign  output to reflect the positive indicators of the past several weeks, but we are  projecting only very slightly higher growth than in the previous Greenbook on  average over the remainder of the forecast period As a consequence, the level of  foreign activity is higher throughout this forecast than in September The near- term upward adjustments are spread throughout the industrial and developing  countries in the forecast  The small upward changes we have made to growth in  2000 and 2001 are notably in China and Mexico among the developing countries  and in Japan and Canada among the industrial countries   With the dollar still projected to depreciate somewhat in real terms over the  forecast period, we are looking for a rebound in the growth of real exports of  goods and services from the low rates experienced in 1998 and the first half of  this year The upward revision we have made to projected foreign activity implies  a rebound in exports that is just a touch stronger than what we expected in  September   There is clearly a risk that these recent indicators of strength are not the result  of transitory or cyclical factors In that case, we are probably being too cautious  in not extrapolating more of the recent good news from abroad into our forecast  for foreign activity and for US export growth over the next two years To get a  handle on the magnitude of the effect of a possible miss on our part, we included  in the Greenbook a simulation of the implication for US real GDP growth of  expansion abroad that is 1 percentage point stronger at an annual rate, sustained  over the coming eight quarters, than what we have in the baseline Such an  extremely buoyant outlook for foreign activity would raise projected US real  GDP growth by about ¼ percentage point in 2000 and ¾ percentage point in  2001 At the same time, it would raise the rate of US core inflation by nearly ½  percentage point in 2001   Of course, even the cautiously optimistic outcome in the Greenbook baseline  forecast is not assured Considerable uncertainty remains in the foreign outlook  Among the most important unfavorable risk elements are renewed weakness in  Japan, perhaps as a consequence of withdrawal of fiscal stimulus; a premature end     11/16/99 10   to the expansion in the euro area should tightening by the ECB prove excessive  and/or confidence falter; and additional upward pressure on world oil prices from  further OPEC production restraint or severe winter weather   Alternatively, the risk of a greater downward move in the value of the dollar  than we are projecting, either by itself or in conjunction with pressures on other  US asset prices, cannot be ruled out Such an exchange rate change would  stimulate export demand more and result in additional upward pressure on import  prices    I think we have done two things We have recognized the fact that   we were wrong about the second half of this year In fact, everybody was wrong; even the   Japanese are continuously surprised by the strength in the numbers they are producing   Secondly, we have widened enormously--although it is obviously not written down anywhere in   the Greenbook--the confidence intervals that we are putting around our forecast for 2000 and   2001   If there is a locus of uncertainty anywhere, it is centered on Japan, at least in my mind   On the one hand, we are getting stronger indicators, at least to some degree, regarding what is   happening now Although we have not seen a private investment response, we were certainly   surprised by the private consumption numbers we saw Strength in the rest of Asia has helped   Japan as well, and the combination has produced GDP numbers that are much larger than we   were expecting Earlier this year we had expected a negative offset to the very strong first   quarter; we did not get that We now are expecting a fairly substantial positive number for the   third quarter Yet one does not get the sense that domestic demand has become self-sustaining in   Japan Officials from the Bank of Japan in the statements they have made recently talk about   having seen the trough and having seen a pickup Yet they talk about demand perhaps not yet   being sustained and say that for that reason they are prepared to keep the zero interest rate policy   in place   So, we are looking at their fiscal policy and at what is happening in the rest of the   world The announcement of the 18 trillion yen package probably had a smaller share of “real   water” spending than these packages have had in the past We often use a rule of thumb of one-  half as the estimate of real spending in the fiscal programs that are announced by Japanese     11/16/99 15   officials, and we think this one does not come up even to that Common assessments are more   like 6 or 7 trillion, which is a number on the order of one-third as opposed to one-half of “real   water” spending But even that amount would not produce the forecast that we have written   down So, embedded in our GDP forecast for calendar year 2000 is the assumption that when   they decide on the budget they will put in about another ¼ percentage point of stimulus through   the fiscal channel That is not a certainty No doubt the medium-term concerns about the size of   the outstanding debt and even short-term concerns about financing problems--as they have been   struggling with the issue of who is going to buy the Japanese government bonds and so forth-­  might lead them to take a less aggressive fiscal posture And that would reduce their growth to   less than we have forecast Even so, I think we have a very cautious forecast--one that suggests   still a lot of problems in the Japanese economy and growth that is going to remain very low   There are other forecasters around the world who see the acceleration of Japanese   activity proceeding, as opposed to falling back the way we do I think the basic answer is the   one I gave you There are upside risks and downside risks The confidence interval around any   forecast on Japan has to be far wider right now than would ordinarily be the case  "
6286,1999-12-21," In my remarks I will first say a few words about the  October trade data that were released after the Greenbook was completed  and then will review what we perceive to be some of the risks confronting  the global economy   In October, the US nominal trade deficit in goods and services  reached $259 billion, a new monthly record Exports were about  unchanged from their level in the previous two months, as increased  exports of industrial materials about offset decreased exports of  machinery, including computers The value of imports jumped in  October, with the largest increases registered in consumer goods and  machinery   The October number was very close to that embedded in the  Greenbook forecast By themselves, these data suggest a fourth-quarter  outcome of real net exports that is slightly weaker than in the Greenbook  However, in combination with small adjustments to some domestic  components of GDP in response to these data, they imply little net change  in our estimate of current-quarter GDP growth   Once again we have slightly revised upward our Greenbook  projection for real output growth abroad during 2000 and 2001 This  brings the total revision for 2000 to about plus ¾ percentage point since  June and plus 1¼ percentage points since last December Our stronger  outlook for the coming two years rests in part on the positive surprises in  recent months for economic activity during this year for most regions of  the world It rests also on the likelihood that fiscal policy will be less  contractionary in several regions while monetary policy remains generally  accommodative abroad The one major exception to the generally bright  picture I am painting has been Japan, where although we have revised  upward our forecast for next year, projected growth remains quite low,  and we are somewhat pessimistic   Together with the stronger view for the U S economy that Mike just  reviewed, the staff forecast now calls for a substantially more robust  global economy over the coming eight quarters than seemed probable a  year ago One risk to this upbeat picture is that we, and other forecasters,  are still not fully taking into account the mutually reinforcing positive  impulses that can be shared across countries during a simultaneous  expansion We may be underestimating the upward momentum in  individual countries that can come from the interaction of improved  confidence, higher capacity utilization, and wealth effects For the global  economy, we may be failing to allow for generally stronger export demand  everywhere as spare capacity is reduced in many economies at the same  time     12/21/99 12   One class of markets where early indications of such growing  momentum might become evident is global non-oil commodity markets  As yet, we do not see an indication that demand is putting severe pressure  on supply in those markets While prices have begun rising, it is from  previously very low levels Going forward, we will need to pay particular  attention to those markets for signs of incipient inflationary pressures   At the same time, we need to be open to the possibility that the  factors causing accelerating productivity in the US economy are  beginning to have similar effects in other economies, especially the other  industrial economies In that event, the global economy would be capable  of faster growth without inflation risk than was previously the case  Provided foreign officials do not unnecessarily limit output growth from  achieving its new potential, such a development could result in stronger  demand for US exports and more balanced growth in the global  economy Such a scenario is one version of a so-called soft landing   It now seems very likely that 2000 will see higher interest rates and  more profitable investment opportunities abroad that could decrease  demand for US assets and raise the risk of downward pressure on the  dollar Such developments could in turn cause disturbances in other  global financial markets as well However, for the first time since the  Asian crisis began in 1997, we need to be alert to the possibility of  generalized global upside economic pressures and the challenges for  policy that such a development would pose  "
6309,2000-02-01,"  Economic activity in the rest of the world continues  to expand, and prospects for this year and next are favorable for most  regions  Moderate to vigorous real output growth around the globe poses  risks that inflationary pressures could emerge in world commodity markets,  and eventually product markets more generally, and that we could be  underestimating the upward momentum generated by the interaction of  simultaneous expansion  A possible offset to these risks is the extent to  which other countries, particularly other industrial countries, may be  beginning to experience the kind of acceleration of productivity that we          20  have seen in the past few years in the United States  As yet, the data  provide no compelling evidence that this is happening     Your next chart presents developments in foreign exchange markets   and recent short-term interest rates for selected foreign countries  In the top  left panel, the decline in recent months in the value of the dollar relative to  the yen (the green line) is in sharp contrast to its rise relative to the euro (the  blue line)  The pound (in red) has changed little against the dollar over the  past year  The net effect of these divergent moves is that the index for the  dollar relative to our major industrial country trading partners (the black  line) has declined since your meeting last June but is up on balance from a  year ago     As can be seen in the panel on the right, three-month interest rates   have moved up for each of these regions with the exception of Japan  These  rate increases reflect a full retracing of the official rate reduction in 1999 by  the ECB and a partial retracing by the Bank of England of declines  implemented from late 1998 through mid-1999   In contrast, the Bank of  Japan has maintained its zero interest rate policy since March of last year   Despite the absence of recent or prospective tightening by the Bank of Japan  in the near future, the yen has appreciated strongly against the dollar and the  euro     The middle left panel shows that in terms of the dollar, the exchange   rates of Thailand and Korea have stabilized on balance since the end of  1998  The Hong Kong dollar and the Chinese renminbi have sustained their  rates at a constant value in terms of the dollar over the entire interval shown  In contrast to the experience of industrial countries, short-term market  interest rates, reported in the panel on the right, have generally not been  rising in emerging Asia over the past six months  The exception is Korea,  line 1, where economic recovery has been particularly strong  Moreover,  spreads of dollar rates paid by these countries over US Treasury rates have  been narrowing       In the bottom left panel, the continued stability of the Argentine peso   and the relative stability of the Mexican peso over the past several months  contrast somewhat with the fluctuations of the Brazilian real  On balance  over the past six months the real is little changed as it has regained since  October some of its loss against the dollar earlier in the year  Short-term  domestic interest rates have moved down in these countries, and Brady bond  spreads of dollar rates compared with US Treasury rates have narrowed  significantly       The next chart reports stock market developments in these countries    In most, stock market prices have risen recently, often to levels well above          21  those at the start of 1997, before the global financial crisis  In the industrial  countries, the upper left panel, European stock prices can be seen to have  risen as much or more than US prices  The exception is Japan, where  equity prices have risen sharply since late 1998 but are only now about back  to their early 1997 level  Stock prices in Mexico and Brazil, on the right,  are also up sharply, especially recently  In Argentina, where recession has  been deep and prolonged, equity values have only partially recovered from  their losses since their peak in mid-1997  Equity markets in Asia, bottom  left, have also rebounded sharply, putting indexes in Hong Kong and Korea  above pre-crisis levels  Chinese stock market prices have shot up recently   Those in Thailand are recovering, but remain below previous highs  When  expressed in dollars, the performance of stock prices in these developing  countries is not quite so impressive, but they are still up significantly     The lower right panels compare equity pricing in Germany with that in   the United States  The black lines are the respective real yields on 10-year  bonds in the two countries, using moving weighted averages of consumer  price changes to proxy for expected inflation  The red lines are measures of  the earnings yield, the inverse of the price/earnings ratio, constructed from  twelve-month ahead forecasts of earnings  In both countries, the real  interest rate has moved up over the past year  With unchanged projected  earnings and a constant equity premium, a higher real interest rate implies a  larger discount factor for the earnings stream, a lower stock price, and  therefore a higher earnings yield; the red and black lines would in this  circumstance move together  Instead the two lines tend to move in opposite  directions, with the most recent decline in the German earnings yield even  larger than that for the United States  Stock prices are rising relative to  near-term expected earnings despite the apparently higher discount factor    Such a development suggests that the equity risk premium that investors  require has narrowed and/or that expectations of longer-term earnings  growth have been revised upward       Taken together, the financial variables on these two charts suggest a   favorable climate for real economic activity around the globe  High and  rising stock prices suggest significant optimism toward earnings by firms as  well as a declining cost of capital for equity financing of new investment   Consumption is likely to be buoyed by the increased wealth implied by the  high stock valuations  Short-term interest rates and risk spreads are  generally falling in those regions most troubled during the crisis years of  1997 and 1998  Investors appear to have regained some confidence in  opportunities in those countries, and the price of risk has moderated  Of  course, investor optimism about earnings in one or more regions might  prove to be excessive, and equity risk could be underpriced  A market  correction in a major country would likely trigger similar moves elsewhere             22  Mindful that there are both upside and downside risks, the staff has  constructed in the Greenbook an outlook for growth abroad that is quite  positive and that reflects the generally supportive global financial conditions  just reviewed  The upper left panel of your next chart compares our outlook  for the United States with that of an average for our foreign trading partners   The rebound of activity in several regions from earlier depressed levels  resulted in average growth of more than 4 percent at an annual rate in the  first half of last year  We estimate that during the second half, foreign  growth moderated just a bit, and we look for it to be sustained at an average  annual rate of about 3-3/4 percent through the end of the forecast period--a  bit less than the Greenbook projection for US growth       By region, as you can see on the table at the right, we expect moderate   to strong growth in most areas, with the notable exception of Japan, line 1   We remain somewhat pessimistic about the Japanese outlook as fiscal  stimulus flags, exports are restrained by the strong yen, and domestic  demand grows only slowly     The middle panels show industrial production in industrial countries   on the left and in selected developing countries on the right  Of these  industrial countries, Canada has shown the greatest increase in production,  but there has been a clear acceleration in the index in the euro area and in  the United Kingdom in 1999  Japan has shown some signs of a recovery in  production, but output has been erratic and remains below its level in early  1998  The rebound in business confidence in the major foreign industrial  countries is evident in the lower left panel This change in attitude should  help to foster stronger growth in domestic demand in these countries       Among the developing countries, the recovery in Korea (the black line   in the middle right panel) has been so rapid that capturing it on the scale  would mask significant growth in Mexico and recovery in Brazil  Korean  industrial production has increased about 40 percent since January 1998   The need for external adjustment was a driving force in the macro policy  choices made in the emerging market countries during the crisis  As can be  seen in the lower right, the developing countries in Asia (line 1) were able to  achieve a substantial aggregate external surplus in 1998, which diminished  slightly in 1999 as growth resumed and imports recovered  We expect that  continued moderate growth should lead to some further erosion of their  aggregate surplus  For the Latin American countries (line 4), the pressures  of financing an external deficit remain acute, and macro policies will need to  take this into account  Some improvement did occur last year, and we  expect a bit more this year  Nevertheless, these Latin American countries  remain vulnerable, with their policy options more limited, as a result of their  external position             23  On balance our outlook is for buoyant activity in the rest of the world  on average over the next two years  We should continue to see a reduction  in economic slack in Asia, Europe, and Latin America  These  prospects  have implications for prices that are the subject of your next chart     One place to look for a signal of global price pressures is in the futures   markets for traded commodities, such as agricultural products and metals   The top left panel shows soybean prices and the futures quotes at the time of  your last chart show and last Friday  Although global demand has recovered  significantly since mid-1999, actual and futures prices for soybeans have  only partially recovered from recent declines  There is some variance in  how futures prices have moved for other grains, but for the most part supply  conditions have kept prices for these commodities from moving rapidly  In  contrast, copper prices, shown on the right, are now substantially higher  than six months or one year ago  Other metals and related commodities  show similar increases  Futures prices going forward continue to show a  much slower rate of increase, however, than that recorded last year     In light of these market developments, we are projecting that our index   of non-oil commodity prices, shown in the middle left, which rebounded  sharply at the end of 1999, will rise at about an annual rate of 4 percent this  year and a bit less next year  This contrasts with the commodity price  deflation that occurred from mid-1997 to mid-1999  Spot oil prices, shown  on the right, spiked up in 1999 as world demand recovered and as oil  producers were successful in restraining supply  As explained in the  Greenbook, we anticipate that some extension of the current agreement  among OPEC and other producers will be put in place at the end of March,  but that over time additional increases in supply will emerge, putting  downward pressure on prices  We project that the US oil import price will  move back down to about $17 per barrel by the end of next year     Some pickup in inflation abroad and the move from dollar appreciation   to a constant and then slightly depreciating dollar should impart some  additional upward pressure on US prices from imports  Foreign prices  expressed in dollars are shown in the lower left panel  The non-industrial  countries, in particular, had been a source of downward pressure in 1997  and 1998  That has now reversed, and both groups of countries have been  imparting upward pressure for the past year  As can be seen on the right, we  expect core import prices, the red line, to rise moderately throughout the  forecast period, largely as a result of the contribution of foreign prices  expressed in dollars     Your next chart summarizes the implications of the foreign outlook for   the US external sector  As can be seen in the top left panel, real imports,  when measured in chained 1996 dollars, substantially exceed real exports           24  The dots indicate the slight discrepancy between the fourth quarter numbers  released by the BEA on Friday and our Greenbook projection  Going  forward, we expect that annual real import growth over 2000 and 2001 will  exceed that of real exports by about 1-1/2 percentage points despite the  strong recovery of foreign growth and some help from the dollar     The key relationships between relative growth rates and prices and our   trade balance are centered on core exports and imports, shown on the right   Foreign GDP growth boosted core exports in 1999 (line 2) and should  continue to support moderate growth this year and next  Reflecting our  projected path for the dollar, relative prices (line 3) should switch from  retarding exports to stimulating them  However, US GDP growth is  projected to provide a significantly larger boost to core imports (line 5) than  the analogous line for exports, owing to the historical tendency for US  imports to be more sensitive to income growth than are exports  Even with  some slowing imparted by relative prices (line 6), core import growth  remains above that of core exports     The middle left panel translates this projection for exports and imports   into contributions to real GDP growth  The positive contribution from  exports should slowly rise, on balance, through the end of 2001 while the  negative contribution of imports diminishes       The panel on the right shows the implications of these trade   projections for the nominal current account balance (the black line) and its  ratio to GDP (the red line)  We expect that the balance will exceed $400  billion in the first quarter of this year and will reach nearly $500 billion by  the end of next year  At about 4-1/2 percent of GDP, the deficit will  significantly exceed the previous low point reached in 1987            In order to evaluate the longer-term implications of our current   estimates of the underlying trade relationships and the stronger outlook for  US trend growth, we used our somewhat more aggregated long-term model  for the US external sector to simulate the current account as a ratio of GDP  out to 2015  The results are shown in the bottom panels  The baseline path  (the black line) follows the Greenbook for this year and next and then  assumes that US and foreign real GDP return to potential levels in the  medium-term and then grow at potential rates over the remainder of the  simulation  To provide some scope for adjustment, we put into the baseline  an ongoing 1 percent rate of depreciation of the dollar in real terms, starting  in 2002     In the baseline, the ratio of the deficit to GDP stabilizes for a time as   US growth is assumed to slow below potential and foreign output  accelerates  Once that adjustment is complete and domestic and foreign          25  output grow at trend, the ratio again deteriorates, reaching 10 percent in  2011, and would continue to do so  In the left panel, we show the  simulation results of a one-time 25 percent drop in the value of the dollar  phased in over 2002 followed by a return to the baseline assumptions  Such  a sharp drop in the exchange rate has a pronounced effect initially, and the  current account deficit recovers to 3 percent of GDP  The benefit of that  depreciation subsequently erodes, however, and the rate of worsening in the  current account ratio returns toward the baseline outcome       The right hand panel gives the results for a simulation of a steady   depreciation of the dollar in real terms of 5 percent per year  Although such  a depreciation does not eliminate the continuous worsening of the external  balance, it slows it substantially  Under these assumptions, the current  account deficit reaches 5-1/2 percent of GDP by 2010  These simulations  suggest that quite sizable declines in the value of the dollar would be needed  for that channel alone to provide external adjustment such that the current  account stabilizes as a share of GDP     Dave Stockton will now continue our presentation         In the balance of payment statistics it is logged that way  It is not a   huge number but, yes, it is counted as debt     You are reading in here a step that is not truly on a piece of paper       That step is the notion that as this number gets very, very large it   would inevitably have some consequences on people’s willingness to hold dollars and would   produce a 25 percent devaluation or a 5 percent devaluation or whatever   The analysis that I   have here, the model that I am able to rely on, only works from one side of this process  And it   says  If the dollar does X, Y would be the implication for the current account balance  To   answer your question--not having any simulation to draw on but just reacting to where I think   you are going--I would say that it is true that the capital account is an important piece of the   story  The desire of foreigners to invest in the United States and to participate in the gains from   the productivity developments that have occurred in the United States does, I think, lie behind   some of the developments we are seeing here  That is most evident in the fact that through much   of the time the deficit has been widening--over the past three years, let’s say--the dollar has been   rising  That means the capital account is going in this direction at the same time that the current   account is going the other way  That might lead one to take comfort in the notion that people          35  find attractive the instruments they are buying in the United States  If we believe that the asset   valuations in US financial markets are sound, there is no reason to think that is going to change   in any hurry  It will over time, taken at face value, open up a gap between GDP and GNP  That   in and of itself is no big deal, although I can imagine some politicians will make a lot of noise   about it  But in principle there is nothing about the economics of having a gap between GDP and   GNP that would be troublesome  We could well imagine that the world is making a rational and   appropriate allocation of global savings into a major economy where productivity is higher than   it is elsewhere and where capital ought to be accumulating  Some of that capital is owned by   foreigners and some of it is owned by the residents of the United States, and there is no problem    And that could continue for some time  But I don’t think there is anything about the form that   foreign investment takes--whether it is in portfolios or in direct investments--that necessarily   assures that it will continue  That’s because if foreigners were for any reason--political,   economic, rational, or irrational--to decide that they were unhappy with their exposure to the   US economy, they would avail themselves of financial instruments either to decrease that   exposure or to hedge it  One can readily hedge foreign direct investment by selling financial   assets short and view that as having protected oneself against certain kinds of exchange rate   developments or certain kinds of economic developments  It is not the case that the form in   which the capital enters the United States necessarily implies anything about future behavior     So, while I put this forward as a warning flag--I don’t deny that--I do not think it   necessarily implies that the dollar will come under pressure tomorrow or the next day or next   year  But I would also say that there is nothing automatic about how the forms of capital inflows   will work out in the future should there be a change in investor sentiment toward holding claims   on the United States          36    I'll submit the euro, but I guess I'll throw that out  [Laughter]      Think about the problem that the Japanese economy is confronting    I’m personally quite pessimistic about Japan, so I don't think anything positive is going to   happen there any time soon  But all those people who are buying Japanese equities clearly feel   differently and have felt so for a while  And the people putting upward pressure on the yen feel   differently  The Japanese economy might appear to be restructuring and recovering and might   appear to offer returns down the road that will be quite attractive  Nonetheless, the Japanese   current account surplus means that exchange rates and interest rates have to be such that   Japanese investors are persuaded to acquire net claims on the rest of the world each and every   month--no matter what--going forward  That, too, is a daunting thought  One might well believe   that that is going to be hard to do after a while, if the Japanese economy begins to recover     The only information I have on this is from the New York Times   article that I read  We have talked about this among the staff and have tried to figure it out    There are various hypotheses about how to understand what is going on, though I can't   distinguish among them  And I put into this particular stew the fact that the Bank of Japan has   announced that it will be busy selling bills into the market over the short run to absorb excess          39  liquidity  The Ministry of Finance says                                                                                           that   they are trying to mobilize funds that they view as sitting around in the banking system doing   nothing  They haven't admitted that this is some sort of approach to a credit crunch situation    They see these funds sitting there and they are going to utilize the resources  So they propose to   borrow to provide to local governments funds that they are obligated to provide under budget   provisions that already exist  In essence they are borrowing from the banking system to finance   this  The right alternative, presumably, would have been to issue more Japanese Government   Bonds (JGBs)  And one might imagine that the banks would have taken these idle funds that are   being provided for them and bought JGBs at 4 basis points     So, one possibility is that this is a way to give the banks a bit more   income  One might ask, as I have, whether the Ministry of Finance thinks that because this is a   relatively more attractive instrument banks will provide more financing than they would have   through the direct JGB route  If so, when all is said and done, in some sense the Ministry of   Finance is going to be able to expand the amount of financing it can do because it is not just a   one-for-one swap that will appear on the books but in effect has no policy implication  The   Ministry of Finance might actually have to do less financing in the open market as a consequence   of having issued an instrument that is particularly attractive to banks, thereby increasing the   willingness of banks to hold claims on the Japanese government  If that were the case, the   Ministry could say that, yes, it paid a bit more but actually sold more into the market  If it did   more in the JGB market than it would have otherwise--if it just has to sell as much as it has to   sell with nothing else going on--this is not a crazy scheme from the point of view of the Ministry   of Finance, I guess            40  A couple of things about it worry me  One is that it seems to be at odds with what the   Bank of Japan is doing                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Another concern is that all those JGBs sitting out there are going to sell for enormous   capital losses when Japanese long-term rates really move  So they end up with a banking system   into which they have put a large amount of capital and barely gotten any effect  The banking   system is not fixed by any means  If the economy were to recover, as they deal with the cycle of   debt they are creating, this undercuts that process by putting more capital losses on the books of   Japanese banks  These instruments presumably won't be trading in the market; they won't be   marked to market and won't show capital losses  At least they won't show them any time soon   because they are going to be selling at rates that are above market for a while anyway  This may   be a way of trying to improve bank balance sheets--a way of giving them returns of 2 percent   instead of 2 basis points--because they are going to need it

model, so it's okay!  [Laughter]     There is nothing about these simulations that is intended to suggest   how the dollar would react or to cause changes in the dollar  This is simply a statement that   says  If both foreign growth and US growth were at potential, as best we know it, and if the          43  dollar were to follow this path, this would be the outcome of the current recovery  Nothing here   is meant to be predictive of what drives the dollar     What I think one can learn from this analysis is that those who   believe a return to stronger, more vigorous growth abroad will solve the external balance   problem of the United States are mistaken  Unless the parameters that relate trade to its near-  term determinants change a lot and change soon, it is not the case that a resumption of foreign   growth will have the effect of closing the US external gap  "
6334,2000-03-21,"  The wide dispersion of economic performance   by regions that has characterized global economic activity in varying  degrees since 1997 appears to be coming to an end  With the notable  exception of the Japanese economy, positive economic developments  are now widespread in Asia, Latin America, and Europe  These  regions have joined North America and the United Kingdom in  returning to sustained, sometimes exceptional, rates of real output  growth     For the most part, the strengthening of economic activity abroad   has been accompanied by sounder macroeconomic fundamentals   Inflation remains contained almost everywhere despite higher energy  prices   In many countries, official interest rates have been raised to  counter the effects of stronger activity and the rise in oil prices  Last  Thursday, the ECB raised its official rates another 25 basis points,  confirming our guess in the Greenbook that additional tightening  would come soon That Greenbook outlook includes further increases  of official rates among the industrial countries this year and a bit more  next year, moves that will moderate the rate of expansion somewhat  and keep growth abroad at a projected annual rate of about 4 percent       Fiscal policies generally remain sound as well  The improved   cyclical positions of many countries are lowering actual deficits, and  gains in structural fiscal balance are also being made in many  countries  Within the euro area, several countries are now in surplus  or near fiscal balance, and all those countries are expected to have  deficits no wider than 2 percent of GDP this year  Among key  developing countries, higher oil prices are improving the fiscal  position of the Mexican government, and past progress in Brazil has  left it in a healthier fiscal situation, although more progress is still  needed                 - 32 -     On the whole, one could say that in terms of macroeconomic  performance, again with the exception of Japan, much of the rest of the  global economy is moving toward growth at respectable rates with  some characteristics in common with recent US experience  At the  same time, many global financial markets are displaying volatile  behavior and raise some concerns that risks of disorderly conditions or  abrupt fluctuations could threaten the otherwise sanguine outlook that  we presented in the Greenbook       Equity prices abroad are beginning to pose puzzles similar to   those in the United States  During the intermeeting period, stock  prices rose at double-digit rates in Canada and Mexico, although they  fell at comparable rates in Thailand and the Philippines  Since the  start of the year, stock prices have moved up strongly in Canada,  Germany, and, to a lesser extent, France  In many foreign stock  markets, as in the United States at least until very recently, the prices  of shares in the technology sector have risen extremely rapidly, on  balance, and account for much of the rise in the overall index  The  similar movements that we observe in equity markets in Asia, Europe,  and the United States raise the odds that a major correction in one  region could trigger large price movements in the others       Foreign exchange markets also contain hints of possible risks to   our baseline picture of convergence toward potential growth rates  abroad  Although ECB officials denied a causal link, persistent euro  weakness was at least in their minds when they reached the recent  decision to tighten  However, this increase in their official rates had  no perceptible effect on the value of the euro in terms of the dollar   With firm economic growth only now being established in some parts  of the euro area, particularly Germany, there is risk of premature  tightening of monetary policy preventing sustained expansion Yen  strength triggered two episodes of exchange market intervention by  Japanese authorities since your February meeting, but with no lasting  impact on the exchange rate  Renewed yen appreciation might risk  derailing the recovery that is beginning in some components of  Japanese demand     There are other risks to sustained global expansion  Structural   problems were identified in many of the countries that experienced  crises in 1997 and 1998  The rebound in activity may lessen the  energy devoted to addressing these problems and foster a return to  complacency  In Europe, high unemployment rates continue and are  evidence that further reforms to introduce flexibility in labor markets  remain essential  Lack of market confidence in the reform process in  the euro area appears to be one of the factors weighing on the euro              - 33 -       Despite the rebound in activity abroad, we continue to project a   widening external deficit in the United States that in turn will require  ever larger amounts of foreign savings to finance  Since the  Greenbook was finalized, we have received two additional bits of data   The balance of payments for the fourth quarter contained revisions to  real exports and imports  A more positive outcome for service exports  relative to imports than in the previous data accounts for the upward  revision of fourth-quarter growth in US GDP to a pace above 7  percent  This morning, trade data for January were released  They  show a new record for the monthly nominal deficit  Taken together,  these data imply, all else equal, a downward revision of several tenths  for first-quarter GDP growth, but only a small change to the current  account balance this year and next        We would be happy to answer any questions       That is why in fact we have little tilt either way  There are factors   on both sides  Looking forward, in some sense we see the US economy slowing--at least that is   the maintained hypothesis in the Greenbook and in so many other forecasts of late--and we see   the rest of the world getting stronger and stronger  So on those grounds, I’m not sure that the   edge in a relative sense--in terms of the pace of activity and the exploration of new opportunities              - 34 -     and the capacity to attract investments so to speak--doesn't still lie abroad   Granted, that’s a   relative-type comparison rather than an absolute one  On the one hand, the slowing in the US   economy that is depicted in the Greenbook arises largely from higher interest rates and a   tightening of financial conditions more generally  Because those are the driving factors, one   might argue that we should continue to attract capital inflows  On the other hand, those higher   interest rates could achieve a stock market outcome that seems less rewarding to capital inflows    In essence, we don't have an answer as to which of these many competing elements will   dominate and over what part of the forecast period  We've chosen an almost flat, though not   quite flat, outcome for the dollar just as a means of saying that we can identify forces going one   way and we can identify forces going the other way  "
6378,2000-06-27," Your next chart reviews developments in  selected international financial markets since the February  meeting  As can be seen in the top left panel, the average foreign  exchange value of the dollar in terms of the currencies of the other  major industrial countries--the black line--has risen on balance so  far this year, although it has most recently given back some of  that appreciation  Through May, the dollar continued its upward  trend in terms of the euro  After falling to a value of about 90  cents, the euro strengthened for a time, amid signs that in the near  term European real growth would start to compare favorably with  that in the United States, before relapsing in recent days  In terms  of the yen, the dollar today is little changed from where it started  the year  Three-month market interest rates, reported on the panel  on the right, have risen in the euro area and in the United States,  in line with tightening moves by the two central banks  In Japan,  the zero interest rate policy remains in place, but market  participants expect that may soon be changed       The middle panels report financial data for selected Asian   emerging market countries  After the turbulence of 1997-98,  these currencies have tended to recover, and the dollar has  depreciated against them  However, the Indonesian rupiah, the  blue line, has continued to be buffeted by political developments  in that country  Despite the recent slide in the rupiah’s value, the  Indonesian short-term rate and the dollar spread--shown on the  right--have moved down a bit on balance since the end of January   That’s partly in response to the IMF finding that the conditions           13  for further disbursements from the Indonesian program have been  met     The approach of the Mexican election has imparted some   upward pressure on the dollar relative to the peso, the blue line in  the bottom left panel; Mexican interest rates have edged down on  balance but are up from their lows in April  In contrast, the most  recent moves of the dollar against the Brazilian real--the red line  at the left--have been toward depreciation, and short-term  Brazilian rates have eased considerably      Your next chart provides an update on recent trade   developments  As can be seen in the upper left panel, the increase  in the value of exports from December to April was limited by the  effects of the strike at Boeing on aircraft exports--line 2--which  have not yet fully unwound  With some allowance for that  transitory element, export growth in the first third of the year has  been moderately strong, particularly for other capital goods--that  is, machinery and equipment, shown on line 3  The small panels  to the right illustrate that our exports have expanded rapidly to  Canada and Mexico, where real output growth has been robust  and investment strong, and are on an upward trend in western  Europe  Exports to Asian trading partners have still not returned  to their pre-crisis peaks       Imports are shown in the lower left panel  The increase   this year through April significantly exceeds that of exports, even  when adjusting for aircraft  Other than oil--line 2--the increase in  imports is largely in the categories of capital equipment and  consumer goods--lines 3 and 6  As is visible in the lower right  panel, the expansion of real imports has been rapid over the past  few years, while real exports clearly show the effects of the global  crisis in 1997 and 1998  As a consequence, the gap between the  two has widened impressively     Global prices of traded goods are the subject of your next   chart  We were guided primarily by the futures prices in writing  down our forecast for oil prices, shown in the upper left panel  Nothing in the announcement last week by OPEC of an increase  in quotas of 700,000 barrels per day has led us to second-guess  the downward trend we have put in these prices, although current  low inventories could contribute to continued volatility in spot  prices for some time  Non-oil commodity prices, on the right, are  expected to recover in the near term from recent declines that  reflect particular supply fluctuations and then on average to move           14  up at a moderate rate over the forecast period, reflecting the path  of quotes in futures markets     We continue to expect that the real exchange value of the   dollar, the middle left panel, will depreciate on balance over the  forecast period  We have little basis on which to pinpoint the  timing of downward moves in the dollar so we have spread the  depreciation over the next six quarters  Of course, more volatile  episodes of exchange rate adjustment are more likely than  extended gradual change      The middle right panel shows the paths of industrial   country prices--the black line--and non-industrial countries--the  red line--expressed in dollars over the forecast period  In the  recent past, dollar appreciation has tended to offset inflation in the  other industrial countries, resulting in no trend to date in the black  line  Going forward, we expect to see a positive trend in this  measure, largely accounted for by the projected nominal  depreciation of the dollar  Developments in the non-industrial  countries have been imparting upward pressure on dollar import  prices since mid-1998 when those currencies hardest hit by the  crisis reached turning points  Over the next six quarters, that  upward pressure will continue, explained primarily by domestic  inflation in those countries       The upward slope to these two forecast lines accounts for   the shift up in projected inflation of the prices of imported core  goods that is shown in the bottom panel  Core import prices are  expected to accelerate to an annual rate of increase of about 3  percent, after experiencing significantly lower increases and even  decreases since 1997       The staff outlook for growth of real GDP abroad is   summarized in the top panels of your next chart  Foreign growth  rebounded last year to an average rate comparable to US growth   In some countries, growth in the first quarter was surprisingly  robust, putting our estimate for average foreign growth in the first  half at a particularly high pace  Going forward, we look for  foreign growth to moderate some and to remain comparable to  US growth  As can be seen on the right, there are important  differences among our foreign trading partners, with the Asian  developing countries (the red bars) resuming growth at rates that  are significantly higher than those of the Latin American  countries (the blue bars) and the foreign industrial countries (the  black bars)  For most countries, our thinking is that the very rapid  growth of 1999 and early 2000 reflects a recovery in activity that           15  has been possible because of the availability of unutilized  resources  As the amount of slack in these economies diminishes,  growth will have to come down from what are unsustainable  rates       This pattern is particularly evident in the Asian emerging   market economies, shown in the middle panels  Korea, in  particular, has recorded an extremely rapid increase in industrial  production--the red line in the left panel--that has already eased  off  As can be seen in the table on the right, on average these  countries experienced very rapid growth last year that seems to  have continued into the first half of this year  Although there are  variations across countries, we look for some moderation of  growth in them  Some slowing in the growth of exports likely  will contribute to this process, as will policy adjustments in the  countries themselves     In Latin America, illustrated in the bottom panels, the   recent strength of activity is importantly accounted for by Mexico,  where industrial production--the blue line at the left--has spurted  this year  Growth in Brazil has been solid, and Argentina is  showing tentative signs of recovery from its sharp downturn  Our  forecast for real output growth--the panel to the right--projects  lower growth in Mexican output over the next six quarters, as  US growth slows      Your next chart reports recent developments and our   forecast for the major foreign industrial countries  As can be seen  in the top left, measures of business confidence have generally  risen over the past several quarters in these countries, even in  Japan--the green line  Unemployment rates, shown in the right  panel, have come down significantly, except in Japan, as activity  in these countries has accelerated      The improved confidence by those in the business sector   and the progress in lowering unemployment rates open the  question of whether these countries might be in the early stages of  strong investment demand, rising productivity, and improved  potential output growth  Right now, we have little firm evidence  that such developments are occurring, except possibly in Canada   As a consequence, we have been fairly conservative in our  forecast for real GDP growth, shown in the middle left panel  We  project that on average real output growth in the industrial  countries will slow some over the remainder of the forecast  period, but that slowing is largely accounted for by Japan  We  continue to expect that domestic demand growth in Japan, shown           16  on the right, will falter as fiscal stimulus wanes and as needed  structural reforms limit any improvement in labor market  conditions, restraining consumption spending as a result      We are expecting some moderation of growth in Canada   also, as lower real output growth in the United States and the  effects of recent and prospective monetary tightening slow  economic expansion in Canada to a more sustainable pace  In the  euro area and the United Kingdom, we are projecting sustained  robust growth, supported by continued growth of domestic  demand, shown on the right     With business confidence strong, we look for fixed   investment to be an important source of demand stimulus   Investment as a share of GDP, shown in the lower left panel, has  risen noticeably in Canada during the current expansion  There  are signs of a slight upward trend in France as well, but less so in  Germany       Investment in capital goods and processes that embody the   new IT developments is one channel by which productivity  enhancement could develop in Europe  Some indication of  support for that activity is shown in the lower right, where  measures of venture capital for the purposes of early-stage  financing and expansion financing are shown as a share of GDP   This measure has risen sharply in the 1990s in Germany, from an  admittedly low base, and somewhat less in the United Kingdom   Increases have also occurred in the United States and Canada,  where venture capital activity is already substantial and where  gains in productivity are more evident in production data   In  contrast, these data suggest little use of venture capital in Japan as  a device for financing investment in new technologies  Our  current judgment is that moderate growth will be sustained in  Europe, but we cannot confirm a major impact at the  macroeconomic level yet from new IT developments     Your final international chart summarizes our analysis of   the US external sector  In the top panels, the growth of exported  goods other than agricultural products, semiconductors, and  computers--that is, core exports--is expected to remain moderately  strong, with foreign growth (the red bars) providing firm support  while relative prices (the black bars) switch from restraining to  boosting exports  Over most of the forecast period, the growth of  core exports will continue to be outdone by rapid growth of core  imports, shown in the middle panel  US GDP--the red bars-- remains the principal factor determining growth of these imports            17  The projected slowing of US output growth next year should  reduce import growth, as will relative prices, the contribution of  which will move from a moderate positive to a small negative  factor  As shown in the top right panel, we look for the  contribution of total exports (the black bars) to US GDP growth  to strengthen in the second half of next year  The positive boost  from exports to US GDP should about offset the effect of  imports (the red bars), resulting in a neutral impact on GDP from  the external sector     As can be seen in the middle left panel, with the trade   deficit widening further and investment income showing larger  deficits, we expect the current account deficit will exceed $500  billion at an annual rate by the end of 2001, nearly 5 percent of  GDP  To date, the United States has had little difficulty financing  the widening current account deficit  The strength of the US  dollar is one indication of this  Another is the large scale of  private capital inflows  As shown in the panel to the right, foreign  private purchases of US securities remain at extraordinary levels,  despite the ongoing net selling of US Treasury securities by  foreigners  Foreign direct investment in the United States, which  has been elevated in part by the general merger wave, declined  somewhat in the first quarter but remains high, at a pace about  comparable to US direct investment abroad     The panels at the bottom depict two simulations done with   the staff’s global model  The solid black line indicates the  Greenbook path for the US current account through 2001 and the  extension that was constructed for the Bluebook for 2002  The  simulation labeled US dollar depreciation--the blue line--plots  the implications for the US current account balance of a uniform  rise in the risk premium on US assets  This shock induces an  immediate 5 percentage point decline in the trade-weighted value  of the dollar starting in the third quarter of this year  This  alternative path for the dollar has a small but perceptible effect on  the current account balance, improving it about $30 billion by the  end of 2002      The alternative scenario also involves dollar depreciation,   but that depreciation results from a tightening of 100 basis points  in short-term interest rates relative to our baseline in the euro area  and the United Kingdom and of 25 basis points in Japan  Such a  development could occur if generally stronger activity abroad  leads those central banks to react strongly, without taking fully  into account similar moves being made elsewhere  In this case,  the weighted average dollar depreciates about 3-1/2 percent by the           18  end of the period shown, reflecting substantial moves down  against the euro and the pound   As you can see, a dollar  depreciation brought about by such a policy move abroad does not  improve the US current account balance within the interval  shown; in fact, the deficit widens  This results from the negative  impact on foreign GDP of the monetary policy tightening moves  abroad, which offsets the stimulative effect of dollar depreciation  on US export demand and leaves US real net exports and US  GDP little changed  With foreign GDP weakened by the  monetary tightening, US earnings from assets held abroad fall,  and the current account deficit widens, despite the weaker dollar   These simulation results highlight the fact that the implications of  dollar depreciation for US external balances depend importantly  on the factors inducing the decline in the dollar       If I might just put a footnote on that  From the point of view of,   say, Chart 7 or some of the others, the comparison of the baseline to the alternative that is being   depicted is, loosely speaking, independent of what we've assumed about the dollar  How much   difference the alternative makes to the baseline is what those charts illustrate  The issue of the   baseline path that we put in for the dollar arose because to get a longer-term view--asking the   model to extend itself in time--requires that it not encounter explosive developments  The   model just doesn't behave  And given the parameters driven by history, we have to put in a   sizable dollar depreciation to meet that, if you will, computing criterion  I don't dispute   anything Don said, but in thinking about the alternative versus the baseline--the aspect the   charts focus on--what we had to put in to get the model to resolve the current account problem   is really irrelevant     I would, in the sense that the 5 percent number gets one's attention   shall we say  It is not that we have a view that a 5 percent decline is necessarily going to   happen or that we have even a clue as to when the decline would start or how fast it would   proceed  The problem is that in order to do a simulation with relationships that define exports   and imports we have to have in the model their effective relative prices and the accumulating   net investment position of the United States, and so forth  Those relationships are built on   historical experience at this point  We have no alternative that we trust that would lead us to go   in and adjust those arbitrarily because of something we think is going to happen for which there   is no precedent in history  Those relationships tell us that any depreciation of the dollar that is   less rapid than 5 percent causes the net investment position to explode at some point in the   future  And that is just not something an econometric model can handle  It can't provide us   with a useful long-run simulation with something like the net investment position extrapolating   ever faster to larger and larger positions  So, in order to make the model have other features   that are not disturbed by this exploding net investment position, we have to put in a value of the   dollar that keeps that investment position behaving  Consequently, one reasons back and back   and back and one ends up with that 5 percent  Does that mean the dollar will start falling by 5   percent in 2002 or 2004 or 2005?  Not necessarily  But there is a germ of truth in this analysis   unless we start seeing in the data something that says the historical relationships and elasticities   no longer apply  Were the dollar to remain strong and were that to give us a more favorable   outcome on the federal funds rate, it would be creating another problem--one that is growing   insidiously--which is this net investment position  "
6402,2000-08-22,"  After the Greenbook was finalized last week, we   received trade data for June  The figure for the trade balance surprised us a  bit  Both exports and imports grew more rapidly than we or BEA had  penciled in for June, with exports showing the larger upward revision  We  would now project second-quarter GDP growth at a 51 percent annual rate,  rather than the 49 percent in the Greenbook     The strength in June exports is consistent with the basic message in the   Greenbook regarding the global economy Economic activity in the rest of  the world is expanding vigorously on average  Many industrial and  developing countries have gone a long way toward closing output gaps--in  some cases eliminating ones that had opened widely during the crisis years  of 1997-1998  Inflation pressures, while for the most part not too far  advanced, are beginning to threaten in some countries  In response, central  banks in several industrial and developing countries have already increased  official lending rates; and our Greenbook forecast incorporates the  assumption of further tightening moves       23    One notable exception in this generally favorable picture is Japan,   although some signs of economic recovery have emerged there as well  So  far, that recovery has largely taken the form of expanding private investment  spending, and it seems fragile to us   Japanese household consumption  spending remains restrained, although recent signs are positive  Fiscal  stimulus is likely to diminish next year, as some of the elements of the  supplementary package from nearly one year ago finally have their effect  but quickly run their course in the near term and others lapse without ever  being acted upon  We see real output in Japan continuing to grow, but  weakly  The Bank of Japan moved recently to end its zero interest rate  policy, amidst controversy with other government officials over whether the  conditions for such a move had yet arrived We judge that the pace of  recovery in Japan will not warrant further moves in the near term, and in our  forecast we have assumed no additional measures by the Bank of Japan over  the next six quarters     The projected strength of foreign output is an important factor   underpinning our outlook for continued robust growth of exports Another is  the moderate rate of decline we have again forecast for the exchange value  of the dollar, starting next quarter  The fundamental reason for this  expectation is the growing net international indebtedness of the United  States and the associated rising total of claims on the US economy in  foreign portfolios  But as the last few years have clearly shown, we have no  way of determining when the foreign appetite for dollar claims will stop  expanding  As long as foreign investors judge US investment  opportunities to be more attractive than those elsewhere, capital inflows will  respond, and the dollar could well remain strong  One argument in favor of  an early adjustment in the dollar is our expectation that further monetary  tightening moves abroad are likely in the near term, especially by the central  banks of key foreign industrial countries, whereas the Greenbook path  assumes an unchanged US federal funds rate until later in the forecast  period   The projected depreciation of the dollar also acts to slow import  demand in the Greenbook forecast         Because our path for the dollar has a sizable impact on the staff   outlook, we included in this Greenbook an alternative scenario using the  global model in which the dollar continues to strengthen throughout the  forecast period  In particular, we simulated the outcome under the  assumption that the dollar continues to trend up and by the end of next year  reaches a level about 8 percent above its second-quarter average  In that  case, the staff model suggests that both GDP growth and core inflation  would be about 1-2 percentage point lower in 2001 than in the current  forecast             24    It certainly is a reason why we thought this was the right time to include   that alternative as opposed to some other alternative  Nevertheless, it’s not unlike the problem   David described with respect to the stock market  Will 4 percent growth in 2001 come as a big   surprise to everybody?  In that case, a range of asset prices might adjust, including the US stock   market as well as the dollar  Will it come as a surprise to some but not to others, and will it have a   differential impact on assets?  We can’t rule that out in some sense  We’ve often seen news move   the bond market and stock market in ways that don’t seem entirely consistent     To be honest, I don’t know  I can tell you that most of the public forecasts that I’ve seen   do not have US net exports in the current account widening the way we do in 2001  And when I   look to see why, it’s because those forecasts have much lower US growth than we have  So I have   to believe that outcome, if it materializes, is going to be a surprise to some forecasters  But whether   it will be a surprise to investors is something we really have a hard time judging at this point     Let me answer the question in two halves  Under the assumption that   the same rules apply as have for years, I think in the face of rising inflation pressures--largely, if you   will, from spending shifting up in these economies--foreign central banks will bring about some,   though perhaps limited, increase in real interest rates  They aren’t just going to keep pace with   inflation, they are going to try to constrain it and they will have small increases in real interest rates   That is in effect what we were referring to when we said we see some increases even perhaps as   soon as two weeks from now  The market seems to think the ECB will act again that quickly,   although today’s news may have changed that  Today there was a weak survey number from   Germany     The question of whether or not the types of technological changes that have driven the   US secular and cyclical experience over the past several years are emerging abroad--and if so   where and at what pace--is consuming numerous researchers around the globe  And that includes   the people who work here in the International Finance Division  The clearest evidence is in   Australia, if we want to cite a foreign country as an example  The Australians see it happening, we   see it happening, and the world sees it happening in Australia  In other places people are looking as   carefully as they can and they are remaining skeptical  There are some small places in Europe where       28  we can see this sort of thing happening  Finland, oddly enough, is one and it’s not just Stolichnaya,   their vodka!  But, as I hinted in the Chart Show six weeks ago, we were looking in various countries   for venture capital spending, we were looking for the composition of investment, and we were   looking for the behavior of their stock markets  We were looking everywhere we could for evidence   of it  It should be there at some point  One can make arguments about why features of certain   economies may make them slower or less likely to incorporate technological change to their   advantage as quickly as we do  But it’s hard to believe that any of those constraints could actually   keep it from happening  Could the electrification of Europe have been suppressed by some kind of   bad structural policy three generations ago?  I doubt it  I don’t think technological change can be   completely suppressed now, even with some bad policy  So we are very alert to this  The fact is that   in putting together the Greenbook forecast, we were not able to find enough concrete evidence of it   happening yet that we felt we should try to factor it in systematically    I would point out that if I thought it were happening, I might be more aggressive in   lowering the dollar, in the sense that the attractiveness of investment opportunities in the United   States has been cited as one of the more important factors influencing the dollar  So, if those who   were doing the saving in the world came to believe that investments at home were on the cutting   edge, so to speak, I think they’d be only too happy to invest at home  And that could cause the   dollar to fall more rapidly than we’ve portrayed in the tiny depreciation we have in the Greenbook     It would benefit, yes     It does, although on the whole, given that our current account has   worsened and yet the dollar has risen, we’re inclined to explain that by saying the investment   opportunity mechanism has been more important for the United States over the last three years  "
6424,2000-10-03,"  As Dave noted, the extension of our forecast through 2002  provides an opportunity to consider some longer-term issues and risks  In  particular, the longer forecast horizon allows the implications of our projections  for foreign activity, the exchange value of the dollar, and, importantly, global  oil prices to be clearly evident in the outcome for real exports and imports  The basic picture we have presented for the rest of the world remains one of  robust growth with inflation that is largely contained  As always, a few spots  on the globe merit some concern on our part  Argentina has yet to achieve  sustained recovery from the recent crisis despite the rebound in growth in its  Latin trading partners  Some Asian economies, for example the Philippines and  Indonesia, still are struggling with the economic implications of what are  fundamentally social and political problems  And the picture remains  somewhat mixed among the transition economies of Eastern Europe   Nonetheless, to the extent we can discern such things, the risks in these  countries appear to be country-specific and not likely to trigger broader crises  and contagion should trouble erupt     In putting together the baseline forecast for the foreign outlook, we too  grappled with the issue of how best to frame the questions raised by the recent  shift up in spot and futures oil prices  We continued with our practice of relying  heavily on these market prices in specifying the path for global oil prices that is  incorporated in the outlook The view implicit in the futures curve that oil prices  are likely to come down over the near term as some elements in demand ease  off and supply remains steady seems reasonable  But the higher level for the  entire path relative to that in the August Greenbook reflects our agreement with  market sentiment of greater uncertainty about the balance of global supply and  demand over the forecast period than seemed to be the case six weeks ago   Nevertheless, we recognize that there are circumstances that could cause oil  prices to fall more rapidly than we have now in the forecast as well as others  that could generate further upward pressure in the short term     In the baseline Greenbook forecast, the implications for foreign real  economic activity of the more elevated path for oil prices vary--depending on  whether a country is a net exporter or importer--and are generally quite small   A small impact is consistent with the substantial reduction in the energy  intensiveness of real output in nearly every major country over the past thirty  years  In addition, we see the current upward pressure on oil prices resulting to  a significant extent from the strength of global demand  Global oil production  is now above the level reached before OPEC implemented supply restraints in  the spring of 1999  However, that supply has not been sufficient to keep prices  from rising in the face of the increased demand  Under these circumstances, we  do not anticipate that the elevated energy prices will have the negative effects  on business and consumer confidence that characterized previous oil crises        29  With oil inventories apparently low and supply disruptions still a  possibility, we included in the Greenbook an alternative scenario for oil prices   The particular path that we simulated is that of the price of oil rising to $40 per  barrel and remaining there over the entire forecast period  This alternative is  not the most likely path for prices in the event of a supply disruption  But it  does have the property that the oil price is high enough for long enough that our  models would show noticeable effects on real activity from the direct impact of  higher energy costs  For the United States, the assumption used in the model  about the response of monetary policy determines whether the impacts of higher  oil prices are almost entirely on prices--the outcome when the fed funds rate is  kept at the Greenbook baseline--or almost entirely on output, the outcome when  monetary policy is tightened in response to the increase in oil prices  Clearly,  intermediate outcomes with some effect on both inflation and output are  possible for monetary policy choices that are between these two     For the rest of the world, our model suggests that the impact of this higher   oil price path is noticeable, but not severe  The particular impact varies from  country to country, depending on its oil production status and on the strength of  links to the US economy and the US monetary policy response  Secondary  effects are transmitted across countries through relative exchange rate changes  that in turn depend upon the monetary policy responses to higher oil prices   Our model results suggest that over the next two years the impact on weighted  average foreign GDP growth could range from negative 01 to 03 percentage  point  The effects on US real exports and imports depend on the particular  US monetary policy assumptions, but on balance US real exports are boosted  because of the relatively large share of US exports to the oil-exporting  countries such as Mexico, Canada, the United Kingdom and OPEC  In nominal  terms, the higher cost of US oil imports swamps effects on our exports and  non-oil imports; accordingly, the US nominal trade deficit and current account  deficit widen significantly in response to the sustained higher oil price     As in the Greenbook, we did not put into this simulation additional   influences on private investment or consumption that might arise from  confidence factors  Such effects clearly could generate a more negative  outcome than this model simulation suggests  But any judgment on our part of  how large to make these negative effects under current circumstances would be  totally arbitrary     On balance, we are left with the conclusion that the effects of higher oil  prices per se are not likely to threaten our quite positive outlook for the global  economy  More negative outcomes are possible, but they depend importantly  on where the shock arises and how it is transmitted into the global economy     As a footnote, I would like to report on the Japanese Tankan survey for the  third quarter that was released overnight That survey showed a bit more  positive change than the markets or we were expecting  Most of the positive      30  news relates to responses from large manufacturers; small manufacturers and  non-manufacturers continue to lag somewhat behind  We continue to be  skeptical about the strength of the recovery in Japan and look for real GDP  growth there to remain positive over the next two years, but at annual rates of  growth in the 1 to 1-1/2 percent range      We’ll be happy to answer your questions           I don’t see that in the balance of payments data either  We’ll get Q3   data with some lag and then we’ll get the foreign direct investment numbers  It’s not until we   actually have the balance of payments data for the quarter that we get the FDI     We have portfolio numbers  I think there are hints in that but I   wouldn’t say there’s anything convincing one way or the other  But the Europeans, who on their   side may have more data by country that aren’t yet published, say this to me      If there is a slowdown, it’s not dramatic yet, that’s for sure  But the   Europeans seem to be of the view that there has been, and it may just be that they’re counting the   numbers associated with the mergers and acquisitions that are going through because in some sense   that is what has triggered some of the most visible flows  But that’s a very volatile series and it’s   hard to see whether a trend has really emerged in it       I might be bold enough to add a thought regarding domestic refining,   and that is the issue of maintenance  There is some question as to how much refining capacity will   be shut down for routine maintenance--whether or not that might be postponed a little  That could   give us some leeway to get a bit more product into inventory before the maintenance occurs   With respect to refining capacity overseas, the information I have is that the refineries are   operating at fairly high levels of capacity, but not at what one would describe an absolute maximum    So, there is a small amount of room there  As to whether in the end that would result in product      33  trades that we wouldn’t ordinarily see happening in the United States, I think there is some scope but   not much scope  And any accident in a refinery, or any type of unexpected shutdown, could   certainly change that picture quickly  "
6471,2000-12-19,"   Let me first update you on the implications for   our outlook of the data we have received since the Greenbook forecast  was finalized  Last week the balance of payments data for the third  quarter were released, and this morning trade data for October became  available  The nominal trade balance narrowed slightly in October to  $332 billion, with exports and imports both decreasing from their  September figures  On balance, these data released since last  Wednesday imply small changes to our outlook for the external sector  that net to essentially no change from the net export projection we  presented in the Greenbook     In putting together this forecast, we revised down our projection for   growth in our trading partners, with the downward adjustment averaging  about 3/4 percentage point at an annual rate in the near term but  diminishing over the forecast period  The extent of revision varies  across countries and regions  Still, real output growth abroad should  remain moderately strong and rebound a bit from the 3-1/4 percent pace  that we project for the near term to around 3-3/4 percent by the second  half of 2001 and during 2002       Three different sets of factors have become more visible over the   intermeeting period, leading us, as well as others, to become less  optimistic about the global economy  First are the direct effects of  slower growth of the US economy on the rest of the world  These  effects are strongest on our closest trading partners such as Canada and  Mexico but are significant elsewhere as well  In this set of factors I  include the projected impact on exports and imports that the improved  competitiveness of US products in all markets that results from the  change in the value of the dollar is projected to have       A second set of factors relates to the indirect effects of recent   developments in the US economy that are transmitted through global  financial markets  These include widespread equity price declines,  higher spreads for emerging market debt, and generally reduced  willingness to bear risk  To some degree, these shifts are happening in  global markets as investors react to changed perceptions about the US  economy and earnings prospects and rebalance their portfolios in order  to reduce overall risk or respond to major valuation changes  Less  optimistic expectations for the high-tech sector in the United States and  the pace of “new economy” investment translate into reduced profit  projections for industries in that sector globally, and the equity prices of  those firms have been depressed in most markets  These financial      16  market channels in turn have an impact on business and consumer  confidence and wealth abroad that lessens the outlook for domestic  demand in those countries       Finally, a third set of factors relates to developments in the global   economy not associated with recent US developments that imply a less  robust pace for foreign output growth  In principle, there are similar  factors that would boost foreign growth, but the last five weeks do not  seem to have yielded many of these  In this category belong financial  pressures in Argentina and in Turkey, which have become urgent   Although right now it appears that with the support of the IMF these  countries will avoid financial collapse and a forced change in exchange  rate regime, their prospects are darker than in November  In the case of  Argentina, the effects of this crisis on other emerging market countries  in the region have led us to reduce our forecast for output growth in  Latin America a bit more than we would otherwise have done  Political  stresses in some Asian economies, including the Philippines and  Indonesia, are an additional negative factor  In Japan, consumption  remains weak and the recovery has not succeeded in becoming  established  These developments are largely in line with our prior  expectations, which have been more pessimistic than consensus  forecasts  However, the prolonged failure of the Japanese economy to  rebound makes adjustment in the Asian emerging economies all the  more difficult     We have no precise way to separate and measure these three sets of   influences on foreign activity  The indicators that we rely upon to guide  our near-term forecast, such as orders data, confidence surveys, and the  elements of production, reflect all of these channels at work  The staff’s  global econometric model tells us that a shock to US investment  demand spills over to reduce average foreign GDP growth after four  quarters by about one third of the total impact on US GDP growth  when US monetary policy responds according to a Taylor rule  The  effects are strongest on Canadian and Mexican GDP growth, as would  be expected  This corresponds to what I have termed above the direct  effects of weaker US growth     In revising down our outlook for foreign growth by more than this   one-third rule of thumb would suggest, we have given some weight to  indirect effects not captured in the model  In particular, we think several  developing Asian economies rely heavily on the electronics industries  and will be hit hard, including through indirect financial channels  In  addition, a combination of wealth effects and blows to consumer and  business confidence are expected to reduce the growth of domestic  demand somewhat in several other industrial countries   We have no  illusion that we have gotten this just right  Clearly, we can imagine      17  “worse case” outcomes in which a global cycle of reduced demand,  diminished prospects for profits, asset price declines, and some further  reductions in demand spiral sharply down  But we think there are  macroeconomic safeguards out there, particularly in Europe and Canada,  that will moderate the deceleration in economic activity abroad and spur  an acceleration later in 2001 and 2002  Important among them are  planned fiscal stimulus and reasonably favorable credit expansion  conditions     While I cannot point to significant positive developments that   would have worked to offset those pointing to downward revision, there  are some steadying influences that at least kept our pessimism in check   Real output growth in China remains solid and should help to support  activity in Asia  Global oil prices still seem poised to decline  significantly going into next year  And growth in Europe, while  moderating, should remain sound     We would be happy to answer any questions   "
6515,2001-01-30,"  The Europeans do     In those countries that have both auctions and Lombard   facilities--the Swiss, for example--the Lombard rate is defined as x basis points over the   auction rate  So it moves constantly with the auction rate     The fundamental challenge we faced in   putting together the foreign outlook this time was to assess the net  effect of spillovers from the slowing of US real output growth and  the internal factors that had led to robust expansion abroad  throughout much of last year  The transmission of US  developments to foreign economies importantly includes financial  market linkages as well as traditional trade quantity and price  effects     Your first international chart reports developments in several   industrial country financial markets  As you can see in the top left  panel, the dollar continued to rise through much of the second half of  last year in terms of the currencies of our major foreign industrial  country trading partners (the black line) before partially retracing as  depreciation against the euro (the blue line) more than offset a sharp  upward move against the yen (the red line)  The decline of the dollar  against the euro seemed to be fueled by a series of data releases  showing emerging weakness in US economic growth  Euro  appreciation appears to have halted, at least temporarily, around the  turn of the year, as the Committee’s action on January 3 bolstered  confidence that the weakness in the US economy will be limited  and temporary  Also, some indicators suggested that the euro area  might be experiencing a similar, if milder, fluctuation in growth   The dollar has moved up against the yen in response to further     1/30-31/01 109  erosion of confidence in the prospects for successful structural  reform and sustained recovery in Japan     Interest rates (the middle left panel) have generally moved in   line with these market perceptions since the June meeting  Short- term market rates have edged up in the euro area and Japan while  moving down in the United States  Long-term interest rates have  moved down in all three economies  Stock price developments as  measured by three broad indexes are shown in the bottom left panel   After increasing the most in 1999, the Japanese Topix index has  suffered the largest decline of the three, feeding concerns about the  quality of bank balance sheets and adding to the general negative  tone of financial developments in Japan, particularly over recent  months      The three panels on the right compare short-term interest rate   futures at the time of the June FOMC meeting with the most recent  data  For the euro area and Japan, these are three-month  Eurocurrency futures market rates, with no adjustment for term  premia  For the United States, these are the standard futures curves  that blend near-term federal funds futures observations with  Eurodollar futures rates, adjusted slightly for increasing term to  maturity  As you can see, in all three cases the curves have shifted  down since June  Market expectations are now for some near-term  easing in euro rates  For the yen, the curve has flattened noticeably     Your next chart shows similar indicators for key emerging   market economies  Over the past seven months, the dollar has  generally appreciated against the currencies of Asian emerging  markets, shown on the top left, as market concerns have focused on  the disappointing degree of progress in structural reform in some of  these countries, on political stress in some, and most recently, on  their dependence on high-tech industries and exports to the United  States  Short-term domestic interest rates, the middle left panel,  have eased in countries such as Korea where activity shows signs of  decelerating, but have moved up in Indonesia as a consequence of  ongoing political uncertainties and the inflationary pressures from  rupiah depreciation  Dollar spreads for these countries generally  remain low except for countries such as Indonesia that present  special risks  Shown in the bottom left panel, stock prices in most  Asian emerging market countries have been trending down since  June but rebounded somewhat in January, as in Korea  In China, the  prices for the B shares open to purchase by foreigners have moved  up sharply        1/30-31/01 110  For the Latin American countries shown on the right, exchange  rates have been relatively stable, although the dollar has gradually  appreciated against the Brazilian real since mid-2000  Although  domestic Argentine interest rates (the middle right panel) rose  sharply in November, as financial uncertainty became a major issue  for that country, the domestic one-month rate has returned to its level  at the end of June  Mexican and Brazilian rates did not spike with  those in Argentina, and Brazilian rates have continued a downward  trend that began in 1999  Brady bond spreads for these countries  widened some at the time of the stress in Argentina, but are down on  net over the seven months  Stock prices (the bottom left panel) have  been volatile in all three countries and most recently have rebounded  after declining over much of the second half of last year     These financial indicators suggest that stock prices and to some   extent exchange rates have been the major financial channels so far  through which changed US attitudes toward earnings prospects and  willingness to bear risk have spread abroad  With expansion in  activity generally softening, interest rates are easing; and some  reduction in official rates is expected in many countries  However,  emerging market spreads are not showing signs of generalized  withdrawal from those markets by global investors     Your next chart summarizes our outlook for the rest of the   world and provides some detail for the developing countries  As is  evident in the top left panel, we estimate that foreign growth (the  blue bars) slowed significantly in the fourth quarter and brought  average foreign growth for the second half of 2000 down to below   3-1/2 percent, annual rate, from the very rapid pace of the first half   Looking ahead over the forecast period, we expect some recovery  from current diminished rates  On average, foreign expansion  probably exceeded that in the United States in 2000, and we expect  that to recur this year  The right-hand panel shows our projection  that growth in the Asian developing countries (the blue bars) will  remain the most robust of the three groups shown, albeit off the  strong pace of 2000For the Asian emerging market economies that  rely importantly on exports, trade links to the United States expose  them to a direct adverse shock as US growth slows  Moreover, for  some, exports from the high-tech sector are of particular importance   With that industry showing considerable retrenchment, those  economies are the most vulnerable  The available export data in the  middle left panel show signs of a downturn, especially in Korea and  Taiwan   As you can see on the right, we look for a substantial  downshift from the rapid rates enjoyed in the first half of last year  but a return to accelerating output at some point later this year as  recovery in the United States boosts their exports and stabilizes     1/30-31/01 111  financial conditions  We expect robust growth in China, where  strong domestic demand is expected to take up some slack from  reduced exports     For Latin America, the need to finance large external deficits   means that global financial conditions are a key link to developments  in the United States and the rest of the world  The bottom left panel  shows the public sector financing requirements faced by Argentina   The sizable jump in payments due in the first quarter of this year  loomed over markets in November last year and fed growing  concerns that a financing failure could erupt as the end of the year  neared  Particularly large payments to private creditors (shown in  red) and to those extending short-term debt (in blue) were bunched  in the first part of this year   The financing package finalized earlier  this month of additional IMF funds and substantial private sector  contributions have, thus far, reassured markets that Argentina will be  able to meet obligations in the first half of this year and that the  burden going forward will be manageable  That optimistic view  depends upon a favorable outcome for the fiscal deficit--the black  portion of the bars--which in turn depends upon tax revenues and  thus a return of growth  Our forecast, shown on the right, calls for  growth in Argentina to recover but not to robust rates  We look for  growth in Mexico, where the direct trade link to the US economy is  important, to slow further in the near term, but to turn up with the  projected strengthening in US activity later this year     The major foreign industrial countries, reviewed on your next   chart, to some extent are also open to contractionary impulses from  the United States through trade and financial channels  This is  particularly true for Canada  But we also had to consider to what  extent these countries are large enough and diversified enough that  domestic factors would sustain their growth and permit them to act  as offsets in the global economy to the US slowdown  In the top  left panel, GDP leading indicators for the euro area and Canada (the  black and blue lines) signaled further expansion during 1999 and  into 2000  Both appear to have flattened or turned down slightly, in  the case of Canada only very recently  In contrast, the indicator for  Japan (the red line) has moved down sharply, reversing the gains it  made last year       Judging by the business sector surveys in the panel on the right,   we see improved business confidence in both the euro area and  Japan  For Canada, the most recent readings on business confidence  do show some retrenchment, but that is from a quite high level in  historical terms for that index          1/30-31/01 112  In the middle left panel, employment data reflect the  production gains that occurred through mid- to end-2000 and  underlie our view that the household sectors in Canada and Europe  are likely to be sources of strength going forward  In France in  particular, some downward progress in the unemployment rate has  come at a time of increasing labor force participation and thus  substantial gains in total employment  In Japan, employment has  fluctuated over the past two years with little net increase, consistent  with our expectation that private consumption will remain weak     The panel on the right shows our expectation of the stance of   fiscal policy in these three areas through 2002  For Canada and the  euro area--the green and red bars respectively--fiscal policy should  be an even larger positive impulse to demand in 2001 than last year  and is in sharp contrast to the fiscal restraint put in place in 1999   For Japan--the blue bars--we see additional fiscal restraint this year  and next, contrary to expansion in 1999     In the bottom left panel, headline inflation rates in Canada and   the euro area rose over the past two years, boosted importantly by  higher global oil prices  This development will be a factor in  decisions by their respective central banks as to whether and by how  much to reduce official rates  We look for the end of oil price  increases and impending declines to contribute to a deceleration of  headline consumer price indexes in these economies  In Japan, we  project that deflation will continue, but at a diminishing rate over the  forecast period      As summarized on the right, we see subdued growth in the near   term, with some strengthening on average later this year and in 2002   We look for Canada to decelerate the most sharply, as a consequence  of its links to the United States, but also to rebound to strong growth  next year, boosted by fiscal ease and momentum in domestic  demand  Japan will grow, but only at a slow pace, as its financial  sector problems and fiscal restraint continue to act as a drag on  output growth       Your next chart provides our outlook for oil prices and the   dollar, as well as our export and import forecast  As in June, we  based our projection for oil prices, shown in the top left panel, on  current futures market quotes, which we believe square with  softening global demand and limited production restraint from  OPEC  Our projection for the real exchange value of the dollar in  terms of a broad range of our trading partners, on the right, has the  most recent run-up in the dollar’s value gradually unwinding over  the forecast period  With US growth relatively anemic this year,     1/30-31/01 113  we look for this decline to be more rapid in the near term than in  later quarters     Depreciation of the dollar should boost the rate of increase in   prices for imported core goods, ie, goods excluding computers,  semiconductors, and oil, shown in the middle left panel  Those  prices have been restrained by past dollar appreciation  Total import  prices are projected to decline this year, reflecting the expected fall  in global oil prices and further decreases in prices for computers and  semiconductors, and then to be nearly unchanged next year     Near-term weakness in global output growth is expected to   limit growth in US real exports of goods and services to sub-par  rates in the first half of this year  But, as can be seen in the middle  right panel, the strengthening in global activity expected later this  year, combined with the effects of dollar depreciation, should  contribute to a rebound in export growth such that for the year as a  whole, export growth is moderate  Next year should see further  acceleration of real exports     Our projection for real imports is depicted in the bottom left   panel  The more pronounced weakness in US activity and the  restraining effect of dollar depreciation on imports of real goods and  services should result in import growth for this year that is less than  that of exports  Stronger US expansion in 2001 will boost import  growth significantly  These forecasts are expressed as contributions  to real GDP growth in the lower right  As you can see, over time we  expect that exports will contribute an increased share to GDP growth  while the negative contribution of imports also rises in magnitude   On balance, for this year and next, these two elements are about  offsetting     Dave will now complete our presentation      I’ve given up hope that anything will cause them to shift in   some way their political approach!  There is an increasingly intense debate going on yet   again in Japan, sparked in part by the fact that the yen has moved so much over the last   month or so  And officials of the Bank of Japan on the one hand and the Ministry of   Finance on the other are somewhat at odds again, which I think is never a really   constructive development  The source of my greatest pessimism is that the debate   continues to be about the symptoms as opposed to the cause of their difficulties  And the   remedies that are being proposed continue to be about the symptoms as opposed to the   cause  They distract everybody concerned from really attacking the fundamental   problem  Now, the Board’s staff didn’t get overly excited about the strength that   appeared in Q1 last year and that appeared to be there even through the first half  So we   were not overly disappointed by the outcome in the second half because that’s how we   saw the situation  But others did see the strength in the first half as the light at the end of   the tunnel  And the Bank of Japan often pointed to that development as the light at the   end of the tunnel  So it’s possible that they will reach a point where they are in fact   disappointed enough that something will happen  If the economy actually slips back into   negative GDP growth that could do it  But at the moment I think the most likely outcome   is that it won’t actually slow that far, assuming that the US problems don’t become any   greater than characterized by our baseline forecast  And therefore the political will to   attack the real problems will gain no more energy than it has now       I don’t know a lot of detail since we only have trade data   through November and we think some of the biggest shocks might have come after that    Imports of consumer goods and some industrial supplies actually held up in November   but we’re expecting them to fall off and join the crowd in the December data, which we   will not get for another two-and-a-half weeks or so  To be honest, I don’t know much   more than that from the import data     We do have some export data from other countries  It’s clear   that there have been sharp reactions and that some of this correction will take the form of   a big drop in imports in December and January  That will be the transmission mechanism   to some of these countries  Indeed, I think that’s to be expected  We did see some   declines in many categories of imports in the November data but not, for example, in   consumer goods where I had expected to see it on the grounds that some of the first   declines in final sales had come in that sector     1/30-31/01 118    Not that I’m aware  I don’t think it’s complete  I have not   seen any      No, it didn’t work well  There were apples and oranges   problems in trying to use those data and we had to be careful  Those data have not been   routinely used for some time now     Yes, that might show it  I will ask whether that series,   having fallen into disrepute, nonetheless exists so that we might look at it     I think we collectively wonder whether the new economy, or   whatever elements in it prove durable, has changed the dynamic of the way things work    We are just too close to it at this point to judge, but we will keep asking that question  "
6539,2001-03-20,"  I’m going to cover some of these developments in my   briefing, so we might want to wait to discuss that  Actually though, I think there is some   uncertainty about both of those reports     Oh, Mr Murphy is definitely out and Mr Cavallo is in   Originally, Mr Cavallo had been named cabinet secretary or chief  Now it appears that   the current cabinet secretary might stay and that Mr Cavallo will take the economy   ministry post  But my guess is, whatever way it ends up, that he will have broad powers   indeed     Developments in the global economy are   moving quickly and not always in a welcome direction  This  morning I will comment briefly on developments that have emerged  since we prepared the Greenbook  They include the latest news  from the Bank of Japan, the further upward drift in the exchange  value of the dollar, the January trade data that were released this  morning, and developments in potential crisis countries     On Monday, the Bank of Japan announced a set of measures   that effectively reinstates the zero interest rate policy and that  changes its operating procedures  This move is in response to a  growing perception that the Japanese economy is in danger of  sliding into recession and that the problems within the Japanese  financial sector have become critical  Markets were expecting the  return to zero interest rates, but were surprised by the scope of the  changes announced by the Bank  The Bank will now implement  policy by targeting the outstanding balances that private financial  institutions hold with it rather than aiming for a particular overnight  interest rate  The proposed increase in those balances from the  current 4 trillion yen level to 5 trillion yen should lower the  overnight interest rate to zero  In an effort to convince markets that  short rates will remain there, and thus to induce lower rates farther     3/20/01 13  out the maturity spectrum as well, the Bank pledged to keep these  balances elevated until year-on-year CPI inflation stabilizes at zero  or above  Moreover, the Bank also announced its willingness to  purchase additional JGBs, if necessary  With Japanese markets  closed today for a holiday, we have few direct readings on market  reaction to the announcement  Long-term interest rates, which had  moved down to 116 percent through Friday, have edged down  further in London trading since the announcement      The move toward additional monetary ease is part of a broad set   of initiatives announced by various Japanese officials in recent  weeks  These announcements have included plans to achieve a  more complete resolution of non-performing loans in the banking  system, to put in place mechanisms to provide support for equity  prices, and to change taxes and regulatory provisions so as to  increase liquidity and trading in the real estate markets       In the Greenbook forecast, we had anticipated that the return by   the Bank of Japan to zero overnight interest rates would come soon  However, we remain somewhat skeptical about the commitment to  effective reform by the Japanese government, given contradictory  statements by various officials and the lack of strong political  leadership, with Prime Minister Mori apparently on the verge of  stepping down and no other politician coming forward to lead the  reform effort  As a consequence, we revised down our Greenbook  forecast for real output growth in Japan this year to minus 1/2  percent  The Bank of Japan’s announcement makes us slightly  more optimistic  But much depends on how market expectations  change and whether other elements of the needed reforms proceed,  especially those for the financial sector  Overall, we now see the  situation as better balanced, with some upside risk as well as  substantial downside risk to our baseline forecast      The series of disappointing data releases and yet more policy   announcements were accompanied by further depreciation of the  yen; over the intermeeting period, the yen moved down more than 6  percent in terms of the dollar, with much of that occurring last week  and early this week  The dollar gained as well against the Canadian  dollar and the euro  On balance, the staff’s index of the dollar in  terms of the currencies of other major countries has risen more than  4 percent over the intermeeting period  This greater strength of the  dollar at a time of significant slowing in the rate of growth of US  output and further downward adjustment in US equity prices is  somewhat puzzling  One possible explanation is that market  participants share our view that the slowing in the US economy  will prove to be short lived and that the perceived rate of return on     3/20/01 14  US assets over the longer run remains relatively attractive   Indeed, the market may be reflecting expectations that ECB  officials will be reluctant to ease as their economies slow, further  impairing the attractiveness of European assets  There may also be,  as Dino mentioned, some safe-haven incentives contributing to  flows into dollar assets, as asset markets globally have become  more volatile      January trade data were released this morning  The nominal   deficit on goods and services was $333 billion, little different from  our Greenbook projection and about in line with market  expectations  In January, both exports and imports moved up  slightly from December but remained below their fourth-quarter  averages  On balance, these data for trade, in conjunction with the  balance of payments data for the fourth quarter that we received late  last week, would not change our forecast significantly from that in  the Greenbook     Finally, some emerging market countries continue to attract our   attention and the attention of markets as well  On Monday, Turkey  and the IMF announced the framework of a new IMF program of  financial support, following floating of the lira on February 22  The  Fund signaled that it has no immediate plans to offer new money   For this program to succeed, difficult policy measures will be  required of the Turkish authorities  Without serious effort by them  and the maintenance of confidence on the part of private creditors,  there is a risk of failure  Currently, markets seem to be awaiting  more information about the specifics of the program       In addition, Argentina is again experiencing political stress   related to its economic policy agenda  Last Friday, Economy  Minister Lopez Murphy announced a set of fiscal measures that  implied serious fiscal restraint in order to come close to the  performance criteria established in Argentina’s IMF program  This  announcement triggered the resignation of several members of the  cabinet who represent the left wing of the coalition  Since then,  former Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo has agreed to join the  government, while last night Lopez Murphy resigned after only two  weeks in office  The implications of these moves for the course of  policy remain uncertain, although it may be that the fiscal restraint  will be lessened  On Monday, S&P put the ratings of Argentine  borrowers on credit watch with negative outlook, and asset markets  reacted adversely  Both the political risks and the economic risks in  Argentina remain high       We’d be happy to answer any questions     3/20/01 15         I think they came as close to inflation targeting as they could   comfortably, given what they had said publicly not too long ago about it being   inappropriate at this time  I see the announcement in some sense as a grand compromise,   an attempt to be a little something for everybody  The people who have been advocating   inflation targeting or other kinds of expectations adjustment steps got a statement that   reserves will remain at this elevated level until deflation had ceased, until it is at zero or   slightly positive  So that is implicitly, I think, an inflation target of zero or a small   positive number     Had they announced a higher number, I think it would not   have been credible  So in my view they made a reasonable compromise on that score    Those people who have been arguing for some kind of liquidity-based, unconventional   steps got a switch to reserve targeting instead of the current policy of interest rate   targeting  They got promises that the government might indeed buy more JGBs--not a   commitment, but at least an open door to that idea  So the people who have been pushing     3/20/01 16  in that direction got a signal that the government is prepared to do that and will in fact be   doing that to some extent    So the answer to your question is yes, but not exclusively  They have shown   flexibility to all of these options that have been in the air now for so long  But as they   pointed out themselves, and as I think is understood by most of the people in Japan, these   steps are not in and of themselves going to move the Japanese economy into recovery    They will facilitate the success of other measures, but they are not sufficient by   themselves to bring about a real turnaround     In that vein, the talk of Hayami having to resign if Japan moved back to a   policy of zero interest rates seemed to have evaporated about a month ago  I have not   heard any suggestion that his resignation is imminent  In fact, the talk that they were   reluctant to make that move because it would lead to his resignation is now all in the   background  That may be because of the increased urgency we’ve seen in these various   announcements in the past month or so and the heightened perception of the trouble   they’re in       It’s a skepticism about their ability to accomplish it, not   about their perception that it’s necessary  I think the biggest problem facing Japan right   now is political  They are simply politically very weak  The LDP doesn’t seem to know   what to do  There are a few persons in the past six months or so who have articulated   some strong views but they do not seem to have been able to build a sufficient political   base to carry the day  The fact is that Prime Minister Mori is still in office  There is talk   about moving up the day on which somebody else will take over the LDP but then   denying that that’s a resignation  The issue of the upper house election in July is a kind   of hurdle for the party  If they had a strong person, they would have dumped Mori and   put that person in  There’s a vacuum of political leadership, not a lack of awareness of   what the problems are  The LDP is not in a good position in the sense that the problems   that need fixing are basically in the areas of the private sector where they have gotten   their greatest support over the years  Let me add a footnote to what I just said  I think   the leaders of Japan understand  I don’t think they believe the people they rely on--the   businessmen and the local officials--understand  The leaders believe that if they take the   steps necessary, those people will not support them, maybe out of pure self-interest or   maybe from a lack of awareness  So they are caught because they can’t turn on their own   supporters until everybody understands that that is the only alternative, and they aren’t   quite there yet  At the level of public officials, the problem is more a lack of political   will than anything else  Our giving them a carefully reasoned argument isn’t going to   change anything  That is not the problem       3/20/01 18    I have been in Tokyo very seldom and I don’t pretend to   have close contacts, but it’s certainly my impression that the population in Japan does not   act as if the country is in crisis  They do not act, after 10 years in which these problems   have plagued the economy, as if they are prepared to do anything in an effort to solve   them  They get up and go to work  They seem resigned to the present situation and not   terribly unhappy with it  So in that sense I think your point is valid  But I read into the   events of the past two months a heightened awareness of the bigger picture on the part of   the people who are in a position to do something  They understand that the financial   sector was put at such huge risk by the declines in the stock market  They understand   that there is a serious probability that the economy will slip into an outright recession   again, which would put further pressure on asset prices and could cause a real financial   crisis  I think that awareness is not generally appreciated  Both the insurance companies   and the financial intermediaries have very serious problems  A further downward   movement in stock prices is only going to aggravate those problems  There is an urgency   here  But you are quite right that the man in the street does not seem to feel that sense of   urgency     But only maybe!     There is no interest rate arbitrage condition that is going to   give you that one!     Yes, I suppose  We’ve actually done some research on that    We’ve taken a sort of kitchen sink approach and put everything we can think of on the   right hand side of the equation and sorted through the most recent data  It did not yield   any real breakthrough  It didn’t give relative growth rates quite as much of a major role   as one might have thought, although the usual things appear in that equation  Our   research did not suggest that we have to throw out all we think we know, but the data   didn’t fit very well either, frankly     I’m a bit reluctant to get entirely on this relative growth   bandwagon, even though I think market participants see the ECB’s constant statements   that they are somehow not very vulnerable to the rest of the global economy--that they’re   going to do just fine and therefore don’t need to ease--as worrisome  I believe that’s   weighing on the euro, and that’s why I put that sentence in my remarks  But you know,   up until a year ago we all thought a primary factor was relative stock markets  The talk     3/20/01 20  was that somehow once the US stock market began to go down, that was going to be a   major event for the dollar and, in fact, that was perhaps the biggest reason to worry about   the stock market  Never mind the economy, never mind the wealth effect, a decline in   our stock market was going to cause this enormous disruption in exchange markets  We   all believed that until it didn’t happen  So it makes me a little leery of getting too   enthusiastic about this notion that relative growth is really the story  There is a kind of   market confidence, in a long-term perspective, with respect to investing in the United   States as a business opportunity that dominates other business opportunities  Japan   certainly doesn’t offer that opportunity and apparently Europe doesn’t offer it  And in   this game of there being only three major currencies, that notion seems to prevail despite   cyclical events     That certainly could be  The fact is, even though the   volume is reduced, that we still have a plateful of merger and acquisition announcements   and so forth on the table  In that vein, we received one unexpected bit of information   from the fourth-quarter balance-of-payments data  Many of the elements of the data are   already known before the actual tables are produced, but we don’t know anything related   to direct investment  And one surprise out of the fourth-quarter data was a big reduction   in the flow of direct investment payments abroad  That is, people holding direct   investments in the United States took a real beating in the fourth quarter and got much   less income than they might have expected from their investments  That’s no doubt   reflective of where the US economy was in the fourth quarter and, hopefully, it will   bounce back  But if that’s a big part of the picture and earnings that people make on their   foreign direct investments in the United States disappoint again, that could produce some   changes     Well, I’m just thinking that in retrospect some people--the   Japanese no doubt--didn't really think some of the investments they made in this country   in the 1980s were such a good idea  And it’s possible some of the Europeans will come   to that view about the 1990s  "
6579,2001-04-18,"  The trade deficit for February reported this morning rounds   to $27 billion, which is about $5-1/2 billion less than the slightly revised January number    It’s the lowest trade deficit in absolute value since December ’99 and it represents the   sharpest drop in imports in the history of these particular series calculated the way it is   now  Exports in fact increased very slightly, but could probably best be described as     4/18/01 3   holding their own  Thus, the improvement in the trade deficit owes entirely to the   significant drop in imports that has occurred     Yes, service imports rose  In the goods categories, the   declines occurred in both capital goods and consumer goods  Imports of industrial   supplies also declined, which I would be inclined to attribute to price effects to a   significant degree  So I would explain, if you will, the goods decline in imports as a   reflection of reduced imports of capital goods--including high-tech--and of consumer   goods across a wide range of categories  "
6600,2001-05-15,"   Yes  I think your comments summarized the situation  I would just   add that the Mexicans want the ending of these swaps to be part of a series of actions they are     5/15/01     8   planning, having to do with some internal reforms they’re attempting  Their hope is to get a   CCL relationship established with the IMF, which would be a very logical and natural point to   end the swaps with us rather than have their demise hit the markets out of the blue as an isolated   event  The Mexicans are not yet at that point, but we’re agreed that that is where they are headed   and, hopefully, they will get there fairly soon     We don’t have a firm commitment from either the Mexicans or the Canadians on   discontinuing the swaps  So in some sense it’s not a done deal  But there’s a shared objective  I   think it’s simply a question of getting it done as opposed to trying to persuade them to do   something that they fundamentally don’t want to do       I think it differs among the various people involved in the Canadian   situation     Well, from the point of view of those in the central bank who were   described to me as having at least paused when this was suggested, the swap could be a useful     5/15/01     9   instrument  If they never used it, that was fine  But the view was  Why give it away if they   don’t have to?     I wouldn’t lay it at his feet  As I understood it, the hesitation came   more from the operational people--those who carry out policy--rather than those who make   policy     They see the swaps as an extra source of funds they can use if they   ever want to, so why give that up?  I don’t believe there’s really any thoughtful resistance     Our outlook for real output growth abroad this time   has been revised down, particularly in the very near term, as data for  several key regions suggest more weakness than we had previously  incorporated in the forecast We still look for the projected rebound in  US real GDP growth, along with past and prospective stimulus from  macroeconomic policy abroad, to contribute to strengthening growth  later this year and next in other regions of the globe      There are important differences in the risks we see in our forecasts   for several countries or regions, and my remarks this morning will  highlight the vulnerabilities we see as looming in some cases and the  upside risks we see in others     The staff’s forecast for Japanese real output growth remains   pessimistic in this Greenbook  The latest indicators of economic  activity, including industrial production, machinery shipments, and new  car registrations for March, suggest that the Japanese economy is  stalling  The momentum necessary for strong private investment to be  sustained has not developed, and the March Tankan survey showed  further declines in business sentiment, especially in the manufacturing  sector  Consumption spending has shown some resilience, but not  enough to spark real recovery in domestic demand  With global demand  softening, the outlook is for export growth to remain weak until late this  year or next year     That said, there are developments in Japan, both on the economic and   political fronts, that we are uncertain just how to factor into our forecast   The spate of bad economic news triggered yet another round of policy  announcements by Japanese officials, including the moves taken by the  Bank of Japan on the day before the March FOMC meeting  And public  support for reform appears to be the reason for the surprise election of  Koizumi as the new head of the LDP and prime minister  He faces a  daunting challenge in moving the LDP and the government bureaucracy  to embrace and actively implement aggressive reform  With an Upper  House election looming in July, he appears to be pushing for the reform  agenda but has yet to provide details of what is to be done and when      5/15/01     16   Meanwhile, we remain of the view that the measures announced by the  Bank of Japan will not by themselves boost growth securely into the  positive range soon  Overnight interest rates have returned to zero, but  the BOJ is experiencing difficulty injecting its targeted level of liquidity  through repo auctions  With banks underbidding the desired repo  quantity, the BOJ will have to consider using outright purchases more  intensively       We do not see these latest political developments and policy plans as   providing any basis for a significantly more optimistic forecast for  Japanese real GDP growth over the next year and a half  And we have  revised our outlook for the quarterly pattern this year while leaving  growth on balance in 2001 near zero  In 2002, it strengthens slightly   However, Koizumi’s arrival on the scene does widen the confidence  band about our outlook  On the up side, progress on reform might now  be more likely and, in turn, could spark a revival of confidence on the  part of households and firms, encouraging them to spend  On the down  side, aggressive reforms, when implemented, would force bankruptcies  and restructuring that over the forecast period could yield an even more  negative outcome for Japan than we now project  The direct beneficial  effects from any reforms will no doubt take some time to appear     We have revised down our outlook for near-term growth of real GDP   in the euro area, as weaker confidence measures and declines in orders  confirm that the global slowdown will not leave the euro area unscathed   The surprise cut of 25 basis points in the official lending rate of the ECB  last Thursday was a bit sooner than what we had incorporated into the  Greenbook forecast but not so soon as to require a revision to our  forecast  European stock markets showed considerable volatility as  equity prices, particularly for the high-tech sector, came down and  earnings expectations in that sector plunged  Nevertheless, the output of  high-tech industries is such a small portion of total production in the  euro area that we do not expect the global weakness in high tech to have  a major effect there  Although we have adjusted down the numbers for  Germany a bit, we still see euro area growth next year as rebounding to  about 2-3/4 percent from about 2 percent this year     Among the emerging market countries, the greatest uncertainties   surround the outlook for Argentina  A new understanding has been  reached with the IMF for proceeding with the existing support program;  it is scheduled for approval by the IMF Executive Board next week  In  the meantime, Argentine officials have been working toward a proposed  swap of around $20 billion of outstanding debt with the private sector in  order to lengthen the maturity of government obligations and to create a  more sustainable amortization time profile for 2002 and beyond  Market  indications raise serious concerns about whether the swap will be     5/15/01     17   workable, given the high levels of interest rates currently  The rating  agencies have downgraded Argentine government debt and banks in  recent days  The latest tax revenues have disappointed on the low side,  despite the new tax on financial transactions that was just introduced       We see the Argentine situation as precarious  It is not hard to   imagine a sequence of events that would force some discrete response,  perhaps default or some kind of unilateral debt restructuring, perhaps  devaluation, or perhaps both  It is impossible for us to know just when  such events might occur or precisely what their implications will be   Recent exchange market pressure on the Brazilian real suggests that  Brazil is vulnerable to some contagion  To date, Mexico seems much  less vulnerable  We have not attempted to incorporate a breakdown in  the Argentine situation into the Greenbook forecast, but we have posited  weak growth in Argentina throughout the forecast period and have  revised down somewhat our growth outlook for Brazil, owing to a  tightening of monetary conditions by the central bank in response to the  inflation risk posed by the exchange rate pressures       Some progress has been made in Turkey, but serious doubts remain    Agreement on a Letter of Intent has been reached with the IMF for a  revised program  Together the IMF and World Bank will provide an  additional $10 billion, for a total of $19 billion  Success in arriving at  terms for privatizing Turk Telecom has been achieved, but at  considerable political stress  The current government seems to be less  than secure  With the extent of fiscal restraint contained in the program  substantial, it is easy to doubt whether the fiscal objectives can be  reached  As of now, it does seem that the spillover effects from yet  another failure of the Turkish support program would be limited, with  little effect on our outlook for the US economy        Well, as you saw in the Greenbook, we think this deflation will   continue for at least the six quarters that remain in our forecast horizon  There aren’t too many   more steps that the Bank of Japan could take in a monetary policy sense  And I am impressed by   the fact that they have basically driven the cost of liquidity to zero in that economy  We could   see that in many different ways  One avenue, of course, is the exchange rate  That is, this   liquidity could have as a consequence further declines in the yen, which could at some point help   in this respect  We got a bit cautious I suppose--or took a middle course--in thinking about the   dollar this time and we have basically extended both the yen and euro at a fairly flat rate  We are   just very reluctant to put into our forecast at this point a big appreciation of the dollar and a big   depreciation of the yen because there are so many reasons why that shouldn’t happen  On the   other hand, from the point of view of the Japanese economy there are many reasons why it   should     It seems largely caught up in market expectations on the one hand   and the politics of the situation on the other  And the politics extend not just to the dollar/yen   and US/Japan relationship, but to various trading partners and the concerns they express from   time to time about what a big depreciation in the yen would do  We still see the fundamental   problem in Japan as a need for serious reform on the structural side of that economy  We would   like to see those reforms in some respect bring relative prices in Japan, particularly between   traded and nontraded goods, back in line with the levels we see elsewhere--and yet for that to   occur without furthering deflation because that does have consequences  But I don’t have really     5/15/01     22   specific answers to offer you in terms of a solution and how they could bring that about  The   banking system, consumer spending, and household incomes are all negatively affected by the   ongoing deflation  We still see statements by Japanese officials that they can’t do certain things   or they can’t do them quickly or they can’t do them one way, they have to do them another way   because of what they view as political constraints on the options they face  So, basically, I am   inherently still pessimistic about how this will play out  "
6623,2001-06-26," May I refer you to a Bulletin article last October in which members   of the Board’s International Finance Division researched that question on other industrial     6/26-27/01 36   countries?  They came to the conclusion that there was no convincing evidence of accelerating   productivity growth in other countries  They offered some conjectures--I hesitate to call them   explanations--   The authors of that article continue to update their database and we   look to them for additional work on productivity  But they have not in any sense reached firmer   conclusions    It is certainly true that it is a struggle to get data to work with--even   something as basic as hours as opposed to number of employees  In the study our staff used an   approach involving a set of OECD countries, and they used OECD data  So the weakest link, if   you will, is to find the data It's certainly possible that if we focused our attention on one or two   countries that produce data that they don't all have, we could make some great progress in trying   to see what is going on But we continue to work on this problem    I think that would be saying that they are misjudging, as it were, how   much growth they could in fact experience and still not get inflationary pressures     That is true I certainly--and many others--have challenged our   European counterparts not to be held hostage to the numbers from the past and to be open to the   concept that their economies could grow more rapidly and not encounter inflationary outcomes   that would be unacceptable at some point  Then along came the oil price increase and the     6/26-27/01 51   weakness in the euro, so that perhaps has clouded the opportunity for them to realize that their   economies actually could grow faster using information technology even if they use it less   completely and less successfully than the United States  So in some sense the jury is still out  If   it turns out that Europe experiences some acceleration in its growth five or six years later than   this country did, part of it will probably be the result of the timing issues  But it’s certainly not   the case that observed inflation is surprisingly lower anywhere in Europe  So the Europeans have   not reached a point where they believe in the capability of their own economies to grow more   rapidly without inflation     Your first international chart reviews developments in the  foreign exchange value of the dollar and compares interest rate and stock price  movements in the euro area and Japan with those in the United States  Despite the  slowing of US output growth that has become apparent since January and the  downward revisions to prospective earnings for US firms, the dollar has  appreciated over the past six months against the euro, the blue line in the top left  panel, and the yen, the red line On balance, the staff’s index of the dollar in terms  of the other major industrial country currencies, the black line, has risen nearly 7  percent since early January No doubt part of the explanation of this strength lies in  the more negative near-term outlook for growth abroad that has emerged over this  same period, to which I will return shortly  But dollar appreciation suggests  investors continue to see risk-adjusted returns available on US investments as  fundamentally more attractive than opportunities abroad            6/26-27/01 60   Long-term interest rates, in the top right panel, have risen on balance in the  United States and Germany since the start of the year but have moved down  somewhat in Japan  Three-month rates, the middle left panel, are down in all three  areas, but by greatly differing amounts  Monetary policy has been eased only  slightly by the ECB, and short-term rates in the euro area have fallen by far less than  in the United States In March, the Bank of Japan effectively returned to its zero  interest rate policy, and three-month market rates retraced the rise that had occurred  in mid-2000  Current market expectations of policy moves as captured by  Eurocurrency futures rates are shown to the right  In comparison with dollar rates,  the euro curve, the blue line, looks for somewhat more reduction over the rest of this  year followed by a similar-sized tightening next year rather than a rapid return to  significantly higher rates Yen rates suggest that markets see the Bank of Japan  maintaining its current easy stance for some time     Stock prices are presented in the bottom two panels  Equity prices have  continued to move in broadly similar patterns this year, although high-tech stocks  have generally been hit harder in the United States and Europe than in Japan   Recent trade developments, the subject of your next chart, reflect the economic  weakness abroad and at home  Exports of goods, rows 1 through 6 in the upper left  panel, declined in nominal terms in the first quarter and again in April as did  imports of goods, lines 9 through 15  Declines were pronounced in the auto sector  (lines 4 and 13) in the first quarter  Both imports and exports of computers and  semiconductors have dropped so far this year  In April, other items within capital  goods were also weak, especially on the import side  The panels to the right  indicate that exports have decreased to all of the regions shown except western  Europe   We continue to look for oil prices, shown in the lower left, to move down  gradually over the forecast period, in line with futures prices, as increases in non- OPEC supply satisfy demand  We also again expect the appreciation of the dollar to  end, as shown in the right panel, but for the dollar to remain strong in real terms  over the forecast period   Our outlook for real GDP growth abroad is summarized at the top of your next  chart Economic expansion in the rest of the world clearly slowed sharply on  average in the first quarter and remains weak currently in most areas  In assessing  the prospects for a rebound in foreign activity over the forecast period, we had to  take into account spillovers from the projected strengthening of US activity,  expected developments in the global high-tech industry, and domestic factors,  including macroeconomic policy responses, in key foreign economies  Overall, we  look for real output growth abroad to accelerate, with average foreign growth  reaching about  3-1/2 percent in 2002, in line with the rebound projected in US  real output growth We expect stronger growth next year in each of the three major     6/26-27/01 61   regions, shown in the panel to the right, but we do not expect a return to the rates  observed last year   In Latin America, US economic developments are especially important for  Mexico; Argentina and Brazil are struggling with problems particular to the region   As you can see in the middle left panel, the dollar has depreciated relative to the  Mexican peso this year as capital inflows to Mexico have held firm in the context of  progress on reforms and the tight stance of policy by the Bank of Mexico  In  contrast, the dollar has appreciated sharply recently in terms of the Brazilian real as  domestic energy and political problems and financial market spillovers from  Argentina have weighed on that currency  Brazilian monetary policy has been  tightened in response to the inflation risks posed by the fall in the currency  Brady  bond spreads, shown to the right, reflect the recent stresses in Argentina, where  spreads rose rapidly until late April The success of the Argentine debt exchange  initiative alleviated near-term financing concerns, and markets reacted positively  with lower spreads  However, the latest policy moves in Argentina to tax imports  and subsidize exports have heightened uncertainty again and raised questions about  policies going forward   Industrial production, in the bottom left panel, has declined through April this  year in both Mexico and Brazil as demand has softened  For Mexico, the reduction  in US demand for its exports and the retrenchment in the first quarter of the North  American auto sector have been particularly important in explaining the drop in  industrial production In Argentina, production has recovered recently from  declines in 2000 but remains below its 1998 peak   As reported to the right, we are projecting that recovery will be strongest in  Mexico; the projected US upturn and some easing of monetary conditions by the  Bank of Mexico will provide the stimulus for stronger growth  In Brazil and  Argentina, we have forecast some increase in growth  That outlook assumes that  financial stresses will continue but not aggregate to the point of triggering a discrete  break in access to funding at acceptable terms by either country  However, the debt  profiles in both countries pose risks that could threaten the return to higher growth   Among the Asian emerging market economies, the subject of your next chart,  recent experience has differed, depending in part on each economy’s dependence on  the high-tech sector As can be seen in the top left, the dollar has risen with respect  to many of the Asian currencies over the past six months, although the Korean won  has since retraced some of its depreciation  As can be seen on the right, dollar- denominated yield spreads have been stable in 2001 for Korea and the Philippines   In Thailand, spreads have widened recently owing to changes in market  expectations about the direction of policy   The middle panel compares an aggregate of industrial production in five of the  Asian emerging market economies to worldwide semiconductor shipments, which  have clearly been an important determinant of industrial output in these countries     6/26-27/01 62   since 1996 The sharp downturn in semiconductor shipments in late 2000 was a  common factor undermining their economic growth  This is not surprising given the  large weights shown in the table in the bottom left for the high-tech sector more  broadly in their industrial production indexes and the shares of high-tech goods in  their total exports  In light of this dependence, revival of economic growth in these  economies would seem to hinge on stabilization in the global high-tech sector   The staff’s projections for this region are shown in the box to the right   Reported output growth in China has not fallen with the general global slowdown,  and we see steady growth over the forecast period, supported by government  expenditure In Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore, growth dropped sharply in the first  half of this year, and we look for moderate recovery going forward  The Korean  economy is larger and more diversified than the others in the “high-tech” group, and  its recovery may be somewhat less dependent on developments in those industries   The slowdown has been acute in Hong Kong, where the drop in global trade resulted  in sluggish activity in recent quarters Recovery elsewhere in the region, along with  lower real interest rates, should benefit Hong Kong    Your next chart reviews current conditions in the industrial countries and  summarizes our outlook Industrial production, shown in the top left, has been  moving down in each of the regions shown from peaks reached in mid- to late 2000   The declines for Japan are severe whereas in both the euro area and Canada  domestic factors have offset to some extent the decreases in demand hitting those  economies from abroad  Canada is closely integrated with the US economy,  including in particular the auto and high-tech sectors; but Canadian domestic  demand has proven to be somewhat resilient so far, boosted by monetary and fiscal  easing and spending in the energy sector In the euro area, the global slowdown has  had a visible impact only in the most recent data as export growth has slowed   Business confidence, shown to the right, has shifted down in all three regions,  however, raising concerns about further cutbacks in investment spending     Employment gains in Canada and the euro area, the middle left panel, have  been important to date in supporting growth of income and consumption  Consumer  confidence had been fairly steady at a high level, but the latest observations suggest  some erosion  In Japan, employment has given back the increases recorded in 2000   Consumer confidence now appears to be dropping as evidence mounts that the  economy is slipping backward again       Our forecast, reported in the bottom panels, reflects the fact that we remain  quite pessimistic about recovery of real GDP growth in Japan over the forecast  period Both real GDP (line 2 on the left) and domestic demand (line 1 on the right)  should decline further in the second half of this year as fiscal stimulus runs out and  private investment continues to drop back from the high level reached at the end of  last year Next year, a return to some positive growth in private investment and  weak consumption growth should result in expansion of activity  The policy agenda  just announced by the government does stress some reforms that have the potential     6/26-27/01 63   to contribute to reviving the economy over time  But it remains uncertain whether  Prime Minister Koizumi will be able to implement these reforms aggressively and  whether they will, in the short run, cause additional weakening in economic activity  Our forecast assumes no dramatic effect from the reforms in either direction through  next year   In the euro area we look for the decline in oil prices and for fiscal stimulus  already in place to support household income and spending later this year and next   Our forecast for Canada depends more directly on the rebound in the US economy  and improvement in the high-tech sector, but nevertheless is largely driven by the  projected strength in domestic demand    The external sector of the US economy is the subject of your final  international chart The deep drop in core export growth, the red bars at the top left,  can be explained in contribution terms by the slump in global economic activity  (represented by the sum of the blue and yellow bars) and by the strength in the  dollar (reflected in the green bars)  We expect recovery in activity abroad to boost  export growth somewhat next year  Core import growth, the red bars in the middle  panel, is expected to be even less this year than what would be implied by low US  GDP growth (in blue) plus relative price effects (the green bars)  This outlook  reflects import growth to date this year, which has been negative, whereas US GDP  growth has remained positive  Imports of capital goods have been especially weak   The turnaround in US real GDP should boost growth of core imports next year to  about 6 percent The contribution of export growth to GDP, shown on the right,  should return to being positive in the second half of this year and increase somewhat  next year We expect the contribution of imports to return to being negative and  also to become greater in magnitude next year, by more than that of exports   Growth of total real exports, line 1 of the middle left panel, is projected to be  sharply reduced this year and to rise next year by more than that of core goods (line  4) as exports of semiconductors and computers rebound  Similarly, growth of total  real imports (line 1 to the right) is projected to rebound strongly next year   The slowdown in US activity has resulted in a pause in the deterioration of the  US current account balance, shown in the bottom left  With stronger US growth  next year, the current account balance should return to its downward trend  A  snapshot of US capital flows is presented in the right panel  Purchases by private  foreign investors of US securities other than Treasuries continue to be extremely  high Foreign direct investment in US assets diminished noticeably in the first  quarter, and US direct investment abroad also fell   Dave Stockton will now complete our presentation   MRSTOCKTON The final chart displays your projections for 2001 and 2002   The central tendency of your projections for the growth of real GDP in 2001 has     6/26-27/01 64   been revised down from the forecasts made at the time of the February meeting  At  the same time, the central tendency of your PCE inflation projections has edged up   For 2002, growth of real GDP is expected to pick up, while inflation is  projected to run close to the pace expected for this year   Mr Chairman, that completes our presentation    Yes, the scale is making that relationship look good    To be honest, I don't know Let me just make sure that what we’ve   plotted there is understood; it's the whole industrial production index of the Asian semiconductor   producer countries that is being averaged    Right, but it’s of their total industrial production not just their   semiconductor production    The IP of Asian countries that produce semiconductors is how you   should read that        6/26-27/01 66    Well, we’ve looked at the numbers a bit  We don't have any analysis   that would enable us to say that these tax rebates will be spent differently than other consumption   dollars are spent But we did look at the historical track of imports as a percent of consumption     6/26-27/01 71   and it has been rising It's not possible to calculate it precisely because the way the imports are   reported there are capital goods, there are consumer goods, and autos is a separate category    Autos generally are some of each, so who knows?  Putting imports of goods in the numerator and   consumption of goods in the denominator produces a ratio of 10, 11, 12 percent or something like   that and it has been rising over time  That is one step in the direction of answering the question    That's excluding the autos completely, I think, and it would be a little more if one tried to make   some allowance for that by putting in some autos     That one I missed  I've been reading many in the last two days     There's a cadre of people within Japan who are arguing that there is a   sequencing issue--recovery and reform or reform and recovery  There are reasonable people--and   I consider Krugman and Sachs on some days to be reasonable--on the side that says recovery and   then reform  The problem with that argument, of course, is that to some extent that is the history   of the past 12 years, and look where it has gotten them     It hasn't worked yet anyway, but the 13th year might be the charm!     Well, there’s some possibility of that  The other concern is that it   doesn't necessarily answer your question about whether the patient can tolerate the medicine  It   does not mean that if they aggressively undertake reform that the patient won't die, in the sense of   having some significant negative and socially disruptive sequence of economic events beset   them  At this point it's almost an article of faith between these two camps as to what's important    Caught in the middle, of course, is the Bank of Japan; it may have one last arrow in its quiver and   it’s called “quantitative easing,” which means different things to different people  BOJ officials   are waiting to shoot that arrow at the point when they think it is most needed and will do the most   good So they are saying do the reforms and if the patient starts to get sicker before he starts to     6/26-27/01 77   get well, we will step in and do what we can Others are saying no, use this device now to get the   economy stronger so it can withstand the physical therapy a little better  Again, I think it's very   hard to be certain, ex ante, which of those arguments is better founded  But the history of the last   12 years suggests that normal recovery steps aren't going to buy them anything  "
6711,2001-10-02,"  In trying to come to grips with the implications  of recent events for the forecast, we were confident that we knew in  which direction to revise foreign growth as a result of information  learned since the August Greenbook down But it was much less clear  to us how to assess the magnitude of that revision for individual foreign  countries and for foreign growth on average   Our downward revision to the forecast for foreign growth has  three components  (1) incorporation of the news about economic  activity in the second quarter and some indicators for July and August  that have become available since the August forecast was completed;  (2) assessment of the implications for foreign economies of the new  outlook for the United States; and (3) consideration of the extent to  which the events of September 11, through asset prices, confidence  factors, and key global prices and industries, will influence real output  growth abroad in addition to the direct impact transmitted by US  demand for imports from the rest of the world  The difficulties we  confronted stemmed from our lack of information about real economic  activity in the days since September 11 and the inherent uncertainty of  prospective effects in the rest of the world as foreign consumers and  business firms react to events that, at least so far, have occurred within  the United States   As we reported in the Greenbook, the economic data that had  become available in recent weeks suggested a more depressed global  economy than we had expected  This was particularly the case for the  emerging Asian economies  There, the news was most negative for  those whose exports of high-tech products were linked to investment  spending in the United States and in other industrial countries   However, there were disappointing data for other countries, including  such industrial countries as Canada and Japan  Incorporation of this  information accounts for a significant share of our downward revision  to foreign growth   As has been evident in the global slowdown to date, a  substantially weaker outlook for US real GDP has clear implications,  in the same direction, for real output growth abroad  Those effects are  largest for our principal trading partners, such as Canada and Mexico      10/2/01 20   However, for other regions of the globe, such as Europe, the  consequences of second and third round effects through multilateral  trading relationships are far from negligible  Should we be further  surprised by developments in the US economy, either positively or  negatively, there would be a significant reinforcement of that surprise  as output in foreign economies responded to the changed demand from  the United States   My third category of factors includes the host of reactions within  the foreign countries and in global markets to the events of September  11 We have seen net declines in stock markets abroad as large as 18  percent Our research and that of others suggest that the effect on  consumption of such changes in wealth will not be as large abroad as in  the United States, but the reaction will be significant  Similarly, we  expect that confidence of consumers and businesses will be impaired by  varying degrees across the rest of the world  We have a few bits of  partial information from surveys that included responses after  September 11 that confirm substantial drops in confidence  The latest  Japanese Tankan survey, released on Monday, fell more than expected  to its lowest level since June 1999 for the overall index  At this point,  we can only guess how widespread the reaction of confidence abroad  will be, how long it will persist, and how much it will contribute to  lessening domestic demand in foreign countries      We also have incorporated into this forecast available information  from global markets  With respect to oil prices, the spot price of WTI  has moved down, on balance, more than 15 percent since September 10,  and futures prices call for it to move down slightly further  Market  participants seem to be anticipating that reduced global demand for oil  will be met by only limited supply cuts by OPEC  The recent  international meeting of oil producers ended with no agreed reductions  in production quotas despite the fact that spot prices were below the  target range for OPEC’s basket   The global market for high-tech products in general, and  semiconductors in particular, is an important element behind our  projections for the emerging Asian economies  Weakness in this sector  underlies the significantly greater-than-expected declines in output that  were recorded in the second quarter in Malaysia, Singapore, and  Taiwan We have little hard information about inventories or  production beyond August Our projection that output in the region  will recover next year depends upon some improvement in this sector   We asked ourselves in which foreign countries scope might exist  for additional policy response to the further downward pressure on  demand  Among the industrial countries, monetary policy has been     10/2/01 21   broadly eased during the first half of this year, and eight major foreign  central banks cut rates further following your action on September 17   Our forecast assumes that additional easing moves will be taken in  Europe and Canada by year-end Some emerging market central banks  had been easing as well, as the global economy slowed and demand  weakened within their economies  However, we expect that external  financing pressures will likely intensify, in particular for Latin  American countries with external deficits, making it less likely that  monetary easing will be enacted there    Within Europe and in Canada, fiscal policy should be somewhat  supportive of growth in 2002 as tax revenues fall and deficits widen; we  do not expect significant discretionary easing measures  In Japan,  however, the long-standing problems within that economy and the  agenda of the Koizumi government to implement fiscal reform are  expected to result in moderate fiscal contraction during next year  Most  emerging market economies have little scope to increase expenditures  or cut taxes One important exception is China, where continued  government spending is expected to support growth during the second  half of this year and next year Other East Asian developing countries  announced some fiscal stimulus measures earlier this year   The downside risks to this forecast are distressingly clear  The hit  to confidence from the terrorist attacks, coming at a time when output  abroad was already decelerating, could set off a mutually reinforcing  cycle of production and employment cuts, downward earnings  revisions, lower asset prices, and additional drops in confidence  Our  expectation of a rebound next year is based primarily on the projected  turnaround in the United States, recognition that monetary stimulus has  been implemented in the major countries, and our judgment that  inventory adjustments abroad should be nearing completion by then   There is no evidence as yet on which to base resolution of the timing  and pace of recovery   That said, we may be too close to the events of September 11 to  judge how countries more distant from those events will respond  We  were aggressive in our reaction to the economic data and world news  since the August Greenbook It is possible that the effects of the attacks  on growth abroad will be even more muted in comparison to that in the  United States than we have projected  The possibility of such an  outcome constitutes upside risk to our forecast                 Well, to be honest I did include them in the eight because   they cut what they call the overnight discount rate, which is a kind of Lombard rate    Technically it’s an official lending rate of the Bank of Japan and they reduced it, so I said   okay, they are one of my eight  And I think they intended, both from the timing of the   announcement and the way they expressed it, to indicate that they were going to do what   they could along with their brother central banks to weather the storm of this particular   financial crisis They wanted to be supportive, in the sense of aiding short-term liquidity   and market functioning and so forth in the immediate aftermath of the attacks   I think this period is somewhat of a crossroads for them  I interpret the   intervention that they did and their decision to let the reserves stay in the system as an   opening Perhaps they are thinking of deliberately using transactions in the exchange   markets--a concept they had resisted for some time--as opposed to operations in the   domestic money markets as a way of getting more liquidity out there  The combination   of circumstances created an appropriate meeting of the minds between the Ministry of   Finance and the Bank of Japan with regard to undertaking these transactions  They   responded in the way we’ve all urged them to respond  I took that to be a fairly positive        10/2/01 25   sign It remains to be seen what they will do going forward, because at least today, for   example, the yen has softened and has not moved up from its low  It’s possible that a lot   of the pressure on the yen has had to do with the end of their fiscal half-year on   September 30th When that is taken out of the picture, I think it remains a completely   open question as to whether the Bank of Japan will revert to its previous practice and say,   “Well, that approach was fine then but it’s not appropriate right now”  I am very   pessimistic that this is a truly long-lasting change in their approach, but I think what they   did in the weeks since September 11th was in the right direction and they could surprise   us They could be more aggressive than they’ve given signs of so far     Prior to September 11th, I think the people in the   International Division who closely watch Japan were trying to talk themselves into being   slightly more optimistic about Japan than we had been for a while, and we’ve been rather   pessimistic all along  We were trying to see some energy in the Koizumi reform,   although what the government has done since the upper house election in July     10/2/01 26   disappointed us because instead of running with the reform and building on it they   seemed to be backing off and hemming and hawing  But there were some shreds of signs   of things possibly not getting worse at least  It’s hard to say whether September 11th will   really change that for them  There are no direct implications for Japan except for the loss   in export potential from the rest of the world and certainly from the United States  I think   they’re so bound up in their own problems that I don’t have a sense--or they weren’t able   to tell us is a better way to put it--of whether the Tankan survey was heavily influenced   by the attacks or not A significant portion of the survey responses were received by the   agency after September 11th, but they made no effort and really had no way to tell how   many had been filled out after September 11th I think we are at risk of that economy   remaining moribund--sitting there more or less doing nothing for quite some time--and   largely for political reasons Now, whether that would spark a real political overturn in   Japan I am certainly not the person to say  Obviously, in most other countries it would   have happened long ago  So it just defies my ability to judge  Personally, I had thought   Koizumi might make a difference but I think circumstances are conspiring against that at   the present time    "
6734,2001-11-06," We revised down our forecast for growth of real  output abroad once again in this Greenbook In part, we were reacting to the  information received over the intermeeting period about production and spending  in foreign economies  In part, we were recognizing that more pronounced  weakness in the US economy in the very near term implied more of the same  for many of our trading partners  We now estimate that real GDP contracted at  an annual rate of about 1/2 percent during the third quarter and expect that a  similar outcome will be recorded for the current quarter  This projection of  prolonged contraction in our average measure of foreign real output reflects  widespread negative growth among the developing countries during the second  half of this year  Among the industrial countries, recession in Japan is ongoing  while the picture elsewhere is mixed Real output appears to have turned down  in Canada, to have become stagnant, at best, in the euro area, but to have  continued to show a bit of resilience in the United Kingdom   In constructing this forecast, we struggled with the need to specify the  intensity and duration of the downturn abroad  The Greenbook baseline paints a  picture of a global economy that is sluggish in the first half of next year and has  clearly begun to rebound by the second half  Although we can identify the  factors that we think will lie behind this path, we would be the first to admit that     11/6/01 14   picking the turning point requires a crystal ball rather than an economic model   In addition, news since the Greenbook forecast was finalized reinforces the  downside risks to the baseline   Our forecast calls for improvement in the developing countries to be  evident early in the new year  For many Asian emerging market economies, this  outcome will depend importantly on an end to the deterioration in the demand  for high-tech goods and the beginnings of a recovery in production in that sector   It will depend as well on continued robust expansion in China, one of the few  countries or regions in the global economy that has not shared in the widespread  slowdown Stability in global oil prices at recent lower levels will help, along  with supportive macroeconomic policy in some of these countries   The widespread recovery of foreign activity during 2002 depends  critically on the rebound that is projected for the United States  Simply put, we  are counting on the range of direct and indirect linkages--through which the  slowing of US growth over the past year imparted downward pressure on the  rest of the world--to transmit positive spillovers  Strengthening of the US  economy will boost confidence, support asset prices, stimulate demand for  exports from our trading partners to the United States, and contribute to a  recovery in investment spending  For the major industrial countries, domestic  policy stimulus of varying amounts is in the pipeline  Since their respective  peaks, official lending rates to date have been lowered 300 basis points in  Canada, 150 basis points in the United Kingdom, and 100 basis points in the euro  area We are expecting another 25 basis points soon by each of these three  central banks, perhaps later this week in some cases, and a further 25 basis points  by the ECB sometime in the first half of 2002  Fiscal stimulus was injected  during 2001 in Canada, the United Kingdom, and several of the major euro-area  countries We expect some additional expansionary measures during 2002 in  Canada and the United Kingdom, where surpluses allow more room for  maneuver        Two spots in the global economy--Japan and Argentina--are especially  troubled by problems that are largely, but not entirely, domestic  The latest  releases of economic indicators paint a bleak picture for real economic activity in  Japan And we see little in the prospects for either monetary or fiscal policy that  could spark a turnaround in spending  The supplementary budget that now  seems on track for passage in the Diet soon will provide a partial offset to what  would otherwise be a large contractionary impulse from fiscal policy  But we do  not see the measures now planned as up to the task of preventing further declines  in real GDP during the first half of 2002 By the second half of next year, we  have projected an anemic return to positive growth as private investment  spending stops falling and stabilizes and as exports swing from declining to  increasing Both of these developments depend importantly on a general  recovery in the global economy, including in the high-tech sector     11/6/01 15   The situation in Argentina is evolving as we speak The chaotic  events of last week have brought into the open the prospect of a sovereign debt  restructuring that now seems inevitable  The scope and terms of such a  restructuring are slowly being proposed  Spreads on Argentine dollar- denominated sovereign debt spiked above 2500 basis points yesterday, as the  market price of the widely watched bond that matures in 2008 fell to nearly 40  cents on the dollar Deposit outflows from Argentine banks, where pesos and  dollars still exchange one for one, have risen over the past week or so and  shipments of dollar currency from US banks to Argentine counterparts have  again jumped    Two “events” appeared to accelerate the downward spiral of the  ongoing Argentine crisis last week  One was the apparent failure of the de la  Rua government to reach agreement with key provincial governors over the  dispute about revenue sharing between the provinces and the federal  government  Some compromise is needed in order for the government to  achieve its stated fiscal objectives  A second bit of “news” was the statement by  an IMF official during a press conference that acceleration of the planned  December disbursements of IMF funds to Argentina was not being considered,  thus quashing widespread expectations that those funds would be distributed  shortly Late in the week, Argentine officials apparently felt the need to  announce something, so President de la Rua made a statement on Argentine  television that included some minor reforms of the tax and pension systems  aimed at stimulating the economy  He also called for a debt exchange, with the  intent of reducing interest costs on the debt, particularly in the near term, but as  of now there is no proposal for additional funds from the IMF or other sources to  support an “orderly” exchange  The government’s explicit position to date is  that there will be no change in the current exchange rate regime     In our Greenbook forecast, we have projected that real GDP will  decline sharply in Argentina during 2002 and then be about flat on balance over  2003 While the actual path will no doubt differ from this, a substantial decline  in output in Argentina is unavoidable over the forecast period  Our current  thinking is that negative spillovers to real output growth of other countries in the  region will be limited  This round of problems in Argentina has been unfolding  for about a year, and financial market developments support the view that market  participants do distinguish both Brazil and Mexico from Argentina  Spreads for  Brazil remain around 1100, with those for Mexico much lower, and both the  Brazilian real and the Mexican peso have appreciated on balance over the  intermeeting period  Thus, despite the imponderables of the Argentine situation,  we see average output growth in Latin America turning positive next year and  strengthening further in 2003, similar to the pattern projected for the Asian  emerging market economies and the foreign industrial countries    Pardon me, but it’s a measurement issue, isn’t it?  The GDP doesn’t   measure increased security; it doesn’t give better security a positive weight  Is there a way to get the   word “measurement” in here?   SPEAKER(?)  Measured productivity  "

6785,2002-01-29," The staff’s outlook for economic activity in the rest of the world  is for a rebound to moderate growth this year, which strengthens somewhat next year   Although we already see tentative signs of positive developments in many regions,  the projected recovery depends importantly on the projected acceleration in US real  GDP just discussed by David and Larry  The global economy does contain weak  spots, notably Japan and Argentina, where economic developments could be  dramatically worse than in our baseline during the forecast period  I will discuss the  problems in those countries shortly  However, our judgment is that those risks are  unlikely to have a major effect on the US economy during the forecast period   Your first international chart reports recent developments in financial markets   The foreign exchange value of the dollar, shown in the top left panel, has risen further  over the past several months  The staff index of major currencies—the black line—  has been touching sixteen-year highs in recent days  The dollar is now significantly              January 29-30, 2002 Page 51 of 194  stronger against the yen—the red line—than at the time of your last chart show, amid  more news that the Japanese economy continues to falter and ongoing public  exchanges about official views on the yen-dollar exchange rate  The dollar has  recently moved up against the euro but is still below the latest peak reached at mid­ 2001 The panel at the right contains futures quotes on three-month interest rates for  this year and next taken from eurocurrency markets  These curves reflect market  expectations that dollar interest rates will rise more sharply over the forecast period  than will euro rates, in line with general anticipation of a relatively stronger rebound  in US real output growth  As is evident from the middle panels, both dollar and euro  short-term market interest rates have fallen over the past six months, but the decline  in euro rates is markedly less than that in dollar rates  This reflects the more- aggressive easing of policy done by the Committee relative to that done by the ECB   The net changes in both US and German long-term rates over the same interval have  been quite limited, and those rates have moved in similar ways for some time  In  contrast, Japanese short-term rates have remained essentially at zero, and Japanese  long-term rates are still low but are up very slightly from mid-2001  Stock prices in  all three regions, shown at the bottom left, have moved down on balance since last  June US and European stock prices have tracked closely, whereas Japanese stock  prices have moved down to near-record lows for the period since the bubble of the  late 1980s At the right are analysts’ expected earnings from I/B/E/S for the S&P 500  companies and from Morgan Stanley’s euro area index  As you can see, those  earnings have been steadily revised down since mid-2001, with the European decline  exceeding that for the S&P    In your next chart the top panels show trade data by region, with the average for  October and November represented by the dot  Note that the scales are equivalent but  shifted; imports by region uniformly exceed exports by region  As a consequence of  the slowdown in activity, both here and abroad, exports and imports actually declined  during 2001 Decreases in exports came earliest in Canada and latest in Europe,  reflecting the onset and extent of slowdowns in those regions  Exports to developing  Asia fell sharply, as those economies were particularly hard hit by the global collapse  in the high-tech sector  The decline in imports primarily reflects developments in the  US economy Signs in the most recent data of an increase in our imports from  developing Asia suggest that a turnaround may have started in semiconductors and  high-tech more broadly   Our outlook for the price of oil is presented in the middle left panel  The spot  price for West Texas intermediate has fallen significantly since the June chart show  and more than the futures markets at that time—and our forecast—had expected   This retracing of much of the earlier run-up in oil prices is a major factor supporting  our view that output will accelerate over the forecast period in most regions of the  global economy  Embedded in our forecast is the projection that oil prices will move  up only slightly from current levels, as now anticipated by the futures market  The  prices of imported goods other than oil, computers, and semiconductors—termed core  goods—are shown to the right Those prices dipped during the first three quarters of  2001, as goods prices fell broadly, particularly prices of industrial supplies  Going                 January 29-30, 2002 Page 52 of 194  forward, as prices of industrial supplies cease falling, the index for core goods prices  should stabilize and then rise at a low rate    The bottom panels show the analysis behind our outlook for a return to moderate  growth in exports and to more-vigorous expansion of imports  Core exports—the red  bars on the left—should recover from a sharp decline last year; we expect them to be  flat this year and then to grow more than 4 percent next year  The blue bars represent  the portion of core export growth attributable to foreign GDP growth, and the yellow  bars capture an additional cyclical effect from growth that improves forecasting  accuracy in our model  Together, these variables only partly explain the weakness of  exports in 2001  Going forward, they account for much of the acceleration we are  expecting The lagged effects of the strong dollar, reflected in the green bars that  measure the contribution of relative prices, act as a drag on exports throughout the  interval Because we expect that some of the unexplained weakness in 2001 will be  reversed this year and next, our judgmental forecast calls for exports to recover a bit  more than the sum of the foreign growth and relative prices would predict  A similar  breakdown is shown for imports of core goods  In 2001, core imports declined  despite flat US GDP and dollar strength that would be expected to impart a positive  impetus to imports  Over the forecast period, core import growth should recover  strongly, with US GDP accounting for about half that growth this year and more  next year Lagged effects of the strong dollar boost imports in 2002, but much less so  in 2003 as our forecast calls for the dollar to stabilize at its current elevated level  As  with exports, our judgmental forecast is a bit stronger than the model output  The  panel on the right shows the arithmetic contributions of imports and exports of total  goods and services to US GDP growth In 2001, the decline in exports subtracted  from output growth while that in imports contributed positively  For this year and  next, we expect to see the more normal positive contribution from exports as they rise  through 2003 The negative contribution of imports is expected to be consistently  larger in magnitude during both years   The outlook for the global economy that lies behind our projection for exports is  reported on your following chart The top left panel compares real GDP growth in  the United States with average growth in the rest of the world The United States  essentially led the world slowdown in 2001, and it is the projected recovery in US  growth that lies behind much of the rebound shown for foreign growth Both this  year and next, we expect that US growth will exceed the average of our trading  partners The panel to the right shows that the swing from declines this year to  growth next year is expected to be largest for the Asian developing countries  Our  baseline forecast is for a more muted recovery on average in Latin America and in the  industrial countries Recent production data for Canada, Germany, and Japan are  shown in the middle left  The downshift of production in Japan is clearly evident   Some retrenchment also occurred in Canada and Germany, with industrial production  and GDP contracting during 2001   The panel at the right contains our forecast for real GDP growth over the forecast  period for the industrial countries  We look for positive but low growth in the euro                      January 29-30, 2002 Page 53 of 194  area early in 2002 and then an acceleration of output later this year and next  The  pattern is similar for Canada and the United Kingdom, but growth is judged to be  stronger in the near term for both these countries and to accelerate to higher growth  rates in Canada, largely as a consequence of its close ties to the US economy  Japan  is the exception With current indicators suggesting further deterioration for some  time, we have output declining further during this year, stabilizing toward the end of  the year, and then growing weakly in 2003   Many of the emerging-market economies of Asia, the subject of the bottom  panels, depended heavily on exports of high-tech goods to support the strong pace of  economic expansion they recorded during 1999 and early 2000  As can be seen from  the example of Singapore, exports for these countries dropped sharply starting in late  2000, and real output contracted during 2001 Even in Korea, where the economy is  larger and more diversified than in most other Asian economies, the fall in exports  was a major factor in the downturn last year  Mainland China experienced a pause in  the rapid export growth that had been occurring; however, expanded domestic  spending, including government expenditures, sustained output growth around  7 percent despite the slowdown in the global economy  Looking forward, we see a  rebound in activity in the region as the high-tech sector resumes growing and as  export demand recovers more broadly   Your next chart highlights the problems currently confronting Japan and the scope  for macroeconomic policy to address those problems  As is evident in the red bars in  the top left panel, the temporary buoyancy in real GDP in 2000 gave way to  contraction in 2001 The contribution of domestic demand, shown by the blue bars,  had been the source of strength in 2000; private investment in the high-tech sector  was a major part of that strength  The global bust in high-tech and some overhang of  capital in that sector and more generally became a source of contraction for output in  2001 With corporate profits sliding and unemployment on the rise, we see even  lower investment and personal consumption this year, but we expect that by 2003  domestic demand will expand enough to support low but positive growth with a small  boost from net exports  Along with the deepening of the output gap this year and  next, we expect that deflation of consumer prices, shown to the right, will continue  throughout the forecast period   The middle panels provide a snapshot of the scope for macroeconomic policy to  address the deflationary trap ensnaring the economy  Money market interest rates are  widely expected to remain at zero  The debate over monetary policy has shifted to  the Bank of Japan’s options for providing more liquidity  Over the past year, the BOJ  has stepped up its target range for current balances held on its books by financial  institutions and others From totals of 5 trillion to 6 trillion yen during much of 2001,  the BOJ has moved to maintaining these deposits at around 15 trillion yen  What  remains unclear is the extent to which this additional liquidity, by itself, will stimulate  aggregate demand  Fiscal policy, shown to the right, confronts the problems of past  high debt issuance and unfavorable demographic developments that are now close at  hand As a consequence, Prime Minister Koizumi has pledged to limit issuance of              January 29-30, 2002 Page 54 of 194  JGBs this year Fiscal policy, which had recently been about neutral, is therefore  likely to be slightly contractionary this year and next   The bottom panels provide some information on the unrelenting problems  besetting the financial sector  Bank credit, on the left, has contracted for the past  three years  Total corporate bankruptcies, the middle panel, have been rising;  recognition and resolution of the many bankrupt firms that lie behind the banks’  nonperforming loans (NPLs) over time will prove to be beneficial; but in the near  term, NPLs are likely to rise further The bars on the right show the steady  downgrading by Moody’s of ratings of Japan’s major banks in terms of their financial  strength The problems of the financial sector and the country’s general  macroeconomic malaise are mutually reinforcing  Some bold policy moves on both  fronts at once are needed, but to date Mr Koizumi has not delivered on his campaign  promises to push the reform agenda  The Japanese economy has been moribund for  so many years, however, that unless it takes a very hard turn for the worse, it should  not prevent recovery in the global economy   Your final international chart focuses on the acute crisis now raging in Argentina  and the effects of those events on Brazil and Mexico  In early January, following  political upheaval and severe financial market pressures, Argentine officials ended  the one-to-one peg of the peso to the US dollar  As can be seen in the top left panel,  the floating rate for the peso immediately shot up to nearly two pesos per dollar, but  neither the Brazilian real nor the Mexican peso was significantly affected  At present,  the floating rate for the Argentine peso is being contained somewhat by illiquid  conditions within Argentine markets and by intervention by the authorities, so further  depreciation could well occur Argentine risk spreads are shown to the right  The  growing sense in late 2001 that the situation at that time could not be sustained  resulted in spreads of more than 5,000 basis points  Some changes in the way the  index is constructed since December and disruptions to trading during January make  precise comparison of the spread over recent weeks impossible; but spreads clearly  remain at extremely elevated levels  Our baseline forecast, shown in the middle left  panel, does not envision any significant recovery in Argentina during the forecast  period Nevertheless, given the projected recovery in the United States and the  limited contagion to date from the crisis, we expect a rebound to moderate growth in  Mexico by the second half of this year and some strengthening of activity in Brazil    The situation in Argentina is fraught with enormous risks for that country, as well  as the possibility that we may yet see more contagion effects elsewhere in Latin  America than have been evident so far  The panel at the right indicates the scope of  economic problems that need to be addressed within Argentina, in addition to the  resolution of its international debt obligations  These problems are severe and pose a  challenge to the political stability and institutions of Argentina  With respect to fiscal  matters, thorough reform of the tax system is needed, including particularly the area  of tax compliance  The fiscal relationship between the federal and provincial  governments needs to be restructured in order to enhance fiscal discipline  Excessive  public-sector employment, wages, and pensions must be corrected As a consequence                          January 29-30, 2002 Page 55 of 194  of the currency devaluation and the effective debt default by the government, the  banking system is at risk of insolvency  Proposals for distributing the burden of this  capital loss among depositors, borrowers, shareholders, and taxpayers are provoking  street violence, followed by frequent changes in regulations  A new exchange rate  regime and a monetary policy framework consistent with that regime need to be put  in place Concerns about protecting some elements of the economy from the effects  of that change are hampering establishment of sustainable policies that can prevent a  return to hyperinflation and other excesses of the past  The tensions raised by these  economic problems threaten to overwhelm the political system  We recognize this  risk but have not tried to quantify it in any way   The bottom panel presents some additional detail from the simulation reported in  the Greenbook in which contagion effects from the current situation in Argentina are  greater than we incorporated in the baseline  In this alternative, the risk premiums  associated with the currencies of Mexico, Brazil, Chile, and Venezuela are assumed  to rise sharply, putting downward pressure on their respective exchange rates  In  addition, this financial stress is assumed to depress domestic spending on  consumption and investment somewhat in South America, by a lesser amount in  Mexico, and slightly in developing Asia  As reported in the Greenbook, these  additional negative developments associated with the Argentine crisis would have a  minimal effect on US real GDP growth  For Mexico and Brazil, however, there  would be a substantial decline in real GDP this year from the direct and indirect  effects of such shocks   The negative effect on growth is augmented by our assumption that monetary  policy officials in these countries would seek to contain the inflationary consequences  of their falling currencies by raising short-term interest rates  As can be seen on the  right, inflation does rise in both countries, but the weakness in activity and prompt  policy response induce some reduction by next year in the extent to which inflation  exceeds that in the baseline forecast In the staff’s global model, real GDP in Mexico  and Brazil begins to recover strongly in 2003 as a result of the boost to exports from  the real depreciation of their respective currencies  We offer this simulation as a  possible scenario of what contagion from the Argentine crisis might entail in the  event the current benign situation proves to be too good to last  David will now  complete our presentation  "
6812,2002-03-19,"  If I may interject, Mr Chairman?  I would note that the one-year   forward rate yesterday was 48 pesos per dollar    There’s not enough economic activity going on in Argentina to know—   even in domestic trading much less anything that would involve the purchase of imported goods   and the reaction of wages or the pass-through or any of that  Ironically, the situation is so bad   that it may be that what they really should do is let the inflation rip because it would depreciate     March 19, 2002 Page 7 of 117  the real value of outstanding debts that they can’t pay  The stress of trying to protect value and   pay those debts underlies many of their political problems  I don’t know, frankly, anything to   suggest to them  If you sent me down there as the Czar of Argentina, I would not know how to   fix the present situation     The IMF task force that was there has gone home  They were subject   to immense scrutiny in the Argentine press  Even people on the street knew the names of those   on the IMF task force, which is something that is very unusual  The government in power now   continues to blame others for their problems  They blame past IMF policies; they blame foreign   lenders; they blame the foreign banks  They blame anybody but themselves  The public has lost   confidence in most institutions  It’s not clear whether they’ve lost confidence in the central   bank But the central bank is in a very difficult position because if they try now to keep the   inflation rate contained, then this device of basically wiping the slate clean and starting over by   just letting the inflation rip won’t happen  And the political struggle to fight over the crumbs that   are left will continue So in some respects, as outrageous as it may sound, it might be better if   the central bank just looked the other way for a while     Oh, it used to be It isn’t any more  By a stroke of the pen, they have   “pesofied” virtually everything They cannot do that to the debt they owe to foreigners because   foreigners basically will just say “no”     But anything that is circulating internally has been pesofied       This morning the trade data for January have just been released   These data show a deficit of $285 billion, somewhat wider than in December and  than we had incorporated in the Greenbook baseline  Compared with the revised  December data, exports of goods and services were about flat  Imports rose  somewhat, just about returning to their November level  When translated into real  terms, these data on balance do not suggest any significant change to the staff’s  outlook for growth in the first quarter, as the slightly lower real net exports than we  were expecting in the Greenbook might easily be offset by a small change in our  forecast for inventories   In line with the positive shift in the outlook for the US economy in the  Greenbook, our forecast for real GDP growth abroad has also been revised up,  particularly in the near term  Indeed, to a considerable extent, the more favorable  outlook for the rest of the world reflects the more buoyant attitude toward current and  prospective activity in the United States  Our optimism, however, is also grounded in  information we have recently received about developments in the economies of some  of our foreign trading partners plus our expectation that significant monetary ease  already in place abroad will stimulate those economies  A rebound in economic  activity has come first and most clearly to the emerging-market economies of Asia   This development appears to reflect the start of a turnaround in the global  semiconductor industry and the related electronics sector  Production data for the  fourth quarter and those indicators that we have in hand for the current quarter  confirm that strong gains have been made in those economies that are intensive                          March 19, 2002 Page 30 of 117  producers of high-tech goods  Exports should contribute importantly to sustained,  moderate growth in this region over the forecast period; but we look for domestic  demand to recover as well  Strong growth of real GDP is projected to continue in  China, supported by continued strength in domestic demand and positive  developments on the external front   For the major foreign industrial countries the picture is more mixed  We have  already been positively surprised by the strength of production in the fourth quarter in  Canada Of course, the Canadian economy should benefit substantially from the  projected US recovery; but we also expect that strong domestic sectors within that  economy and the lagged effects of 375 basis points of past monetary policy easing  there will be important factors in an acceleration of economic activity going forward   For the euro area, the fourth quarter on average was one of contraction in real GDP   Although there are signs of improved confidence and increasing production in some  countries, we remain cautious about the speed with which recovery will occur and so  have forecast a gradual return to growth at an annual rate of about 2½ percent in the  second half of this year and near 3 percent next year  A more robust global expansion  should be good for exports from the euro area, but recovery is likely to boost import  growth as well On balance, we look for domestic demand to grow slightly more  rapidly than output during this year and next   The Japanese economy is once again an exception to the pattern of growth that we  see for most of the global economy  To be sure, there have been some positive signs  of late Improved prospects for the rest of the world do imply a better outlook for  Japanese export industries, particularly those in the high-tech sector  And the serious  collapse of the financial system that some had feared as the end of the current fiscal  year approaches now seems unlikely  These developments appear to lie behind the  rather dramatic appreciation in some Japanese asset prices that has occurred in recent  weeks But worrisome offsetting factors remain  The banking system still has not  resolved its nonperforming loan problem, and its true capital structure is dangerously  weak The inspections now being conducted by the Financial Services Agency will  likely refocus attention on these problems once their results are released  Total  bankruptcies continue to rise Domestic demand and recent production indicators  show further contraction Accordingly, we have again written down a forecast of  further declines in GDP during most of this year and only weak growth thereafter  In  such an environment, deflation should persist throughout the forecast period in Japan   We have struggled to assess the risks now confronting our Latin American  trading partners  Our best judgment currently is that financial markets will continue  to distinguish among those countries, particularly in regarding Mexico as more  closely tied to the United States and Canada than to its Latin neighbors  We expect  that the projected recovery in US manufacturing will provide stimulus to the  Mexican economy and that we will see a moderately strong turnaround in that  economy this year  We also expect positive growth to return to Brazil, but the risks  there are greater and the ties to the US economy are weaker  For Argentina, we  have projected further sharp declines in output this quarter and for the subsequent                        March 19, 2002 Page 31 of 117  four quarters But it is impossible for us to have any confidence in that outlook as   Argentina’s problems are as much political as economic, and the resolution of those   problems is not yet in sight  Moreover, there are additional risks to political and   economic stability in other South American countries, such as Venezuela and   Colombia  The direct effects on the US economy of developments in South   America are not likely to be large, but a clear downside risk to our forecast is that   these problems might result in greater turmoil on international financial markets than   we now envisage I should add, however, that developments in global oil markets   could have substantial effects on the US economy, and oil prices have moved up   noticeably over the intermeeting period  Additional instability in Venezuela could   add to the forces putting upward pressure on oil prices    With the stronger outlook for the US recovery operating as the driving force  behind greater optimism about the global economy, it may seem surprising that in  recent days the dollar has come off its highs of late February  In part the explanation  is a stronger yen, which is due to some factors that are likely to prove transitory given  the unresolved problems in that economy  Indeed, yesterday we saw some retracing  by the yen But in part the move down in the dollar may also reflect some further  attention by market participants to the US external deficits and the controversy over  trade policy and the Administration’s position with respect to the “strong dollar”  policy With the dollar at a very high level and an expansionary cycle set to begin,  during which the United States is widely expected to grow more rapidly than our  trading partners for some time, the outlook is for widening US external deficits  At  some point, the rising mountain of debt created by those deficits may lessen the  appetite of global investors for dollar-denominated assets  The baseline combination  of stronger US growth and tightening by the FOMC suggests some upside risk to the  dollar that is offset in our minds by the possible reaction of investors to the return to  ever-widening US trade deficits  It is this thought that has led us to incorporate in  the forecast the projection of a stable exchange value for the dollar     It’s certainly true that outsourcing has become a much-discussed   phenomenon in Japan  And many of the foreign direct investment flows into Asia arise in Japan   because Japan is still running a sizable current account surplus  It has funds that need to be   invested, and that goes hand-in-hand with Japan’s strategy to do more of the manufacturing in   lower-cost places  So in some sense I think the answer to your question is “yes”  The Japanese   economy for some time has not reacted to its export sector the way it did, say, back in the 1970s    Many people would still argue that, given the condition of the Japanese economy, a falling yen   and a consequent easing of Japan’s deflation pressures, on the one hand, and a boost to its export   sector, on the other, constitute the only salvation that they can envision for the Japanese   economy  So I think it’s a question of degree Yes, it is perhaps less than it was some time ago         March 19, 2002 Page 34 of 117  But it’s still true that the export sector and investment in the export sector are what has to happen    in Japan to get the rest of the economy going  Therefore, I think many people would anticipate   that we will see strengthening abroad turn into the difference between further contraction versus   very slow growth—not a boom by any means but at least a difference of that much—in the   Japanese economy     True It’s certainly possible  But for example, the components that   we’ve written down behind the scene so to speak—which give us a forecast of very low growth   in 2003 rather than the contraction that we’ve projected for 2002—have to do with a combination   of inventories plus exports working in that direction to get the Japanese economy to stop   contracting    Germany is in the awkward position of being the weak link in the euro   area, which certainly changes the nature of the debate within Europe from that prevailing in the   final stages of the pre-EMU period  Both of those economies are in the throes of an election   cycle, which is certainly complicating events this year  The Germans are in the midst of a wage   round, which is getting a little ugly also, with threats of strikes and disagreements being made   public and so forth So on balance I still see the French economy as showing a bit more   buoyancy and vigor than the German economy  That had tended to be the case in 1999-2000    Oddly, the French economy was looking better than the German economy and showing more   flexibility, which is certainly something the French had not been viewed as possessing before    That’s still on balance true         March 19, 2002 Page 38 of 117  We just had a summit on the part of the EU that had been billed as the one in which   structural reform was supposed to be the key  The tone coming out at the end of that summit was   a sense of disappointment  Part of the explanation of that was this election cycle  Schröder, at   least based on views of colleagues that I see when I travel to Europe, is thought of as having   failed And the CDU is actually rising in the polls, which presents an interesting notion of what   might happen next in Germany     So on the whole, nothing terrible is happening in either country, but they’re not   succeeding in solving the problems they claim to recognize that they have  On balance, France   probably is doing a little better than Germany in terms of the basic macroeconomic dimensions   that we usually track  "
6835,2002-05-07," As we reported in the Greenbook, we have revised up slightly  since March the outlook for real output growth abroad over the remainder of this  year For some of our foreign trading partners, we were reacting to the most recent  evidence that had surprised us on the positive side  For others, we interpreted the  changes made in the outlook for the US economy as likely to pass through to faster  growth abroad over the forecast period  In our analysis, the rebound in the global  economy hinges on the projected strength in US economic activity  Past easing of  monetary policy abroad is also an important supporting factor  In a few cases, with  Canada being the most important example, foreign central banks have started to  withdraw some of this stimulus as the pace of activity improves   With somewhat mixed feelings and a good deal of worry, we found the courage to  lower our projected path for the exchange value of the dollar from that in the March  Greenbook We continued our recent practice of a “straight-line” approach for the  dollar path from current values as again we see roughly offsetting upside and  downside potential for the dollar over the forecast period But a review of the factors  that led us to adjust down the dollar about 2 percent for the weighted average and  against several of the major currencies should convince you that we did consider  alternatives   First, market developments since the March FOMC meeting have varied across  different currencies but have generally been in the downward direction for the dollar   The nominal index for the major currencies has fallen about 2½ percent  Within that  set of currencies, the dollar has depreciated the most (about 4 percent) against the  Swiss franc, which seems to be attracting safe haven flows, and the euro (more than  3½ percent) It has declined least against the Canadian dollar (less than 1½ percent),  despite strong economic data for the first quarter in Canada  In terms of our broad  index, which includes our other important trading partners, the dollar has depreciated                                      May 7, 2002 14 of 81  much less; but that result includes a very sharp drop in the nominal value of the  Argentine peso In addition, the dollar has risen more than 4 percent vis-à-vis the  Mexican peso over the intermeeting period   Revising down the projected path of the dollar fits a “random walk” strategy and  is consistent with the long, sad history of analysts, including ourselves, failing to find  structural explanations for exchange rate determination that outperform a random  walk But I think we were reacting to more than just the actual market moves  In  recent weeks, a tone in the market has surfaced that perhaps the dollar has turned a  corner and that investors are now less willing to add to their dollar holdings than they  have been over the past few years Perceived pressure from the US manufacturing  sector and the decision on protection for the steel industry have raised doubts about  the Administration’s commitment to the so-called strong dollar policy  Secretary  O’Neill’s testimony last week was the occasion of additional market reaction and  downward pressure on the dollar  The large US external imbalances seem to be  drawing renewed attention, although market participants have not been reacting to the  trade data per se Indeed, the employment report of last Friday and the implication  that the US economy is less robust than previously thought was a greater cause for  dollar weakness than the latest trade releases had been   After years of raising warning signs about the unsustainability of the US current  account deficit, it would be easy for those of us in the Division of International  Finance to exaggerate the significance of these recent market developments   However, we have tried to guard against doing that as experience has made us wary   The intermeeting movements of the dollar have generally only retraced its gains since  about November in terms of nominal value against other industrial country  currencies  Our forecast calls for US real output growth to exceed average foreign  growth substantially If US productivity growth remains high and asset values are  sustained, global investors could continue to regard investment opportunities here as  superior to those elsewhere   Lastly, we have trouble writing down a significant depreciation in the dollar  because we have a hard time identifying against which currencies the dollar might  move sharply A 10 percent appreciation of the yen in terms of the dollar would  move it beyond the levels at which Japanese authorities not long ago indicated their  concern by intervening In our view, the present state of the Japanese economy is not  consistent with significant yen appreciation as it would remove the scope for some  stabilization and then improvement of production in the Japanese economy  We  cannot picture how market forces would come together to push the yen up under  current circumstances  The upside potential that we see in the dollar is importantly in  terms of the yen; the unresolved problems within the Japanese economy could well  lead to a return of yen depreciation   There would seem to be scope for appreciation of the euro  But there have not  been many positive surprises coming from the euro area recently  Demands from  labor in Germany and Italy seem to be worrying markets  And there are still no signs                                 May 7, 2002 15 of 81  of an acceleration in productivity similar to what we have seen in the United States   So we believe that the euro could equally well move up or move down from its  current value   On balance, we have taken a cautious approach  It would seem foolish not to  acknowledge the recent market moves, but it would seem rash to extrapolate them  into the future We remain convinced that an adjustment of the US external balance  will become necessary at some point  The capital inflows needed to finance  prospective deficits cannot continue to expand forever  It seems probable that an  external adjustment will entail some decline in the value of the dollar  But whether  we are now seeing the beginnings of that process, we do not know   Let me conclude by briefly updating you on developments in Argentina   Negotiations with the IMF are effectively at a standstill, although President Duhalde  has again appealed for international assistance  The Argentine political process has  been unable to date to resolve the major issues that IMF officials and others insist  must be addressed before a new program can be considered  These issues include  reform of the bankruptcy law, repeal of the economic subversion law, and a binding  agreement to substantially reduce provincial deficits and halt the printing of scrip to  finance those deficits Structural reforms of this kind are needed as fundamentals  before a sustainable economic plan can be formulated     After a week-long bank and foreign exchange holiday, Argentine banks reopened  a week ago Monday The legislature had passed a measure making more complicated  and presumably more time consuming the legal steps necessary for depositors to  withdraw their money under the rules of the corralito  This occurred after a proposal  to convert bank deposits to government bonds, termed Bonex II, failed to be approved  by lawmakers, and the Economy Minister Remes Lemicov resigned in protest   Argentina remains without a functional banking system, the payments mechanism is  hobbled, and economic activity continues to contract  Pressures are being directed at  the foreign-owned banks to inject more funds into their Argentine affiliates  So far,  foreign banks, including a major Spanish bank, have rejected any calls for additional  capital; they maintain that no additional funds will be provided unless the government  can assure them it will abide by established and reasonable laws with respect to  property rights   The new Economy Minister, Roberto Lavagna, has assembled a new team, but  little has yet been accomplished  Relations between the provinces and the federal  government remain part of the ongoing problems  Some of the provincial governors  are quite strong politically and have their own ambitions  Popular opinion is against  the banks—as well as the government—and popular demands call for softer terms for  debtors but the return of deposits at full value   In sum, there is no direction to policy and no prospects that any difficult decisions  will be made any time soon  To date, no major evidence of spillover to other  countries has appeared, and market analysts seem to regard Argentina as a distinct               May 7, 2002 16 of 81  case However, sovereign bonds issued by Uruguay have just been downgraded, and   that country is certainly suffering some economic distress as a result of events in its   close neighbor Brazil is also showing some signs of stress on international financial   markets, although most analysts attribute this to uncertainties arising from its   upcoming presidential elections  That completes our remarks  We’d be happy to   answer questions      We don’t, but we could  The interest differential is available, I think,   for all the pieces  We look at the forward euro, and we look at the forward yen; I think we could   do that for the other major currencies     Right    But as you well know, the yen is going to be an issue because the   interest differential is going to say that the market expects the yen to appreciate a lot    I thought you asked me for forward rates            May 7, 2002 17 of 81    But it’s identical at the horizons of the interest rate differential     We can use the futures market, yes    But there’s no way that the arbitrage opportunity of trading in the   futures market and then long-end and short-end bonds—      We’ll construct one    That’s my point If we know the interest differential, we know the   forward rate            May 7, 2002 18 of 81    We can take that number, but what I’m saying is that the existence of   the arbitrage opportunity would lead some people to go around the block if that were profitable    So I think you can be certain—    I understand that, too What I’m saying to you, though, is that other   people do want to make a profit and therefore we can assume—      We will map the forward rates and future rates and look at them  "
6859,2002-06-25,"  Your first international chart presents financial market  developments in the major foreign industrial countries  The top left panel shows the  decline in the nominal exchange value of the dollar that has occurred since shortly  after the January chart show in terms of the euro, the yen, and the index of the  currencies of the major foreign industrial countries  This index has returned to a level  last recorded in January 2001, falling 9 percent from its peak in late January of this  year Despite the headlines and market chatter, the dollar has retraced only a fraction  of its 40 percent rise between 1995 and earlier this year  Nevertheless, market tone  has shifted toward the view that a prolonged downward adjustment of the dollar may  have begun in response to heightened risks  Concerns have increased about  robustness of the US recovery, revealed weaknesses in US corporate governance,  the questionable attractiveness of holding ever larger claims on the US economy,  some move toward protectionist policies by the Administration, and political and  terrorist uncertainties To provide some perspective, I have shown in the right panel  the adjustment of the exchange value of the dollar from its peak in 1985 in terms of  the German mark, the yen, and the Canadian dollar  From early 1985 to mid-1987,  the average value of the dollar fell about 35 percent  The mark and the yen both bore  a substantial share of the change, with the dollar declining nearly 50 percent against  each of these currencies  In contrast, the Canadian dollar moved only slightly   The middle panels trace the shifts in market expectations about future euro and  yen interest rates since your January meeting  From their January values, shown in  red, euro three-month futures rates first moved up, as markets became more  optimistic about the pace of global recovery and came to expect more-aggressive  tightening by the ECB However, after peaking in late March—the blue lines—rates  have since more than retraced that shift for 2003, resulting in a curve for yesterday’s  rates—the black line—that is flatter and the lowest of the three  A move by the ECB  from its present refi rate of 325 percent is still expected by the end of the year   Three-month yen future interest rates have changed little since January, sagging  slightly lower for rates in 2003   The table at the bottom left depicts spot short-term and long-term interest rates  and their changes since the January meeting  Three-month rates show little net  change, whereas ten-year rates have declined somewhat  Stock prices, shown to the                            June 25-26, 2002 61 of 179  right, have moved down quite sharply in the United States and Europe  Japanese  stock prices have fluctuated quite a bit over the past several months and, on balance,  are now close to their late January level   Our outlook for recovery abroad is summarized in the top two panels of your next  chart Total foreign growth—the blue bars in the left panel—show a rebound to  3 percent during the first half of this year from essentially no growth last year  Data  for first-quarter GDP in several key regions as well as more recent indicators confirm  that turning points have been reached and activity has generally started to accelerate  abroad Over the forecast period, we expect that this expansion will gain some  additional pace, with growth abroad averaging 3½ percent over 2003  The staff  forecast calls for US real output growth to exceed average foreign growth over the  forecast period The right panel displays the extent to which the projected rebound in  emerging Asia, captured by the blue bars, outshines that elsewhere    Some of the evidence for recovery in the industrial countries is illustrated in the  middle panels  Industrial production has turned up sharply in Canada and moderately  in Japan and the United Kingdom  In the euro area, industrial production through  April is only slightly off its recent low toward the end of last year, but over the period  shown it has recorded the strongest performance  As shown to the right, the positive  swing evidenced by business confidence in all four regions should help to support  domestic spending and allow the recovery to become established  A rebound in  exports is also an important factor for these regions, as can be seen in the bottom left   Particularly in Japan, the upturn in the export sector is a key ingredient to prospects  for positive growth in the future   The table to the right gives the staff baseline forecast for these countries  The  vigorous performance expected in Canada (line 4) stands out relative to the others   Canadian first-quarter growth registered 60 percent, with final domestic demand  accounting for 34 percentage points of that In contrast, Japan’s outlook (line 3)  remains sluggish  With fiscal policy mildly contractionary, the financial sector still  largely broken, and monetary policy effectively unable (or unwilling) to provide  additional stimulus, we expect that a swing in inventories and support from export  demand can provide support for only weak output growth over the forecast period   The contrasting experiences of the Asian and Latin American emerging-market  countries are the subject of your next chart  Selected Asian nominal dollar exchange  rates are shown in the top left panel  On balance, the dollar has depreciated against  these currencies since the start of the year  The Korean won has appreciated about  10 percent, much of it in the most recent weeks  Offshore dollar spreads for China,  Korea, and Thailand—in the middle left panel—are low and have fluctuated narrowly  during 2002 Both of these financial developments are consistent with the quite  favorable recent macroeconomic performance of most of the economies in the region   Strong rebounds in real GDP growth have generally been recorded for the first  quarter, particularly in the economies that specialize in exporting high-tech products   In addition, expansion of domestic demand has been solid in countries such as China                    June 25-26, 2002 62 of 179  and Korea While we recognize that there are risks to continued robust growth in  emerging Asia, our baseline forecast (at the bottom left) is for growth in the region to  be well maintained through the forecast period   The outlook for most of Latin America is far less positive, with only Mexico  displaying any economic strength  Dollar exchange rates for Mexico, Argentina, and  Brazil are shown in the top right panel  The dollar has appreciated more than  300 percent against the Argentine peso since officials ended the one-to-one peg in  early January This is consistent with the huge spread on Argentine dollar debt in the  middle right panel and the continuing state of crisis that characterizes Argentina  currently  In recent weeks, new worries concerning Brazil have roiled financial  markets—returning the real to its lows against the dollar of last September and  widening the spread on Brazilian dollar debt, which touched 1,700 basis points   Markets are reacting to the political winds blowing in the presidential campaign and  are unhappy about the lead in the polls of the left-wing candidate  With a sizable  domestic debt of the public sector that must be managed and rolled over on an  ongoing basis, the bond and exchange markets have expressed their displeasure with  the political trends Although it appears that the government has sufficient cash to  pay obligations due between now and the October election, complete cancellation of  regular bond auctions would likely cause pressures in other places, such as the  exchange market, to intensify For now, the government is partially rolling over  maturing debt at rates it deems acceptable, taking steps to increase the banking  system’s holdings of public sector bonds, and running down cash to fill any gap  It  has just arranged to draw $10 billion from its existing program with the IMF, with  some of the additional funds available to counter downward pressure on the currency   Whether these tactics will be sufficient to avoid a more serious financial meltdown  remains to be seen  As reported in the table at the bottom right, we expect the  Mexican economy to return to growth of about 4 percent as it benefits from the  recovery in US GDP For Argentina, we do not see an end to the decline in activity  this year and have written down zero for next year with no real conviction  Brazil  experienced a recovery in output in the first quarter, but we expect growth for this  year overall and next year to be fairly low  However, circumstances there are very  uncertain, with the political risks dominating other developments   The top left panel of your next chart reports some of the trade data for April that  were released after the Greenbook forecast was completed  Relative to revised first- quarter figures, imports and exports of goods (lines 1 and 5) both rose somewhat,  whereas services (lines 3 and 8) were little changed  The increases in both exports  and imports of goods were widespread across categories of goods, including capital  goods The monthly deficit (line 10) widened to a new record level, triggering some  notice in exchange markets  In response to recent market developments and our sense  that market participants are now questioning the attractiveness of adding to their  claims on the United States—given market disappointment with the pace of US  recovery and some heightened risk aversion as evidenced by shifts out of equities in  global markets—we have incorporated as our baseline forecast a further moderate  depreciation in the real value of the dollar in terms of the other major currencies  As                 June 25-26, 2002 63 of 179  you can see in the panel on the right, this contrasts with the strategy of a flat dollar  going forward that we followed in January Our projected rate of depreciation is  quite gentle, and in real terms would only return the dollar at the end of the forecast  period to its value in mid-2000     Our outlook for economic activity in the rest of the global economy and for dollar  exchange rates lies behind the rebound we are projecting in both real exports and  imports  Total exports of goods and services, line 1 in the middle left panel, are  projected to accelerate over the forecast period, reaching nearly 8½ percent growth  next year Exports of goods (line 3) account for most of this recovery, but service  exports contribute importantly  Within the goods component, we look for core goods  (line 4) to pick up significantly as foreign growth firms and as relative prices boost  these exports going forward Total real imports of goods and services—line 1 to the  right—should accelerate sharply as well  Imports of goods (line 3) account for more  of this improvement, with core imports (line 4) picking up and services contributing  only slightly The recovery in US output, along with our high propensity to import,  more than accounts for the increased expansion of imports, as positive relative price  effects wane and then turn negative over the next six quarters   The contributions to US GDP growth of exports and imports are illustrated in the  bottom panel  The global slowdown of activity and trade caused imports and exports  to decline last year, resulting in a negative contribution from exports and a positive  contribution from imports  The normal pattern resumed in the first quarter, with  imports particularly strong  Going forward, we see a slowly rising positive  contribution from real exports, but a sustained and larger negative contribution from  real imports   Your final international chart reports some information from the balance of  payments data for the first quarter, which were also released after the Greenbook was  completed  The top left panel shows that the staff forecast implies a widening of the  current account deficit over the forecast period to about 5 percent of GDP in 2003   The panel on the right provides some detail on the composition of capital flows in the  first quarter and suggests some trends in the nature of those flows  Net private capital  inflows (line 2) were lower in the second half of last year than they had been earlier,  and that reduction was maintained through the first quarter  Of these private inflows,  foreign purchases of US securities (line 3) moved down in the second half of last  year and slipped further in Q1 Stock purchases (line 4) held up in Q1, but bond  purchases fell sharply US purchases of foreign securities, importantly equities,  (lines 5 and 6) also moved down over the past several quarters and switched to net  sales Foreign direct investment in the United States (line 7) was greatly reduced in  the second half of last year as the global slowdown and events of September 11  lessened merger activity  That inflow recovered somewhat in the first quarter, but  remains well below earlier rates  On balance, the realized net capital inflow in the  US economy expanded with the current account in the first quarter, but it came  about through reduced gross flows in both directions and significantly lower private  capital inflows than in the first half of 2001  This pattern lends some support to the                  June 25-26, 2002 64 of 179  view that investors now see acquiring claims on the US economy as less attractive  than they previously did  At the same time, US investors seem to have a reduced  appetite for claims on the rest of the world   The bottom panels use the staff model to explore the consequences for the rest of  the world of a substantial dollar depreciation  The black lines in each of the boxes  show the Greenbook baseline forecast for real GDP for each of the four regions The  red lines are the alternative presented in the Greenbook for the negative shock to the  dollar of 20 percent against most currencies, but only 10 percent against the Canadian  dollar and Mexican peso As reported in the Greenbook, the depreciation is mildly  stimulative for US real growth  For these foreign regions, the effect is to weaken  real output, particularly in developing Asia, where the economies are very open and  dependent on exports With Japanese growth already very weak and Japanese  officials having used intervention repeatedly in light of exchange rate developments  over the intermeeting period, we recognize that a further appreciation of the yen of  the size considered in this shock could trigger a reaction among market participants  and/or Japanese officials So, to explore the implications of a shock that was much  more concentrated on the euro, we ran another simulation—the blue lines  That  simulation yields the same overall impact on the weighted-average dollar and on US  activity but is distributed toward the euro and away from the yen and the currencies  of developing Asia The Canadian and Mexican currencies are left to be as near the  Greenbook baseline in this alternative as they were in the Greenbook alternative   Monetary authorities everywhere are assumed to react based on Taylor rules to the  consequences of the initial shock The result of a nearly 35 percent decline in the  dollar in terms of the euro and the pound is to derail the recovery in the euro area and  cause output to weaken absolutely and relative to the Greenbook baseline  In  contrast, in both Japan and developing Asia, the effective depreciation of their  currencies relative to the euro actually causes output to be boosted relative to both the  Greenbook alternative and the baseline In this simulation, the ECB uses all of the  room to the zero bound on interest rates to offset the effects of the exchange rate on  output and inflation   Declines of the dollar of the size explored in these simulations are comparable to  what occurred in the 1985-87 period However, the Japanese economy is far weaker  now than it was then And interest rates are generally significantly lower, bringing  the zero bound on interest rates into consideration for those regions experiencing  sharp appreciation Let me turn the floor back to David for some concluding remarks     At this point, these data are sufficiently new to us—and the revisions   actually caught members of my staff by surprise—that I don’t have any further explanation    Since bond issuance has been fairly strong, there is no obvious explanation as to why it should   go down I think the answer is that I don’t really have a good answer       Yes, four quarters    Well, to be honest, I don’t think my model would tell us anything very   interesting about the differences in those two alternatives because the model is quite linear    There would be some little differences here and there  The monetary policy reaction function              June 25-26, 2002 66 of 179  would behave differently, which would have some effect  But certainly the current tone of the   financial press on the subject and the comments that are being made publicly distinguish hugely   between a gradual and orderly depreciation of the dollar—one similar perhaps to the 1985-87   experience—and something that would be described as abrupt  The latter would be disruptive of   market psychology and disruptive in terms of risk-aversion behavior  People are concerned that,   if the dollar were to fall rapidly, it would trigger reactions and expectations that would become   almost self-fulfilling     The biggest issue is obviously the US stock market  We on the staff struggled a great   deal as we tried to think about how to express this outlook—not wanting to put down language   that suggests the dollar is falling because US stock prices are falling or even vice versa because   foreign stock prices are falling too  Indeed, foreign stock prices in some respects have declined   more than US stock prices So there is no relative difference that we can point to there  But we   interpret the decline in stock prices as indicating a degree of risk aversion in the behavior of   some investors  They are moving toward investments that they perceive to be safer     Foreign investors, if they see the dollar falling rapidly, will recognize that the value of   any dollar investment they might hold will reflect not only whatever capital gain or loss it might   experience but will suffer from any depreciation of the dollar that might be forthcoming too  So   one could imagine the change in market psychology if expectations about the pace at which the   dollar will adjust were to be revised  If the dollar’s depreciation were expected to be even more   rapid, that would enter into some people’s calculations about any dollar assets to buy and would   probably be reflected in our bond prices and our equity prices    So there is a psychological element involved that is difficult for us to pin down  The   models do not capture it But I think it would show through under those circumstances And     June 25-26, 2002 67 of 179  oddly, developments in Brazil—or, say, Mexico, which is thought to be very dependent on the   United States—could begin to produce market effects here, and we could get feedback loops on   risk aversion in other ways It could become a more generalized problem                  More the latter than the former in that we had some positive surprises    Emerging Asia was even a little stronger than we expected—and not only in the high-tech   countries Thailand, for example, which we don’t ordinarily put in that category, had a very   strong first quarter  Canada surprised us a bit on the upside  I’m a little fearful—in this country   the first quarter looked good, too—that April and May will be disappointing abroad, but we   don’t know about the performance of their economies quite as fast as we know about the US   economy  We haven’t corrected for that But on the whole, we’ve had more positive surprises   than negative surprises, so on the margin we adjusted our outlook  "
6887,2002-08-13," As we tried to convey in the Greenbook, the staff outlook for  the global economy over the remainder of this year and next is a bit weaker than last  time and less certain  The factors behind this change in tone with respect to global  prospects can be grouped into three categories (1) recent developments that are  broadly global in nature, in particular global financial market developments;  (2) consequences for key foreign economies of the downward revision to our forecast  for US real growth; and (3) developments that essentially are external to the US  economy and are being driven by economic and political shocks abroad     The sharp decline and heightened volatility in equity prices over the intermeeting  period was a common feature across most global stock markets  European equity  prices were particularly hard hit  As in the United States, the effects of the resulting  loss of wealth on total spending are partially offset by the declines that have occurred  in many long-term interest rates  But long rates in the other major industrial countries  generally moved down less than did those in US markets  Although foreign stock  markets seemed to take their cue primarily from movements in US markets, issues  of corporate governance and accounting accuracy have also arisen with respect to  some large foreign firms  And a general reduction in the willingness on the part of  investors to bear risk seems to be widespread  Certain sectors, such as European  insurance firms, have been particularly penalized in the current market environment     We expect that these less favorable financial conditions will weigh on confidence  and spending abroad Indeed, we have some early readings on confidence that  indicate such a reaction Negative wealth effects are to be expected particularly in the  United Kingdom and Canada, where our research tells us that consumers are quite  sensitive to wealth changes  The contractionary effects of these financial market  developments should be cushioned, however, by the absence of monetary tightening  on the part of most major foreign central banks in the near term  Although in June we  had incorporated such tightening into the forecast, we share the view currently  reflected in short-term interest rate futures that monetary policy will remain generally  accommodative into next year in the major foreign industrial countries   As we noted in the Greenbook, several of the regions that evidenced strength in  the first half of the year, in some cases more than we were expecting, depended for  that strength on their export sectors This was the case in Japan, in emerging Asia,  and to some extent in Europe  For Japan and emerging Asia, a significant part of the  rebound in exports was in the high-tech sector  Continued recovery in that sector                           August 13, 2002 15 of 92  depends broadly on global developments But a key risk to ongoing expansion in  these export-dependent economies is a negative surprise in US output growth   The downward revision made to the outlook for the US economy fed directly  into our less optimistic outlooks for Canada and Mexico  Canada has been something  of an outlier among the industrial countries during the first half of this year, recording  rapid output growth in both quarters and strength in final domestic demand  In  response, the Bank of Canada has raised its policy rate a total of 75 basis points since  April We expect Canadian growth to slow to a more sustainable rate, and we have  edged projected growth down a bit more to reflect the somewhat weaker path for US  real GDP this time than in the June Greenbook  Similarly, we are looking for  recovery to become established in Mexico, the one bright spot in our outlook for  Latin America  However, we have shaded our projection for Mexico in light of the  less favorable US projection   Finally, a series of developments in the past several weeks in a few foreign  countries, importantly several in South America, have cast significant gloom over the  foreign outlook To some degree, problems in these countries have interacted to  reinforce the negative effects being felt in each and to raise the risk of a serious  collapse in economic activity and stability in the region  Because of the size of its  economy and the extent of its participation in global financial markets, Brazil is  arguably the most important of the potential crises brewing in South America     The proximate cause of Brazil’s current financial distress is concern on the part of  investors, both domestic and foreign, about the future course of economic policy in  Brazil as a result of the election to be held in October  The current government has  generally followed policies since the January 1999 crisis that have met with market  approval But there is nothing that this government can do to ensure the continuation  of such policies And statements alone by the candidates have not been reassuring to  markets, especially in light of the long-standing differences in political positions and  sources of support of the three principal candidates  Spreads on Brazilian dollar- denominated debt rose from 1,500 basis points to around 2,400 basis points over less  than two weeks, as political news swayed markets  Reports circulated that  international banks were withdrawing trade credits and similar short-term lines    After the Greenbook was finalized, the IMF announced an extension and  enlargement of Brazil’s existing IMF program that will total about $30 billion  One  important feature of this new program is that only $6 billion is to be disbursed this  year, with the remainder slated for 2003, after the new government is in place  Thus  the program should create strong incentives for the new government, regardless of  who wins, to follow policies consistent with the program in order to obtain those  funds Market participants now understand that those incentives are in place and that,  because of the IMF commitment, the Brazilian government could have sufficient  resources to manage its sovereign debt in 2003                        August 13, 2002 16 of 92  To be successful the program has to result in lower spreads and improved   exchange rate stability for Brazil following the election and perhaps much sooner  To   help in that regard, the program gives Brazilian officials more scope to use their   existing reserves to provide liquidity to bond markets and to intervene in the foreign   exchange market Although the program is large and designed to reassure markets, it   is something of a gamble  Enough capital needs to remain in Brazil for the private   economy to function reasonably between now and the election  After the election,   market-compatible policies need to be followed—either because of the incentives   created by the IMF program or because, once elected, the new president will have to   weigh election rhetoric against the cold light of reality in making his choices    Following the announcement, spreads first narrowed sharply and the real appreciated   However, investor enthusiasm for the loan package is already waning  The real has   subsequently more than reversed its post-announcement gains, despite intervention   support for the currency, and spreads have backed up to more than 2,300 basis points    The Greenbook baseline forecast is for Brazil to weather this storm  Output is   expected to stagnate during the rest of this year, as turbulent financial conditions and   heightened uncertainty disrupt economic activity  But low growth is projected to   resume next year as financial conditions improve  However, the risk that financial   conditions will instead deteriorate further and force some kind of debt standstill   and/or capital controls before the election even takes place is certainly present  In   that situation, the incentives for the new government, once elected, to follow market-  compatible policies would be greatly reduced  If that is the course followed by   Brazil, the pressures on other South American countries and their financial systems   will intensify and prospects for even low growth of economic activity in the region   will be sharply reduced  That concludes our report  We’d be happy to take any   questions     Well, first of all, they are industry data  There is a good apparatus for   monitoring developments that is generally industry based       Yes In those economies, high-tech exports are such a large part of   what is going on that it is a focus So I think in some sense, yes, it might be an early reflection of   the orders of their principal purchaser, the United States     I think it is close  "
6912,2002-09-24," Mr Chairman, I do      I have a chart of Japanese corporate versus government debt spreads    The AA has been a little choppy, but the spread is about 15 basis points; the BBB is around   50 basis points Both have been spiky, up and down a bit, in the last week or so    There is no discernible trend     Right I can’t tell you what issuance has been, so I have no idea if this   is a reflection of no issuance and no trading and so forth  Actually, the spread has been trending   down a bit in the BBB from the middle of this year to most recently  So there is no sign here that   spreads are blowing up or even widening    The staff outlook for real economic activity in the rest of the  world is slightly darker than that we presented in the August Greenbook, as some of  the recent data have failed to meet our expectations and have disappointed markets   In response, we have revised down a bit our outlook for foreign real GDP  We still  believe that the most likely outcome will be that output growth abroad will generally  strengthen in 2003, and we have now added some further projected acceleration in  2004 But downside risks seem to predominate, and the rebound from global  weakness in 2001 remains uneven and still a bit elusive   The occasion of the IMF and World Bank annual meetings later this week  prompted me to look back six months to their spring meetings to assess how  economic and financial developments over that interval compared with our  expectations at that time and to look for factors at work during that interval that will  have implications for activity abroad during the forecast period  In March our  expectation was for a general strengthening of output growth abroad throughout 2002  that on average characterized both the industrial countries and the developing  countries Not surprisingly, the actual course of economic events was less smooth  than that Foreign growth surprised us on the upside in the first half of the year,  particularly for the industrial countries Nevertheless, we now see real GDP growth  in the industrial countries in the second half of this year and the first half of next year  as likely to be weaker than in our March projection and below that now reported for  the first half of this year   The reasoning behind our projection of near-term weakness in the industrial  countries differs importantly for Canada on the one hand, and for Japan and the euro  area on the other In Canada, real GDP growth during the first half of the year was  exceptionally vigorous at an annual rate of more than 5 percent  Growth at this pace  is not sustainable and poses the risk of triggering inflationary pressures if it were to  continue Accordingly, the Bank of Canada has raised its policy rate 75 basis points  since March—a pace of policy tightening that exceeded what we had incorporated  into the March Greenbook The effect of these higher rates on both consumption and  fixed investment should become evident over the next several quarters  In addition, a  swing in inventory behavior made a substantial contribution to growth in the first half                         September 24, 2002 18 of 115  of this year but should prove to be transitory  Finally, the pattern of US real output  growth is of particular importance for Canada  Taken together, these factors paint a  picture of moderate, rather than blistering, growth in the near term that continues over  the forecast period   In contrast, Japan and the euro area both appear to have experienced some good  fortune in the first half of this year after negative real GDP growth in the fourth  quarter of last year But both have as yet failed to develop any momentum that would  sustain demand and lead to a firming of recovery  In Japan, double-digit export  growth more than accounts for the rebound in real GDP over the first half, as  domestic demand again contracted on balance  Much of the increase in exports was  to other economies in Asia, and we do not see the scope for export growth to continue  at its recent pace Given the ongoing problems in Japan of financial sector weakness,  monetary and fiscal policy inaction, and moderate deflation, we expect that domestic  demand will not expand enough to result in anything other than weak growth over the  forecast period   In the euro area, the expansion in the first half was the result of improved net  exports and a boost from reduced inventory liquidation  In our forecast, we have  these factors continuing to contribute, albeit at a reduced rate, along with some  rebound in final domestic demand to yield relatively weak real GDP growth for the  next several quarters Subsequently, acceleration in fixed investment and  consumption should boost growth to between 2½ and 3 percent during the second half  of next year The continued listless performance of the German economy is a major  factor behind the subpar outlook for the euro area  Declining equity prices and global  financial market volatility over the past several months have undermined business  and consumer confidence in the euro area  German stock prices have fallen further  over the intermeeting period as European insurance companies, in particular, have  been hit hard by portfolio losses and high claims     With output growth in the euro area remaining weak and showing no sign of  rising soon, the ECB has left rates unchanged since November 2001  This contrasts  with our previous expectation of an increase of 50 basis points during the current  half-year Long-term interest rates have responded by moving down about 90 basis  points since March, of which more than 20 basis points have been since the August  Greenbook Automatic fiscal stabilizers are providing some support to demand, but  the deficit limit of 3 percent of GDP set by the Stability and Growth Pact is  constraining fiscal policy in Germany  On balance, we expect that recovery of euro  area output growth will firm by the middle of next year but recognize that currently  there seems to be little upside risk for such a forecast   Among the developing countries, the emerging economies in Asia and Mexico are  projected to show strength and to experience a return to vigorous growth by the end  of the forecast period, although the pattern is expected to differ across these countries   Elsewhere in Latin America, financial and political stresses are likely to keep growth  significantly reduced for some time  Economic activity in China, which did not           September 24, 2002 19 of 115  slacken significantly in 2001, has provided some stability and strength to the Asian  region throughout this year  In several of the emerging Asian economies, including  Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan, and Korea, rebounds in high-tech production and  exports have been important elements in sustaining expansion during 2002  Although  domestic demand has provided a boost to output growth in some Asian economies—  particularly China, Korea, and Taiwan—we see this region of the global economy as  vulnerable to a downturn in the global high-tech sector and to reduced demand for  their exports to the United States and other industrial countries  Accordingly,  continued expansion in emerging Asia would be threatened should the pace of growth  on average in the industrial countries over the next few quarters be weaker than we  now expect Similarly, our forecast that the recent bounceback in Mexican output  will prove durable is especially dependent on the path of output and demand in the  United States   Overall, the slightly gloomier tone to the staff outlook this time does not arise  from a judgment that the global high-risk spots, such as Brazil, are now more likely to  experience severe crises or to cause greater spillover effects on other countries   Rather, it is that, among the major foreign industrial countries, only Canada has  experienced a robust recovery The failure to date of the euro area and of Japan to  move beyond sluggish growth to a pace that reduces excess capacity and triggers a  revival of investment spending is reflected in the small downward revision that we  made to our projection for near-term foreign growth And it is a negative risk factor  for our expectation that, later, output abroad will move closer to its trend rate of  expansion That completes our remarks  We’d be happy to answer any questions    To be honest, I don’t I sincerely hope that there are many people who   for other reasons are paying a lot of attention to immigration controls in Canada  But it is not   something that has been raised in the context of the economic debate about the reasons that   Canada has led the way in this recovery They have had a housing boom in terms of house prices   and housing starts And part of the story is that they have had an auto boom that is, I’m sure, to   some extent a part of and derives from the US auto boom  They have not had the same degree   of capital overhang that we have experienced, and for that reason they see themselves as having   a recovery that has fewer headwinds In reality they have been out in front of us  I wouldn’t rule   out the thought that immigration has something to do with it I just honestly don’t have an   answer for you    No, and I think that is a good point  I appreciate your mentioning it   The industrial country that on the whole did the best through the recent downturn and the upturn   is Australia I’ve asked myself over and over again why it is that Australia has done so well    And now in terms of the recovery, Canada is coming right behind them as an economy that is   outpacing ours and outpacing those of all the other industrial countries  Some people when they   talk about both of those countries, but mainly Canada, point to the fact that their exports in   particular are commodity based But it goes against everything I think I understand about the   global economy to believe that during a downturn those economies would fare better rather than   worse They typically are hit harder as manufacturing falls elsewhere; there’s an accelerated   effect on the demand for their exports  It usually makes them more vulnerable rather than less         September 24, 2002 26 of 115  But both Australia and Canada are economies that have had substantial currency depreciation    They have allowed that to happen—have not resisted it by tightening monetary policy—and have   not suffered particularly on the inflation front as a consequence for a host of reasons that we’ve   talked about before We’ve discussed, for example, whether the global economy is more   competitive and so forth and whether inflation targeting per se has helped to make that happen    They have enjoyed some relative price advantages  Canada is an energy exporter, or at least self-  sufficient in that regard, and that may help to some degree in this environment as well      Well, I’m always the one who is sitting around worrying about the   current account deficit and our net external indebtedness  It’s not that I don’t think the US   economy can be maintained at full utilization of its resources either way  But I think that in the   long run some dollar depreciation is a necessary step, so I don’t regret it when it comes along     I am skeptical that the Canadians, because they are the tail and not the dog of North   America so to speak, can sustain such strong growth any more than Mexico can sustain strong   growth when the US economy is not performing well  So for those reasons we do expect to see   the Canadian economy conforming more to other industrialized economies and experiencing   growth closer to their long-term average, more along the lines of what ours is doing     I will say that one Bank of Canada analyst whispered the word “productivity” in my ear   not too long ago And I have suggested to some of our people that we look to see if we can find   some answers there because that is the one area we thought the US experience might most   readily be replicated in Canada  So maybe they are beginning to experience the initial stages of   some of the developments that occurred in the US economy three or four years ago  No doubt           September 24, 2002 27 of 115  it’s a mixture of all these things—some exchange rate depreciation, some success in getting their   inflation rate down, a housing boom, an auto boom, and in general a working out of the   inventory cycle and less perceived overhang of capital—that together add up to the stronger   Canadian performance  "
6936,2002-11-06," The contour of the staff forecast for the rest of the world  mirrors that for the US outlook—a downward revision in the near term relative to  last Greenbook, followed by some acceleration in 2003 and 2004  We are expecting  the swing in growth abroad on average to be somewhat damped relative to the US  pattern We see foreign growth slowing in the current quarter, but exceeding US  growth this quarter and during the first half of next year, and then strengthening over  the remainder of the forecast period, but falling short of US growth in 2004  The  similarity to the US path in part reflects the implications of developments in the US  economy for other regions of the globe but in part also reflects our reading of signals  from within those regions of changes arising there    A significant contribution to global slowing arising abroad is that from the euro  area A variety of recent indicators, including industrial production and consumer  and business sentiment, have persuaded us that output growth in the euro area is  slowing rather than edging up, as we had projected in September  The disappointing  pace of activity in turn is adding to the problems posed by the fiscal stance in several  of the EU countries, including France and Germany, and the standards for fiscal  deficits set in the Stability and Growth Pact  Weaker-than-expected activity is  reducing tax revenues and adding to the actual government deficits, including pushing  the German deficit above the 3 percent limit  Understandably, the national  governments do not wish to take procyclical fiscal policy actions that would slow  their economies further  At the same time, ECB officials, having stressed the  importance of fiscal discipline for each member of the euro area, are faced with the  choice of easing monetary policy despite rates of inflation through September above  their 2 percent ceiling The debate has raged publicly in Europe, and it now appears  that the needed structural adjustment of some budgets will be pushed off into the  future Nevertheless, the staff forecast incorporates the assumption that fiscal policy  in the euro area will remain mildly contractionary over the forecast period  However,  with the economy softening and future inflation likely to recede, we have  incorporated into the baseline forecast the assumption that the ECB will cut its policy  rate by next spring   On balance, the picture for the euro area is one where domestic spending has  failed to establish any momentum, as investment spending contracts further and  consumer spending expands only slowly  Uncertainties about near-term prospects for  oil prices, the global economy and so export demand, and geopolitical tensions  continue to weigh on confidence Fiscal policy is caught between agreed medium­                             November 6, 2002 12 of 122  term goals and the macro policy needs of the near term  And monetary policy for  now appears to be on hold Going forward, business spending should start to expand,  with inventories now well below last fall’s peak and capital overhang less of a  problem in Europe than here  As global oil prices come down and euro area inflation  drops, consumer confidence should firm, and clear scope for monetary easing should  emerge  But we readily admit that, whereas evidence of current weakness is clear,  our forecast for a rebound next year is far less certain   Our outlook for Japan is another instance where we have revised down the  forecast based importantly on developments within that economy  Some signs of  strength earlier in the year reflected demand for Japanese exports  But that stimulus  has so far failed to result in positive investment spending or to boost the pace of  consumption spending, as had been widely expected  In addition, new uncertainties  have been created by the appointment of Takenaka as head of the Financial Services  Agency and by the roller coaster nature of the announcements concerning his plans  for more forceful handling of the problems of the financial sector  In light of the  repeated postponement of making public specific details of what will be done, we  have put only very marginal, negative effects from the set of recent policy initiatives  into this forecast  We judge that the near-term effects of an ambitious reform  program would be, on balance, even more negative; but we are not persuaded by what  has been revealed to date that such a program will in fact be implemented  In light of  new data and the diminished prospects for Japanese exports, we have revised down  our outlook for GDP growth in Japan but have retained a slight upward trend in  growth starting by the middle of next year   The emerging economies in Asia have been leading the recovery in global  economic activity, and economic expansion in that region remains robust  We have  adjusted down a bit our projection for output growth there during the second half of  this year, but that change largely reflects developments elsewhere and some  moderation of the very rapid pace of real output growth recorded for the first half   Domestic demand in those economies remains solid, but many of them are  importantly dependent on exports, especially from the high-tech sector  Accordingly,  our baseline forecast is for growth in that region to remain quite strong, outpacing  that elsewhere around the globe Should activity in the United States or the global  economy more generally falter, however, emerging Asia is vulnerable  The resulting  loss in export demand would likely undermine domestic investment spending as well  and result in significantly weaker growth of real GDP   Canada and Mexico remain strong performers on the global scene, and domestic  demand in their economies has been robust  Nevertheless, their ties to the US  economy, including through such important sectors as autos, are so strong that we see  them as largely reflecting or sharing in US developments   Finally, let me mention South America  Events there are clearly driven by  economic and political developments within the major countries, especially Argentina  and Brazil but also Venezuela and others Market reactions to those developments,               November 6, 2002 13 of 122  however, do depend in part on global appetite for risk and general concerns about  uncertainties more broadly  Following the election of Lula as president of Brazil,  markets have initially tended to move in a favorable direction as his statements and  actions to date have been reassuring  However, spreads on dollar-denominated  Brazilian debt remain above 1,700 basis points, and the interest rate on roughly half  of the government's domestic debt now stands at 21 percent At such interest rates,  the debt burden in Brazil will eventually overwhelm the economy  Both the private  sector and the government will need to access financial markets for sizable amounts  of funds in coming months  Thus it seems premature to draw any conclusion about  whether Brazil's government will avoid a need to restructure the terms of some  portions of its debt over the forecast period  It appears that spreads would have to  decline further and that the currency would have to strengthen for a truly benign  outcome to occur  In Argentina, meaningful resolution of economic policy and  progress on restoring growth seem to be on hold until elections are held next March   And even that date for elections is clouded as a dispute continues over conducting  primaries  In the meantime, negotiations with the IMF are proceeding in an effort to  prevent an actual default by Argentina on its obligations to the international financial  institutions The deadline for avoiding a default is the middle of the month The IMF  and major creditor governments have asserted that they will not approve a flawed  program, so some basic issues need to be resolved with Argentine officials  That may  or may not prove possible  Although we regard the situation in South America as  serious, with important implications for the economic and political stability of that  region, we do not judge the stagnation or low growth in the region as having a major  impact on real output growth elsewhere  South America is vulnerable to slowdown in  the United States and the euro area, however  And a major financial disruption in  Brazil could have repercussions on global financial markets  That completes our  remarks  We’d be happy to answer any questions  "
6961,2002-12-10," As we reported in the Greenbook, the staff did not see the  developments since the November FOMC meeting as indicating a need for any major  revisions to our outlook for economic activity abroad or for the US external sector   Some new information did prompt marginal changes to our forecast for particular  countries, but these small adjustments were largely offsetting The challenge  confronting us as we put together this forecast remained that of ensuring that the  overall strengthening in the global economy that we have again presented is  consistent with the extent of stimulus we see outside that present in the US  economy   We have become slightly more pessimistic about the outlook for the euro area and  have written down real GDP growth in that region by 03 percentage point in 2003  and slightly less in 2004 Most, but not all, of that revision is accounted for by the  change in our outlook for Germany  We see the obstacles to growth in Germany as  looming larger than we had previously thought  German fiscal policy is constrained  in the near term by the failure to have made more progress over the past several years  in achieving the medium-term goals set out in the Stability and Growth Pact  The  momentum for structural reform within Germany seems to have faded, perhaps  because of the politics of the election this year  There are particular problems in the  German banking system that raise questions about the efficiency with which capital is  being allocated and that may be impeding a return to more dynamic growth  And the  general weakness in business spending on new capital in Europe and elsewhere works  to the disadvantage of Germany’s manufacturing industry—the core of the German  economy   Slight upward revisions to our projections for Mexico and for some of the  emerging-market economies in Asia essentially offset our less favorable outlook for  the euro area These small positive changes were driven by some recent data, which  confirmed solid expansion in Mexico and Korea, and by the stronger outlook in this  forecast for the acceleration in real output in the United States over the forecast  period These regions are extremely vulnerable to any weakening in US activity or,  for Asia, to any faltering in the recovery of the global high-tech sector  We have built  into the forecast the consequences of the current-quarter slowing now apparent in the  United States and elsewhere But our slightly more optimistic projection for output  growth in 2003 and 2004 in Mexico and emerging Asia reflects the boost to US  growth expected from your move at the last meeting  It is not the consequence of any  significantly stronger domestic demand now evident in those foreign economies   Last Thursday, the ECB Council lowered its official lending rates 50 basis points,  bringing the minimum repo rate down to 275 percent  Ahead of the meeting date,  members of the Council had signaled the likelihood of this step, and we had  incorporated it into the Greenbook forecast  We are not looking for any further  reductions by the ECB and do not expect them to begin moving up rates until mid­ 2004 We view rates at the current, rather low, level as necessary for the moderate  recovery in growth that we expect will begin next spring                      December 10, 2002 12 of 87  The underlying factors that are the basis of our expectation for moderate  acceleration in the pace of activity abroad are similar to those for the US economy   Monetary policy is stimulative in several of the major industrial countries, although  its effectiveness in Japan remains a concern  Inventory cycles abroad are well along  and, to varying degrees, we expect will be adding positively to the change in output  over the forecast interval The restraining effect of lower equity prices on spending,  either because of hits to confidence or direct wealth effects, should be waning  And  lower oil prices will reduce headline inflation, boost confidence, and support  domestic spending  Domestic demand has been buoyant in a few cases—such as  Canada, the United Kingdom, and Korea—and appears to be firming in others  These  factors point to only a moderate pace of recovery in 2003  Such an outcome should  allay concerns that now weigh on spending and support further recovery in growth to  more vigorous rates in 2004 Except in Canada, this projected path for real activity  still leaves the level of output below potential in the major foreign industrial countries  even at the end of 2004   We are concerned that there is limited scope outside the United States to react to  any new negative economic developments that might arise  In both Japan and the  euro area, options with respect to fiscal policy are severely limited  But most  countries do have room to maneuver with respect to monetary policy should the  recovery go off track In South America, even a very favorable outcome would not  generate positive spillovers elsewhere; at best, we are looking for no major  deterioration in Brazil and so no negative contagion problems within the region  In  emerging Asia—the region that has so far displayed the most resilience—there would  be some scope for absorbing some external shock to the real economy  Continued  robust growth in China is a stabilizing factor in that region  Nevertheless, we judge  that, were US real GDP not to accelerate as projected in the baseline forecast, the  projected strengthening of activity elsewhere in the global economy would be  undermined as well  David and I will be happy to answer any questions  "
6988,2003-01-28,"  Chart 10 presents recent developments in selected global   financial markets  The decline in the exchange value of the dollar in terms of the  major foreign currencies has been a feature of these markets since early 2002  The  top left panel shows the movements of the dollar in terms of its index of other major  currencies (the black line) and in terms of the yen (the red line) and the euro (the blue  line)  The data are plotted so that the lines coincide at the point about one year ago  when the major currencies index reached its peak  The depreciation of the dollar  against the euro has exceeded that against most other currencies in the index, with a  significant further move down coming since your previous chart show in mid-2002   At its peak last year, this index of the dollar was 40 percent above its low point in  April 1995  Currently, it is a little more than 20 percent above that low  Recent  market commentary has pointed to the heightened tensions concerning Iraq as a factor  in the latest downward pressure on the dollar  These political risks are apparently   January 28-29, 2003 76 of 195    affecting the terms on which market participants are willing to finance the large and  growing US net international indebtedness     Yields on ten-year sovereign bonds, shown in the panel to the right, have moved   down since the spring of last year  On balance, German and US rates have moved  about the same amount, but a small differential unfavorable to the dollar opened  during the second half of last year, and some differential remains  Despite their low  absolute level, Japanese rates have moved down as well  The ten-year rate crossed  below 1 percent late in 2002 and has since moved down further as demand for JGBs  continues to be strong  The middle panels show the change in market expectations  over the past year for euro (on the left) and yen (on the right) three-month rates as  captured in futures contracts  Disappointing macroeconomic performances during  2002 in these two economies and more generally globally contributed to shifts down  in futures rates  For euro rates, almost all of that shifting has occurred since the June  chart show as real output growth slowed in the second half of the year and  expectations of monetary easing became established  The ECB did lower its  minimum repo rate 50 basis points, to 275 percent, in December; and markets now  appear to be pricing in additional easing by mid-2003  Futures rates in Japan have  shifted down as well; and the curve has become noticeably flatter, suggesting that  markets have postponed further any expected move back up in rates  Stock indexes  are shown in the bottom left panel, with the lines scaled to coincide at the time of  your last chart show  Stock prices are generally down over the full period shown,  falling further since mid-2002  US stock prices have compared favorably with  European and Japanese stock prices since the June chart show       Overall, these financial developments reflect the generally weaker tone to   economic activity that has emerged, especially during the second half of last year   Interest rates have moved lower, partly in response to some additional monetary  easing  But stock prices have fallen, reflecting investor caution  Market conditions  are generally supportive of a recovery in economic activity and, for the most part, do  not by themselves pose additional risks  There are some exceptions, however  For  example, the United Kingdom appears to be experiencing a housing price bubble,  illustrated in the bottom right panel, with prices up 40 percent over the past two years   The circumstances under which this rise will come to an end and the consequences  for the UK economy are a source of uncertainty to the foreign outlook, which is the  subject of your next chart     The top left panel of chart 11 illustrates the deceleration of real GDP in the   second half of last year both here and abroad  US and average foreign growth have  been roughly comparable and are expected to remain so through midyear  Over the  remainder of the forecast period, activity abroad is expected to accelerate but less  vigorously than is US output  Past and some prospective monetary easing should  boost growth abroad, but there is very limited scope for fiscal stimulus   Recovery of  the US economy, along with resolution of some of the geopolitical uncertainties  currently impeding growth everywhere, should also support the return to higher  growth abroad     January 28-29, 2003 77 of 195      Consumption spending has been a key factor in maintaining output growth in   many industrial countries  However, employment growth (shown in the top right  panel) has been strong only in Canada, raising questions about the prospects for  future consumption elsewhere  We look for household spending in most industrial  countries to continue to expand, but we do not see consumption as sparking a rise in  output growth in the euro area or Japan  Rather, we think improvement in investment  spending is essential if growth in those countries is to rebound  Orders data (shown  in the middle left panel) appear consistent with our view that, at least in the near term,  activity in Japan will remain sluggish, with investment spending falling further   German manufacturing orders picked up in November, but that move was entirely  because of stronger foreign, rather than domestic, orders  We remain fairly  pessimistic about the prospects for investment in Germany but expect that, for the  euro area as a whole, investment spending will switch from contributing negatively to  growth to being a small net positive  Such an outcome is far from certain, however   As can be seen to the right, survey responses gathered by I/B/E/S imply that  expectations of long-term earnings growth of companies in the euro area have come  down sharply since early 2001, with the second half of 2002 showing a particularly  steep drop  These reduced expectations likely reflect not just changes in the  circumstances of individual firms but also market perceptions of greater uncertainty  and heightened downside risk that are a consequence of global tensions     As can be seen in the bottom left panel, for this year we anticipate that growth in   the euro area and in Canada will result entirely from expansion of total domestic  demand  Exports from both regions should expand but will be offset by rising  imports  Robust domestic demand should underpin output growth at near its potential  rate in Canada, whereas weak growth of domestic demand in the euro area will leave  that region with a lackluster performance for the year  In Japan, we look for net  exports to be the major positive component of very weak growth  The table to the  right presents our real output forecast through 2004  We do expect some further  strengthening in 2004, with Canada and the United Kingdom continuing to  outperform the other foreign industrial countries     The economic performance of the emerging-market countries, the subject of   chart 12, has continued to be uneven  The emerging Asian economies led the global  economy into recovery and continued to outperform in 2002 but cooled somewhat in  the second half as global demand, particularly for high-tech products, slipped  The  value of the dollar in terms of the Korean won (the black line in the top left panel)  moved down in mid-2002 and, on balance, has remained about unchanged since then   The Singapore dollar also gained somewhat against the US dollar during the second  half of 2002  Its limited move reflects the fact that high-tech industries were  particularly hard hit by the slowdown during the second half of the year  Stock  prices, in the right panel, rose in Korea and, to a lesser extent, in Singapore during the  first half of last year, as these economies grew vigorously, but then retreated as the  global slowdown made itself felt       January 28-29, 2003 78 of 195    Despite relatively strong economic performance in the region, price inflation in  the Asian developing economies has been low  Attention has focused on the potential  for persistent deflation in some of these countries, in addition to the ongoing issue of  deflation in Japan  The middle left panel reports consumer price inflation for selected  emerging-market Asian economies  Deflation was the case during 2002 in China and  Taiwan; in Singapore, deflation early in the year became very low inflation in the  second half  In Taiwan and Singapore, prices decelerated in response to exchange  rate appreciation as well as to the weakening of activity during the second half of the  year  These economies are relatively small and very open and sensitive to the  fluctuations in high-tech industries  We expect that the rebound in activity projected  for this year will lift inflation in these countries, including China, to a low, positive  number  These economies show no signs of being caught in a debt deflation process  as a consequence of the deflation to date     The panel on the right gives the staff growth outlook over the forecast period for   developing Asia  We see no signs that growth in China will flag from the 7½ to  8 percent pace that has been reported for recent years  Continued government  spending and strength in exports should support output growth  For the remainder of  emerging Asia, the projected rebound in US growth and the return to healthy  expansion in the global high-tech sector are essential to the return of growth to the  5 to 6 percent range that we have forecast for these countries     In Argentina and Brazil, financial market developments are both a barometer of   how the economy is currently faring and the channel by which stress is propagated  through the economy  Spreads on international debt, shown in the bottom left panel,  have stabilized and even retraced somewhat their previous spikes, albeit much more  in Brazil than in Argentina  Similarly, exchange rates and stock prices in these two  countries, not shown, have come back off their extremes  The situation in Argentina  is in a kind of suspended animation, awaiting the outcome of the election now  planned for April  While the observed stabilization in markets is welcome and we  have written down low, positive growth as can be seen to the right, none of the really  hard work of fixing the problems in Argentina has been done  Prospects remain very  uncertain  In Brazil, markets have been giving President Lula the benefit of the doubt  since the election  But the most recent moves on financial markets have been to take  back some of the good news of lower spreads and stronger currency  Much depends  on whether the politics of his program can succeed in an environment of fiscal and  monetary restraint, and uncertainty remains very great  Only in Mexico do we see  grounds for optimism  Our outlook for acceleration in Mexican output is closely tied  to the projected recovery in US manufacturing production     Your final international chart (chart 13) addresses the external sector of the US   economy  The real exchange value of the dollar as measured by our broad index has  depreciated on balance since its peak in early 2002, as the staff projected at the time  of the June chart show  The most recent move down reflects significant nominal  depreciation in terms of the other major currencies  With the real dollar already  substantially lower than one year ago, we project only modest further depreciation   January 28-29, 2003 79 of 195    through the end of the forecast period  We judge that the ever-present need to attract  growing amounts of net financial inflows to finance the widening current account  deficit will weigh on the dollar  We estimate that real imports (shown to the right)  grew 9 percent last year, with extremely rapid expansion in the first half  Real  exports grew 5 percent, held back by past appreciation of the dollar and only  moderate growth abroad  For this year and next, we project that real exports and  imports will rise at comparable rates  Depreciation of the dollar should boost exports  as foreign output growth remains moderate and should restrain imports some as US  GDP accelerates more strongly  With imports already substantially greater than  exports, similar growth rates over the forecast period imply a small negative  contribution to US real GDP growth from the external sector       Our projection for a widening trade balance largely explains the increase expected   in the current account balance, shown in the middle left panel  That deficit should  reach about $625 billion by the end of next year, 5¼ percent of GDP  The most  recent data available on the financial flows that are the counterpart to that deficit,  shown to the right, give some clues as to the factors moving exchange rates in recent  months  Our estimate for the fourth quarter implies that, during 2002, the current  account balance (line 1 of the table) widened a little more than $100 billion   Increased foreign official holdings of dollars in the United States (line 2) were nearly  as large  Private foreign investors (line 3) purchased substantial quantities of US  securities, but at a rate slightly below that observed in 2001  Private US investors  (line 4) greatly scaled back their acquisition of foreign securities, lessening the total  financial inflow needed to achieve balance  With mergers and acquisitions very  much reduced, net foreign direct investment into the United States (line 5) is  estimated to have been negative last year     The final two panels present some foreign detail for two of the alternative   simulations that we have recently provided to you  The panel on the left reports the  change in foreign real GDP growth that our model projects in the case of a six-month  war with a limited embargo, one of the four scenarios that Sandy discussed  For these  countries, there are no positive impulses from enlarged government spending, only  the effects of higher oil prices and the spillovers that occur across countries  For  2003, the consequences for foreign output growth range from negligible to about  minus ¾ percentage point  In 2004, as in the United States, the assumption that the  oil price falls below baseline by mid-2003 results in a boost to output growth, and our  model calls for growth above baseline for these foreign economies  The panel to the  right gives detail for the Greenbook scenario of a $20 rise in the price of oil that lasts  four quarters and that includes an additional shock to confidence  In this case, the oil  price rise is a bit less than assumed for the limited embargo, but it lasts twice as long   As a consequence, the oil-producing countries of Mexico and Canada experience this  as a positive shock to output in 2003  For the other countries, the added confidence  factors significantly increase the contractionary effect of the higher oil prices  With  oil prices back to baseline in 2004 and the effects of the shock to confidence waning,  output growth rebounds to varying degrees in most of these countries  Larry will now  complete our presentation   January 28-29, 2003 80 of 195        You know, I’ve asked every Canadian economist I’ve run into over the   past nine months why Canada is doing so well when other countries are not  Partly it may be a   fortuitous mix in what their economy produces  Canada is not as heavily high-tech oriented as   we are, Nortel notwithstanding, and it did not experience the excesses of the high-tech bubble to   the extent that we did  So the capital overhang in that sector as a proportion of their total GDP   structure—     They do, but Nortel itself is a huge share of the Toronto stock index    Off the top of my head I can’t answer specifically how large the Canadian wealth effects are    We do have estimates of that  I didn’t bring them with me so I can’t tell you, but I can certainly   find out  Another issue is the exchange rate  The Canadian dollar, all things considered, has   been somewhat weak on a fairly consistent basis     It should be showing up in exports, but it could also show up to some   degree in the willingness of domestic producers to invest  It’s not that exports haven’t been   reasonably strong  It’s just that Canada has been importing as well, so the net export effect is not   all that much  But exports have been doing their share  To some extent the performance of the   auto industry is a factor  The auto industry has been a big part of the strength in the United   States, and Canada shares in that strength in a very direct way  Canada also has been   experiencing a phenomenon in the housing sector that is similar to ours  That sector is very   strong, and it is supporting consumption demand     I don’t know of any specifically Canadian firms that have been making   headlines whereas I could name some European firms, for example  That leads me to conclude,   merely on the face of it, that it may be a bit less in Canada       Right     Well, I might mention another issue that we are constantly looking into    I can’t claim it as a fact, but I still maintain it as a hypothesis  Canada was always a place where   we were looking for an acceleration in productivity growth comparable to the US acceleration   because of their links to us and their similarities to us  It didn’t happen in the 1997-2000 period    It is possible that some of the strength in Canada in 2001 and 2002 is due a bit to the fact that   their productivity improvement is happening a little behind ours in real time, so that it’s   supporting their economy now  But I don’t have actual facts to back up that hypothesis        It was not, in part because their employment growth has been so strong    If one had a crystal ball and could discern the changes in structural productivity from the   adjustment components and so forth, one could draw some conclusions  We on the staff remain   equally interested in and to some degree puzzled by the Canadian performance  We will look   into these specific issues and everything else we can think of to try to learn more about what is   going on in Canada   January 28-29, 2003 83 of 195      Well, the staff members who deal with the domestic side of the   economy might be better able to answer that question  As a preliminary comment on your   question, I would have to say that we’ve thought about this a fair amount, and we really don’t   have any answers  But one of the things that we think helps the thought process is the realization   that, to the extent people are less interested in taking on cross-border exposures, it has an impact   on the current account deficit  That is how that long-term structural problem in the United States   interacts with the geopolitical situation  The euro area and the rest of the world—Japan, in   particular—are running a surplus vis-à-vis the United States  So, let’s say investors in those   areas wish to take on fewer new cross-border commitments  Given that their countries are   running a current account surplus—and conversely we are the deficit country—that sets up a   need for asset prices and exchange rates to change in a way that will induce those investors to   take on enough foreign commitments to enable the balance of payments to balance  To the   extent that US investors seek to keep their funds at home, that helps a bit   I think the box on chart 13 in the chart show illustrates this point  Buried in column 3 of   that chart are both fixed-income and equity transactions  Foreign investors are still willing to   purchase claims on the United States  They’re investing a substantial amount in the United   January 28-29, 2003 86 of 195    States—mostly in fixed-income assets, not so much in equities  The figure was $361 billion last   year, based on not quite complete data  The problem is that our current account deficit is bigger   than that  So a $361 billion inflow from investors seeking to take on assets in the United States   just isn’t sufficient to do the job any longer  There’s a willingness among foreigners to acquire   dollar assets, but a slightly smaller willingness than earlier  US investors are helping by not   wishing, in a gross flow sense, to put assets overseas  But the rest of the world relative to us is in   imbalance  That would be the case even if we pulled the flow of dollar investments overseas   back to zero  Of course, we can make that number positive by not selling our claims in the rest   of the world, so zero is not a bound in any sense  Nevertheless, the order of magnitude is such   that it was a fairly important factor, if you will, in financing our current account deficit last year    Could it become a whole lot higher?  Absolutely  There is no real benchmark for how big these   numbers might become in the various categories if the dollar were to fall sharply    We can look back at the episode from 1985 to 1987 and ask ourselves, How bad was   that?  The United States did rather well, actually  The capacity of the US economy to absorb   relative price changes and to make the shifts necessary is remarkable, I think  The US economy   can probably adjust to a sharply declining dollar just fine  It would help the export sectors and   manufacturers and others who need the help right now and, in some respects, might be just what   the doctor ordered  My concern is that the rest of the world might not be as able to make the   counterpart adjustment  So when they get what is in essence a deflationary shock coming from   the exchange rate, they probably are not going to adjust policy as quickly as we would to   maintain total demand as we did in 1995 to 2002  Nor are their economies inherently as able to   adjust to a change in the mix of manufacturing versus services or the export sector versus the   domestic sector  So global demand may not be invariant to a change in exchange rates that shifts   January 28-29, 2003 87 of 195    demand from production abroad to production in the United States  Therefore, for the global   economy, a sharply falling dollar may have more-adverse consequences than it will have for the   US economy     We will look into it and do what we can     You’ve painted the picture in its extreme form, shall we say, for the   sake of the discussion     Yes  Let me put one additional fact on the table and then try to give   some kind of answer  Brazil’s biggest debt problems are the debts that the Brazilians owe to   other Brazilians  So the consequences for Wall Street or the industrial countries of default by   Brazil vis-à-vis Uruguay differ  Default by Brazil doesn’t really translate into a direct answer as   to how within Brazil to reconcile the pressure for meaningful change in income distribution, in   January 28-29, 2003 93 of 195    opportunities, in government policies, and a host of other regional and structural kinds of   problems  Given the obligations of one Brazilian to another that exist on paper now, how can   that whole situation be worked out and not break down into other problems?  The situation could   lead to violence, unilateral default on some pieces of debt, or behavior on the part of the   government that throws into question the stability of other facets of the social structure  That   really is a much bigger problem than what Brazil owes the rest of the world, and that’s the   problem I think they’re really grappling with     Setting aside Brazil, however, there is this issue of why other countries—Ecuador, to pick   a country almost at random—won’t somehow think the rules have changed  I don’t minimize   this problem that you have posed, but I guess I would use slightly different words to describe   what was done for Argentina  Argentina was not going to pay its debts on January 17, January   24, December 31, or any other date one could name  In no meaningful sense was Argentina   going to pay the IMF or anybody else  So the question for the IMF was, How do we recognize   that fact and try to get ourselves in a position where what happens subsequently in 2003 will   have the best chance of being constructive?  Rightly or wrongly, the G-7 governments felt it was   more likely that the new government in Argentina could be worked with to foster constructive   developments with respect to the country’s long-term problems if the fiction were maintained for   a little while longer that Argentina was not in default to the IMF   It was not entirely the United   States pushing this view, although this country was certainly on that side, but it was the Italians,   the Spanish, and others  So that was done  On the surface of it, I wouldn’t really disagree with   that  I don’t know that forcing the crisis into January, given that we still haven’t seen the   sorting-out in the political parties in Argentina as to who is going to run in the election for   president—and we certainly haven’t had the election—would have made for a better outcome    January 28-29, 2003 94 of 195    But as you mentioned, there are spillover effects in terms of how it was done, and in some   respects those have created very real problems   It is certainly true, and it is symptomatic of why Argentina is where it is today, that the   picture painted in the Argentine press was that it had looked the IMF in the eye and the IMF had   blinked  As far as I know, the Argentine politicians drew that conclusion, too  So until   somebody is prepared to hit those people over the head with a brick and tell them that this isn’t   the way the world works, this is going to continue  If you have any bricks handy, [laughter] I   invite you to do it because that’s why—a year and a half into the crisis—the Argentines still   haven’t figured out who’s going to pay even a piece of the bill, whereas at this point in time the   Asians are busy growing again  The problem is largely within Argentina; it’s a political   problem, and people are still dancing around it  The United States is obviously in a very difficult   situation because it’s hard to do the brick throwing without looking like a heavy to somebody,   particularly to the people hit on the head with a brick  The chances of it somehow all coming out   favorably don’t look good     Well, it’s a tough situation     The staff at the IMF wanted a real program  If it was going to be called   a program, they wanted it to have teeth  Indeed, the managing director had been told originally,   when he first took office, that the IMF was going to have smaller programs and that it was going   to be more realistic and firmer in conducting these types of negotiations  Then he is confronted   with the situation in Turkey and after that Argentina, and it’s very clear that consistency is not   exactly at a high point       Well, it’s certainly true that commodity prices are up a bit in some   categories  I don’t have them corrected in an SDR basket or the like, although I could do that at   some point just to see what it shows  But we would suggest that the increases are occurring   selectively in certain categories where for the most part we think we can explain it on the basis of   January 28-29, 2003 98 of 195    special factors  We don’t see it as a leading indicator of a global recovery or something of that   sort  In a few of the agricultural commodities—cotton and some others that are probably spelled   out in the Greenbook, but I don’t have them memorized—supply-side disappointments or crop   failures or the like have caused prices to go up  Those categories—in contrast to the metals,   say—are the ones in which we’ve seen prices rising  That suggests to us that this chart reflects   more or less a weighted average of a number of market-specific, idiosyncratic developments    "
7017,2003-03-18,"  No, nothing that would go out far enough to answer the question     In putting together the baseline forecast for the rest of the   world, the staff in the International Finance Division grappled with the same issues  that confronted those forecasting the domestic economy, but spread over a wide range  of countries  With the outbreak of war perceived by many to be likely and soon, a  host of indicators and market variables abroad implicitly reflect the weighted average  of market expectations as to the timing of the onset of hostilities and the implications  of subsequent events for economic activity around the globe  Of course these  variables also reflect developments in the underlying economic fundamentals, which  no doubt have changed somewhat since we prepared the January forecast       The clearest instance in which market expectations have provided answers to   critical questions that we otherwise were at a loss to answer is the assumed path for  oil prices in the forecast  As in the past, we have incorporated into the baseline  forecast the futures path for crude oil as observed in the market at the time the  Greenbook forecast was being finalized  That path starts with the price for West  Texas intermediate at an average value of $3523 for the current quarter and has it  dropping more than $550 by the end of this year and nearly another $500 dollars by  the end of next year  Although some volatility in oil prices in the very short run is to  be expected, a sizable decline in global crude oil prices from current levels, starting  by midyear, is an essential factor in our baseline forecast for global growth That  forecast has some continued near-term weakness giving way to growth at an annual  rate of about 3 percent on average in the second half of this year and 3½ percent next  year  The implications of less favorable developments with respect to oil prices vary  somewhat, depending on how long the price of oil remains elevated and whether a  given country is an oil exporter or importer  We reviewed the staff model’s  assessment of the effects of some alternatives in January during the chart show  A  sharp spike up in oil prices that persists for two quarters, what we termed the limited  embargo case, by itself implies negative effects this year on GDP growth in the major  foreign economies that range from negligible to a reduction of ¾ percentage point    March 18, 2003 15 of 101    Alternatively, oil prices could fall further or faster than implied in the futures curve,  with positive effects on growth     A second major factor underlying the forecast is the state of business and   consumer confidence that is incorporated in the forecast, but we cannot quantify these  variables in the way that we can for oil prices  In recent weeks, confidence has  reacted both to the changing prospects of the onset of war and to news about  economic fundamentals  As we reported in the Greenbook, consumer confidence  surveys have moved down further recently, particularly in Europe  We are also  looking for very sluggish or declining domestic demand in the euro area and Japan  during the first quarter  Nonetheless, our projection for an acceleration of activity  abroad over the forecast period includes a strengthening in domestic demand in many  countries that, in turn, is consistent with a moderate and sustained improvement in  confidence  A quick and pronounced move in confidence in either direction,  triggered by geopolitical events, could produce a significant deviation from our  baseline outlook  Sharply higher oil prices could well combine with a fall in  confidence  The version of such joint developments that I included in the January  chart show implied reductions in growth rates of 1 to 2 percentage points in the  foreign industrial countries this year  A positive bounce in sentiment abroad is a clear  upside risk to our forecast, and foreign real GDP has considerable scope in most  countries to grow faster without threatening capacity constraints or heightening price  pressures     We have incorporated specific assumptions about monetary policy actions in the   foreign industrial countries, which support the recovery of economic activity in our  baseline view and are broadly consistent with market expectations for rates  We  expect that the ECB will lower its official rates another 50 basis points by midyear, as  falling oil prices, considerable slack in the economy, and strength in the exchange  value of the euro contribute to improvements in inflation performance  We have  assumed that the Bank of England will move rates down another 25 basis points later  this year as UK inflation also diminishes  In contrast, we see the Bank of Canada  keeping its official rate at its present level through the end of this year, as the  Canadian economy remains near potential and inflation declines from elevated rates  thanks to lower oil prices and some exchange rate appreciation       Should developments surprise us and the markets and the outlook for activity   diverge from our baseline, there is some scope for monetary policy abroad to react   Clearly, lower oil prices, stronger confidence, and more-positive prospects for growth  would imply stronger activity  Such a development might result in the major foreign  central banks choosing not to ease further  On the downside, persistently high oil  prices, even weaker confidence, and reduced growth prospects might elicit immediate  easing and more cumulative easing than we now assume  With rates now at  25 percent or higher in the euro area, the United Kingdom, and Canada, the central  banks in these economies do have some room for maneuver on the downside  The  Bank of Japan, which we assume will keep rates at essentially zero throughout the  forecast period, has been caught up in the problems posed by the zero bound for some   March 18, 2003 16 of 101    time  The Swiss National Bank has recently reduced its target rate nearly to zero, so  it has little room to ease further using that tool     Our crystal ball is least able to help us anticipate the reaction of the foreign   exchange value of the dollar to coming events—a circumstance in which we often  find ourselves  In the days just before the Greenbook forecast was completed, the  dollar reacted to downward pressure that appeared to relate, in part, to heightened  risks for war in the near term  We reacted to market developments by adjusting down  slightly our path for the real weighted-average broad dollar index  Since Greenbook  day, however, the nominal dollar has rebounded somewhat—with the broad index  rising more than ½ percent in nominal terms, apparently on news that action in Iraq is  imminent  I hesitate even to offer a guess as to which way the dollar will move in  reaction to future good news or bad news on events in Iraq  To the extent that the  dollar turns out stronger than we have projected, exports will be restrained and  imports encouraged  However, these partial effects could be offset by effects on  exports and imports from growth outcomes here and abroad that differ from the  baseline       We received data for the US balance of payments in the fourth quarter after the   Greenbook was completed  Those data confirm that the ex post components of the  financing of our current account deficit shifted during 2002  Private foreign net  purchases of US securities slowed from their record pace in 2001, and foreign direct  investment inflows fell sharply  These smaller private inflows were offset by a drop  to zero in the appetite of US investors for foreign securities  Balancing these  changes and the larger current account deficit was a sizable increase in foreign  official acquisition of dollar assets  These shifts reinforce in our minds the judgment  that market participants are unlikely to be willing to continue to add indefinitely to  their claims on the United States at current exchange rates  So we continue to put  into the forecast a slight downward tilt to the path for the real exchange value of the  dollar  However, we recognize that over the forecast period the dollar could in fact  rise at times, and even on balance, as the host of geopolitical and economic risks now  present in the global economy are resolved       My final observation is that the projected recovery in US output growth remains   among the most important factors underlying our baseline forecast for growth abroad   We see various idiosyncratic economic fundamental factors in the individual foreign  economies as shaping our outlook and as conditioning the reaction abroad to near- term geopolitical events  Nevertheless, any developments that would significantly  change the outlook for US economic activity would have major repercussions  abroad  David and I will gladly try to answer your questions    "
7034,2003-03-25,"2  Thank you, Mr Chairman  We, too, posted some charts that I  hope the Presidents have received and can refer to  For the most part, financial  variables abroad have followed the lead of US markets, with certain timing  differences associated with holidays and time zones and whatnot  As you can see in  chart 1, the dollar appreciated against most currencies and on average through the  period from March 12 to the March 18 FOMC meeting  It continued to appreciate                                                     2 The materials used by Ms Johnson are appended to this transcript (appendix 2)   March 25, 2003 4 of 29    slightly after the FOMC meeting, but in the trading after the weekend it moved back  down  Relative to the levels at the time of the FOMC meeting, the changes against  various currencies are for the most part very close to zero  The dollar moved up a  little further today in some cases, but nothing significant  So, it is stronger than  shown in the Greenbook but not greatly different from what it was on FOMC meeting  day       As you can see in chart 2, that’s largely true for most of the forward-looking   curves that we’ve depicted  March 12 is a benchmark we’re using because it was the  time when the oil price turned down and when many stock markets turned up,  although not every financial variable reached its turning point on that date  These  forward rates moved up further through Friday of last week but have since retraced  those moves  So, the net changes over the period since the FOMC meeting are zero,  but it has been a time of fairly substantial volatility      The next chart makes that clear with respect to stock prices, which did continue to   rise through Friday in most places  Japan is a bit of an exception, but in part that’s  owing to a holiday  Subsequently, as the somewhat less favorable news came out  over the weekend and on Monday, stock prices came back down—led in part by US  stock market developments but to a large extent these markets trade first  Again,  these stock market indexes are up substantially from their low points but are not  greatly changed from FOMC day  We have had some news on foreign economic  activity that might be moderately relevant  There is a bit of positive data coming out  of Japan that suggests that the economy may not be as weakly situated for Q1 as  previously expected  So the base on which these events are happening might be a  tiny bit stronger in Japan than we had pictured it  There was today an extraordinary  meeting of the Bank of Japan’s policy board, which was called on fairly short notice   Markets are now puzzled because the outcome of that meeting was a unanimous vote  not to change policy  So it’s a little unclear why the new governor called the meeting  and how to think about the vote today in terms of what the policy board might do two  weeks from now at their regular meeting  Other than some small adjustments of  certain limits and a clear statement that the Bank of Japan stands ready to be flexible  should markets need more liquidity in light of events elsewhere in the world—which  may in fact have been the meeting’s purpose—little else actually came out of the  meeting     The final chart, chart 4, is a picture of recent oil market developments, and I   thought I’d give a little detail on that  As I said a moment ago, oil prices turned down  on March 12  They continued to fall quite sharply in the days following the March 18  FOMC meeting through last Friday  They rose on Monday, which is the last date  plotted on this chart; today, through trading as of now, they have increased a bit more   Three factors, I think, are driving oil markets at the moment  One is the news coming  out of Iraq, which over the weekend turned negative for oil market developments as  much as for other things, though that news was not substantively about oil  The  second factor is that the markets are taking some comfort from the securing of the  southern oil fields in Iraq and the fact that a very limited number of those were set on   March 25, 2003 5 of 29    fire  People believe that the coalition forces now have control of those oil fields and  that is providing some positive news to oil trading The third factor is the negative  news coming out of Nigeria  It appears that the situation in Nigeria is deteriorating  and that certain Western oil companies that have a collaborative relationship with the  government actually are closing down their operations and removing their people  from Nigeria  As much as 800,000 barrels a day could be at stake for the shut-ins that  we now know about  So this news just out of Nigeria combined with the turn of  events after the weekend has caused the oil price to go back up  But obviously it is  significantly lower than it was at its peak and is still markedly lower than it was on  the day of the FOMC meeting  I’ll stop there    "
7043,2003-04-01,"2  Thank you, Mr Chairman  The signals with respect to  economic activity in the rest of the world remain mixed  The theme that one hears in  various reports from abroad is still great uncertainty, and it is the uncertainty more  than anything else that seems to be looming large in the minds of other policy  officials  In the package of charts that we distributed, entitled “Recent Developments  in International Financial Markets,” the first chart shows exchange rate developments   In the week since you last met, the weighted average value of the dollar relative to  other major currencies is down a bit, as shown in the dotted blue line in the bottom  panel  And as you can see in the top panel, it’s noticeably down against the euro (the  red line) and the yen (the black line)  The broad dollar, a measure that brings in  currencies such as the Mexican peso and the currencies of other developing countries,  is shown as the black line in the bottom panel  That is back almost to where it was on  March 12, the date we used as a benchmark because that was the peak in oil prices,  the start of the stock market rally, and the beginning of a bit of a dollar rally     A host of small bits of data have come out about economic activity abroad,   though very little of that is post the onset of war  For the most part the data are  mixed, but for some countries, particularly those in the euro area, they are somewhat  to the soft side  The confidence surveys from the euro area, for example, were down  sharply in March  In particular, the German IFO survey, which was consistent with  the broader euro average and did have some responses since the outbreak of  hostilities, was down substantially  Retail sales in Germany have been down  Today  we got the PMI for the euro area  It was slightly above 50 in February and is now at  484 for March  All the components are lower, with new orders and employment  actually at multiyear lows  So the picture for the euro area economy is confirming  softness; whether it’s softer than in the Greenbook projection is hard to tell with only  these fragments of data  We’ve also received several pieces of weak data for the  United Kingdom  The picture for Japan is, if anything, perhaps slightly the other  way  It’s still quite mixed but may be a bit less negative than the characterization we  gave in the Greenbook  We’ve had data on household consumption in Japan that  indicate positive growth  On the other hand, today we got the Tankan index of  business conditions, and it was weaker than expected and painted a rather pessimistic  view of the business outlook  All in all I think the data have figured a little in  exchange rate moves, but I would tend to agree with Dino and Vincent that the war  news more than these tidbits of economic data have moved markets around  On the  whole the dollar has tended to depreciate but only by a small amount, as chart 1  shows     In chart 2 we have some indicators of how the market perceives policy prospects   abroad  The ECB Council will be meeting this Thursday, two days from now   Statements made by ECB officials suggest strongly that they are anticipating no                                                     2 The materials used by Ms Johnson are appended to this transcript (appendix 2)   April 1, 2003 5 of 34    change in policy on Thursday; they point to the extreme amount of uncertainty as a  reason for not moving The market in the futures sense is not pricing in a move on  Thursday, but if you look at the three-month Eurocurrency futures rates for the  euro—the second panel on the left—you can see that the curve has shifted down  The  rates today (the black line) versus those a week ago (the dashed red line) clearly  indicate that the market is pricing in some additional easing  One can argue about the  amount versus the probability, but clearly market players are expecting more easing  in the euro area, certainly by September  The same can be said of the Bank of  England and the sterling curve  That curve has shifted down (the black line relative  to the red dashed line), pricing in easing by the Bank of England—not immediately  but certainly by June and perhaps even more by September       Stock prices are shown in chart 3  They have moved down since a week ago,   drifting with a sense of economic weakness and the expectation of a more prolonged  war than previously anticipated  Today there was a general move up  You can see a  slight tick up in the last bit of each of those lines, as yesterday’s sharp declines were  retraced a little today in most of these markets  But on the whole, stock prices are  well off the recent peaks associated with the rally that occurred almost immediately  after the onset of the war  Euro area stocks have been particularly volatile and  Japanese stocks a bit less so  But Japanese stocks are flirting with their lows of  March 12 or thereabouts, whereas the other markets are still noticeably above the  levels recorded at that point       Finally, some information on oil prices is depicted in chart 4  Oil prices, too, are   drifting with the economic news and the information people think they’re getting  about the war situation—moving up slightly both in swap terms and near-term  futures  As you can see in the top chart, the price of WTI for May is now above  $30 per barrel  It has been fluctuating in that general vicinity, as has the spot price   In the very near term, oil prices are lower than what we incorporated in the  Greenbook projection; further out they are back to about the same as in the  Greenbook  So as of now the futures curve is telling us that perhaps prices will be  lower sooner than one might have thought, but over a sustained period no lower than  we had incorporated into the Greenbook  You can see in the bottom chart, though,  that futures options allow us to infer a distribution  The red dotted line for December  WTI does have a lot of mass at fairly low prices—say, in the $15 to $20 per barrel  range  It is fairly recently that the shift toward lower prices has occurred and that the  mass has been gathering there  I take that to be a somewhat optimistic sign regarding  oil prices  In Nigeria the good news is that a public-sector strike has been avoided—a  strike that might have complicated and exacerbated the oil-sector situation  The bad  news is that the oil-sector situation is still not good  There’s a story about it in the  Wall Street Journal today that’s pretty negative  In Venezuela, production is actually  holding at somewhat higher levels than one might have expected, and that is a bit of  good news  That’s all I have for today       I don’t have an actual production number for today, but the monthly   number—     Yes, it’s 23, 24  Above 2 is the number people are coalescing around   as the daily production  "
7052,2003-04-08,"2  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the set of  international charts distributed to you earlier  In chart 1, which shows a few bilateral  exchange rates and indexes for the trade-weighted value of the dollar, you can see  that the dollar continued to strengthen on balance over the past week  For the week, it  is now up against the major currencies by a little more than 1 percent but less than  1½ percent  Notice that it has moved up and down, driven in large part by war news,  so the absence of some good news today—the chart was updated this morning—has  caused it to drop back a bit  But the dollar has been rising fairly steadily, as the news  out of Iraq seems to have been favorable over the past two weeks  The pattern is  similar for changes in the dollar’s value against the European currencies and the yen   But the exchange rate against the Canadian dollar (the bottom line in green) has been  quite flat     Chart 2 depicts the outlook for short-term rates from which we infer market   expectations about policy moves by the foreign central banks  Last week’s yield  curves are the dashed red line; this morning’s are the solid black line  You can see  that some of the expectation of monetary easing abroad that was priced into markets  last week has been removed  That’s particularly the case for sterling, where a bit of  ease is still priced in; but of the probably 50 basis points in there last week, about  25 have come out as a consequence of recent favorable developments  I think those  developments have led to the expectation that a global recovery is more likely than it  seemed a week ago     The third chart reports on stock prices in major foreign countries  Again, they   have moved up on balance but took a bit of a step back today absent some positive  news to which markets would have responded  Notice in particular that European  stocks are outpacing the others; relative to other markets, European stocks are now  further above the levels reached with the initial bounce that occurred after March 12   In contrast, share prices in Japan have not recovered to the extent they have in other  markets  The index for total stocks is off its lows in Japan but not as much as                                                     2 The materials used by Ms Johnson are appended to this transcript (appendix 2)   April 8, 2003 5 of 31    elsewhere, and in particular the bank sub-index of the TOPIX (the dotted blue line)  has been underperforming very sharply  So it is the weakness of Japanese bank stock  prices that is holding down overall stock prices in Japan, producing a rather different  perspective in that country in terms of the optimism being reflected in share prices   To some degree those bank stock prices are down because of new share issuance,  which is a way that some of the large banks that are in financial straits are raising  capital  But that, of course, has had an effect on prices by diluting the value of the  outstanding shares  Even so, I think one could say that the market is indicating as  well that the situation in Japan is not really improving, particularly in the banking  sector      Consumer confidence in Japan remains very weak  We did see a couple of   positive signs from the real economy that I mentioned last week  I think one could  say that the recent past and the near term in Japan look flat  It’s probably hard to  believe that further contraction is inevitable but that the economy really is not  recovering in any sense  On the other hand, in the rest of the major industrial  countries, given a good war outcome and favorable stock price developments, I think  we are going to see a mild but nonetheless positive expansion in the first half of this  year       That outcome, however, is heavily dependent on oil prices, which are shown in   the last exhibit, chart 4  Oil prices have come down further today  The spot price is  trading at about $28 dollars a barrel, which is approximately the same as for the May  futures contract  The whole futures curve has shifted down for the near term; but in  the further-out timeline quotes, prices are about the same as in the March Greenbook   As a consequence, the futures curve is considerably flatter than it was at the time of  the Greenbook, and much but not all of the backwardation is now gone  With respect  to the risk imbedded in that futures curve, I would point out that currently we have  reports of some fighting in Kirkuk and Mosul, which are near the northern oil fields  of Iraq  In that region the Iraqis, on the one hand, and the Kurds and the US troops,  on the other, are beginning now to interact militarily  The risk of damage to the oil  wells there I think is still an open question  At the moment there is no report of such  damage, but securing those oil fields will require some military action first  I would  say that that process has begun, but uncertainty about the fate of the oil wells in that  region remains       The low level of the current spot price and the shifting down of the futures curve   have triggered a response from OPEC, which has called a meeting sooner than one  would have been scheduled otherwise  Their basket of oil prices is now around the  middle of their target range, and I think there is some concern among OPEC members  that the price might continue to fall  A major concern is that the whole futures curve  might shift down as opposed to what has happened so far, which is that the front end  has moved down to a flatter position  It is the case that Saudi Arabia has been  pumping more oil than is considered “normal,” so to speak  A natural reaction might  be for Saudi Arabia to cut back its production from this elevated level to something in  the range of 8 million barrels a day or even less  That would be one way to sustain oil   April 8, 2003 6 of 31    prices near the midpoint of OPEC’s target range and not allow those prices to go  further below it  In Nigeria oil production appears to be coming back  There are now  announced plans to resume pumping approximately half of the 800,000 barrels that  were lost  That is, the security in Nigeria has improved in some places but not  throughout the country, so some wells will be left unused—for a time anyway  But  other parts of the Nigerian oil production sector are going to be restaffed, and the oil  will begin to flow again  Oil inventories are still somewhat low, but we’ve noticed in  the most recent US data an indication that inventories are building and rather sharply  so  All in all, the picture in the oil market is one of fairly well maintained quantities  and lower prices, with prospects for still lower prices absent a sharp reaction from  OPEC and Saudi Arabia in terms of production quantities  That’s all I have, Mr  Chairman       Well, as you can see in my chart, which was benchmarked off   March 12—a date chosen because that was a trough before the turning point in markets as   opposed to war-related moves—they had fallen a lot further as well     So in some sense the question is why the euro area markets are more   volatile in both directions  One explanation might be that stock capitalization relative to GDP is   lower in Europe than it is in the United States and it is a smaller, more volatile component of   corporate finance than in the United States  Now, when European stock prices were going down   last month, somebody asked me a similar question, and I did a little digging and came up with a   couple of reasons that those prices might have been particularly depressed in the middle of   March  In part, there was a lot of distress in insurance stocks at that time, and the insurance and   reinsurance industries in Europe were particularly hard hit  To be honest, I haven’t checked on   this in the last two or three days, but on at least one earlier day I was told by someone from New   York—maybe Dino can confirm this—that insurance stock prices had been moving up  It may   be that the insurance sector is reacting to both the good news and the bad news in a greater   way—and that sector looms larger in the European indexes because those markets are smaller   than the US market to begin with  Another major piece in the European markets was the Ahold   situation, which when it broke pushed stock prices down further  To the extent that there was   sympathy selling at that time, that may have provided some room for stock prices to come back   more as those correlations are coming undone now  "
7068,2003-04-16,"2  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I will be referring to the charts  entitled “International Financial Markets” that we sent out to you  I would agree with  Dino’s characterization that the changes we’ve seen in global financial markets and in  the information we get from market chitchat reflect a swing back to a focus on  economic news from war news  Economic developments, such as they are, are the  factors that are moving these markets  Over the past week since your previous  conference call, there has been no really dramatic trend that these markets have  shared in common  In some sense the moves are sideways or only slightly up or  down across these markets     Chart 1 depicts selected exchange rates  In the eight days since your previous   conference call last Tuesday, the dollar has moved down just a bit on a weighted- average nominal basis against the major foreign currencies—that’s the dotted blue  line in the bottom chart  In particular, the dollar has been moving down in most  recent days against the euro and the Canadian dollar  The Bank of Canada raised its  official lending rate 25 basis points this week  Bank officials cited inflation and the  implications for activity of capacity utilization of resources as reasons for the increase  and referred as well to what they perceived to be a better balance with respect to  factors coming from outside the Canadian economy  The yen versus the dollar has  moved largely sideways  We have been tracking commercial bank deposits with the  Bank of Japan as carried on the balance sheet of the Bank of Japan  Those deposits  grossed 35 trillion yen at the end of the fiscal year on March 31 and presumably are  heading back down toward the target of 22 trillion yen  But they have been in the  vicinity of 27 trillion to 28 trillion yen for some time now, and the Bank of Japan  clearly is in no hurry, at least, to move them all the way back down to 22 trillion  If  anything, the level at which the BOJ is maintaining those liquid balances has been  relatively narrow recently     Chart 2 depicts short-term interest rates as measured by three-month   Eurocurrency futures rates on the left; there’s a longer-term look on the right in  calculated one-year forward rates derived from swaps  Short-term interest rates have  changed only slightly, and the direction is somewhat mixed  They are up for the euro  and sterling, consistent with what we interpret as a further lessening of expectations  of policy ease by the ECB or by the Bank of England  In market terms, there is still  an expectation that the ECB is going to ease by perhaps another 25 basis points some  time during this year, but there is no high probability built into such a move any time  soon  In yen rates we’ve seen downward moves in the longer-term area to new record                                                    2 The materials used by Ms Johnson are appended to this transcript (appendix 2)      April 16, 2003 6 of 47    lows; and Japanese ten-year and twenty-year rates are falling further, having reached  remarkably low levels earlier this week     Chart 3 shows stock markets, which have already been characterized a bit  I   would point out that there is a difference between what is happening in Europe versus  Japan  European indexes are still well off their lows of March 12, and they have  moved up further over the past week in line with US markets, which Vincent was  talking about just a minute ago  In Japan, stock prices are down on balance since last  Tuesday, although they have moved up just a bit in the last two days  Generally they  moved sideways in March and to date in April rather than having the clear upward  trend displayed in the other panels of the chart  There is an issue being talked about  with respect to Japanese share prices that we do not know exactly how to quantify  It  has to do with an incentive now in effect for private pension plans to give back to the  government management of the public portion of what in fact are shared pension  plans  Allegedly that is triggering sales of equities, but there’s really no way to  establish how important that is in explaining why Japanese share prices are not rising  while those elsewhere generally are rising  As for countries not shown on the chart,  share prices have been moving down in Hong Kong and Singapore—which we are  attributing in part to the consequences of SARS on those economies—and have been  moving up in Korea and Taiwan      Finally, chart 4 reports the latest developments in oil prices  Oil prices have   edged up most recently  Today spot is trading around $29, and the May contract is at  that level, too  As you can see in the top panel, the June contract actually is slightly  lower, reflecting the fact that the near-term portion of the futures curve still has a  slightly downward slope  So futures prices fall a bit from May and June, but as I  mentioned last week, the curve has flattened and is pretty much flat after mid-2004 or  so  I can report, as you probably already know, that the oil fields in northern Iraq are  now secure, so that source of risk to oil prices seems to have abated  OPEC is  planning a meeting on April 24 to address issues with respect to price, including  concerns that oil markets are in fact oversupplied—which they have at least  suggested—and that further downward pressure on prices is a risk  As for Nigeria, no  new element is threatening in events there, but the unfolding of the election process is  ongoing  Parliamentary elections have been held, and the presidential elections are to  be held shortly  We have seen some violence as a consequence of elections being  conducted, which suggests that there’s some risk of further disruption  The country is  at the point where about half of the shut-in capacity has been restored  So of the  800,000 that was shut-in, 300,000 to 400,000 is thought to be back in operation  That  concludes my remarks               We think it will be visible in the data in some sense for Hong Kong and   Singapore most especially and perhaps a tiny bit for China  Based on what we now know, we   think the effects will be enough to show through but not be a major source of pressure  There   really is no way of knowing if SARS is about to be contained and recede or whether it’s going to   continue to surprise us  And if it continues to surprise us, it’s unclear whether it will be as a   nagging but still small factor or if it will grow  So in all honesty I really can’t answer the   question  Our thinking now is that this will be a major factor only in the places where it has   already been very evident as such  But that judgment is based on the lack of any reason for   making a more aggressive assumption  We’re just in a wait-and-see mode  "
7092,2003-05-06,"  In constructing our outlook for the rest of the world this time,   the task we faced was basically the same one we confront each Greenbook  We  needed to determine to what extent the information we had received over the  intermeeting period was consistent with our forecast in March and to what extent it  represented unexpected developments that appropriately required some adjustments  to our projection for this year and next  Although the task was familiar and routine,  the challenge was particularly difficult this time as so much of what has happened  since your meeting in March was driven by the extraordinary events in Iraq  For the  last three to four weeks, since the phase of major hostilities in Iraq wound down,  global financial markets appear to have responded to fundamental economic news  more than was the case earlier in the intermeeting period  Nevertheless, we have little  hard evidence on developments in the real sectors of foreign economies since the  most acute geopolitical risks substantially abated      May 6, 2003 13 of 115    Developments in global oil markets are the most straightforward to evaluate   Relative to our forecast in the March Greenbook, we are now projecting the average  spot price for WTI oil in the current quarter to be $9 lower  The same comparison for  the fourth quarter of next year yields a difference of less than $1  Thus events have  largely pulled forward in time a reduction in world oil prices that had been expected  to occur but more slowly  The most direct effect of that change is on the total cost of  imported oil for most countries, including our own, and we have visibly reduced the  US external deficit this year and next year accordingly  For major US trading  partners who are also oil exporters, such as Mexico, we have incorporated a negative  hit to their trade balance and to their aggregate income       The indirect effects of the lower path for global oil prices are less straightforward    We judge that confidence on the part of consumers and businesses abroad should be  boosted by the rapid fall in oil prices and the consequent benefit to real disposable  income and business costs  That difference should be greatest in the near term  To  date we have limited evidence on confidence abroad since the end of hostilities, and  what we do have presents a somewhat mixed picture  On balance, we saw the lower  oil prices as a moderate positive for consumer and business spending abroad,  particularly for the rest of this year     The foreign exchange value of the dollar fluctuated somewhat widely in the days   just before and following your March meeting, mostly in response to developments  within Iraq  Since early April, however, the dollar has trended down on balance and  in terms of the index of major foreign currencies has recently moved below its  March 12 low point  No doubt more by luck than any forecasting skill we might  have, fluctuation of the dollar–euro rate left that pair about in line with the path we  wrote down in March  We have adjusted down the US dollar in terms of the  Canadian dollar and the Mexican peso  In contrast, we have adjusted the dollar up in  terms of the yen  Taken together, these changes imply a slightly weaker level for the  real value of the dollar in terms of our broad index of trading-partner currencies, but  the rate of change from here through the end of the forecast period is projected to be  about the same as in our previous forecast     As in the United States, stock prices in most major foreign economies have rallied   in recent weeks  Equity prices are now up for the year in many European markets   The average across Europe represented by the DJ Euro Stoxx price index is back to  no net change for the year, after reaching a low of 20 percent below its late December  level on March 12  Stock prices are up on balance this year in major Latin American  emerging-market countries also, including Mexico and Brazil  For those countries,  EMBI+ spreads on dollar bond rates are down substantially as well  We interpret  these favorable developments in financial markets as consistent with an improvement  in confidence over time and a strengthening of real GDP growth  For now we judge  these developments to be in line with the pace of strengthening that we projected in  March but not a reason for revising upward our growth outlook for these countries      May 6, 2003 14 of 115    Stock prices in Japan and emerging Asia are the exception to the general picture  of rising equity values  In Japan, stock prices touched new twenty-year lows on  several occasions during the intermeeting period  Although some prices rebounded  near the end of the period, the major stock price indexes remain well below their  values at the start of this year  We attribute the downward trend in Japanese stock  prices to the domestic concerns that continue to dog the Japanese economy, plus some  possible spillover from rising tensions with respect to North Korea and the effects of  SARS on Japan’s major trading partners in the region  The latest data have left us  slightly more optimistic about the pace of economic activity in Japan this year, but we  do not detect any evidence that would call for a major revision to our outlook for  economic activity in that country     One new element in the global economic picture since your March meeting has   been the emergence of SARS as a major economic threat to most of the emerging  Asia region  Even though we have no expertise in anticipating the course of the  disease, construction of the Greenbook baseline forecast required that we make a set  of working assumptions about its implications for economic activity  As we reported  in the Greenbook, we incorporated into the forecast the likely consequences of SARS  based on the information known at that time  In large part that involved limiting the  effect of SARS primarily to key service sectors such as travel and entertainment and  positing that its adverse effects would be felt mainly in the current quarter  We have  added some small positive payback later this year and in early 2004 as the lost travel  and sales are partially recouped  This approach yielded an estimate of a downward  revision to growth this year in developing Asia that averaged about 05 percentage  point owing to the SARS outbreak  Based on the information we have to date, we see  the effects as largest for Hong Kong, somewhat less but still quite visible for China  and Singapore, and much smaller for various other Asian emerging-market  economies     The end product of our attempts to incorporate these various developments   into the baseline forecast is a projection for total foreign output growth of  about 2 percent in the first half of this year—¼ percentage point lower than  we had in March—followed by growth of 3 percent in the second half of this  year and about 35 percent next year  As is the case with the domestic  forecast, despite quite favorable outcomes of many events related to the Iraqi  conflict, we have revised down the path of foreign GDP  Most of the  downward revision is due to our estimate of the near-term effects of SARS on  global growth  The weaker projection for US real output growth is a factor  as well, particularly for Canada and Mexico  The more favorable oil price  developments and some buoyancy in global financial markets provide a small  offset  That concludes our remarks  We’d be happy to answer any questions    "
7118,2003-06-24,"  Well—  [Laughter]  The staff, as you know, did a paper that received   some attention in which we came to the conclusion that the Japanese started too late     That’s an easy answer to give after the fact, and I hope we conveyed in   the paper the thought that as we witnessed that period in real time we, too, did not perceive that   Japan was sliding into the difficult situation that subsequently developed  So, that’s meant to be   a red flag  But it’s also meant not to trivialize the problem of our inability to see the future with   any great clarity     Relative to the kinds of options that these gentlemen have put on the table today, I think   there would be a lot of agreement that there was one thing the Bank of Japan did that was very   wrong  Namely, at each step along the way they portrayed the situation as abnormal and an   emergency, and they indicated that the actions they were taking made them uncomfortable and   that it was their intent to return to more-normal operations absolutely as soon as possible  That   certainly characterized their first steps in the direction of zero interest rates, and I think they’ve   probably learned from that mistake  One doesn’t hear Japanese officials use that kind of   language any longer  But in the earlier stages there was always a tone that they grudgingly were   going to do a little more if they had to and were going to take it back just as soon as they could    Admittedly, some of the things that made them uncomfortable are the very problems that have   been identified here  And those are real problems  But I think the Japanese limited the   effectiveness of their actions by this overtone they used to characterize the steps they were taking   as they announced them     Right, and a failure to perceive the expectations part of it  I think they   were counting on their statements to help a lot because of what otherwise isn’t available to   policymakers at zero interest rates  I don’t think they really embraced the concept of   June 24-25, 2003 21 of 211    expectations enough at the time, even intellectually, in terms of the importance of getting   expectations to work with the policymakers instead of working against them     Your first international chart presents an overview of   developments in selected international financial markets  As can be seen in the top  left panel, both the narrow index of the foreign exchange value of the dollar in terms  of the currencies of the major foreign industrial countries (in black) and the broad  index that also includes the currencies of our other important trading partners (in red)  have fallen further and at a faster rate since the January chart show than during the six  preceding months  On balance, the index for major currencies has fallen 6 percent  since the end of January this year and nearly 20 percent from its peak value at the end  of January 2002  As can be seen in the panel on the right, the dollar has depreciated  particularly sharply in terms of the euro, moving down about 25 percent from its  recent peak in January of last year  The dollar has fallen significantly against both the  Canadian dollar and the yen as well, with the stepdown against the yen coming during  the first half of 2002; the yen–dollar rate has fluctuated narrowly and changed little  on balance since then       The depreciation of the dollar has been broadly consistent with changes in   corresponding long-term interest differentials, shown in the middle left panel   Although dollar rates are above yen rates, they are below rates in Germany and  Canada  Since the January chart show, ten-year government bond yields have  decreased in these markets, but US dollar rates have dropped more than German and  Japanese rates       Borrowing costs have diminished for emerging-market economies as well in   recent weeks  EMBI+ spreads for Argentina and Brazil, shown on the right, have  fallen to levels not recorded since the spring of last year  Apparent increased market  willingness to invest in riskier assets and to seek return as yields have fallen in the  industrial countries partly accounts for the declines in spreads  The absence of any  major unfavorable developments within these emerging-market economies likely  contributed as well     As can be seen in the bottom panels, stock prices are generally up in recent weeks   in the foreign industrial countries (on the left), and major emerging-market economies  (on the right)  But since the January chart show, stock prices in continental Europe  and Japan are up somewhat less than the S&P 500       Your next chart reports the results of our efforts to use the staff’s econometric   models of the United States and the rest of the world to address the question, “What  have been the effects of the dollar depreciation to date?”  Clearly our answer depends  on the properties of our particular models  But even for a given model, there is no  single answer to that question because, in order to design the exercise for the model,  the analyst must give a reason why, in the counterfactual scenario, the dollar would  not depreciate as it had in fact done in real time        June 24-25, 2003 70 of 211    For our first counterfactual scenario, we posited that each bilateral dollar  exchange rate in the model remained at its value in the first quarter of 2002, when the  dollar on average peaked  We also held short-term monetary policy interest rates  constant at their values in 2002Q1 because the exchange rate is importantly affected  by monetary policy and we wanted to begin with no exchange rate effects coming  from changes in policy rates  This scenario treats the constant paths of exchange  rates as resulting from shocks to risk premium terms in the equations that relate  exchange rates to long-term interest differentials and the counterfactual short-term  interest rates  As can be seen in the top left panel of the chart, the effect of the dollar  depreciation since early last year as structured in our simulation has been to increase  import price inflation (the bars) above what it otherwise would have been by an  amount that rises to more than 4 percentage points for the first half of this year and  then diminishes somewhat  Such an increase in import prices is large enough to make  a difference for PCE inflation (the black line)  The staff’s FRB/Global model  calculates that the increase in PCE inflation owing to the dollar as modeled in this  case rises to ½ percentage point in the second half of this year  As can be seen in the  right panel, the weaker dollar is also a net stimulus for real GDP growth  In this  scenario, that stimulus is calculated to have been negligible in 2002 but to have added  about ½ percentage point to real GDP growth in the first half of this year and is  projected to add 1 percentage point in the second half  Other models might not  estimate effects quite this large     The answers provided by the first scenario reflect the imposed condition that   short-term interest rates remain unchanged  In general, monetary officials could be  expected to respond to the consequences of strong exchange rate pressures   Accordingly, the middle row of panels provides a second set of estimates in which we  retained the shocks to the exchange rate risk premiums calculated in the first case but  allowed the model to adjust monetary policy both here and abroad in response to  these developments and their effects on output and prices according to Taylor rules   As a consequence, both interest rates and exchange rates do not remain unchanged at  their 2002Q1 level  This counterfactual allows for some feedback on exchange rates  from the monetary policy response to the pressure on the dollar and its consequences   When monetary policy is allowed to respond, the calculated implications for US  import prices, consumer prices, and real GDP growth of the dollar depreciation since  early last year are damped  In this estimate, the effects on import price inflation rise  only to around 2¾ percentage points, so PCE inflation is boosted only ¼ percentage  point  The estimated stimulus to real GDP growth is reduced to less than  ¼ percentage point in the second half of this year  As is evident from the range  defined by these two estimates, there is no single answer to this question  But we see  this range as a reasonable bound for the extent to which dollar depreciation to date  has raised US inflation—and so countered deflation—and helped to support real  output growth       The effects on other countries are reported in the bottom panels as “fixed” for   unchanged policy rates and “Taylor” for policy rates governed by Taylor rules  The  euro area experiences a substantial reduction in price inflation and GDP growth even   June 24-25, 2003 71 of 211    in the case in which monetary policy reacts to the exchange rate pressure, suggesting  that the appreciation of the euro is important in explaining current euro-area  sluggishness  By contrast, the effects are much smaller on the other industrial  countries  The currencies of developing Asia were fairly stable against the dollar  over the past six quarters, so they too have experienced depreciation on a weighted  average basis since 2002Q1  Thus our model estimates that they have experienced  higher inflation and stronger output growth as a result of currency depreciation to  date       Your next chart presents some evidence on the stance of monetary policy that is   currently in place in two of the major foreign industrial economies—the euro area and  Canada  The top panels show our calculations for each of these regions of the output  gaps currently implied by our baseline forecast  For the euro area (on the left), the  gap will widen over the forecast period, as growth remains below potential until near  the end of the forecast period  In contrast, we project that actual output will remain  slightly above potential in Canada over the same period  This projection assumes  another easing of 50 basis points by the ECB by year’s end and no change in the  Canadian policy rate     The middle left panel compares the actual path of the ECB’s policy rate (the black   line) with the expectation for that rate that we incorporated into the Greenbook at the  time of your chart show one year ago (the red line) and to the market’s expectation at  that time (the dashed blue line)  Since mid-2002, the ECB has implemented a  somewhat easier policy than we and the markets were expecting a year ago, as  economic performance has been disappointing  The bottom panel compares the  ECB’s policy rate to two variants of a Taylor rule prescription  The first, the red line  labeled “Taylor Rule #1,” utilizes imposed coefficients that equally weight deviations  of inflation and growth  By that standard, the ECB has been a bit more expansionary  than the Taylor rule indicates, as the rule implies continued effort to move inflation  below the 2 percent target       The standard Taylor rule can be criticized as incorporating insufficient forward-  looking information  The recent declines in oil prices and the appreciation of the euro  can be expected to lower inflation in the euro area over coming quarters  In the spirit  of including these factors into the assessment of the current policy stance, we  calculated “Taylor Rule #2,” the dotted blue line, retaining the same coefficients but  substituting for observed inflation the staff forecast for inflation six quarters ahead   By that standard, ECB policy has been and continues to be tighter than the rule would  prescribe, even given the recent cut of 50 basis points       Similar comparisons are presented for the Bank of Canada policy rate on the right    A year ago, we and the market were expecting the Bank of Canada to tighten by more  than in fact has been the case to date  Although Canadian economic growth has  remained above potential, the slowing of the US economy and the appreciation of  the Canadian dollar stayed the hand of the Bank in raising rates  Compared with  Taylor rule calculations, in the bottom right panel, the Canadians appear to have been   June 24-25, 2003 72 of 211    somewhat expansionary  The move up in rule #1 reflects the rise in headline  inflation, which in turn owes importantly to oil prices       On balance, the success of the Bank of Canada in keeping that economy close to   potential suggests that they have adjusted policy sufficiently in response to economic  developments over the past year  For the ECB, the picture is more clouded  Since  2002 Q1, the ECB has lowered rates a total of 125 basis points  We cannot replicate  for certain with our models exactly what the shocks have been that have struck that  economy since early 2002  But our attempts to quantify the effect of the exchange  rate change over that interval suggest that the ECB would need to lower rates  significantly more, perhaps as much as a total of 300 basis points, to offset the  contractionary effect on euro-area GDP of the exchange rate change they have  experienced      Our outlook this time for the US external sector is summarized on the next   chart  Total foreign real GDP growth, line 1 in the top left panel, is projected to grow  at an annual rate of about 2½ percent during the second half of the year—a substantial  acceleration of real GDP from the first half  Next year, we look for growth abroad to  rise further  Among the industrial countries, activity is likely to remain lackluster in  Japan and improve only gradually in the euro area, whereas Canada should continue  to outperform the other foreign industrial countries  Growth in developing Asia (the  right panel) is projected to rebound over the second half of this year, but to a lesser  extent than we previously thought, as incoming data have surprised us on the low  side  We are also expecting a pickup in expansion in Latin America, with Mexican  real growth recovering in line with US growth     Our forecast for the real exchange value of the dollar in terms of all of our trading   partners (the middle left panel) reflects the downward shift in the market value of the  dollar that has occurred since your January chart show  We still see likely factors that  will put upward pressure on the dollar—as the US recovers more vigorously than  elsewhere—and factors that will put downward pressure on the dollar, as the  financing needs of the widening external deficit grow over the period ahead  With no  way to judge just how these will balance over time, we have put into the forecast a  very gradual downward trend in the dollar, reflecting the inevitable need for external  adjustment to occur some day     The implications for real exports and imports of a lower path for the dollar, a   slightly stronger outlook for the US economy, and a somewhat weaker foreign  outlook, especially in the near term, are shown to the right  Exports (in red) are  projected to rebound and to make a significant positive contribution to GDP growth  through 2004  Imports (in blue) should expand some during the rest of this year and  then accelerate strongly, resulting in a negative contribution of more than  1 percentage point in 2004  On balance, real net exports should make a small positive  contribution over the remainder of this year and a moderate negative one during next  year      June 24-25, 2003 73 of 211    Our near-term projection for the current account, the bottom left panel, is for the  deficit to reach $600 billion by the end of next year  The widening of the projected  trade deficit explains all of the change in our outlook for the current account balance   The table on the right reports the data just released for the balance of payments in the  first quarter  Whereas net official inflows (line 1) rose in the first quarter from their  average last year, net private financial inflows (line 2) slowed  Within private flows,  foreign purchases of US securities (line 3) diminished, and foreigners were net  sellers of US equity (line 4)  The resumption of US purchases of foreign securities  (line 5), particularly equity, contributed to the US external financing need  Foreign  direct investment into the United States (line 7) recovered to a pace about equal to  US direct investment abroad  Going forward, we expect that more-robust US  growth will continue to attract foreign private financial inflows, but the financing  need will be growing as well  Accordingly, some additional net inflows of official  capital and some downward nominal adjustment of the dollar are likely  David  Wilcox will now continue our presentation    "
7144,2003-08-12,"  Well, I’d say that the improvement that’s apparent in Argentina—  whether it will be long-lasting is a different question—no doubt has had an impact in getting   people to use the domestic currency there     The staff outlook for real GDP abroad in the current Greenbook   is little changed from the one we presented last time  Again this round we are  looking for real growth in the rest of the world to strengthen on average from less  than 1 percent in the first half to about 2½ percent in the second half of this year and  to nearly 3½ percent during next year  With the calendar now telling us that we are  well into August and thus about halfway through the third quarter, you might  reasonably expect that evidence of such an acceleration should be emerging in the  data for real activity abroad       For July, we are mostly limited to survey data for evidence on production and   demand  But it is encouraging and consistent with our forecast that euro area and  UK PMI reports and euro area consumer confidence figures for July show  improvement as do readings on UK business confidence and Japanese business  conditions for small and medium sized enterprises  We have a wider range of data on  real economies abroad for the second quarter, and I scrutinized these data for  developments during the quarter that supported our projection of accelerating  economic activity  After showing weakness in May, German manufacturing orders  moved up strongly in June  French industrial production fell significantly in April  and May but then rebounded in June  UK industrial production also strengthened in  June  At least in part, both of these indexes reflected a jump in energy generation that  may have been tied to the very hot summer weather  The preliminary figure for UK  second-quarter real GDP shows a rebound in growth from the flat first-quarter  outcome  Canadian employment moved up strongly in June but slipped back a bit in  July  In Japan, machinery orders rose in May and June, and housing starts ended the  quarter with a sizable increase  Among the Asian emerging-market economies,  export orders expanded in Singapore in July; and industrial production in June  rebounded or strengthened further in several, including China, Taiwan, Korea, and  Singapore  But to be honest, some indicators signaled deceleration over the quarter,  with drops in June in industrial production in Germany, Italy, and Japan  Japanese  GDP, released this morning, reportedly grew more than 2 percent at an annual rate in  the second quarter, surprising us and most other forecasters, particularly with respect  to exports  All in all, my list of confirming data seems far from conclusive, and  indicators from Germany and Japan appear to be mixed  Nevertheless, although we  detected no basis in these data for an upward revision to our forecast, we saw no need  for a downward revision  So we have maintained the same positive trajectory for  total foreign GDP that we had presented in the previous Greenbook     Our reading of financial market developments over the intermeeting period is that,   on balance, market participants have become somewhat more optimistic about near- term activity abroad, confirming our basic view and leaving financial conditions  generally supportive of recovery  Since the June FOMC meeting, euro and sterling  three-month eurocurrency futures rates have shifted up, removing from market rates   August 12, 2003 16 of 110    expectations of further easing on the part of the ECB and Bank of England We see  positive market reaction to the most recent indicators, along with statements by  Japanese officials and the ECB about more-favorable prospects in their respective  economies, as consistent with our expectation that economic activity abroad is  already recovering from the sluggish pace earlier this year      Further gains in equity prices in the major foreign industrial countries over the   intermeeting period reinforce the view that market participants see stronger activity  and improved corporate earnings as likely in the near term  Moreover, greater total  stock market wealth should have some positive effect on household spending and  should provide some stimulus for business capital expenditure  The Japanese TOPIX  index rose sharply in early July as foreign investors reportedly augmented their  holdings of Japanese equity  Although some of those gains subsequently were  retraced, the index is up about 5 percent since the June FOMC meeting  Stock  indexes are also up on balance over the period in the euro area, Switzerland, the  United Kingdom, and Canada  All of these indexes remain well above their recent  lows in March       Ten-year government interest rates have risen as well, with rates in the major   foreign countries reaching a low in mid-June and climbing rapidly since then  Market  commentary linked movements in foreign rates to those for dollar rates, as discussed  by Dino and David, and most foreign rates displayed volatility similar to that for US  rates in recent weeks  This co-movement at least in part reflects shifts in demand by  global investors as expectations for future monetary policy here and abroad evolved  and as returns on dollar securities rose  However, long-term rates abroad, particularly  those in Europe, moved up significantly less than did US rates  With the exception  of Japan, long-term rates are now back about to where they were in late April and  early May  Japanese ten-year rates, after falling to less than 45 basis points, have  jumped back to about 90 basis points—their level in late December  We see these  higher rates as lessening a bit the favorable character of financial conditions abroad   But the magnitudes of the increases are not large, and the effects are widely seen,  even in Japan, as more than offset for many in the private sector by the rise in stock  prices     For many of our foreign trading partners, the expected recovery in real output   growth in the United States and the associated rebound in the global high-tech sector  will be critical factors in any acceleration of output  Accordingly, we wrestled with  the issue of whether the downward revision for next year in the staff’s forecast for  US real GDP growth should be reflected in a similar revision for foreign growth   Although adjustments were made for some countries, on balance these were  offsetting, leaving our figure for average growth during next year unchanged     Two of the elements tending to bolster growth abroad are the intermeeting rise in   the exchange value of the dollar and somewhat more expansionary fiscal policy now  expected for Germany and France   We have raised the projected path for the dollar  over the forecast period in response to its recent step-up  Although we still project a   August 12, 2003 17 of 110    slight downward trend in real terms for the weighted-average dollar, the stronger  value of the dollar—and thus weaker value for foreign currencies—now projected for  each quarter relative to the June forecast implies some boost to activity abroad  In  Germany, where real GDP growth was likely negative for a third consecutive quarter  in Q2, the government has announced its intention to inject some fiscal stimulus, and  we have revised up our forecast for 2004 as a result  France is expected to use the  German stimulus as cover for its own somewhat smaller fiscal expansion      All in all, the data that have become available since the June FOMC meeting, the   financial market developments over that period, revisions to the US forecast, and  macroeconomic policy shifts, both actual and prospective, resulted in our making  many marginal adjustments to our forecasts for individual foreign economies   However, those minor adjustments left the average for real output growth and  inflation abroad very similar to that in the June forecast  Such an outcome, along  with our slightly higher path for the dollar, yields an arithmetic contribution to US  real GDP growth from net exports of about zero for the second half of this year and  about minus 2 percent for next year  For the remainder of this year, a rebound in  exports to a moderately positive growth rate is crucial for the external sector to have a  net neutral effect on US expansion  For next year, we see imports responding  strongly, as historical experience suggests, to the projected strengthening of US  economic activity  Thus, although we anticipate that export growth will remain solid,  the external sector on net should again subtract slightly from US real GDP growth   That concludes our remarks, and we’d be happy to take questions    "
7190,2003-09-16,"  May I have a choice?  The United Kingdom is running a current   account deficit  As the UK economy has outperformed the Continent, it has come to be a bit   like the United States in worrying about its external situation and its external deficit  If a risk   premium is built into the market for the possibility that the exchange rate will have to depreciate,   that would push the long-term interest rate up     Right     Since the Greenbook forecast was completed, we have received   additional data about the US external sector—the figures for July nominal trade,  August prices for internationally traded goods, and second-quarter balance-of- payments statistics  The nominal trade deficit in July was a bit smaller than we had  anticipated, mainly owing to stronger exports  We were pleased to be a little  surprised in the positive direction by exports, and we read the July data as consistent  with our forecast that real exports of goods and services will rebound during the  second half of this year after a very weak performance since the fourth quarter of last  year  In July, both exports and imports of services continued their recovery from the  contractions in spending on travel and related categories that we saw in the second  quarter as a consequence of the war in Iraq and then the SARS outbreak  All in all,  the changes to our forecast suggested by the July data are small and only slightly alter  our view of real net exports in the near term  The prices of non-oil merchandise  imports and merchandise exports both declined marginally in August  The decline in  the price of natural gas from its previously elevated level continued to hold down  prices for imported goods  The balance-of-payments data for the second quarter were  also close to our Greenbook projections  Private portfolio inflows remained very  strong in the second quarter, with especially strong demand for Treasuries and  corporate debt securities  Nonetheless, official inflows picked up from their  extraordinary first-quarter pace as intervention purchases of dollars increased  The  one relatively weak spot on the financing front has been direct investment inflows,  which have languished with the dearth of merger activity     These data, along with those that became available over the intermeeting period,   increased our confidence that the pace of economic activity abroad is accelerating and   September 16, 2003 19 of 106    led us to revise upward somewhat our outlook for the second half of this year and for  next year  We see foreign financial conditions as reflecting positive developments  across a range of countries and as contributing to the conditions that will support  further strengthening of business and consumer spending  Stock prices moved up  noticeably in most foreign countries since the August FOMC meeting, particularly in  Japan and in some emerging-market economies  These price increases should ease  some financial sector vulnerabilities by strengthening the balance sheets of Japanese  banks and lessening somewhat problems at pension funds and insurance companies  abroad  Higher share prices should lend support to domestic demand through  household wealth effects and business willingness to invest  Yields spreads of  emerging-market sovereign bonds narrowed as well, reflecting an improved access to  capital more generally in several of these economies       Market participants have interpreted the stronger signals of recovery as implying   no likelihood of further monetary easing by the major foreign central banks  For  example, near-term futures curves have priced out expectations of additional cuts  that, in some cases, were there earlier in the summer  We generally agree with this  inference and have incorporated into the September baseline forecast a prolonged  period of unchanged official rates  Nevertheless, market participants may be  expecting tighter conditions to emerge sooner than we—or the relevant central  bank—now envision  The Bank of Japan has taken action with respect to the tenor of  some of its discount and repo operations in an effort to reinforce the view that it will  not be raising the overnight rate anytime soon     Although the more optimistic tone of financial markets is shared by some   improvement in confidence readings and survey results, hard data on actual  production and spending rebounds remain limited  Some third-quarter figures for  production in emerging Asia are encouraging, and we have revised up our forecast for  developing Asia from 4½ percent to about 6½ percent for the second half of this year   To be honest, that revision reflects in part the fact that second-quarter declines in  those economies most damaged by the SARS outbreak exceeded our expectation and  set the stage for a somewhat stronger rebound  The emerging-market economies in  Asia should also benefit from gains in the global high-tech sector and from the  recovery projected for the US economy  They stand to benefit as well from the  strength of domestic demand in China and from spillovers from China to its trading  partners, as China has increasingly become a source of net trade stimulus to its Asian  trading partners, including Japan     We see the Latin American emerging economies, particularly Mexico, and the   other industrial countries as poised to recover as well, although less vigorously than  emerging Asia  Broadly supportive monetary conditions and fiscal stimulus in a few  cases should support some acceleration in domestic demand  The strength of activity  in the United States will be particularly important for Canada and Mexico  Although  we have projected only a gradual acceleration in euro-area real GDP to rates of about  2½ percent by the second half of next year, we expect euro-area domestic demand to  grow somewhat faster, reaching nearly 3 percent in 2004H2   September 16, 2003 20 of 106      Overall we see a global recovery that is somewhat unbalanced, with momentum   concentrated in the United States and the Asian emerging-market economies  But  most of the major regions of the global economy should benefit from the spillovers  from these regions and from more-favorable global market conditions  Of course,  one consequence of relatively strong income growth in the United States is a further  widening of our external deficits, with the current account deficit on track to reach  about 5½ percent of GDP by the end of the forecast period     In addition to the data already mentioned, since the Greenbook was distributed we   have learned about some progress with respect to Argentina’s negotiations with the  IMF  An agreement was reached and Argentina eventually made the payment that  was due on September 9, thereby avoiding the problems that would have followed  from a technical default  The program includes a commitment to a primary fiscal  surplus of 3 percent of GDP in 2004 and greater independence in the implementation  of monetary policy going forward  However, several of the contentious issues that  had delayed the negotiations were resolved only in general terms, with specifics to be  determined later  That concludes our prepared remarks  We’ll be happy to take  questions    "
7215,2003-10-28,"  Well, I’m foolishly going to offer to say something on this subject!    [Laughter]  The dilemma with the arbitrage reasoning that you have accurately laid out is that   one end or the other of the term structure of exchange rates implied by it needs to be nailed down   in some way for that by itself to tell you where the spot rate should be  Regrettably, that’s the   piece that is missing  It’s not that the arbitrage conditions fail, and it’s not that the respective   interest rate differentials don’t give you a whole term structure at some level of movement in the   spot rates  The problem is that nowhere is it attached to a level       But the magic term is “aggregate supply”  What pins down the   aggregate supply of a currency?     In real time on a given day, at a particular minute, a certain supply   exists and the price equates demand to it, yes       But in an attempt, based on theoretical reasoning, to determine what   shocks should do to that system or what the future rate should be and so forth, the issue is that   the supply of a currency has no economics behind it  The supply could be anything     There are no parameters of a supply curve that are driven by incentives   as there would be, say, if we were talking about the price of lumber in a year  For example, one   can think about the reasoning behind the actions of the people who buy lumber and of the people   who sell lumber  And one could, rightly or wrongly, write down curves that describe that   behavior and thus predict a price based on them       But recall that each exchange rate involves two currencies  So in the   case we’re discussing, one is implicitly talking about the supply of dollars and the supply of yen    While a certain supply exists in calendar time at this moment, nothing predetermines the supply   of either currency going forward  Both of those variables might move in a way that markets   can’t predict  So the arbitrage theory—     Wise suggestion     As we reported in the Greenbook, the information about   economic activity abroad that we have received since the September FOMC meeting  has confirmed our view that foreign real GDP growth has rebounded from the weak  pace of the first half of the year  Based on various indicators from a variety of  countries plus the more robust estimate for US third-quarter growth than had been  projected in September, we have revised up our best guess of average real growth  abroad last quarter to 3½ percent from the 3 percent we had projected     The upward revision to the GDP growth figure for the third quarter is due in part   to a recovery in some previously strong countries that were weak earlier in the year  for transitory reasons  The primary explanation for this outcome is the SARS  epidemic, and the countries in question are China and other emerging-market Asian  economies  But we have also revised up forecasts for countries such as the United  Kingdom, where the most recent evidence suggests a stronger pace to real activity  than we had expected     Looking ahead for 2004 and 2005, we see continued average growth abroad at   about the current pace as most likely, similar to our September outlook although we  have fiddled a bit with the projections for individual countries  Sustained growth at   October 28, 2003 16 of 126    3½ percent would be a welcome improvement in foreign economic performance, and  it would go some way to closing the relative growth differential between the United  States and its trading partners  Our baseline projection calls for that gap to narrow  from over 1½ percentage points this year to about ½ percentage point in 2005  Such  an outcome would lessen the sense that the global economy is overly dependent on  the engine of US growth, although I hasten to add that a surprising shortfall of US  growth from that projected in our baseline would have negative implications for  growth abroad as well     Among the foreign industrial countries, we expect that Canada and the United   Kingdom will continue to record the most successful performance  Domestic demand  within those economies continues to be strong, and financial markets as well as we  are now expecting the Bank of England to begin raising its policy rate soon in  response  In our baseline forecast, growth in the euro area firms over the next year  and achieves a pace of about 2½ percent in 2005  In contrast, we are a bit skeptical of  the signs of recovery in the Japanese economy and have written down positive, but  still low, real GDP growth going forward for that country  All in all, the picture for  the industrial countries is one in which the expansion remains somewhat uneven but  is shared by all the major countries       For the developing countries, the projected improvement in growth over the   forecast period is more dramatic, as both the Asian and Latin American countries  recover from various idiosyncratic problems this year to achieve significantly more  vigorous growth next year  We anticipate that China will continue to outperform all  other countries with respect to reported real GDP growth, although we expect the rate  to moderate a bit by 2005  Elsewhere in Asia, strength in the global high-tech sector  should provide support for rapid output growth of production that in turn will  underpin incomes and domestic demand  In Mexico, sustained expansion of output  depends upon a rebound in US manufacturing that in turn stimulates Mexican  manufacturing  In general, we see dispersion of real output growth lessening across  the developing countries as global recovery becomes more firmly established in 2004  and 2005     Our projection that growth rates will return toward trends in most countries results   in part from our sense of the normal working of macroeconomic forces and in part  from our natural reluctance to project any major new shocks to the global economy   We do believe, however, that we can detect in current data the basis for such an  optimistic outlook     One shock that might be of particular interest and relevance is a more substantial   decline in the value of the dollar than we have incorporated into the baseline  Such a  development might seem a possibility in light of the nearly 5 percent drop in the  nominal value of the dollar in terms of the other major currencies that we have  experienced during the intermeeting period  In addition, the continued widening of  US trade and current account deficits, even as foreign growth recovers, might  heighten concerns on the part of global investors about taking on increasing amounts   October 28, 2003 17 of 126    of exposure to US assets  Accordingly, we included in the Greenbook an alternative  simulation in which the real exchange value of the dollar declines an additional  20 percent by the end of next year  This alternative continues to assume that China  and Malaysia peg to the dollar but posits a one-time revaluation in that peg so that  these countries share in the adjustment to a weaker dollar  Foreign monetary  authorities other than those pegging are assumed to implement policies according to a  Taylor rule, so that they do take steps to mitigate the consequences of exchange rate  appreciation for their domestic macroeconomic performance  However, with the  exchange rate shock phased in and the usual lags in monetary policy effectiveness,  such policy responses cannot prevent significant effects on real GDP growth and  inflation abroad  As reported in the Greenbook, the implications in the staff model of  this large and rapid decline in the dollar for US real GDP growth are plus ¾  percentage point in 2004 and 1½ percentage points in 2005  Core PCE inflation is  increased about 1 percentage point     For foreign economies, our model predicts the greatest decline in growth by year-  end 2005 in Canada because of its dependence on exports to the United States   However, in the near term, the largest negative impacts fall on Mexico and the  developing countries of Asia  These economies are also quite open and trade- dependent  In the simulation, the largest reductions in inflation also occur in Canada,  Mexico, and developing Asia  In response, the Taylor rule calls for very large  reductions in short-term interest rates by their respective officials  Under our  assumption that the shocks to exchange rates are comparable across all of these  trading partners, the negative consequences for growth in the euro area and the United  Kingdom are relatively mild and slow to develop  For Japan, the option to ease rates  in response to further appreciation is not available and so the consequences for real  growth are somewhat larger than in the euro area but less than in the other regions   This particular simulation suggests that significant and broadly felt dollar  depreciation would have its greatest effects on output in two of the regions of the  global economy where performance is now strongest, Canada and emerging Asia   Further into the future, in response to monetary stimulus, those economies should see  domestic demand offset the loss in external demand  With J-curve effects actually  increasing the nominal value of US imports following declines in the dollar, our  trade and current account balances initially worsen and then subsequently begin to  adjust  By the second half of 2005, the US trade deficit would begin to narrow   That completes our prepared remarks  David and I will be happy to answer your  questions    "
7240,2003-12-09,"  If I may?  I would note that the mechanism by which the 95 percent are   tied to the dollar is in some sense the willingness on the part of the holders of those currencies to   provide the financing  So the job left for the other 5 percent to do would be considerably smaller   than in another set of circumstances     December 9, 2003 8 of 133      Right, but as I said, the financing need would be so much smaller       With respect to economic activity abroad, our basic message for   you this meeting is that the rebound in activity that we have been forecasting for  some time has been confirmed in production and spending data for the third quarter   Indeed, we were sufficiently surprised by the strength of this rebound, primarily in   December 9, 2003 15 of 133    emerging Asia but also in some other regions, that we revised up our outlook for  foreign real GDP growth in the current quarter about ½ percentage point      The list of countries reporting double-digit real output growth in the third quarter   includes China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Singapore  No doubt these remarkable  magnitudes reflect a bounceback from the contraction of output in the second quarter  in those economies and the fact that the SARS epidemic, by its nature transitory,  accounted for the declines  Nevertheless, real GDP reached levels ranging from  about 2 to 9 percent above one year ago  Robust growth was also experienced in  Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines  Vigorous expansion in the global  high-tech industry has boosted growth in many of the emerging Asian countries  although other factors, such as strong expansion of domestic demand in China, have  also been important  Trade within the region has helped to spread demand broadly  across a number of countries, including Japan  Japanese exports, particularly to  China, have contributed substantially to the strong growth reported in recent quarters   Although some measurement issues raise concerns that the reported Japanese real  GDP data overstate the true pace of output growth, sustained positive growth has  occurred, in part because of stimulus from elsewhere in the region     Among the other foreign industrial countries, the euro area was another region   where growth came in noticeably stronger than we had expected in October  Of the  member countries, France and Italy have provided some positive surprises, whereas  Germany continues to perform at a subpar pace  Even in Germany, however, survey  data and some recent indicators show signs of coming improvement, and we again  have forecast an acceleration of economic activity in 2004  To be fair, I should admit  that there were some important exceptions to the generally optimistic outcome in the  third quarter  Real GDP growth in both Canada and Mexico, two very important US  trading partners, came in below our October projections  We think that, at least in  part, the reasons for their weak performances will prove transitory, and so we expect  a rebound in growth in the current quarter  All in all, we read the most recent data as  consistent with a rise in the growth rate of aggregate foreign output from an annual  rate of about 3½ percent last quarter to 3¾ percent this quarter  Although we do not  think the very rapid pace that was recorded in several countries for the third quarter  can be sustained, we see the recovery in production in many regions, the favorable  developments in labor markets in some cases, and the strength of domestic demand in  several key regions as confirmation of our forecast that average growth near the  current rate will continue over the forecast period     For the most part, developments in global financial markets are consistent with   and supportive of ongoing economic expansion abroad  Stock markets are generally  up over the period and since early in the year  Foreign monetary conditions remain  accommodative  Official rates were raised by the Bank of England and by the  Reserve Bank of Australia  In the other major foreign industrial countries, policy  rates were left unchanged, and long-term interest rates are little changed to up slightly  on balance since the October FOMC meeting  The generally positive news about real  economic activity abroad was about matched by the indicators released for the United   December 9, 2003 16 of 133    States, yet the dollar depreciated further on balance over the period, a trend that  seems to have intensified since the G-7 meeting and communiqué in Dubai in  September  As Dino reported, some recent events seem to have spurred market  participants to exert downward pressure on the dollar, including the emergence of  new trade frictions with China and renewed geopolitical risks associated with  violence in Iraq, Turkey, and elsewhere  Yet it is the also the case that dollar  weakness over the past few months has coincided with reduced private capital inflows  into the United States  As we reported to you in the Greenbook supplement, the  October data on international financial transactions revealed that private demand for  US securities remained weak  These data are confidential until their release on or  about December 15  The dollar moved down when market participants reacted to the  information that in September private foreign investors sold on net US Treasury  securities, agency bonds, and corporate stocks  Treasuries and equities were again  negative in October; agencies showed only small net purchases  In contrast, private  foreign demand for US corporate bonds remains healthy  Ongoing demand on the  part of US investors for foreign securities has added to the financing need for  foreign savings to balance the international accounts      The reasons for the reduced inflow are unclear  Relatively low US interest rates   could be one factor  A perception that the Administration is less committed than  previously to a strong dollar could be another  As market participants come to expect  near-term dollar declines, the incentive to reduce dollar holdings rises, creating the  risk of yet more selling pressure and price drops  We do not have a complete picture  of financial flows in the third quarter  To some extent foreign official purchases of  dollar assets have taken the place of private purchases  Significant foreign official  acquisitions of dollars continued in October and, according to data from FRBNY  custodial accounts, in November  Data on foreign direct investment are not yet  available  In the months preceding September, private foreign demand for US  securities had been quite strong  Data for two months are not sufficient to convince  us that a major reversal is under way     Accordingly, in the December forecast we have adjusted down the starting point   of the projected path for the real foreign exchange value of the dollar to reflect  exchange rate developments over the intermeeting period  As one more bit of  evidence that our crystal ball is a bit cloudy where exchange rate fluctuations are  concerned, the dollar has weakened further since we committed to that path in the  Greenbook  The nominal index in terms of major foreign currencies is already about  1 percent below the Greenbook projection for the first quarter  The projected path  remains tilted slightly down as we judge that, over some extended period, the  pressures exerted by the need to finance a widening current account deficit and  growing net international indebtedness likely will result in some further decline in the  dollar  But we recognize that the dollar is likely to fluctuate up as well as down at  times  Moreover, the current Greenbook assumption that you will begin to tighten  somewhat earlier than was incorporated into the previous Greenbook lends support to  possible upside pressures on the dollar in the coming year  That concludes our  presentation, Mr Chairman    December 9, 2003 17 of 133         I cannot answer the specific question regarding oil consumption in   Europe, although I will follow up on this  We do judge that there is an exchange rate effect in   the market determination of oil prices in the sense that the demand for oil reacts to local currency   prices everywhere on the globe  So as those currencies fluctuate against the dollar relative to a   relatively sticky dollar price for oil, they see changes in the relative price of energy, and they   react to the changes in those relative prices  That feeds back, on a short-term, day-by-day basis,   onto the demand for oil in the spot market, and it shows through to the oil price  I honestly don’t   have in my head a number in terms of how strong it is, but it’s not zero  Of that I’m quite sure     Now that’s a different question from the strategy of OPEC, which might shift the band as   a consequence of seeing a reduced international value of the dollar that is eroding somewhat the   price OPEC is getting for its oil  What we’re seeing now are fluctuations that are staying high in   the band partly as a consequence of exchange rate developments  If that persists and if the dollar   were to fall further, we might see the band shifting so that OPEC puts the spot market price back   in the middle of the band   December 9, 2003 18 of 133      Yes, I think $2 is the number we usually cite  So both of these factors   are at work  We think we see the exchange value of the dollar showing through to the gold   prices, for example, and we think we see it in some commodity prices  It certainly comes   through to oil in the sense of where the demand curve is  There is the larger question of whether   OPEC might change its strategy as well     Well, for places where one looks the hardest, say Europe, I’m not   aware that people see it as a data problem  I believe it’s still the case that what we would call a   Phillips curve analysis is not well confirmed in empirical estimates for most major foreign   industrial countries, with maybe one or two exceptions  People keep trying to find a relationship,   and I think in some sense if you want to believe one exists, you could find some evidence for it    But the evidence is not sufficiently persuasive that the relationship has become an accepted   characteristic  It is true, given that these are poorly fitting equations with big standard errors and   a tendency to go off track outside of sample and so forth, that there is probably a bit of evidence   supporting speed effects for some of these countries  As Dave just commented, that differs from   the situation in the United States in terms of the speed effects here  Most of the rhetoric about   December 9, 2003 19 of 133    speed effects comes from colleagues outside the United States  Central banks outside the United   States point to these issues as a problem, and they usually explain it in the context of a wage   determination process  So I think in fact econometrics hasn’t really answered the question of   how prices are determined in many European countries and in Japan too  Japan may be the   biggest puzzle of all, given that there is probably as much evidence for speed effects as there is   for gap effects in that country  That has opened up the door to this ongoing debate and some   behavior responses on the part of foreign officials     It was somewhat the story of the 1980s  That’s when a lot of this work   went on and where the word “hysteresis” came from  I think people do look to labor markets for   the explanation  I can’t say that I’ve seen studies that have revisited this question the way it was   looked at in the ’80s and have concluded that nothing has changed  I think things are changing    France is a country, for example, where a lot has changed by way of labor market regulation and   December 9, 2003 20 of 133    the like  Nonetheless, the process of wage setting is certainly more political in Europe than it is   here, and the capacity of the unemployed to matter either politically or in the markets seems   enormously less in Europe than here  That’s perhaps a reflection of the fact that most Europeans   have a more generous safety net than is typical in this country, so the unemployed may be   exerting less pressure  Moreover, the deck seems stacked against them a bit in that the European   labor unions don’t cry many tears over the unemployed outside their own particular union  The   political process is responsive to some degree, but the answer from the political arena seems to   be to provide much more in the way of safety net solutions as opposed to better working markets    There are other countries—Canada, for example, or Australia or New Zealand, with tremendous   regulatory changes—where we might look for the sort of phenomenon you’re talking about  I   don’t think the issue is black and white  It’s not that the phenomenon exists only in the United   States and nowhere else  There is a gradation  But the econometric analysis doesn’t really   provide a clear answer; the relationships are murky     To be honest, I haven’t checked what the private-sector forecasts are   saying, so I can’t comment on that  It’s certainly not the case that the projection for the dollar   has not shown through to our forecast  In fact I tried to suggest in the Greenbook that we’re   finally at the point now where past dollar appreciation has exited the very long lagged term,   particularly on the export side  So the consequences of the dollar depreciation since its peak in   early 2002 are now more or less fully coming through without being moderated by some of the   lingering effects of past dollar appreciation  In the export equation in particular we are seeing   some significant effects from the fact that the dollar is lower and going forward is projected to   come down  Now, in all honesty, in our forecast we don’t have a lot of dollar depreciation yet to   come  So it’s mostly a backward-looking effect of relative depreciation that we already have   experienced that is showing through to exports  We have export growth rebounding to   something like 10 percent  A significant portion of that is due to the exchange rate effect, and   some of it is due to the improved outlook for foreign economies that I talked about this morning   On the import side, it’s a little more difficult to say exactly how the dollar’s decline is   having an effect because import prices have been surprising us  We haven’t gotten the increases   in import prices that the econometric relationships would suggest we should get  So with that,   December 9, 2003 31 of 133    we have been chipping away at how much of a given dollar change we are willing to put into the   import price change  It’s only through import prices that the dollar is going result in imports   being restrained by the falling dollar  If import prices don’t rise in response to the dollar falling,   then the effect of the dollar’s decline doesn’t show through to the relationships that guide the   way we project imports     All in all I think we have fairly vigorous import growth here  As a consequence, we have   net exports becoming yet again a drag on output  We’ve had positive contributions from the net   export sector in somewhat anomalous ways during the slowdown because, while we had exports   falling, we had imports falling, too  Going forward, everything reverts to its usual sign  Exports   contribute positively; they contribute about 1 percentage point on average over the forecast   period in most quarters  But the contribution from imports rises to about minus 1⅓ to minus   1½ percentage points  So we get a net drag from the external sector reemerging, as is usually the   case, if I may put it that way   Now, how powerful is the dollar to do this?  We have the usual elasticities in our   equations  I don’t think our trade relationships differ greatly from those used by most of the   other forecasters that I know of  What is usually the culprit here is the fact that imports are so   much bigger than exports  What happens to imports really, really matters  The fact that we   aren’t seeing the depreciation of the dollar reflected in import prices may be a source of   difference between what we’re forecasting for net exports and what others are forecasting  We   would have slower imports and stronger GDP if we had the pass-through to import prices   occurring more quickly in the forecast     If I give Dave any more GDP he’s not going to buy it anyway!       I guess I’d say “no” as a short answer  It’s certainly true that some   other central banks comment from time to time on their sense of monetary accommodation  But   there are other central banks with a different position  For example, the Bank of England has   already raised rates, and the Reserve Bank of Australia has raised rates twice  But I think the   notion in international financial circles that the global economy has turned and it’s time to start   raising rates—there was even a time when people somehow thought the Fed would have to go   first—is not prevalent  We occasionally might hear in the press about worries voiced in other   countries that, if the Fed doesn’t act, how can we act?  But it turns out that we don’t have to go   first  The Reserve Bank of Australia can certainly go first, and it did       Well, that’s certainly a piece of it, although both of those banks I think   quite legitimately see themselves as having a zero output gap  The Australian economy has   December 9, 2003 36 of 133    performed remarkably strongly  So they need to have their policy rates much closer to   equilibrium than we do       Well, I would use that language even if they don’t  And I would say   that they are growing—      SPEAKER(?)  With speed limits     For various reasons their economy has been growing around 4 percent   at times and rather consistently  Now, in England, I think there is an enormous tension over the   housing prices on the one hand and other prices on the other  Not all prices are rising  There’s a   sense of the service sector of the economy versus the manufacturing sector of the economy  One   monetary policy just won’t do for the United Kingdom anymore, but of course, they can have   only one monetary policy  So there is a certain tension there  But I think in the international   setting it has become clear that, depending on the inflation situation and the macroeconomic   picture more broadly, some central banks need to be acting now and some do not have to yet    But I have not detected a sense that the reason the dollar is being sold is that we’re failing to   address an emerging inflation problem  I have certainly heard often—and Dino may confirm   this—that the Australian dollar is one of the currencies that has appreciated the most against the   US dollar, so just the interest differential in the normal course of transacting is looming in   people’s conversations  "
7293,2004-03-16,"  The staff forecast for economic activity abroad this year and   next is one of moderately robust growth and contained inflation  This favorable  picture reflects the rebound in the global high-tech industry as previous   March 16, 2004 15 of 107    overinvestment has been worked off; the positive spillovers to the rest of the world of  the expansion of the US economy; and the fruits of the accommodative policy,  particularly monetary policy, that has been in place in many foreign economies for  some time      Expansion abroad is no longer just prospective  Although foreign growth during   the second half of last year did not match that in the United States, it rebounded  sharply from the troubled outcome during the first half of the year, with total foreign  real GDP growth averaging more than 4¼ percent  To be sure, there were substantial  differences across countries, with those in emerging Asia charging ahead and those in  the euro area only inching forward  Nevertheless, by the fourth quarter of last year  the expansion was widespread and becoming more firmly established  Indicators for  the current quarter confirm that this process has continued  In some economies where  growth was unsustainably strong, such as Japan and China, we are looking for some  moderation going forward  And we expect that output in the euro area will accelerate  a bit further this quarter and next to come closer to the potential rate of growth for  that region     Of course, I would not be doing my duty to you if I did not look for the black   cloud among all this sunshine  Two issues seem to merit further discussion  recent  developments in oil and other primary commodity prices and concerns about the ever- expanding need to finance the US external deficit       Despite persistent forecasts of declining oil prices, spot prices for WTI have risen   from about $30 per barrel to $37 over the past six months, including a $3 per barrel  rise since your January meeting  To some extent, the higher oil prices have been  muted abroad as many foreign currencies have appreciated against the dollar   Accordingly, the balance of demand and supply in the global oil market would tend to  push up dollar oil prices at a time of general dollar depreciation  Other factors  supporting spot oil prices are the current low level of inventories, OPEC production  policy, the risk of instability in some oil-supplying countries, and the strength of  demand as the global economy expands  Nevertheless, futures markets continue to  expect declines in the price of oil going forward  Were any of several possible supply  disruptions to occur, the resulting spike in oil prices could threaten the global  recovery and put some upward pressures on prices more broadly       Nonfuel global primary commodity prices also have risen sharply in recent   months  Utilizing spot and futures prices, we project that these commodity prices  will increase at an annual rate of nearly 50 percent in the current quarter before  decelerating sharply and even reversing a bit later this year and next  Such sharp run- ups in commodity prices have occurred previously  This forecast applies broadly to  all the categories of nonfuel primary commodities  Thus the outlook is that the very  rapid rate of increase in these prices will prove transitory, in part because of supply  factors and the expected supply response to strong demand       March 16, 2004 16 of 107    Some have expressed concerns that the inflation in commodity prices is a leading  indicator of rising inflation pressures more broadly throughout the global economy   Within industrial countries, however, primary product prices are a very small input  into the determination of prices for final products  And a relative price change in  favor of primary goods will only partially retrace a trend against their relative price  that has been ongoing for some time  Nevertheless, particular bottlenecks for some  products could arise if demand for primary products remains strong, supported by  continued rapid output growth in China and elsewhere       Debate about the risks to the global economy posed by the large and growing US   current account deficit has been rising in volume as global recovery proceeds  Two  data releases to the public since the Greenbook was distributed—the TIC data on  January capital flows and the balance of payments data for the fourth quarter— provide some information on how that deficit has been financed in recent months   The TIC data were discussed in Part 2 of the Greenbook as we had that data before  Thursday  As was the case in November and December, foreign private net  purchases of US securities were quite strong, reversing the sharp reduction in those  purchases seen in September and October  Financial market concerns that these data  might be signaling a major shift in foreign preferences away from US assets appear  already to have abated  When these data were released on Monday morning, there  was little market reaction     The balance of payments data contained new information on US net investment   income in the fourth quarter That figure came in significantly more positive than we  had been expecting and implied a current account deficit in that quarter about  $25 billion less than in the Greenbook  This positive revision is entirely explained by  higher income receipts on US direct investment abroad, which in part is due to the  depreciation of the dollar and the resulting higher dollar value of recorded foreign  profits  In response to these data, we have narrowed our projection for the current  account deficit this year and next by about $20 billion and $10 billion respectively   These data only add to the mystery of how the world’s largest debtor country can earn  significant net income on its foreign investment position     The balance of payments data also reported the complete picture of capital   inflows and outflows for 2003 and gave us our first look at the foreign direct  investment figures for the fourth quarter  For the year as a whole, the major  components of foreign private capital flows to the United States, securities purchases  and direct investment, remained very large—around $450 billion—and were not  much changed from the figure for 2002  Yet much has been made of the increase in  the foreign official holdings of dollars  These net purchases doubled between the two  years from around $100 billion to a bit over $200 billion Two items in the balance of  payments data reconcile these facts  First, US investors switched from being net  sellers of foreign securities to net purchasers and at the same time US foreign direct  investment abroad remained strong  So US capital outflows experienced a swing of  about $100 billion to about $220 billion  Second, the current account deficit itself  widened about $60 billion  Thus capital inflows faced a larger financing hurdle in   March 16, 2004 17 of 107    2003 than in 2002  Looking ahead, we see the current account deficit continuing to  present a moving target, reaching $600 billion by the end of next year  Capital  outflows are particularly hard to forecast, but our projection calls for them to rise  slightly over the forecast period     Our forecast for only a slight downward tilt in the foreign exchange value of the   dollar implies that some combination of private capital inflows to the United States  plus increases in foreign official holdings will willingly finance the expanding deficit  plus the outflows that occur at exchange rates near those of today  This may seem  like a major challenge  But I point out that the foreign private net purchases of US  securities in December and January, when expressed at an average annual rate, by  themselves come to nearly $650 billion  Dave and I would be happy to take your  questions        I asked my staff if they could make that decomposition, and I basically   got “no” for an answer  [Laughter]  The dilemma is that we’re talking about looking at this   across all the different currencies and all the different—      I understand  And that is shifting a bit when this valuation effect   shows up and when there were offsetting gains on the one hand versus losses on the other    Remember we’re talking now about US earnings abroad, not foreign earnings here  At any rate,   the staff did not seem hopeful that they could disentangle the earnings in euro, yen, Canadian   dollars, and pounds and the exchange rate effects as reported in these data  We know the general   tendencies, but we don’t have enough data to do the actual accounting that would disentangle   that     I raised that question  I think what we’d have to do at this point is to   look at annual reports or something  At some later point we may have those data     Right     Back to their foreign currencies     And we would have to do it over time in order to track foreign earnings   versus the imputed exchange rate effects that we would have injected into that calculation  "
7317,2004-05-04,"  We don’t have any actual real-time data on inventories at that level     Copper prices are down     Well, they’re off their peak  When we put the Greenbook to bed, they had   come down from their peak level, and they have come down another 10 cents, I would say, since   then  That was largely on news of the macro monetary policy coming out of China rather than on   news about real economic activity or inventories or anything else  So, it was in some sense an   inference—in effect, that if China’s boom cooled, copper would become less viable—on the part of   those who trade in futures markets rather than a direct read on what was going on  Now, over the   same interval—since we put the Greenbook to bed through Friday, which is the last date for which I   have quotes—lumber prices, for example, both spot and in the futures market, went up not down    That’s partly because what is driving the lumber speculators or purchasers or hedgers or whoever is   US homebuilding as opposed to Chinese construction  And these market players thought they   were getting different signals, so the futures curve shifted the other way  Soybean prices, which are   being driven by expectations of the beginning of harvesting, also have gone up a bit since the   May 4, 2004 11 of 112       Greenbook rather than down  But cotton is down a lot off its peak; copper is down noticeably from   its peak; and wheat is down from its peak  So a more informed and discriminating shifting seems to   be going on, but it is tied to what people perceive to be news about the factors that are driving   demand in these markets     Right  And for metals, I think the story isn’t necessarily the same for all   of them  But copper in particular was thought to be driven by developments in China     I have a less detailed picture in front of me regarding aluminum  It   appears to have stopped rising as opposed to falling       Yes, but copper has already started moving down     One element of the external forecast that may be of greater   interest than usual is the recent and prospective behavior of import prices, and I  thought that I would begin by looking at some of the factors driving changes in those  prices  The advance release last week reported that the deflator for total imports of  goods and services rose at an annual rate of 10 percent in the first quarter, after  increasing only a bit more than 2½ percent over the four quarters of 2003  A large  part of this upsurge reflects the upward move in oil prices over the quarter, with the  prices recorded for computer and semiconductor imports providing some offset by  declining, but less than in the past on the part of computers  In part, the rise in import  prices also reflects continued increases in the prices for service imports, which rose  quite strongly in 2003 as the dollar depreciated  For the remaining import items,  which we term core imports, the annual rate of price increase in the first quarter was  66 percent, a bit less than we had estimated in the Greenbook but substantially more  than the 18 percent recorded last year       Among the components of core goods, the commodity-intensive categories of   foods and non-oil industrial supplies recorded the greatest jumps, with the latter rising  at an annual rate of nearly 24 percent  This development is consistent with our model  analysis, which suggests that the two most important factors behind the rapid inflation  in core import prices last quarter were the exchange rate and commodities, including  natural gas       Looking ahead, our forecast calls for deceleration of core import prices to an   annual rate of about 3½ percent over the remainder of this year and to about  ½ percent next year  This slowing importantly reflects the recent and projected path  for the nominal exchange value of the dollar, which paused starting around the turn of  the year following a two-year period of depreciation, has risen slightly on balance so  far this year, and is projected to decline only marginally over the forecast period  The  lagged effects of previous dollar depreciation were still evident in core import prices  in the first quarter, but our projection for the dollar implies that the contribution of the  exchange rate will be a small negative to zero starting with the current quarter       We expect that commodity prices will continue to exert significant upward   pressure on import prices over the rest of 2004, largely because of lagged effects from  previous increases, but then will hold down import price inflation in 2005, owing to  declines expected on average and in most categories  Our index for nonfuel primary  commodity prices rose nearly 50 percent in the first quarter, and our model finds that  the effects persist for four quarters  Prices in all four categories of commodities— food, beverages, agricultural raw materials, and minerals and metals—rose in double  digits in the first quarter, but some have peaked and begun to decline  Among the  individual commodity prices that rose most rapidly are those for copper, which have  already come off their recent peaks  Similarly, prices for soybeans have stopped   May 4, 2004 17 of 112       rising; futures prices call for spot soybean prices to fall sharply at midyear as new  crops are harvested  Thus although our forecast incorporates a rather abrupt change  in the course of nonfuel primary product prices, we believe that the signs of that  reversal are already evident  Accordingly, we believe that our forecast for significant  slowing in import prices is balanced, with risk on both sides     The extremely rapid increases in commodity prices during the fourth quarter of   last year and the first quarter of this year, particularly for minerals and metals, are  linked to the rebound of real output growth in some regions, especially emerging  Asia  Within Asia, the pace of growth in China, which has averaged nearly  15 percent over the past three quarters, is seen as a major reason for the strong  demand for commodities  Chinese authorities have taken steps to tighten monetary  conditions and to slow the rate of growth of bank credit in order to counter concerns  about domestic inflation pressures and excessive investment in some sectors  Our  forecast sees these efforts as successful, with growth slowing to a moderate  7½ percent rate but not collapsing as some fear  At the same time, we see inflation in  China lessening as the rapid increases in food prices abate  Elsewhere in emerging  Asia, we expect expansion to continue at a vigorous pace, depending importantly on  continued global spending on high-tech goods     Bolstered by rapid growth in Asia and continuing strength in the US economy,   we look for global output to grow at near its current pace over the remainder of this  year and to decelerate only slightly next year  Some parts of the global economy,  such as Canada and the United Kingdom, should continue to show firmness in  domestic demand  In Japan, we look for domestic demand, particularly private  investment, to be a source of demand stimulus, but net exports will be an important  element in maintaining real GDP growth at around 2½ percent through next year      The outlook for the euro area is more troubled  We expect that exports will   respond to the improved global economy and grow moderately  But given the past  appreciation of the exchange value of the euro, imports should rise as well  On  balance, we anticipate that the external sector will be a neutral factor and that real  GDP in the euro area will expand at about the same 2 percent pace as domestic  demand  Such an outcome will not allow for much progress in addressing the  macroeconomic problems, such as high unemployment rates and excessive budget  deficits, confronting many of the large euro-area countries  It should result in a small  tick down in euro-area inflation, permitting the ECB to delay any rate increase until  2005       Overall, our forecast for real output growth abroad is favorable  When combined   with our projection for slight depreciation in the real exchange value of the dollar, it  yields a rebound in our forecast for growth of total exports of real goods and services  to more than 10 percent over the remainder of this year and only slightly lower next  year  Both core goods and services should respond to foreign GDP and relative  prices and bounce back from rather weak first-quarter figures to moderate growth on  average over the forecast period  In nominal terms, export growth should about equal   May 4, 2004 18 of 112       or exceed that of imports, notwithstanding the strong performance of the US  economy  Nevertheless, the trade deficit is expected to widen further this year and  next, reflecting the extent to which imports already exceed exports  Accordingly, the  current account deficit is expected to move above $600 billion in 2005  Dave and I  will be happy to answer any of your questions       Well, if China’s growth fell below, say, 5 percent, I think we’d see fairly   significant spillover effects  Seven percent used to be a sort of “target” rate of growth; then it   became 8 percent and then it was around 10 percent  But China growing at 7 percent would be a   return to what we had seen for quite a few years in the 1990s, which would probably allow for a   better allocation of resources than growth of 15 percent is likely to be generating     The fact that China is not in fact a fully market-based economy is, I think, the bad news and   the good news  The bad news part is that it probably is leading to a misallocation of resources and,   therefore, to the risk of some over-accumulation of certain items—and the sudden redirecting of   effort because somebody may well wake up eventually and realize that the warehouses are full of air   conditioners, say, that aren’t moving   May 4, 2004 19 of 112       On the other hand, it’s partly good news because there are no phenomena like CEO risk   aversion or tendencies on the part of markets to overshoot or the need for depreciation or balance   sheet corrections to work their way through before companies make decisions  If the authorities in   China decide that too many resources are being used to produce air conditioners and what they   really want are snow blowers, the desired reallocation of resources will happen pretty quickly  So,   to my mind, the risk in China is more that resources are being wasted  And given that standards of   living in China and much of the world aren’t as high as we’d like them to be, that’s a very   significant and important cost  But I don’t think that involves the same systemic cyclical behavior   yet that a truly market economy would have     That said, if the Chinese run into economic problems in terms of their ability to meet the   demands of the population for rising standards of living and jobs—or if they fail to deal in an   orderly way with the transition from a mostly rural to a more industrialized economy—I don’t know   what the effects would be  If those efforts hit a rough spot, I don’t know that I have any special   expertise to suggest what might politically happen in China or how that situation would resolve   itself  I do think the spillover to the rest of Asia would be very severe—at least as bad as in the late   1990s     And in places such as Korea and a few other countries, we’re not seeing   the current account deficits and the need to attract capital; so if the capital were to stop flowing, it   May 4, 2004 20 of 112       wouldn’t have exactly the same consequences  On the other hand, outside of China, domestic   demand is not really the driving force in Asia; it is export demand  So in a macroeconomic sense,   the Asian countries are vulnerable to development in China and in the United States   "
7342,2004-06-29,"1  Thank you, Mr Chairman You should have a packet of charts  labeled “US External Adjustment” in front of you  Our topic today is US external  adjustment  The “adjustment” that is our focus starts with the recognition that the  United States is running a large and growing deficit vis-à-vis the rest of the world in the  use of goods and services—a deficit that makes obvious our interdependency with  foreign economic behavior  As a result, some analysts are concerned that a change in  foreign behavior at some point may have unwelcome consequences for us  But in  today’s interdependent global economy, such vulnerability is present even for those in  external balance or surplus  In our presentation today, we will analyze the factors  behind our growing external deficit and consider what circumstances might foster its  reversal  Of particular concern will be the implications of various alternatives for US  asset prices, especially the foreign exchange value of the dollar      One direct measure of our external deficit (shown in the top panel) is the balance of   payments concept termed the “current account balance”—that is, the sum of the trade  balance, net investment income, and net foreign transfers  For many years the US  current account balance has been driven for the most part by the trade balance  Both  balances began a period of substantial decline in 1996 that was only briefly interrupted  by the recession in 2001      The price-adjusted exchange value of the dollar in terms of the currencies of a large   number of our trading partners (the dotted blue line) is central to our story for two  reasons  First, the dollar exchange rate is an important price variable in most, if not all,  of the significant demand-and-supply relationships in our complex story  Second, the  dollar exchange rate is part of the transmission mechanism of US monetary policy and  influences US inflation determination  Note that the dollar began to appreciate from a  low point in early 1995—in advance of the downturn in the trade balance—and  generally continued to rise until early 2002  The nominal exchange value of the dollar  in terms of the major foreign currencies (the green line in the middle left panel) has  come even further off its 2002 peak than has the more inclusive broad real dollar, nearly  returning to its 1995 level  This difference reflects the fact that, in terms of the  currencies of our other important trading partners (the dashed red line), the dollar has  risen somewhat in nominal terms since early 2002  The dollar exchange rates of the  major currencies have tended to be more flexible and more market driven than some of  the OITP currencies, such as the Chinese renminbi; and the dollar has appreciated  against some of these other currencies, in particular the Mexican peso     Persistent current account deficits cumulate to the net international investment   position, shown to the right, which measures our growing stock of indebtedness to the   June 29-30, 2004 4 of 203          rest of the world  This large and growing stock of claims on the United States must be  held at all times, and one intuitive perspective on the sustainability of our external  position is that this stock cannot increase relative to our GDP forever  Every import and  export transaction in the current account has a financial counterpart  Except for  measurement error, the current account balance equals the net of all the international  financial transactions  There are, of course, huge volumes of cross-border transactions  between assets—unrelated to trade finance and driven by complex incentives of risk and  return—that have consequences for asset prices, including exchange rates  Recent data  for elements of those financial flows, reported in the bottom left panel, show that private  foreign inflows to purchase US securities (line 3) are very large, particularly in relation  to private US outflows to purchase foreign securities (line 4) and net direct investment  (line 5)  Moreover, these flows increased sharply in the first quarter  Nevertheless,  foreign official inflows (line 2), which had about doubled in 2003, rose significantly  further earlier this year     From a macroeconomic perspective and with the public and private sectors   combined, the extent to which the United States invests more than it saves corresponds  to resources borrowed from abroad—the blue shaded region labeled “net foreign  lending” in the bottom right panel  This is the NIPA analogue to the current account  balance  As the rise in US net domestic investment in the 1990s outpaced that in net  saving, our external deficit rose  As our saving subsequently declined sharply, the  external deficit widened further     Unless and until the trade balance begins to narrow, adjustment is not yet occurring    Indeed, as was argued in the background paper circulated to the Committee, stability in  the ratio of our foreign indebtedness to nominal GDP requires that the trade deficit  eventually return to near zero  US trade data are presented at the top of your next  exhibit  The yellow shaded area represents the trade deficit, which has reached a record  level  To the right of the vertical line, which is positioned at the latest actual data point,  we have shown a simple extrapolation of imports and exports—based on standard partial  equilibrium trade equations—for the case in which real GDP here and abroad grows at  potential and the real value of the dollar remains at its current level  With imports  already substantially larger than exports and with foreign potential growth reasonably  robust but slightly less than US potential growth, the change in imports tends to exceed  that in exports, and so in this case there is no adjustment through 2010  The green bars  measure the change in the trade balance  For the trade balance to narrow significantly,  exports would need to grow rapidly relative to import growth for an extended period     The middle panel provides a summary of the composition and magnitude of cross-  border financial flows for the same period, expressed as a percent of GDP  The trade  balance above accounts for most of the change in the current account balance, shown in  yellow  US private financial outflows, in tan, also must be financed; and the sum of  these two is the counterpart to foreign private financial inflows (in blue) plus net official  flows (in red)  The extrapolation through 2010 incorporates the trade outcome from the  top panel and plausible staff projections of US and foreign private financial flows  Of  course, private flows could behave differently, depending on the incentives perceived by   June 29-30, 2004 5 of 203          investors here and abroad  To the extent that the flows shown in blue do not fully  finance the current account deficit plus US private outflows, foreign official  intervention may fill the remaining gap, as shown here  Otherwise, exchange rates,  other prices, and incomes here and abroad would change, resulting in a current account  position and private flows that would satisfy the balance of payments norms     The bottom two panels provide some detail on recent stocks of dollar holdings by   foreign officials (the left panel) and foreign private investors (the right panel) that  correspond to the flows in the middle panel  Estimates based on data through April  show that, of the total foreign official holdings of more than $1,600 billion (line 1),  about two-thirds consist of Treasury securities (line 2)  The end of 2001 was very near  the time of the most recent peak in the value of the dollar  Changes from then through  April are shown in the column to the right and reveal that the change in the total is  nearly accounted for by the change in holdings of “selected” Asia (line 3)—economies  whose monetary authorities have engaged in substantial foreign exchange intervention   The incentives behind dollar acquisition by foreign officials, for the most part, relate to  their objectives for their respective exchange rates and the competitiveness of their  exports      Foreign private holdings are significantly in fixed-income securities—lines 1, 2, and   3 in the right panel  These investors are thus exposed to dollar exchange rate risk and to  US market interest rate risk  Foreign holdings of US equity (line 4) are also large but  entail somewhat different risks  Over the period since the dollar began its appreciation  in 1995, foreign investors have more than doubled their holdings of each of these  categories of assets  Nevertheless, because US securities markets are very large and  quite liquid, changes in preferences on the part of foreign investors among these  categories of assets need not have major implications for their prices  However, as long  as the US current account remains in deficit, net foreign claims on US assets must  continue to rise in total  Any diminution in the appetite of investors for US assets  would first trigger valuation changes, primarily via the exchange rate, that would lower  the foreign-currency denominated value of their total claims on the United States      Such a change in investor appetite could well be the first step in the external   adjustment process  Some characteristics of an “orderly” adjustment are listed in the top  left panel of your next exhibit  Although there are a great many possible alternative  paths for adjustment that could be termed “orderly,” in the sense that financial markets  would continue to function within normal ranges, such an outcome seems more likely to  occur if investors are attracted by improved returns abroad rather than discouraged by  unfavorable changes in US prospects  Various specifics along these paths would differ,  but all would be characterized by continued, albeit declining, net financial inflows into  the US economy  In addition, because lasting correction of the US external deficit  cannot be achieved through cyclical slowing of US GDP growth to below potential and  the associated temporary restraint on imports, external adjustment such that exports  increase more than imports almost certainly requires dollar depreciation      June 29-30, 2004 6 of 203          The panel to the right expresses the data on foreign holdings of US assets from the  previous exhibit as shares relative to the total outstanding amount for each category   Foreign holdings of US Treasury securities (line 1) amount to nearly 50 percent of the  outstanding stock, with the official share about 30 percent and the private share (not  shown) about 20 percent  Foreign holdings are more than 10 percent of agency  securities  The percent held abroad is only slightly higher for equities, with 12 percent  of US equities owned by foreign investors, virtually all of whom are private  These  numbers are large, and they have risen over time  But moderate financial inflows could  continue over time even if these shares stabilize or edge down      There appears to be ample scope for continued financial inflows, as reflected in the   bottom left panel  For most of the foreign countries shown, in December 2002 domestic  securities made up most of their total bond and equity holdings, in many cases more  than 80 percent  Moreover, US securities are generally just a moderate portion of their  nondomestic holdings  Accordingly, it does not seem to be the case that foreign  portfolios are already overly invested in US assets     If stronger demand for US exports is to contribute to adjustment, from which   countries might it come?  The panel on the right reports that the economies with the  largest average share of US exports in 2003 were Canada and western Europe (lines 1  and 2) followed by Mexico (line 3)  These regions accounted for a slightly smaller share  of the increase in US exports over the past two years, shown in the second column   Note the jump in the share for China and Hong Kong (line 7) when viewed from the  perspective of the change in exports  This increase is somewhat offset by the drop in  Japan’s share (line 5)  Taken together, our Asian trading partners (lines 4, 5, 7, and 8)  accounted for 30 percent of the gain in exports  Income growth in Asia is likely to  remain quite vigorous, with domestic demand a major source of strength  To a lesser  degree, this outcome is likely for Canada and Mexico  Strong domestic demand in those  regions will be necessary if US exports are to accelerate      The panel at the top left of your next exhibit is constructed to illustrate the sense in   which there is a tradeoff between relative growth here and abroad and the minimum  pace of real dollar depreciation required for the trade deficit to narrow  The line  separating the shaded and nonshaded regions was calculated using standard partial  equilibrium trade equations, and its position depends importantly on the current starting  conditions, in particular the initial size of imports and exports  Given those quantities  today, for any foreign minus US growth gap (the horizontal axis) the unshaded area  indicates what the annual rate of dollar depreciation (the vertical axis) would have to be  over the near term for the US trade deficit to begin to adjust, following the usual lags   In 2003, we were well above the line, with a growth gap of minus 1½ percentage points  and real dollar depreciation of 8½ percent  The panel shows that the stronger relative  foreign growth is, the less dollar depreciation would be required  However, even for  growth outcomes very favorable to foreign activity, some dollar depreciation would be  needed to get adjustment started  The staff estimates that the gap for relative potential  growth is currently about minus ½ percent, so we have plotted the corresponding point  on the line, marked by the box, as indicative of how far to the right on the horizontal   June 29-30, 2004 7 of 203          axis we might tend to be  At that growth gap, dollar depreciation of more than 8 percent  per year would be needed to start the process of external adjustment      Overall, the implications for the US economy of extended, gradual external   adjustment—listed to the right—include that demand on the part of US residents and  foreigners shifts in favor of US-made goods and services, thus boosting exports and  reducing imports  In order for the United States no longer to depend so much on foreign  saving, the extent to which US domestic demand exceeds US production potential  must decline  Contractionary fiscal policy could contribute to restraining domestic  demand and increasing net saving  Monetary policy would need to maintain full  utilization of US resources and may need to offset the expansionary implications of  increased demand for US goods  Significant resource shifts across production sectors  may be needed, which could entail adjustment costs for the economy      We cannot rule out that adjustment will be disorderly  In that case the primary   concerns are about conditions in asset markets, where there could be abrupt price  changes, increased volatility, and impaired liquidity, triggered by changed sentiment on  the part of foreign and domestic investors about the attractiveness of US assets   Because of the role of the exchange rate in cross-border transactions, dollar depreciation  is likely to be at the center of any disorderly event  Given that some depreciation is part  of virtually any external adjustment, depreciation in the case of a disorderly outcome  would likely have to be large in magnitude and abrupt in pace  With global asset  markets now highly linked, any abnormal developments in US markets would be likely  to spill over to asset markets elsewhere      Where are the effects of such asset-price swings likely to matter most?  The bottom   left panel contains data on balance sheet risk faced by US corporations via their debt  denominated in foreign currency  Foreign currency issuance is just 4 percent of the total  outstanding, and a substantial portion of that foreign currency risk may well have been  hedged in the derivatives market  So this channel is not likely to have significant  consequences  Foreign holdings of claims on the United States are shown by region in  the panel to the right  In European portfolios, especially those in the United Kingdom,  and in Canadian portfolios, holdings of US assets are quite large relative to their  respective GDPs  Negative balance sheet effects through declines in the exchange rate  or US asset prices could be expected to significantly impair economic activity in those  regions and to be not inconsequential for the other countries shown  Joe Gagnon will  continue our presentation         To be honest, I don’t have those numbers in front of me     We could certainly calculate world exports to world GDP  My guess is   that it won’t have slowed     Well, the recession     I can’t answer that exactly  Part of the problem, of course, is finding   the units in which to add up world exports and world GDP; that requires us to use data sources   that are not available on a timely basis  I don’t have world GDP for Q1; that number doesn’t   exist     But what is true is that the global recession and recovery tended to be   more intensive in goods than in services  They tended to be investment driven, at least in the   United States and to some extent elsewhere  And trade is more goods intensive than is GDP,   broadly speaking  So we saw imports and exports react more than in proportion to our GDP or   to our weighted average of foreign GDP; and presumably the rest of the world, added up,   experienced the same phenomenon  I would assume that we are still on something of an uptrend   and are washing through a cyclical phase, but we can look at that and get back to you on it   June 29-30, 2004 19 of 203          Of the variables that relate to globalization in a somewhat more indirect way, the only   ones that I know of that really slowed were the turnover measures on the foreign exchange   market  I think, in part, the effect of the euro on foreign exchange turnover, as we measure it,   probably explains why we saw declines in the volume of foreign exchange activity     That was just imposed on the chart       There were some assumptions made about continuing certain behaviors   and extrapolating them and so forth, but I deliberately didn’t want the red to have to go away, so   I told the people who prepared the chart that it should have some red on it [Laughter]     Well, these are hypothetical  Of all the pieces of the story, the   composition of the capital flows that will finance the US current account is the most subject to   change and the least predictable  So it would be foolhardy for us to claim in any sense that we   have written down a serious forecast  I simply wanted to show how the elements might interplay   and what the pieces would be     Similarly, I didn’t want the tan portion to grow too much or to grow too   little either  It is important to realize that not only do we have to finance the US current account   deficit but we have to take into account the reality of US investors buying claims on the rest of   the world  The elements of globalization that are making foreign investment attractive—that are   allowing people to diversify, reducing home bias, and adding to this dispersion to which you   referred—apply to US investors every bit as much as they apply to foreign investors  So that’s   June 29-30, 2004 21 of 203          an additional factor  And the flows must abide by simple accounting conditions—they have to   add up—in order to make the process continue     No, there’s just the ultimate final condition that it can’t continue   forever     Yes, indeed     For each of these countries, it is the portfolios of their residents  In   other words, line 1 refers to the portfolios of euro area residents, 85 percent of which are held in   domestic euro area securities     Yes  And they hold 5 percent of their portfolios in US securities,   leaving 10 percent held in non-US foreign securities     Well, yes, in the sense that the figures in column 2 would be the same    But the denominator here is the portfolio per country     Yes, their GDP     Yes, but let me amend my answer to you a second ago  In exhibit 3,   the figure in the column labeled “US securities” is bonds and equities     This is all claims, including foreign direct investment holdings—claims   in the United States through that channel     Yes, and Chrysler and all the other investment assets that Europeans   have bought     In exhibit 4, my point is that if there is a disorderly adjustment, the   balance sheet effects are likely to be felt more by residents of other countries than they will be by   residents of the United States     And these governments, in particular, are already challenged with   respect to fiscal policy  [Laughter]  But it is hard to see anywhere on earth, with the possible   exception of some Asian countries, where the governments themselves perceive the scope of   using fiscal policy in that way, whether they could do it well or not     We take that point very seriously  And it may be one reason—maybe   some of you have noticed it, too—that, when we go to international meetings, it is always the   other people around the table who are complaining about the US deficit and worry that it is   going to cause a problem  That may be because, in fact, the problems from the point of view of   the United States seem quite manageable relative to the picture we get of trying to figure out how   this situation is going to work itself out in the rest of the world     In some sense, if monetary policy could work immediately and without   friction, none of the GDP lines would move in this scenario 1     Yes  And in some sense, the elephant in the room is the size of the   current trade balance     The elephant grows     In some sense, there’s nothing we need to do about it  On the other   hand, I do lose a little sleep over that conclusion  But I do believe that global capital markets are   better at deciding where the world’s capital ought to be put than almost any other mechanism I   can think of      It can  And it’s certainly true that factors like US fiscal policy bear on   the intertemporal consequences of allowing this deficit to run  It bears on a much broader issue   of intertemporal resource utilization in this country that includes our borrowings from abroad   and our repayments or servicing of those borrowings going forward  So, I am inclined to say   when I look at exhibit 2—I agree with the Chairman—that it could happen  It is perfectly   plausible that there will be no adjustment through 2010  But then I look at the diagram on the   top left in exhibit 4, and every year that goes by that the deficit gets bigger, that line shifts  So   what it would take to get us going in the other direction becomes a bigger and bigger hurdle over   which we have to jump  The interplay of those things and whether the world’s economic   resources are being best allocated by all the millions of decisions that are being made by people   everywhere is the conundrum in all of this  It is not an immediate issue  It is not going to   produce a crisis tomorrow  It might not ever produce a crisis  But embedded in this situation are   these issues that are a concern     Linda is referring primarily, at least in the last portion of her answer to   you, to what we might call adjustment costs  The mix of US GDP that would come out of this   depends entirely on just where the shock starts, how it makes its way through the economy, and   in particular, how monetary policy has to respond  In the event that the shock began because   June 29-30, 2004 30 of 203          asset preferences turned against dollar assets, we would get one sequence of events  We would   get stimulus  The United States in any scenario has to produce more tradable goods and fewer   nontraded goods  So, in some sense, the shift has to involve a move into manufacturing and   certain sectors that we all know and love, and against certain sectors that we may think we   probably are overindulging ourselves in anyway  [Laughter]       That mix shift doesn’t necessarily have to mean that it is somehow an   unwelcome development in the US economy and that we’re going to have a smaller   manufacturing sector  We may have a bigger manufacturing sector  We may have more   investment in certain sectors, but we’ll have less investment in other sectors     Looking at the same set of relationships—and using the vocabulary of the national   income accounts—we do have to shrink our savings–investment imbalance  We have to lower   total investment and raise total savings so that they meet, or at least come closer to meeting than   they do now  The lower dollar will be a terms-of-trade change to the United States  US   consumers will have less purchasing power over the world’s goods, broadly defined, than before   the dollar fall; that will be a force against consumption, and it favors investment  The really   critical thing would be that monetary policy, even in some orderly scenarios I could imagine,   would have to tighten to restrain excess aggregate demand that would otherwise emerge in the   United States owing to the expansionary shock of dollar depreciation   But if adjustment were to begin by fiscal tightening in the United States—if that were   among the first things to happen—or by a spontaneous increase in US saving rates owing to   demographic effects or some such development that brought down interest rates and exchange   rates and lowered domestic demand, monetary policy might even have to ease  In that world the   June 29-30, 2004 31 of 203          mix of investment and consumption and government spending that we’d ultimately get would be   different  So, that’s not predetermined  The mix could come out a variety of ways  But the   savings and investment imbalance has to close  That much we know for sure     Yes  Indeed, in the background paper we reported another model   simulation, which we did not describe today, that makes the shock the productivity story  It   involves a one-time productivity shock that works its way through the whole global economy    And you can see how that world looks different from the one in which asset preferences change     Yes, right  But a stark case of that point is the difference between   productivity opportunities emerging abroad that attract capital abroad, as opposed to just a   widening of the risk premium because people become disheartened by the course of policy or the   politics or the outlook for the United States for some reason  The whole mix of saving and   investment globally and the accumulation of capital depends on just these kinds of factors     Let me answer your questions in reverse order, if you don’t mind    There is a difference in some of the conclusions we draw about pass-through, and I think it   would be worth airing that a little   You might ask, What if we just extended that saving line, wouldn’t everything have been   wonderful?  But the point of that panel on saving and investment and relating it to the other   information on the same exhibit is to try to emphasize the general equilibrium nature of this   process  It is true that fiscal policy could help  Fiscal policy is the one textbook answer to doing   something in the right direction to resolve this problem  But let’s say that government   expenditures were cut for whatever reason—just hypothetically, in a thought process—to match   whatever might otherwise have happened and we kept the saving rate sufficient so that the line   for saving would have been horizontal  A lot of the cutting of government spending would have   been on domestically produced goods, not internationally produced goods  There is no magic   direct channel from fiscal policy to traded goods or to our trade deficit   We do simulations asking what the outcome for external adjustment would be if we   assumed a fiscal policy action of this or that size  If we put a contractionary fiscal policy in   place that lowers domestic demand for an unchanged exchange rate and everything else,   momentarily we have slack resources in the US economy  The model then tells us that   monetary policy should respond and should stimulate the economy to get utilization of resources   back to capacity  But the mix of GDP will now be different  By construction, we cut G,   government spending  The question is, Are we going to get more exports?  Are we going to get   more of some other component of domestic demand?  And the answer to that question depends   June 29-30, 2004 35 of 203          importantly on the interest elasticity of the components of domestic demand, the interest   elasticity in our model of the exchange rate, and the exchange rate elasticities of exports  So as   we do this exercise, filling that hole from fiscal policy, we get back a fairly substantial amount of   domestic demand  And the adjustment that we get in the external balance is only a portion—and   it could even be a small portion—of the change that was made to fiscal spending that started it       Right  I think we’re confusing endogenous and exogenous things here,   which makes me a little nervous  But somewhere along the way there needs to be a mechanism   that “crowds in,” to use David’s language, exports and helps to get external balance out of the   fiscal action  The same story would have been true had the original shock just been a   spontaneous increase in saving rates on the part of the private sector  What delivers the external   adjustment is that the exchange rate changes; and it changes the relative price among the   components of GDP  The result is that people, both producers and consumers, shift their   behavior in a way that makes net exports fill that hole as opposed to other components of   domestic demand  The interest elastic components also come in to fill that hole       I will take thirty seconds on this question about whether these numbers   in exhibit 4 are big or little, and then we will turn to the pass-through question  It is true that the   37 percent of GDP for Europe or the 56 percent of GDP for Canada that are shown in that exhibit   are big numbers  But remember, on this basis, capital output ratios for economies are numbers   like 300  So, though these economies hold claims on assets that are multiples of their GDP—and   their claims on the United States may be 60 percent of their GDP—you want to put it in that   perspective     We’ll turn to the pass-through question  Linda     The one stumbling block in trying to analyze this problem that we’ve   encountered since we began—we have a little cottage industry here, and I have been doing this   for eight or nine years of my life now—is that we don’t have the capacity to relate exchange   rates, in real time or hypothetically in a model, to a number of variables and have a deterministic   relationship among those variables and exchange rates that works very well at all  So we are   always forced to pose the problem and structure the answer in ways that don’t require that we   claim that we can forecast exchange rate developments  We talk about relationships, but we   don’t say that the dollar will do this at a certain point in time or even that the dollar will do this   in response to the current account, which is an open issue that we didn’t even raise here  We   have lots in here about how the dollar affects the deficit implicitly  In Joe’s simulation, the   dollar is driving these things  We don’t really have anything about how the deficit is feeding   back on the dollar because being able to explain determination of exchange rates is the weakest   link in international economics going  We don’t have an answer, and others don’t have one   either  I’m inclined to think that, if Secretary Snow rented out Yankee Stadium and made the   announcement you indicated, the dollar would move  But I wouldn’t be basing that on an   understanding of economics  [Laughter]  It would be more my understanding of the politics in   the United States and what I think traders would do because that’s what they think other traders   would do      Part of me clings to the hope that oral intervention of whatever sort has   a marginal and only transitory effect on exchange rates and that deep down the economic   fundamentals drive the process, regardless of what anybody says     It should     We’re just not in the business of predicting crises here  Down deep the   things that make the US economy different from the rest of the world I think are overpowering   in terms of the role of the dollar, notably the size of the economy, the flexibility of the markets,   and the depth and size of the asset markets  The notion that the world’s investors will truly   become so disheartened about the US economy that they will produce something that would   look like a disorderly adjustment strikes me as remote  On the other hand, I was an adult in the   1970s and early 1980s, and I remember periods when the dollar was thought to be a very weak   currency  And I remember periods when Federal Reserve policies weren’t well regarded  So   I’m not about to say that could never happen  I just don’t see it happening any time soon     If US macroeconomic policy remains well grounded, if the value of   goods in terms of US dollars is well maintained by this Committee, if nature doesn’t impose   some truly exogenous crazy event on the US economy, and if US fiscal policy could get a little   June 29-30, 2004 43 of 203          better, I think those are the things that will determine how this situation evolves  But, you know,   when I read my own briefing I realize what it means—that this problem is going to continue to   grow  And I remember Herb Stein’s admonition and say that this situation can’t go on; at some   point, in some way, an adjustment has to occur  The paper had a rather benign outcome in which   the productivity differential just worked its way through the system and things more or less   corrected  I can certainly imagine, if the same sort of productivity shock that hit the United   States were to become evident abroad—which we keep looking for—that it would accelerate that   process even more  And those stories do exist  Those adjustment paths are very credible     It’s in two quarters actually      No, no  You should think of scenario 1 as just an initial description of   an element that is in the whole set of scenarios  We didn’t really mean for you to take scenario 1   seriously without scenario 2 coming along as well  That was more an analytical clarification    We think that much dollar depreciation would roil markets      Yes, in that short a time period  As indicated in exhibit 6, starting in   1985 a depreciation of that magnitude occurred over 2½ years     In my own mind—Joe actually did this page, so he might have a   different way of explaining it—I don’t think of the shock in scenario 1 as causing the shock of   scenario 2  If people were to wake up and decide that they didn’t want to hold claims in the   United States, that would mean that all those things would occur at once  People simultaneously   do not want to hold dollar claims but also do not want US equity or US bonds, et cetera     I see that as affecting the path  In other words, those countries are in   some sense financing our deficit  Official finance is a variant of private finance; it has different   incentives behind it and perhaps works through other asset markets a bit differently  But what   the Asian official sector is now doing is in part financing a continuation of the deficit as opposed   to triggering or even participating in the adjustment process  There are some risks embedded in   June 29-30, 2004 45 of 203          that  There are some who feel that the decisionmaking in the official sector is a bit more   political; it is not comparable to the kinds of decisions and thought processes made by those in   the private sector  Also, the sums are getting very large so that the holdings of foreign claims on   the United States are becoming concentrated in a very few spots  Huge sums are held in the   Central Bank of Taiwan and the People’s Bank of China; that in and of itself sort of changes   things a bit  On the other hand, I’m inclined to think that those official entities are not likely to   shoot themselves in the foot if they can help it  So there are pluses and minuses, I guess  If they   change their exchange rate strategy, I would expect them to change their reserve management   strategy; I think those two things will go hand in hand  While it will matter to the specifics of   the path, I don’t think it’s a deal breaker       That is certainly the attitude that the staff has taken  We’ve even   written those points down, and we’ve asked the Chairman to say them out loud, and he has    [Laughter]      In part, it goes back to this unanswered question of exchange rate   determination  In essence, that conclusion follows from a kind of portfolio balance theory of the   exchange rate  What it says is that, when the Chinese, for example, take dollars off the market   and out of the hands of the private sector, they make dollars less abundant relative to Chinese   renminbi  That is true, but they also make dollars less abundant relative to European currencies    So in essence, they absorb some of the dollars that would otherwise be putting pressure on the   euro and any other currency you care to name That’s because there is this big portfolio balance   issue and relative supplies are a factor; so anybody who buys dollars in some sense is helping the   other currencies, not hurting them  But that isn’t the only theory of exchange rate determination   that one might want to adhere to  And given that none of these theories is empirically very   satisfactory, it is possible to construct the story another way and get a different conclusion      There are time-varying and policy-varying risk premiums on most of   those equations, and we can get different outcomes     I would say it’s not  The fact of the matter is that most of the securities   of at least private corporations—not US Treasuries, obviously—that foreigners buy are   marketed in Europe and are sold in the euro markets  They are not sold in New York  I’m not   saying that there aren’t any sales of the type you asked about, but there’s a huge offshore market   for corporates in which the securities are denominated in various currencies and the lenders can   vary  And that market is for the most part in London—in Tokyo, too, and to a limited extent in   Frankfurt—not New York  What foreign buyers of US corporates purchase is a security issued   June 29-30, 2004 48 of 203          in their own jurisdiction and in some sense governed by their own jurisdiction’s practices  So,   while I see your point and I’m sure that some part of what you are saying is accurate, it’s not as   if these people truly are participating directly in the US corporate market  The US   corporations are going overseas to the euro market    What is true is that foreign corporations haven’t followed those in the United States in   choosing to offer corporate tradable securities that have a range of alternatives  The secondary   markets haven’t developed, and the derivatives markets haven’t developed as much, in part   because of the universal banking tradition that they have  They’ve gone a different way  It’s   true that they might change  Those corporations could become more multinational so that their   taste for how to finance themselves in different places changes  If European corporations start to   offer a richer mix of high quality corporate debt in their own markets, European or Asian or   other non-US investors will see more competition with US bonds and equities, and that could   have an effect     Well, a certain variation of that theme is to rerun the Asian crisis in   one’s head over and over and ask, What if this or that or the other thing had been different?    Indeed, many people now argue that some of the Asian countries are recreating conditions   comparable to those that existed in 1996 and 1997, in particular the stability that they are trying   to achieve in their exchange rates  Are those kinds of conditions being recreated?  I think there   is a clear risk   Now, it is also true that one of the lessons that those countries drew from the Asian crisis   is that large holdings of reserves are a good insurance policy  Also, they realize that running a   current account surplus removes the need to go to the market to finance their activities in any   given month, day, or quarter, if conditions get a little adverse  I think they are quite explicitly   seeking to build large quantities of reserves both to impart confidence to the market, which sees   that they have all these wonderful reserves, and to use if needed—though I would say it’s   probably more the former than the latter  And they exhibit a certain bias in the direction of   keeping their exchange rate from appreciating in real terms because that’s what generates the   surpluses that protect them from the need to go to the market  So they don’t have a large   outstanding stock of debt; and, if anything, they are running down their net debt position and   might have positive claims on the rest of the world at the rate they are going  They don’t have a   June 29-30, 2004 51 of 203          flow problem, and thus they feel better positioned to manage the ups and downs of being   globalized into the world’s capital markets     The problem they face involves the consequences for their domestic economies if these   strategies ultimately get uncomfortable  One thing that could happen through the back door is   that they may end up with their money supplies growing and they may have domestic inflation;   so they get real exchange rate appreciation even while they are maintaining nominal exchange   rate stability They may at the same time lessen the chance to strengthen and develop their   banking systems and their capital markets because they are constraining prices in the domestic   financial system more than is attractive  So they may be encouraging their private citizens to   diversify out of the domestic market, even though they are trying to reassure those private   citizens through the exchange rate stability  These countries might be better served in the long   run not just to hold on to the resources they are requiring as reserves but to use them to come up   with a stronger banking system and more competitive capital markets  Ultimately that strategy   of trying to achieve exchange rate stability is not going to prove to be a long-run winner  It   could be a good adjustment strategy, buying time to accomplish the domestic reforms and to   strengthen their financial systems—doing that carefully over a period of time  But it does have   the capacity to put us back in a world in which the emerging-market countries, even successful   ones, lack some of the features that the developed countries have, particularly on the investment   side  So these emerging-market countries are still subject to concerns about sudden reversals of   capital flows or capital flight from their own residents, and those sorts of things  Indonesia, for   example, has had a lot of pressure on its exchange rate lately—shades of a return to 1997  It’s a   real issue  And I think it’s one of the reasons that we can finance a 5 percent deficit when they   June 29-30, 2004 52 of 203          probably can’t and that we can probably finance a 6 or 7 percent deficit when they surely   couldn’t  Does it mean that we can finance a 9 or 10 or 15 percent deficit?  I don’t know      Within the kinds of numbers we’ve experienced to date we’re inclined   to be relatively relaxed about that  Dino might want to comment on that issue, too, though     Yes     I think what we’re talking about are the preferences of everybody else    Let’s assume that foreign officials, because of laws written into their books, their regulations,   their procedures, or whatever, always want US sovereigns but that the vast majority of global   June 29-30, 2004 53 of 203          investors regard US sovereigns and US corporate triple-As as perfect substitutes  Then this   tiny group called foreign officials can do whatever they want, and it really doesn’t matter to the   pricing of the assets involved     This reminds me of the debate we had when we thought US debt was   going to disappear  While that has consequences, it was not something we regarded as a bad   thing because we had surpluses  So, surely it is manageable      Yes    June 29-30, 2004 54 of 203                                                               3 The materials used by Mr Kos are appended to this transcript (appendix 3)     There’s a risk premium in that as well as an expectation   "
7370,2004-08-10,"  As David has discussed, it now appears that the pace of US   economic activity in the second and third quarters has been and likely remains  somewhat less robust than we thought in June  Such a development naturally leads us  to question whether we should reduce our forecast for activity abroad, as the strength  of demand arising in the United States is an important factor for many regions of the  global economy  However, the data we have in hand for the second quarter and the  indicators we have received for activity abroad this quarter do not suggest any major  revisions to our outlook, and our projection for foreign economic growth is little  changed this time from that in the June Greenbook  The possibility of some spillover  from the softness in US activity remains a risk, however      The view that the foreign expansion remains moderately vigorous is consistent   with the fact that we were surprised on the upside by real growth of US exports in  the second quarter  Although we still lack monthly nominal trade data for June,  stronger-than-expected exports in May and positive revisions to April have led us to  project that exports of real goods and services expanded almost 12½ percent at an  annual rate in the second quarter—a full 5 percentage points higher than we were  forecasting in June  The nominal data show strength across most categories,  particularly capital goods and industrial supplies  By destination, they reflect the  second-quarter weakness in economic activity in China, with nominal exports to  China plus Hong Kong declining from the first quarter  We expect that real GDP  growth abroad, particularly in the major foreign industrial countries, will moderate on  average over the remainder of this year and, accordingly, that real exports will  decelerate some through next year     Our story is a bit less satisfactory with respect to real imports of goods and   services  Although US real GDP growth for the second quarter came in below our  expectations, real imports of goods and services also surprised us on the upside  A  higher figure than anticipated for May and an upward revision to April imply second- quarter real import growth of about 9½ percent, about 4 percentage points above our  projection in the June Greenbook  The strength in imports is widespread across  categories  For the second half of this year, when we incorporate the weaker outlook  for US GDP growth including the information from last Friday’s employment  report, we now expect real import growth to slow some, to an annual rate of   August 10, 2004 13 of 103          9 percent, about ¾ percentage point weaker than the figure in the current Greenbook    For 2005, we expect further deceleration in imports, to an annual growth rate a bit  less than 8 percent      With our outlook for import growth slightly diminished, we see the arithmetic   contribution of net exports to real GDP growth as moving to about minus  ⅓ percentage point in the second half of this year and averaging about that much in  2005  We have also shaved a bit off our projection for the current account deficit and  expect it to average 5½ percent of GDP next year     In addition to the less positive near-term news about the US economy, the other   major global economic development over the intermeeting period was a further rise in  oil prices  In line with futures prices at the time, we had expected the spot price of  WTI to begin moving down; and for the few days between the Greenbook release and  the June FOMC meeting it did just that  However, since June 29, the spot price has  moved up nearly $9 per barrel, to close above $44 yesterday  Our forecast for the  average spot price of WTI this quarter has been revised up $5 per barrel  Although  we and the futures markets still expect the price of oil to move down over the forecast  period, our projected path shows a decline of only $4 per barrel from the current  quarter to the fourth quarter of next year      Sorting the mix of demand and supply effects is made difficult by the limited   availability of very current data  OPEC raised its production target 2 million barrels a  day for July and an additional 05 million b/d for August and has continued to  produce above its announced quotas  Excluding Iraq, OPEC produced 269 million  b/d in June, an increase of about 1½ million b/d from April  Much of that increase is  due to Saudi Arabia and the Emirates; and other than Iraq, no OPEC member reduced  production significantly over the last few months  On August 4, Saudi authorities  announced that they had started production from two new fields three months ahead  of schedule       Nevertheless, there have been some negative supply factors over the intermeeting   period  The most important has been the Russian government’s virtual attack on  Yukos  In the guise of taking steps to collect unpaid taxes, the Russian government  has taken actions that seem intended to gain control of Yukos production assets  Both  the rapid reversals of some decisions made in the past several weeks and the  ambiguity of whether production will be disrupted in the near future have heightened  uncertainty in oil markets  In Iraq, intensified violence in recent days has threatened  oil exports from the southern ports on the Persian Gulf  Other sources of supply  concerns have been conditions in Nigeria and Venezuela plus questions about  refinery capacity and short-term refinery disruptions  These developments have  combined to put upward pressure on prices and to increase volatility      With spot prices rising even as reported supply has increased, it seems clear that   strong global demand for oil has contributed importantly to the run-up in prices  In  early July, the International Energy Association (IEA) revised up its estimates of   August 10, 2004 14 of 103          world oil consumption in the first and second quarters  For the first half of the year,  world oil consumption is estimated at 81 million b/d, up 3 million from the same  period last year  Global consumption is expected to rise slightly further during the  second half of the year  US demand for oil has risen over the past year, but much of  the increase in global demand is attributable to China, where demand has moved up  noticeably both last year and so far this year  IEA estimates put global production in  excess of global consumption in the second quarter, implying a considerable build in  inventories—more than is normal for that quarter  Such a development is only partly  evident in data on OECD inventories, which have increased but remain at low levels   If IEA data are correct and no supply disruption emerges, then inventories should  build further in the current quarter, with downward pressure on prices a likely result   This expectation seems to be priced, at least in part, into the futures market, which, as  mentioned earlier, yet again calls for prices to move down from their current highs   The current IEA data may be misleading, however  Recent upward revisions to  estimates of demand raise the possibility that demand is even stronger than now  estimated  The elevated level of the entire current path of futures prices suggests that,  in response to the intermeeting developments such as the Yukos events, traders have  become less sanguine that production will meet or exceed consumption going  forward       With strong global demand for oil a major factor in explaining the high spot   prices, the implications of the higher prices for our outlook for foreign growth are  complex  For individual countries, the consequences of high global oil prices might  be the same whether those prices result from supply restrictions or from demand  arising elsewhere  But on average, absent significant disruption, we judge that only if  global economic expansion remains strong will these prices be sustained  The data do  not suggest that we are reaching a global supply constraint  Accordingly, with no  major supply disruption yet occurring in oil markets or assumed in our forecast, we  have adjusted the growth and inflation forecasts for individual countries, but we  continue to project a sustained expansion abroad at a pace close to, but slightly below,  that experienced in the first half of this year  Dave and I will be happy to answer any  questions         But it matters if demand is being underestimated      That is where all the anecdotes about China come in, I think  Our   information about what is really going on in China is poor, at best  We know, for example, that the   electricity grid in that country is not up to the task of meeting current demands, and China’s   economy is growing rapidly  And we know that, in response to that, many manufacturers or other   producer units—or for that matter households, for all we know—have purchased generators  But   August 10, 2004 16 of 103          the use of numerous small generators burning kerosene or heavy fuel oil or whatever they burn is a   very inefficient way to supply electricity  Their use is lowering, if you will, the average efficiency   of producing electricity to support economic growth in China, perhaps in an important way      The story, though, is that to build capacity you need to stock it with an   original endowment and some of that is happening      Right, but we don’t know  All these anecdotes are out there, but no one   has real data     Well, certainly in the intermeeting period, not only the spot price but I   think the farther-out futures have reacted enormously to the Yukos story, which is not really about   production today  Actually, it might be about production today because overnight the Russian   authorities seized control of a big production unit of Yukos, which only added credence to the view   August 10, 2004 17 of 103          that the Russian government was trying to re-establish control over those assets or wanted to gain   some perceived political benefit by selling them at below true value to favored purchasers      It is hard to imagine that they would allow that to happen for any period   of time, but I’m sufficiently skeptical about their business competence that I wouldn’t assume that   they can do all this shifting and achieve their political aims and not disrupt supply temporarily  But   there is certainly no incentive for them to cut back production      To exert some leverage over the rest of the oil producers or for a host of   reasons      Well, you’re asking someone whose expertise in this matter is more   limited than I wish it were  It’s normal for this curve to display a downward slope, but it’s not   always the case that it does  There have been times when the front portion of the futures curve has   sloped up; that would not be considered an unprecedented event by any means  Oil is costly to   store  So that figures into the value of buying now to meet a future demand versus buying it in the   future     I’ve expressed to the people who study this market in great detail my frustration about the   fact that this curve slopes down all the time and rides up to the actual spot price  I’ve asked why it   is that the people in the futures market always continue to believe that the oil price is going to start   coming down “tomorrow” despite six months’ worth of evidence that that hasn’t happened  Those   who analyze the oil market confront me with this supply and demand story  They say that as best   they—and I assume all the people trading in the real markets—can tell, the data they have available   suggest that the current supply exceeds consumption  Now, we may someday learn that these data   were just wholly inaccurate, and that may explain what was misleading all of us  But the people   trading in the futures markets have the same data, and they, too, believe that current production   exceeds consumption by a comfortable margin  So they are always expecting that supply–demand   imbalance to show through to the oil prices     Now, these people have become a bit battle scarred  And the curve, at least to my eyes, has   flattened a little from some of its previous shapes  I think that’s because, even though the   production data, taken literally, suggest that production exceeds global consumption, people are   pricing in either some expectation of a Russian foul-up of one sort or another, or a terrorist event, or   August 10, 2004 19 of 103          the Venezuelan situation getting ugly, or something of that sort  So either they are attaching some   probability to supply being below global capacity in the future, or they have come to believe that the   data aren’t entirely reliable  Something, however, has caused them to bid up the far futures more   than a straight reading of what the market’s knowledge of demand and supply would create but not   so much as to take away completely this notion that inventories must be building somewhat and that   it’s going to show through to prices at some point      Pickup, yes     Or it will come down just with the passage of time  If among those   purchasers are people who envision some reason for using oil, they don’t need to buy in the spot   market because they will have already bought forward  If they are just speculating, as it gets close   to the time when they’re going to get delivery of this oil that they don’t really want, they’re going to   sell it spot  Ultimately, it’s only the people who actually consume the oil who can sustain the price   August 10, 2004 21 of 103          That’s what makes this global demand story have to be the context in which this trading is taking   place      And somewhere out there are alternative energy sources—tar sands, other   kinds of materials, or whatever  They often used to be cited as putting a limit on how high the oil   price could be      Even ethanol looks good      But if one imagines that the citizens of India and China, which would total   about 3 billion people, raise their per capita consumption of energy to, say, half the average of that   in industrial countries—     That would result in an altogether different picture of the long-term   energy supply–demand balance in the world  And the effect of that has to feed back at some point    Now, if that were really what was driving everything, one might think that investment in the energy   sector would just be taking off, and I don’t see that either  And part of it is because this miserable   curve slopes down all the time  In the short run it always seems as if the price of oil is going to fall   August 10, 2004 22 of 103          any day and, therefore, that such investment is not really going to pay off  There’s a certain   inconsistency in that, I realize      It’s certainly true that the role of Saudi Arabia as the swing producer was   a deliberate and explicit policy adopted by the Saudis  They would restrict production or they   would expand production in an attempt to set a sort of horizontal supply curve for oil at a specified   price  That has just broken down  It has broken down for a variety of reasons  What I think we’re   seeing is the transition to some new structural pattern in global oil and related sources of energy that   hasn’t really settled out yet  And it’s not clear exactly how it is going to settle out   "
7395,2004-09-21,"  The baseline forecast for real output growth in the rest of the   world is little changed from that in the August Greenbook  This is the case despite  substantial market volatility of, and much media attention to, global oil prices  The  primary reason is that despite the intermeeting fluctuations, the path of oil prices  implicit in futures prices showed little net change from the path incorporated in the  August Greenbook  We did look very carefully at the question of how the effects of  elevated oil prices are likely to be distributed across foreign economies  And there  are differences among industrial countries, emerging-market economies, net oil  importers, and net oil exporters  Nevertheless, the basic common elements of  reduced oil intensity in several foreign countries, especially the foreign industrial   September 21, 2004 18 of 100          countries, and well-anchored inflation expectations in most important foreign  economies, along with the expectation that only a portion of the spike in spot prices  will prove to be persistent, have led us and most forecasters to judge that the output  effects of recent oil market developments will be limited     Our initial projection for growth abroad in 2006 is that foreign real GDP will   expand at about 3¼ percent, a slight deceleration from the 3½ percent annual pace of  the second half of this year  Among the industrial countries, most of the stepdown in  growth is accounted for by Canada and the United Kingdom, countries whose  economies have been expanding particularly rapidly, closing their output gaps, and  that need to bring growth in line with potential in order to avert the emergence of  inflationary pressures  The central banks of both those countries have already moved  to tighten policy, with the Bank of Canada tightening 25 basis points earlier this  month and the Bank of England increasing rates by a total of 125 basis points since  mid-2003  Some deceleration is also projected for the Asian developing economies  on average, particularly in Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, and Indonesia  Elevated oil  prices are boosting headline inflation abroad, but core price inflation, where data are  available, appears to be well contained  Over the forecast period, we expect inflation  abroad to decline gradually as oil prices reverse some of their recent run-up and as  food prices, which have been a factor in Asia, retreat in response to increased supply,  and as monetary tightening in Brazil and Mexico have some effect     Extension of the forecast horizon to the end of 2006 allows the effects of returns   to near-trend growth here and in most regions abroad to show through to our  projections for real net exports, the nominal trade deficit, and the current account  deficit  The consequences of weakness in activity here and abroad earlier, past dollar  depreciation, and sharp swings in oil and nonfuel commodity prices will have been  pretty much fully felt by the end of 2005  For this forecast, we have projected  slightly more rapid depreciation of the dollar than previously, with the broad dollar  decline averaging nearly 1½ percent in real terms in 2005 and 2006  We judge that  such an outcome in relative income here and abroad and in price competitiveness of  US goods would lead to a widening of the nominal US trade deficit of about $90  billion from its current average through the last quarter of 2006  In addition,  prospective increases in market dollar interest rates, along with other factors, imply  that US net investment income will move into deficit, declining nearly as much as  the trade deficit over the same period  As a result, our projection for the current  account balance widens from about $700 billion this quarter to nearly $880 billion in  the fourth quarter of 2006, reaching about 6½ percent of GDP  In real terms, there is  an equivalent deterioration  The positive contribution from real exports to overall  GDP growth slowly diminishes from more than 08 percentage point this year to less  than 07 percentage point in 2006  And the negative contribution from imports  remains above 1 percentage point, reaching 13 percentage points over the four  quarters of 2006  There is thus a persistent subtraction from US GDP growth that  arises from the external sector and that reaches about ⅔ percentage point in 2006   The slight deceleration in real export growth primarily reflects a lessening of the past   September 21, 2004 19 of 100          impetus coming from relative prices, particularly from the exchange rate  Similarly,  the strengthening in real import growth arises largely from a relative price boost  Of  course, real export growth would have to exceed that of real imports substantially at  this point for real net exports to have a neutral effect on the forecast for US GDP  growth     Only a few forecasters have added 2006 to their outlooks  Although we are not   absolutely alone in anticipating a marked deterioration in the external balance over  the next two years, many forecasters currently call for little change from this year to  next  For example, the average current account deficit polled by Consensus Forecasts  is about $625 billion for both 2004 and 2005  Of course, some of the individual  outlooks in that average call for the deficit to widen, but some actually project a  narrowing  Plus, a number above $800 billion for 2006 seems to be way off the radar  screen of most forecasters     Our view that the current account deficit will widen into rather startling new   territory reflects the large size that the deficit has already reached and our projected  path for the dollar  Trend growth here and abroad is consistent with the deficit  widening further unless relative prices change, and the present large deficit means  that the decline in the nominal balance moves quickly as likely growth rates yield  rapidly diverging exports and imports  This poses a severe challenge to us with  respect to our projection for the exchange value of the dollar in the baseline forecast     For some time we have taken to heart the results of research that we and others   have done that shows that structural models of the exchange rate have little  forecasting power  Accordingly, we have incorporated into the forecast paths for the  real value of the dollar that are nearly flat, with some slight trend at times to signal  features of the maintained assumption about US monetary policy or our ongoing  concern that the financing of the US external deficit would ultimately result in  downward pressure on the dollar  But that strategy now results in the external sector  having a very prominent effect on the top-line GDP path  Moreover, as the numbers  we are writing down get larger and larger, we are beginning to have doubts that  financial markets will be able to manage them easily  However, no clearly better  alternative comes to mind  If we arbitrarily projected a path for the dollar that  minimizes the negative effects coming from the external sector, then we would be  masking an important feature of the US macroeconomy, and that dollar path, rather  than net exports, would become the essence of the international forecast  Because we  do not believe that we truly can project when any major change in the value of the  dollar will happen, in particular whether it will happen within the forecast interval,  we do not see any basis on which we could follow that strategy  For now, we have  used the alternative simulation in the Greenbook to suggest to you what would be the  consequences of a sharp move in the dollar sometime in the forecast period  As  awareness of the looming external deficits becomes more widespread, we may see  more clues in financial markets as to what to expect from them  Dave and I would be  happy to answer any of your questions   September 21, 2004 20 of 100              Well, I like to avoid the words “unsustainable” or “sustainable”   because then you’ll ask me what makes something sustainable and I can’t answer that question       I absolutely agree with everything you said     Yes  And where we saw it most clearly was when it came time to look   at the contribution of those numbers to GDP  In the past, there were those of us, such as myself,   September 21, 2004 21 of 100          who were somewhat of a Cassandra regarding the external deficit, but we were talking tenths of   a percentage point one way or another in terms of the effect on GDP  The notion that the effect   would get swamped by the unanticipated ups and downs that would come along in the forecast   period was always present, and the external sector didn’t seem to be creating a situation that   would strike financial market participants as unmanageable   This time, as we worked our way through preliminary runs of the forecast, the negative   contribution from the external sector got up to be almost 1 percentage point of GDP  Well, we   finally settled on something a bit smaller for 2006  But 1 percentage point of GDP gets one’s   attention; in fact, ⅔ percentage point of GDP gets my attention  So the reason that this seemed   an opportune time to call extra attention to that point is that, when we first extend the forecast   horizon, as we have now into 2006, it gives us a longer time period over which these kinds of   forces are having their effect  This is a very inertial process, so one has to look ahead more than   just a few quarters to see its consequences   We don’t know much else about 2006, so we don’t have information that would lead us   to say, “Oh, a US recession is going to cause imports to fall,” or “A crisis in Asia is going to   cause capital inflows to be particularly high”  We don’t know what kinds of other random   events are going to occur in 2006  All we’re seeing is this long-lasting fundamental process, and   we’re seeing it very clearly  Surely, the numbers we’re forecasting right now for 2006 will not   actually happen; I fully appreciate that  But they will be embedded in what does happen, and   this is an opportunity to see them more clearly before the outlook gets complicated by other   developments     Unless you happen to have an urn and a few balls that I can select   from, I don’t think I’m in any better position than you are to judge that outcome  When we have   in some previous Greenbook simulations—or in the June FOMC presentation, for example—  added an asset market disruption and volatility as a consequence of a change in the dollar, it is   always just very arbitrary on our part  There’s no systematic link that we’ve been able to   discover in the data between the exchange rate and these other things  A lot depends on the   exogenous shock, if you will, that gives rise to the exchange rate change  So to mimic a world in   which people became less confident about US assets, we put in higher risk-premium terms and   things that drive the stock market, and we get out some disruptive effects  But the dollar could   move as a result of a world in which productivity gains finally started showing up in other   countries—      Yes  But I’m looking at a scenario that would have a net positive   shock to the global economy so that it’s not that our incomes in the future are likely to be lower   but that foreign incomes appear likely to be higher  Foreign assets look as if they should be   valued more highly  The relative differential shows through to cause the dollar to fall, but on   balance, it is a more favorable foreign outlook rather than a less favorable US outlook that   produces that effect You’d get a very different story if the dollar were to fall for political   reasons that could be driven by safe-haven concerns, which would tend to drive down US long-  term interest rates somewhat, as we saw in ’97 and ’98  Alternatively, the dollar could fall for   anti-US political reasons, and presumably people would then be selling US bonds as well as   US dollars  So the mix is all over the map  The dollar itself is just a reflection of what that   underlying shock might be, as would be the case with stock prices and with the long-term   interest rate  We can arbitrarily put those shocks into the model and get out the answers, but   basically we feel why bother the model?  We could just write down the answers  That’s in   essence what we’d be doing, so we’ve shied away from it      Well, presumably that would lead to a step-up in the US saving rate    We would get some benefit from a dollar decline  Remember, a drop in the dollar is a very   expansionary shock to the US economy When we run that shock sort of naked, the way we did   this time, and ask the model what the outcome would be, the Taylor rule wants monetary   tightening  And we still get some more output and some more inflation because it’s a very   expansionary shock  But if it happens in the context of something like a loss of confidence,   September 21, 2004 27 of 100          these residuals that were just being discussed presumably would go up in other countries, too—  ones without all of the attributes of the United States, such as Brazil, Argentina, and Korea     These kinds of shocks tend to be associated not with expansionary macroeconomic   outcomes but with recessionary macroeconomic outcomes because, despite the fact that the   exchange rate gets a relative price boost, these other events cause such havoc and disrupt fiscal   policy and so forth that there’s often monetary tightening to counter the inflationary effects  But   also there’s stress in the financial markets and stress in investment spending, and fiscal policy   gets off track and, all in all, you get a recession movement, not an expansion, despite the   exchange rate shock  So out of context, it’s just very difficult to put these added features into the   equation along with the exchange rate  One could do dozens of these simulations, and I would   have no way of attaching probabilities to them, to be honest     Right     It has some balance sheet effects that complicate the household sector’s   problems and the nonfinancial corporate sector’s problems, and typically there are some balance   sheet effects that threaten the banking system  Now, for sure, we don’t think that a depreciation   in the dollar would have serious consequences for the US banking system  In June I mentioned   that, given the information we had, the balance sheet effects from a dollar depreciation appeared   to be abroad rather than at home  Dollar-denominated assets would become less valuable   abroad, but balance sheets in the United States would tend to be more or less dollar neutral   September 21, 2004 28 of 100          because the dollar is on both sides  It would be a complicated picture  But the confidence   effects and other aspects of the story depend very much on the precipitating shock     The holdings abroad need to be divided into two basic categories, one   of which is the net foreign direct investment story and the other is the portfolio—that is, stocks   and bonds and bank claims  What you’ve described has characterized the foreign direct   investment portfolio  We have, on average, earned higher rates of return on our holdings of   foreign direct investments than foreign investors in the United States have earned on theirs  That   has been a big source, and will continue to be a big source, of net positive income into the US   current account  It is ironic that we’ve become the world’s biggest debtor and nonetheless we’ve   actually been recording, at times, positive income flows  That is because much of the bond   portfolio is dollar-denominated  There are very few—some, but not a lot—foreign-currency-  denominated bonds issued by US corporations; they are mostly dollar-denominated bonds  And   interest rates on those have been quite low  So even though the position has deteriorated—  basically, rather severely—from 1995, the net income actually stopped deteriorating and was   quite flat for a while, owing to the low interest rates  In principle, if the interest rates were   September 21, 2004 29 of 100          actually zero, one could see that that whole part of the portfolio wouldn’t matter at all  So the   notion that we earn more on direct investment is still present in the data and in our forecast  But   as we apply somewhat higher interest rates to the bond part and the bank deposit part, we finally   see the consequences of being a big net debtor starting to overwhelm this direct investment   portion of the position      Well, one of the features in the Greenbook simulation, going back to   the prior question, is the model’s ability to say that foreign policymakers act in a way that speaks   to this codependence  One problem that we face collectively in the global economy is that the   low interest rate environment for all concerned does limit the capacity of foreign central banks to   stimulate domestic demand as they lose external demand  So zero-bound problems become quite   relevant, as we highlighted especially in the paper that we circulated ahead of the June meeting    The most immediate and direct device we have for undoing the codependence is to get domestic   demand abroad stronger and to do that through monetary policy stimulation; but that’s limited to   some degree by zero-bound problems  And when we run these model simulations, we tend to hit   the zero bound, particularly in the euro area, say, where the policy rate is sitting at 2 percent   right now  And, of course, Japan is already in the vicinity of the zero bound, so there’s not a lot   of scope for stimulating domestic demand   If I wanted to, I could tell a happy story  There are plenty of happy stories  We’ve been   through this before—in the 1980s—and we’ve lived through the past decade The world hasn’t   September 21, 2004 30 of 100          stopped turning; even the financial markets haven’t stopped turning  There’s a lot of potential in   the developing world for capital accumulation, either financed out of the high saving rates of   those countries or financed out of foreign direct investment that doesn’t keep flowing into the   United States but goes to China, to the rest of Asia, and maybe even to Brazil and other Latin   American countries  There’s a lot of potential in Brazil  There have been investment bank   articles that I’m sure some of you have seen about how fifty years from now China, India, and   Brazil are going to be the dominant economies in the globe  If that capital accumulation is   realized, that’s domestic demand in the rest of the world  The market economies of the globe   can handle all that; there’s no reason to think that it can’t lead to a quite benign resolution of the   circumstances we’re now in  But that’s terribly complicated, more by politics, property rights,   infrastructure, and those kinds of issues than by anything inherent in this imbalance problem       The essential monetary policy contribution, it seems to me, is to keep   US inflation low and US output as close to potential at a sustainable rate as possible  This is   what you would do in any event     But as a footnote to the 1980s, that was a time when the rest of the   world was growing; it enjoyed a much better macroeconomic performance  Japan was growing   September 21, 2004 32 of 100          strongly  Europe was doing better  The domestic demand contributed from outside the United   States was healthier at that point      Yes       That is the case in our model  However, I’ve been, if anything, a bit   skeptical about that  But when you reduce any component—exogenous government spending,   exogenous investment, a change in the saving rate—you create an opening in the demand–supply   balance that is then going to be filled by something, and you want it filled by exports That   would be the pro-adjustment response    Our model suggests that, as monetary policy eases in response to flagging demand, we’re   more likely to get interest-sensitive components of US domestic demand stepping in than to   induce a change in the exchange rate and get higher exports  But that is all conditional on two   things, one of which is how interest-sensitive that demand is  And if the interest-sensitivity isn’t   as high as we have it in the model or if those components suffer some of the residual problems of   the sort they have suffered lately because of confidence or whatever, maybe US interest-  September 21, 2004 35 of 100          sensitive demand won’t come rushing in  That’s one possibility  The other is that, as far as the   model is concerned, that relationship depends on the model’s ability to tell us what the exchange   rate is going to do because the induced effect on the exchange rate is how that adjustment works    I always start and stop these conversations by saying that we don’t have a good model of the   exchange rate and that’s why we make all our statements conditional  In order to close   models—most models, including ours—we use uncovered interest parity because the model has   to have an exchange rate equation  There has to be something that does that, and that’s what   economic theory says to put in there, so that’s what we put in  But uncovered interest parity has   never succeeded empirically, ever  So that conclusion rests on these two properties  that we   don’t really know what the exchange rate response would be and that we don’t know if our   interest sensitivity is as high as the model says it is     I could tell stories in which that flexibility would all work in the right   direction, but I could imagine at least some factors that could go the other way, in the sense that   every time the world seems to be going through a period of uncertainty and unsettledness—and a   pronounced external adjustment might be such a period—there’s a tendency to see capital flow   into the United States, not out of it  And that would counteract the desired adjustment     But I would just reiterate what Governor Gramlich said a minute ago    If all that happens is that we decide that we’re going to use monetary policy to limit US   domestic demand, that by itself is not going to be sufficient to produce a good result   "
7421,2004-11-10,"  Well, as I will repeat in just a minute, I’m afraid, emerging Asia actually   is faring comparatively less well than the other regions of the world at the moment on two scores    higher oil prices and a perception that at least for a time there’s a bit of a pause in the strength of the   high-tech sector  And these countries see themselves vulnerable to the fact that they import more   primary products than anybody else in some sense  Few of them have primary product resources   November 10, 2004 13 of 107    domestically  So the inflation consequences of developments over the last few months have   loomed larger for them than for others, and I think in that sense they are reassessing how   unfortunate an exchange rate appreciation would be for them  At the same time, their real   performance is impaired as well, so there’s sort of a juggling act involved, as with any negative   supply shock  But I think seeing that they are more vulnerable than most has altered a bit the   calculus of how important it is to stabilize the exchange rate vis-à-vis each other and vis-à-vis the   renminbi  And they probably are more vulnerable than China, if that’s the elephant in the room,   because China is a much larger and much more closed economy and it is domestically able to deal   with some of these issues better than the smaller satellite emerging Asian countries are     Over the intermeeting period, news about foreign economic  developments has generally been somewhat disappointing, and we have edged down  our outlook for real GDP growth abroad in response  The downward revision is  largest for the third quarter, 04 percentage point, as growth appears to have been  below our expectations in Japan, Europe, and emerging Asia other than China, where  we were surprised on the upside as we were also to a slight extent in Latin America   For the current quarter and the rest of the forecast period, we have taken an average  01 percentage point off the annual rate of foreign growth     A major factor behind our decision to shave a bit off prospective growth abroad   has been the intermeeting behavior of oil prices  Although the sharp run-up in spot  WTI prices attracted much attention, that price significantly retraced its gains in the  final two weeks of the period  However, the far futures price for WTI rose on balance  $5 per barrel over the period  Accordingly, the entire path of oil futures prices shifted  up  To some extent, the elevated WTI prices reflect the premium now being paid for  sweet (less sulfurous) crude oil relative to other grades of oil, and we anticipate that  this premium will narrow over time as the supply of sweet oil from the Gulf of  Mexico is fully restored, refiners shift their capacity, and demand adjusts  However,  consistent with the futures markets, we now project that oil prices will be higher for  longer than we thought in September, as continued production at current high rates  seems less certain and as demand remains strong     For the industrial countries, small negative revisions to the outlook were   widespread as elevated oil prices have eroded confidence to some extent and  weakened domestic demand  In Canada, an oil exporter, growth has remained strong  although we marked down the forecast a bit in response to changes in the US  forecast  For emerging-market economies in Asia, the prospect of sustained, elevated  oil prices has more negative consequences than is the case for Latin American  countries  The Asian emerging-market economies generally import oil and other  primary commodities  Higher global prices for these goods plus a somewhat dimmer  outlook for the high-tech sector have led us to become less optimistic about these  countries, on average  In contrast, activity so far in 2004 has been strong in Latin  America, as primary product exports and energy self-sufficiency—or better—have  boosted growth We nonetheless revised our outlook down slightly in 2005         We expect that foreign economic activity is rebounding in the current quarter   from the slowing that was evident in the preceding three months, particularly in  Japan, the United Kingdom, and emerging Asia  But we look for average growth  abroad to weaken a bit over the next two years  In part, this projection reflects the  need for some of the rapidly growing foreign economies, such as Canada and the  United Kingdom, to bring growth in line with potential  Monetary policy has already  been tightened in both these countries, and we expect additional moves in Canada  In  addition, we look for growth in China to moderate as officials there use both  administrative and interest rate tools to slow credit creation and the expansion of  investment spending, in particular      The subdued outlook for growth abroad also reflects the depreciation of the dollar   that occurred over the intermeeting period and the further depreciation that we have   November 10, 2004 19 of 107    again incorporated into the forecast  Since September, the exchange value of the  dollar has fallen sharply against many of the other major currencies  In response, we  have lowered the projected path for the real value of the broad index of the dollar  about 2 percent  Currency appreciation should be a factor restraining growth over the  forecast period in the other industrial countries     In our Greenbook baseline, the combined effect of higher oil prices, the lower   dollar, and revisions to output growth here and abroad is a slight easing in the  projected drag from real net exports in this quarter and during the next two years   This quarter and for the first half of 2005 we see the external sector as having a  largely neutral effect on GDP growth, as imports are restrained by moderate US  growth and exports bounce back  Thereafter, the negative arithmetic contribution of  net exports is about ½ percentage point, as relatively strong US growth boosts real  imports while dollar depreciation works to lessen the gap between real exports and  real imports  Nevertheless, the nominal US current account deficit is expected to  widen to nearly $890 billion in the fourth quarter of 2006, about 6¾ percent of GDP   This deficit reflects a higher oil import bill throughout the forecast period than  previously projected, with the overall trade deficit widening about $60 billion at an  annual rate from the current quarter to the end of 2006  In addition, the deficit on net  investment income is projected to widen by a comparable amount as rising US  interest rates and the growing stock of US portfolio liabilities combine to overwhelm  a modest increase in net receipts from direct investments here and abroad       This morning, we received data on trade in September  The trade deficit, at   $516 billion, was noticeably narrower than we and the market had anticipated   Contrary to our expectations for a rise, merchandise imports edged down, with most  of the surprise concentrated in core goods  In contrast, exports came in stronger than  expected, again with most of the miss in core goods  Of note, the surprising weakness  in exports in August was revised into a respectable gain  On balance, this morning=s  data indicate that real net exports made a negative contribution to US GDP growth  of 03 percentage point in the third quarter, considerably smaller than the minus  07 percentage point in the November Greenbook  This revision is pretty evenly split  between higher exports and lower imports  Although it is a bit early to draw  implications of these data for the current quarter, we remain fairly comfortable with  our Greenbook projection  Dave and I would be happy to answer any questions           I guess we’re learning as we go along the consequences of having global   demand push on resource limitations the way it has been  And we are making adjustments of a   tenth here and a tenth there  So, it’s not as if analytically my demand curves are well enough   defined that I can even tell the difference between moving along a curve versus the curve shifting at   this point  I think down deep that strong demand is the central factor in explaining why oil prices in   particular, but commodity prices more broadly, have been high  There is a self-limiting nature to   the price-adjustment process that occurs, but it’s hard to say that those higher prices are then a cause   for weaker growth  It is just a matter of both growth and prices being resolved in the marketplace   But I think that recent events, particularly the events in the past intermeeting period, have   conveyed an awareness that the supply conditions that this higher demand is confronting are a bit   less robust and a little less certain than people previously thought  In the energy case, this mix   between sweet and sour oil suddenly seemed more important  Whereas we often talked—I myself   did—about total production versus total consumption and questioned where the missing barrels   were and so forth, now we need to think about the possibility that the important issue may not be   just total production but the composition of production and the composition of refinery capacity    So it may be that the elements of demand in the different economies are going to determine how   this works out  We’ve learned, for example, that hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico have a much   greater potential to disrupt supplies than we understood to have been the case   So I think this extra   uncertainty and the somewhat greater volatility and risk on the supply side are leading me in an   expected-value sense to say that the outcome of these demand pressures and what I know about   supply may involve a little less growth than I had previously thought     I’m afraid you’ve caught me without an answer  I’m not sure what the   elements of that are     Sure  "
7446,2004-12-14,"  At this time of year, when persons old and young are looking   for tangible evidence of whether they have been naughty or nice during the past   December 14, 2004 13 of 118           twelve months, I cannot resist taking joy in pointing out that some force, perhaps  from the North Pole, has given the forecasters in the International Division the  opportunity to say something that we have been waiting to say for a long time “As  we forecast in the previous Greenbook, global oil prices have fallen on balance over  the intermeeting period”  [Laughter]  Indeed, they have fallen a bit more than we  forecast, with the result that our forecast path for US oil import prices has shifted  down about $3 per barrel in 2005 and $2 per barrel in 2006  One consequence of  recent developments is that the futures curve for WTI prices and our projected path  for the average price of imported oil are flatter than they have been in the past several  months, with only a relatively small further net change expected in oil prices from  now through the end of 2006  At the same time, uncertainty about future oil prices  seems to be quite high  The expected prices for WTI for the January contract and the  June contract for next year are both around $41  But the probability distribution  around the mean price for June is very wide, with the ⅔ probability interval ranging  from $32 per barrel to $50 per barrel     With the projected path for oil prices fairly flat, the implications of global oil   prices for growth and inflation abroad consist mainly of the future effects of oil price  developments that have already occurred  Despite their recent declines, oil prices  remain elevated from their levels one year ago  We judge that the slowing of activity  in several foreign economies in the third quarter is due at least in part to the net  increase in oil prices this year  The negative effects on output growth were relatively  greater for the Asian emerging-market economies, which tend to be more dependent  on imported oil than other regions, although these economies have also felt the  slowdown in the global high-tech sector  Over time, we expect the transitory  influence of the spike in oil prices to dissipate and average real GDP growth abroad  to return to an annual rate of about 3¼ percent  For the industrial countries and the  emerging-market economies, headline inflation will be up a bit in the near term and  then subsequently edge back down, reflecting the path of oil prices     During most of the intermeeting period, the dollar continued the downward trend   that had resumed in mid-September, with the index of major currencies reaching a  point early last week that was 12 percent below its May peak and a nine-year low   Market participants pointed to heightened concerns about the financing burden of the  widening US trade deficit as a major factor driving the dollar’s slide  At the time  that we were putting the finishing touches on the December baseline forecast, recent  exchange rate moves indicated that we should lower the path for the real value of the  broad index of the dollar about 3 percent  However, subsequently the dollar has  significantly reversed its intermeeting move in a sharp appreciation  No particular  data release or event seems to have triggered the climb of the dollar  Market  participants point to incentives for traders to take profits and to eliminate previously  established short dollar positions ahead of the year-end     Our baseline December forecast incorporates the lower path projected for the   dollar directly in US trade prices and volumes and, as a consequence, in the outlook  for domestic activity and inflation in a complex way  Of course, daily fluctuations in   December 14, 2004 14 of 118           the dollar cannot be anticipated and could easily put us back at the December  Greenbook starting level  However, had we not revised the path for the dollar and so  left it unchanged from that in the November Greenbook, our trade equations suggest  that the partial effect of this change alone would have been to increase the negative  contribution of net exports to US real GDP growth about 015 percentage point in  2005 and 01in 2006 relative to what is currently in the December Greenbook  With  such a higher path for the dollar, import price inflation in the baseline would have  been noticeably lower in the near term but little changed in 2006  By the fourth  quarter of 2006, the partial effect of a higher dollar path would be to widen the  projected current account deficit about $35 billion       In addition to the moves in oil prices and the exchange value of the dollar, the   other major feature of the international forecast at this time is that we have again  revised down projected foreign growth, particularly in the near term  As mentioned  earlier, to some degree this reflects the consequences of elevated oil prices  But it  also reflects more-fundamental shortfalls in macroeconomic performance in some  regions—for example the euro area, where we have lowered our forecast for real  GDP growth throughout the forecast period  Persistent weakness in domestic demand  in the euro area is a vulnerability that restrains global recovery and undercuts the  adjustment of US external deficits       Weak domestic spending in the euro area is associated primarily with Germany    One factor that is thought to be at least partly responsible is the extensive discussion  of and, at least some progress on, implementation of structural reforms in the  participating countries  For example, German pension reform appears to be creating  incentives for higher savings on the part of households, as the prospects of less- generous pensions or the uncertainty about how the reformed system will function  increase the perceived need for private assets  Given the very large unfunded public  liabilities associated with social insurance systems in Europe, successful reform and  higher personal savings would be helpful  However, for those savings to be realized  in higher capital stocks and improved German output growth, private investment  spending must also be stimulated  Such a response might require some reduction in  interest rates, led by easing on the part of the ECB, in order to maintain utilization of  macroeconomic resources during the implementation of reforms  Action on the part  of the ECB is made less likely, however, by the continued recording of headline  inflation above the target ceiling of 2 percent  Euro-area inflation is “stuck” at  2 percent in part because governments, particularly the German government, are  turning to increases in administered prices as they seek higher revenue to keep overall  budget deficits from rising even further  On balance, our outlook for the euro area  during the forecast period is slow growth, at about 1¾ percent, as the long-run  positive benefits of the structural reform efforts are either yet to arrive or are  overwhelmed by negative, short-run consequences     We have also revised down our projection for near-term growth in Japan    Recently released GDP data and current indicators paint a picture of real GDP  expansion in Japan that is not as strong as we and the markets had expected  Growth   December 14, 2004 15 of 118           should rebound from less than ½ percent at an annual rate in the second half of this  year to only about 1½ percent annual rate during 2005     This morning, trade data for October were released  The trade deficit came in at   $555 billion, up $45 billion from September and noticeably larger than both we and  the markets had anticipated  The increase in the deficit primarily reflected a surge in  merchandise imports; exports increased only modestly  These data will no doubt lead  us to revise down our projection for real net exports in the current quarter, although  we obviously have not had time to digest fully the implications for the outlook  A  rough, back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that the contribution of real net  exports to US GDP growth could be revised down enough to bring the negative  contribution in the current quarter to around ½ percentage point  This number should  be taken with a grain of salt, however, as we are reluctant to rely too heavily on one  month’s worth of volatile data  That concludes our presentation  Dave and I will be  happy to answer your questions    "
7472,2005-02-01," Your first international chart reviews financial  developments for the major foreign industrial countries  After appreciating early last  year, the nominal exchange value of the dollar in terms of the other major foreign  currencies (the black line in the top left box) changed little through September  It  subsequently declined broadly, as can be seen by the red yen–dollar and blue euro–  dollar lines So far this year, the nominal dollar index has rebounded about 1½  percent from its December low  It is now approximately 27 percent below its peak in  early 2002   As can be seen in the panel to the right, euro and yen three-month market  interest rates have remained about flat for over a year as dollar rates have moved up  with your moves to raise the federal funds rate  The ECB has left its official repo  rate at 2 percent since mid-2003, and the Bank of Japan is continuing its policy of  quantitative easing The middle panels show market expectations of policy moves  by those two central banks on three dates currently and at the time of the two most  recent chart shows Three-month euro futures rates, on the left, have shifted down  since June, as expected tightening has been pushed off into the future Markets now  appear to expect some upward move by the ECB around midyear  Similarly, as seen  to the right, markets have pushed off expected increases in rates on the part of the  Bank of Japan into 2006   In all three countries, 10-year sovereign interest rates, shown in the bottom  left panel, moved up during the first half of 2004 and then retraced  Whereas US  rates (the black line) moved up over the fourth quarter of last year, German rates (the  blue line) continued to drop and are now below their levels at the start of 2004  Japanese ten-year rates (in red) have returned to about the level of one year ago The  retracing in long-term rates and the shift down in policy expectations reflect the  slowing of economic growth abroad in the second half of last year, to which I shall  return in a moment  Nevertheless, broad stock price indexes, shown to the right,  resumed their upward trend over the second half of last year, after giving back some  earlier gains Although the Japanese Topix has not regained its mid-2004 level, both  it and the DJ Euro Stoxx are noticeably above their levels at the start of last year                      February 1-2, 2005 75 of 177  The table in the top half of your next chart provides an overview of our  forecast for real GDP growth abroad After expanding at an average annual rate of  more than 4 percent during the first half of 2004, total foreign real output (line 1 in  the table) decelerated to just under 3 percent during the second half Although both  the timing of and the factors behind the “soft patches” experienced abroad differ  across countries, we expect that going forward the pace of activity will generally  firm across the industrial countries (lines 2 through 6) and will converge to steady  growth across the emerging economies (lines 7 through 11) as the restraining forces  dissipate By the second half of this year, we project that average foreign growth  will return to an annual rate of about 3¼ percent and remain near that rate over the  remainder of the forecast period   Among the industrial countries, the “soft patch” was far more evident in  Japan (line 3) and the euro area (line 4) than it was in the United Kingdom (line 5) or  Canada (line 6) The latter two countries have sustained moderate to strong growth  in real GDP with vigorous domestic demand over the past several years  In contrast,  Japan is struggling to sustain an expansion that had been promising to end over 10  years of subpar economic activity  The euro area has been expanding at subdued  rates, with high unemployment  As shown in the bottom panels, business and  consumer confidence in both Japan and the euro area improved sharply from  previous lows in 2003 through the first half of 2004 Little or no further  improvement was recorded during the second half of last year, however, raising  concerns about the robustness of internal demand in these economies during this year  and next As can be seen in the right panel, through mid-2004 Japanese exports  expanded strongly, supporting output growth, and, to a lesser extent, euro-area  exports did the same  A pickup in the pace of global expansion should halt the  downturn in Japanese exports and contribute to renewed export growth in these  economies, but at rates below those experienced in late 2003 and early 2004   Your next chart reviews developments in the emerging-market economies   As can be seen in the upper left panel, one feature of markets over the most recent  months is the very low level to which spreads on emerging-market securities have  fallen Such favorable financing terms have not been observed since before the  financial crises of the late 1990s Nonetheless, issuance of new debt during the last  half of 2004 has been subdued in Asia and in Latin America  As seen to the right,  stock prices in Korea, Singapore, and Brazil trended up over most of 2004, although  Brazil’s Bovespa has recently retraced some of those gains  The middle panels  report on production (on the left) and exports (to the right) in China, Korea, and  Thailand Chinese industrial production expanded strongly during 2004 and  remained brisk in the most recent months  In contrast, production has moved  sideways in Thailand and Korea for much of the past four quarters, following a  significant move up in the preceding half year  Chinese exports rose sharply on  balance during 2004 After roughly leveling off from June through September,  Chinese exports spurted in October and November; the December level was more  than 10 percent above that for September  The sustained trend growth in Chinese                          February 1-2, 2005 76 of 177  exports has led to China becoming a more important trading partner for a range of  countries For example, over the past several years, China has moved up to replace  the United States as the number one trading partner of Japan, Korea, and Singapore   The bottom panels indicate that production expanded strongly in 2004 in  both Brazil and Mexico, although a slowing in the second half of the year is clearly  evident for Brazil Despite sharp fluctuations, on balance, exports provided positive  stimulus to Brazilian output over the year, as they also did in Mexico, although to a  lesser extent   The nominal US trade deficit, reported in the upper left panel of your next  chart, has moved further into deficit since the last chart show  Compared with the  third quarter, the most recent data for October and November report a substantial  increase in imports (line 2) and essentially no change in exports (line 8)  About half  of the increase in nominal imports reflects the higher oil import bill (line 6), which in  turn was boosted by the elevated level of oil prices The remaining half of the  increase is accounted for largely by consumer goods (line 3), with several other  categories showing small positive changes  The weakness in exports, which  surprised us and the markets, is not explained by a large drop in any particular  category and would still be apparent even after accounting for errors made by  Canadian statistical officials in measuring their imports for November—a correction  to the data that we cannot yet make     The breakdown of US exports by destination is illustrated by the panels to  the right During 2004, exports to Canada and western Europe expanded strongly;  the most recent observation for Canada likely will be revised up about $4 billion  when corrected data are released Export weakness is evident in the downturn in  exports to the group of countries labeled “Other Asia,” ie, our Asian trading  partners other than Japan, China, and Hong Kong US exports to those three  economies were flat for most of last year   Oil prices, shown in the lower left, reached remarkable highs in 2004 and  have been very volatile since midyear  After the December meeting, I must admit,  those prices moved back up, not down  We still see the strength in overall global  economic activity, and thus demand for crude oil, as a significant factor in supporting  oil prices at current levels Moreover, some supply developments, including OPEC  decisions and violence in Iraq, continue to influence prices In line with the futures  markets, we project that prices for global crude oil will decline through next year,  although we expect that the spread between the spot price for WTI [West Texas  intermediate oil] and the US import price will narrow somewhat     Shown in the panel on the right are our outlooks for core import prices (the  black line) and the factors underlying their change (the bars) Core import prices  were pushed up during 2004 by rising global commodity prices, as reflected in the  blue portions of the bars The red portions of the bars show the contribution of                          February 1-2, 2005 77 of 177  foreign prices expressed in dollars That contribution fluctuates with the exchange  value of the dollar, which declined at times, particularly in the fourth quarter of last  year, but which also rose at times, such as in the second quarter of last year  Starting  next quarter, we see the upward pressure from both of these factors as diminishing  greatly, with the result that core import inflation is projected to be low over most of  this year and during next year Our outlook for the contribution of global commodity  prices reflects the predictions in current market futures curves  The low and steady  contribution of foreign prices when expressed in dollars results from our projections  of stable and low inflation abroad on average and of little change going forward in  the exchange value of the dollar In addition, expiration of the multifiber agreement  [World Trade Organization Agreement on Textiles and Clothing] should lower  import prices   The consequences of our outlooks for foreign growth and prices for US real  exports and imports are presented on your final international chart  Real export  growth (line 1 in the top left panel) is boosted this year by some bounceback from  the weak fourth quarter last year The acceleration in core exports (line 4) reflects  our assumption that some of the recent export weakness will be “paid back” in early  2005 as well as the continuing stimulative effects of recent dollar depreciation  The  somewhat stronger export growth forecast for both this year and next also depends  upon the projected return to steady, moderate growth abroad     In contrast, real imports of goods and services (top right panel) are projected  to decelerate this year; growth of imported core goods (line 4) should slow nearly 2  percentage points, in part the result of the expiration of the partial-expensing tax  provision, which had created an incentive to import capital goods in 2004  Past  dollar depreciation lessens growth of core import volume as well  Real import  growth should rebound somewhat in 2006, as growth of core imports responds to the  subdued pace of projected inflation in import prices   The bars in the middle left panel translate export and import growth into  contributions to US GDP growth The positive contribution from exports is  expected to outweigh temporarily the negative one from imports during the first half  of this year Thereafter, on balance, imports will subtract about one-third percentage  point more from GDP growth than is contributed by export growth   The US nominal trade and current account balances are shown to the right   Despite the sizable decline in the dollar since its peak in early 2002, the US nominal  trade deficit widened by slightly more than $300 billion from the first quarter of 2002  through the fourth quarter of last year, as deficit-enhancing factors more than offset  the beneficial effects of dollar depreciation To be sure, had the dollar not  depreciated, the deficit would have widened even more  In the Greenbook baseline  forecast, we project very limited further dollar depreciation and an additional $30  billion increase in the trade deficit through the fourth quarter of 2006 Unfortunately,  I have to report that, by the standard of a reduced trade deficit, US external                                    February 1-2, 2005 78 of 177  adjustment will not even have started by the end of the forecast period if the  Greenbook forecast is realized In 2005 and 2006 the projected current account  deficit widens significantly more than does the trade balance as net investment  income deteriorates   We asked our global econometric model what average rate of dollar  depreciation would be required during the Greenbook projection period for the trade  deficit in the fourth quarter of 2006 to be about unchanged from that estimated for  the fourth quarter of last year The dollar path needed to produce that outcome,  shown in red in the bottom left panel, is one that declines at an average annual rate of  10 percent   The panel to the right reports consequences of the weaker dollar path for the  trade balance and the current account balance By construction, in the alternative of  a weaker dollar, the change in the trade balance over the forecast period is about  zero However, the current account balance nonetheless continues to deteriorate In  fact, the weaker dollar improves the current account deficit by less than the  improvement in the trade balance, primarily because higher interest rates, which the  model generates as it uses a Taylor rule to guide monetary policy, result in even  greater declines in net investment income  This simulation suggests that even were  the dollar to depreciate quite sharply, it is likely that over the forecast period the  trade deficit would remain near its current size and the current account deficit would  widen further Sandy will now conclude our presentation    I do Do you want me to give you some figures?    We have several tables that cover all of the countries we forecast and then   we have the global—                              February 1-2, 2005 79 of 177   No, no You might think of our Greenbook forecast for the dollar as a   technical assumption  We have adopted a “random walk” frame of mind when it comes to   forecasting the dollar, based on two things First of all, the research that we ourselves have done in   the articles that members of the Board staff have written shows that a random walk assumption   outperforms any structural model over long periods of time  Moreover, the profession has engaged   for years in trying to forecast the dollar And the random walk—that is, no change from today—in a   statistical sense outperforms on average any of the alternatives that have been suggested   One possibility, an alternative assumption, might be to go with the implied futures rates that   come out of trading  But those rates have been shown to be particularly bad forecasters  So there’s   no real empirical support for making that alternative choice   We used to attempt to infer the consequences of what we knew—the “maintained”   assumption of the federal funds rate, so to speak  That was based on the view that we knew   something about the future course of policy that the market didn’t know; that is, we were   conditioning the forecast on something that the market didn’t necessarily know, and we thought we   would sense other forces, if you will, at work So we had a somewhat more activist forecast for   many years until we were wrong for such a long time that we gave up, basically   It troubles me in some sense that our forecast suggests that import inflation will drop from   being a fairly significant number to virtually nothing—tomorrow—and will continue that way   throughout the forecast period That result is very much affected by this maintained assumption that                                 February 1-2, 2005 80 of 177  the dollar isn’t going to change much more  So my explanation is simply that we try to make that   assumption very explicit to you  You understand that we have not taken a position on changes in the   value of the dollar, which very much determines our import price forecast  And we let it go at that   We do not take a position on the dollar because our actual ability to tell you when the dollar is going   to go up and when it is going to go down is just nonexistent    Yes But I would say that over any short time horizon, like the next two   years, there’s as much upside risk as downside risk  The dollar rose substantially in the first half of   2004; it rose in the early part of this year Even though many of us have argued at great length that   there are reasons to think that over time the dollar has to go down, for any period you care to   name—for a year or even as long as two or three years—it could well go up before it goes down    We haven’t taken the step of, say, putting that into an alternative   simulation in the Greenbook, which maybe we should do  But we have been thinking about the   issue and what alternatives might be good—that is, effective and productive—and what alternatives   might be counterproductive  There was a time about three weeks ago when the amount of chatter   about the Chinese regime was very elevated  And there were some remarks that came out of the   meetings in Davos, just five days ago, that made it seem as if something was imminent  And then   the talk would subside and it would go quiet   Do I think that nothing is going to happen in this regard between now and the end of 2006?   Personally, my answer would be “No, I don’t”  I think something will happen before that  But we                                 February 1-2, 2005 81 of 177  would have a very hard time specifying exactly what will be done or when and putting it in the   baseline forecast    I could make it bigger than a bread box, depending on whether the rest of   Asia reacts in some explicit manner  I say that because the pegging to the dollar is a device for   stabilizing exchange rates among the Asian trading partners  So if China moves in certain ways, that   might trigger a reaction on the part of its trading partners  But I could imagine some steps that China   might take that wouldn’t do that    Now, I think we can, and probably should, take a chance and commit to writing what we   think those relationships are and what the implications might be  If all of the Asian currencies move,   I think you would see some consequences  If China revalues by 5 percent and pegs again and   nobody else does anything, I think it will be almost inconsequential  It will be politically helpful to a   variety of people, but economically I don’t believe it will mean a lot  If China not only moves but   also floats—if it defines a band in which the currency will fluctuate or goes to a weighted average   or, in other words, introduces the potential of movement going forward—and that triggers a   comparable decision on the part of other Asian countries, it’s a different story  If the currencies of   Asian countries that now in one way or another stabilize their exchange rates with China’s become   more flexible vis-à-vis their bilateral rate with the dollar, I think the implications could be greater    I guess I will commit to trying to do some sort of analysis of this issue or   an alternative simulation in the next Greenbook  I think that would be a helpful thing to do    I don’t know that I would link it to that particularly I think it is in part,   but I can’t tell you how much, a result of the integration of trade—or reintegration of trade—that’s   going on in Asia, so that exports that previously came to us from Japan now pass through China for   some final stage of processing  There’s a sense in which the gains that China is making are coming   at the expense of other Asian trading partners and are not of much significance  On the other hand,   if the China and Hong Kong line had gone up at the same time that this “Other Asia” line went   down, I think I would have had to say that I shouldn’t show them separately but should add them   together or something  But it did not   I’d point more to the high-tech sector as a factor  In terms of the risks to this global forecast,   we have oil prices, our basic standard risk But the issue of whether the high-tech sector is going   through a temporary inventory lull and is going to rebound or not is the biggest question mark for   the Asian emerging-market countries  I think that accounts for the falloff in trade at the end of last   year—that is, the falloff in exports more broadly and in IP [industrial production]  I think that’s all   wrapped up in the high-tech question    Yes, we did that in our global model  And those countries—given that   prices in their currency for the goods they sell to the United States go up because the dollar is   depreciating—actually earn some income, which is then spent on US exports  So in that sense it   accounts for all the money that is spent on trade  It goes somewhere; it feeds back to the model    Yes, that’s what I’m saying    Yes Now, the model has the usual Houthakker and Magee asymmetry in   it, but the move down of the dollar is very stimulative  In our model it would be a very stimulative   shock to the United States, and it would be a contractionary shock to almost all of our trading   partners    Right, but because of the interest rate effect  Now, it’s possible that the   model doesn’t fully capture valuation effects  In the direct investment account, the fact that the   dollar is depreciating means that every euro earned by a US subsidiary is now worth more dollars   rather than the same number of dollars  So this current account effect may be too conservative  It’s   possible that the current account would improve more via that valuation effect than the model is   fully able to capture    Well, our people do their best, but the financial flow part of the model is   less fully articulated than is the real side of the model    Yes It’s just a question of how many equations—or how many   independent variables—you can actually manage  "
7497,2005-03-22," One of the most important changes made to the forecast in this  Greenbook relative to that of January is the increase in the projected path for oil  prices That increase reflects developments in global oil markets over the  intermeeting period  Since late last week, spot WTI oil prices have been at new  highs, over $56 per barrel, a bit above the peak price reached last October But there  are some significant differences between market conditions then and current ones   Last October, the spike in rates was particularly sharp for the light, sweet crudes such  as WTI and was, in part, a transitory response to the impact of hurricane Ivan on  supply in the Gulf of Mexico This time the rise in prices is more general  The price  of Dubai, a heavier, more sour crude, has risen nearly $10 per barrel above its level  last October, resulting in a spread between the price for WTI and Dubai of about $9  per barrel rather than the $17 recorded last October 25 In addition, the far futures  price is now more than $49 per barrel, over $10 per barrel higher than in October,  suggesting that markets expect prices to be elevated for some time                                       March 22, 2005 14 of 116  No one factor explains the run-up in prices since late January, but a major reason  seems to be stronger demand in global markets—currently and prospectively, in the  eyes of market participants  This stronger demand is arising from a global economy  in which continued expansion at a reasonably robust pace seems likely, albeit with  some variation across regions  Also, there are currently some supply risks in the  usual trouble spots among oil-producing countries  But over the longer run, the issue  seems to be how projected increases in demand will be met by increased supply  Of  the 27 million barrels per day that global consumption increased during 2004, 30  percent, or 850,000 barrels per day, was accounted for by increased consumption in  China China is now the second-largest oil consumer on the globe; the United States  is first   The staff continues to rely on futures markets for our projection of the spot WTI  price After the first couple of months, the futures curve slopes down and is the basis  of our forecast that, by the end of 2006, that price will be somewhat below today=s  price However, we also need to forecast the US oil import price, and for us the  challenge is to project the spread going forward between WTI and the import price   That spread was quite variable last year, and in January of this year it jumped up  again, to over $9 per barrel We currently expect that the spread will narrow, on  balance, over the forecast period, with the result that the US price for imported oil  will decline only slightly from current levels—noticeably less than the decrease  embedded in the futures curve for WTI—by the end of next year  However, we could  be surprised, and the behavior of that spread is one of the risks to the forecast   The general increase in global oil prices has been cited by many as a reason for  rising inflation expectations and the move up in long-term interest rates across the  major industrial countries during the intermeeting period  Ten-year sovereign rates in  the major foreign industrial countries generally rose about 20 basis points since your  last meeting, somewhat less than the increase in the US rate  The smaller rebound in  rates abroad is consistent with the perception that recent economic indicators suggest  a more vigorous pace of expansion in the US economy than in the other industrial  economies  And foreign rates declined more sharply than did US rates from the end  of last June, when you began your current tightening cycle, to the turning point for  rates in early February   However, it may be that the stronger price performance of bonds denominated in  the major foreign currencies reflects some shift in portfolio preferences away from  dollar assets toward those denominated in the other major currencies  Such an  interpretation is consistent with the 1 percent net nominal depreciation of the foreign  exchange value of the dollar in terms of the other major currencies over the  intermeeting period and the fact that stock market indexes in the foreign industrial  countries generally outperformed US indexes over the same interval     Data for the US current account balance in the fourth quarter were released last  week and reported in the Greenbook supplement  At an annual rate, the deficit                                March 22, 2005 15 of 116  widened nearly $90 billion from the third-quarter figure, with about $60 billion of  that change accounted for by the increase in the trade deficit Of that $60 billion,  more than half represents the deterioration in the oil import bill  Relative to the  figures we put in the Greenbook, net investment income surprised us in the positive  direction That surprise was entirely in net direct investment receipts, as net portfolio  income came in about as expected, around $25 billion weaker than in the third  quarter Direct investment receipts were particularly strong, with the increase more  than offsetting a small positive surprise in direct investment payments  The fourth- quarter increment in the current account deficit was financed by somewhat larger  foreign official financial inflows and substantially larger foreign private net purchases  of US securities, particularly of agency bonds and corporate stocks The rise in  foreign inflows was sufficient to finance a small rise in US net private acquisitions  of foreign securities and an unusual but sizable increase from the third quarter of US  direct investment abroad   Looking forward, we expect the trade deficit to widen further both this year and  next With little change projected in the US oil import price, the oil import bill  should increase only slightly, and most of the deterioration in the trade balance is  expected to occur within the core goods categories—that is, goods less oil,  computers, and semiconductors  Accordingly, in real terms we are looking for net  exports to make a small negative contribution to GDP growth in each of the two  years We expect the widening of the nominal trade deficit to be nearly matched by  further reduction in the net investment income balance, as the negative change to net  portfolio income substantially outweighs projected gains in net direct investment  income  Accordingly, the current account deficit should widen to exceed $850  billion, or 6½ percent of GDP, by the end of next year   We also received February prices of internationally traded goods late last week   Prices for non-oil core imports increased a bit more than we were expecting   February price rises were concentrated in foods, feeds, and beverages and in non-oil  industrial supplies; but for January and February combined, all categories of non-oil,  core goods other than autos registered significant upward moves  These  developments leave us with a projection for inflation of the core import price deflator  in the first quarter of nearly 5 percent at an annual rate, higher than the January  Greenbook figure and higher than our equations by themselves would suggest  We  do not yet have sufficient evidence to conclude that the decline observed in past  exchange rate pass-through is being reversed With the effects of dollar depreciation  in the second half of last year and the recent run-up in commodity prices likely to be  felt through the end of this year, we expect core import price inflation to be about 2  percent at an annual rate during the rest of this year before slowing noticeably next  year, consistent with our outlook for flat commodity prices and only modest further  dollar depreciation   David and I will be happy to answer any questions                                         March 22, 2005 16 of 116   Well, the answer to your first question is that I don’t know the energy   demands of India  I don’t even think they are on my list  I have a table here listing oil   consumption by country, and I’m sure India is not on that list   But the fact that India is expanding mostly in its service-producing sector, rather than its   manufacturing sector, makes me think that that aspect of India’s growth is not driving energy   consumption particularly  But, as standards of living rise in India, presumably households and   the like will start consuming more   What I can say, though, is that we have recognized that India is suddenly getting to be   more important, and we have upped the staff coverage of India  We are going to put India more   explicitly into the forecast and will be covering that country in more detail    Well, I have not read it or thought about it in sufficient detail to truly   answer your question My sense is that, in part, it was a recognition of the inevitable That is, it   was a political solution to the fact that certain realities of life were confronting several European   countries So rather than continue with the political tension at meetings about who was going to                                      March 22, 2005 20 of 116  be penalized and allow the stresses between the larger countries and the smaller countries to   keep playing out in the media, they revised the agreement  They felt that if they changed the   language, they could accept what was going to happen in any event and reduce the damage it   might cause, because countries would be complying in some sense with the revised Stability and   Growth Pact rather than the old one   As for the actual details of the changes, they largely took the form of redefining what   goes into the measures against which targets are set and against which penalties are levied for   violating the targets To be honest, I don’t have the list complete in my head, but one change   had to do with German reunification  For example, certain expenditures get put in a different   category and are not part of the relevant measure of the budget deficit against which they are   supposed to meet the target    Other kinds of restructuring expenditures were included  So there was   an effort made to—    Yes, the pension reform    In addition to sort of recognizing the inevitable, such as the German   reunification piece, many of the other categories that were accorded new status I would describe   as things that everybody agreed should be done They agreed that it would be regrettable if, in   the name of the Stability and Growth Pact, political pressure were exerted to cut back on                             March 22, 2005 21 of 116  restructuring so as to meet the goal  Now, we all know the Stability and Growth Pact was   intended to tell these countries that they should cut other things so they could achieve the target,   but that wasn’t happening   The ECB [European Central Bank] made a guarded statement about remaining   concerned The markets didn’t seem to react negatively  Down deep the problem, in my mind,   is that the way the Stability and Growth Pact was originally structured—and possibly even the   way it is still structured—was appropriate for countries that had already re-centered their fiscal   activity more or less at a zero balance  The various ways that the limits were stated and the   symmetry, and so forth, all assumed each country started from a good place  And then it made   perfect sense Actually, if that had been the case, one would be indifferent to whether it should   be the structurally adjusted balance or the actual balance; that is irrelevant if you’re starting at   zero   Some of the big countries never got there, and that has been the part of the story that has   produced tension ever since 1999, really These reforms didn’t undo that  They didn’t say We   wrote a pact centered on zero and that isn’t working, so we’re going to scrap that and start all   over But they did make these exceptions, which are going to ease the pressures on some of the   big countries So, those countries will not be forced, in a macroeconomic sense, to tighten when   it’s not such a good idea; nor will pressure be put on them not to do some structural things that   they should be doing, because those specifically are the things that have been exempted    No                                         March 22, 2005 22 of 116   Right But by setting aside a class of expenditures that are going to   happen, they have allowed the band, as defined, to embrace the countries  So the fact that they   didn’t change the cyclical thing doesn’t matter so much anymore    That’s correct    Yes But it seems to me what is flawed is not so much the Stability and   Growth Pact as the Lisbon Agenda Despite the rhetoric, the major countries in Europe have not   taken steps to deregulate themselves, to become more efficient and more dynamic, and to do all   the things that they pledged to do in Lisbon Had they done those things, the old Stability and   Growth Pact would have probably been just fine   It’s not obvious to me that the changes they agreed to just recently are going to move us   very far in the direction of the Lisbon Agenda But these changes will at least eliminate the                                                  March 22, 2005 23 of 116  uncertainty that has been out there in the market about whether these countries will actually be   contracting fiscal policy at a time when unemployment is rising, and that kind of thing    Yes And, at some level, Schroeder’s initiatives have been appropriate   and the right thing to do But certainly there’s not a broad consensus among the European   population to go in that direction  "
7522,2005-05-03," The staff forecast for average real GDP growth abroad over the  forecast period has changed little from that in the March Greenbook despite swings  in global oil prices, nonfuel primary commodity prices, and exchange rates, plus a  significant near-term revision to the outlook for US growth  However, the only  minor revisions to our projection for average foreign growth mask significant  differences across countries and regions—differences that reflect the varying  influences of recent developments     In order to explore further these differences, I will highlight those developments  over the intermeeting period that were unexpected and offer our thoughts on their  implications for the outlook abroad and our forecast of the US external sector   Despite continued expansion of global activity, long-term sovereign interest rates in  the major foreign industrial countries have dropped significantly on balance since  the previous FOMC meeting  For example, the German 10-year rate moved down  from about 37 percent at the time of the March meeting to reach an all-time low of  338 percent on April 29 and has remained near that low so far this week  Rates in  Canada and the United Kingdom fell almost as much, and even Japanese rates  decreased nearly 20 basis points Although by themselves lower interest rates might  be expected to raise equity prices, the major stock price indexes abroad have fallen  over the period from 2 to 7 percent   These asset market developments reflect participants’ reactions to the most  recent data, which suggest that the foreign industrial countries have encountered  some additional headwinds that are impeding growth during the current quarter and  likely will do so over the remainder of 2005  Accordingly, we have shaded down  our near-term projections for the major foreign industrial countries  Although we  cannot be certain, we judge that elevated oil prices are taking a greater toll on these  economies than we anticipated earlier  Less favorable news for the US outlook is a  factor as well Both these developments are likely influencing confidence abroad                                              May 3, 2005 14 of 116  Euro-area economic sentiment fell in April to its lowest level in a year and a half   The Tankan survey in Japan dropped noticeably in the first quarter   In contrast, recent developments in the emerging-market economies, although  mixed, are positive on balance, and we have revised up slightly our outlook for  average growth there for this year This outcome reflects the fact that several of the  emerging-market economies export oil and/or other primary commodities whose  prices have remained high  It also reflects the unexpectedly strong first-quarter  growth that was recorded in China We now calculate that China=s GDP grew at a  14 percent annual rate last quarter, almost double our projection in March  Although  we expect some moderation in Chinese output growth over the remainder of this  year, its robust pace should support somewhat stronger expansion in the region than  we previously projected   Exchange market developments also contained some surprises  The dollar  appreciated broadly over the intermeeting period, particularly in terms of the  Canadian dollar and the euro Domestic political tensions appear to be weighing on  the Canadian dollar Although we continue to build into the Greenbook baseline  slight real dollar depreciation, the higher starting point for the current quarter leaves  us with a forecast path for the dollar that is above that in March throughout the  forecast horizon, a change that boosts imports and restrains exports   Particular focus on the Chinese exchange rate regime and the timing of any  modification to that regime emerged at the time of the G-7 meeting in mid-April and  again last week when market participants reacted quickly to a short-lived anomaly in  the renminbi/dollar rate  Since your March meeting, the amount of appreciation  priced into NDF [non-deliverable forward] contracts for Chinese renminbi has risen  at 1-month, 3-month, and 12-month horizons  US Treasury officials have made  public statements calling for Chinese officials to act soon, and the US Congress has  raised the possibility of action on its part if the Chinese do not move  The  heightened public debate appears to have raised the sensitivity of markets to any  indication that something might be happening  In the absence of any reliable  information on when and in what way the Chinese might alter the present regime, we  have not incorporated any such change into the forecast The extent to which other  Asian currencies will move against the dollar when the Chinese do act remains an  additional major uncertainty   Trade data for February were another major surprise for us during the  intermeeting period  Those data showed a second consecutive month of sizable  increases in imports  Part of this increase is accounted for by a jump in the value of  oil imports, but non-oil imports, particularly industrial supplies and consumer goods,  expanded rapidly as well First-quarter national income data reflected the strength  of nominal imports in January and February in double-digit growth of real imports of  goods and services We now estimate that real imports rose at an annual rate of  more than 13 percent in the first quarter, an upward revision of more than 4                                                   May 3, 2005 15 of 116  percentage points from the figure in the March Greenbook  We estimate that real   growth of core imports, non-oil imports other than computers and semiconductors,   was about 18 percent—far faster than historical relationships with US activity and   relative prices would suggest No component among real imports stands out, leaving   us with no special factors that would explain the rapid growth  This quarter, we   look for the pace of core import growth to moderate substantially to one more   consistent with historical determinants, particularly given the downward revision of   projected US real GDP growth to about 3½ percent In addition, on a seasonally   adjusted basis the volume of oil imports is projected to contract sharply    Accordingly, imports of goods and services are projected to grow only 1¼ percent   this quarter and then to expand at annual rates of 6 to 7 percent over the forecast   period    Putting these pieces together leaves us with a first-quarter negative arithmetic   contribution to US real GDP growth from net exports of about 1¼ percentage   points, about the same as in the fourth quarter  With import growth forecast to drop   sharply, the projected contribution swings positive for the current quarter  In the   second half of this year and during 2006, the contribution is small but negative      The near-term fluctuations in imports should be evident in the nominal trade   balance as well By the second half of this year and during 2006, we expect the   trade deficit to widen further Net investment income is also projected to deteriorate   Given current position figures, we see that balance as finally turning negative next   year Together these forecasts imply a current account deficit of more than $900   billion in the fourth quarter of 2006    Dave and I will be happy to answer any questions    Well, we have numbers written down for the pieces, but not ones that I   think are ready for exposure                                    May 3, 2005 16 of 116   A very big chunk of the Q2 story is oil and relates to the seasonal   adjustment procedure that is now in place for describing real oil, which we question  We think that   may not translate into real-time evidence of this sort, because it is, in some sense, a statistical   treatment of the data as opposed to an actual real-world event  Other than that, consumer goods   have been a big piece of the surprise in imports, so I don’t think they would immediately have   implications for US industrial production  There is nothing specific I can point to, and I admit—in   fact, it’s one of the reasons I highlighted this—that a change from double-digit growth to 1+ percent   growth this quarter is a huge drop But that is our best estimate    The people who construct these numbers write down notional placeholders   for the different components for the very, very near term, but I don’t think they would regard them   as grounded in a lot of information  They do that to see if the number they write down for the longer   term is a sensible number    We collect import prices at the border, so to speak  So I can’t speak to the   question of this showing through to retail prices David might want to comment on that; I don’t   know   Import price inflation has been surprising us a bit on the upside, and we have attributed part   of that to higher global commodities prices  It shows up in our case in the industrial supplies types   of categories, but we’ve seen some in the manufacturing area as well  When we break out the actual   data for how import prices have moved, we’re getting contributions from both those pieces into   import price inflation  So, relative to the last Greenbook, we have extended the period of elevated   import price increases into the second quarter and a little into the third quarter because the global   indexes of commodity prices—based on futures at this point for those periods—show the prices not   rising further but remaining high, and we think it will take some time for that to be fully reflected in   our import prices  But one factor that seemed to cause the timing to be off a little bit in our forecast                                       May 3, 2005 25 of 116  last year was that commodity prices tended to be showing up more rapidly in US import prices than   our models would suggest is the historical average  We have that as a second term, in addition to   foreign prices and the exchange rate and so forth   So embedded in our story is that import prices were high in the first quarter and will   decelerate somewhat in the second and third quarters, but not hugely and not as much as we had   thought before It involves a somewhat more extensive pass-through of high global commodity   prices into import prices, and a little bit is probably still the effect of dollar depreciation at the end of   2004 Those things, in essence, go away thereafter, and we have import price inflation dropping   down very much—to less than 1 percent in 2006  That is conditioned on two assumptions the   assumption we have been making routinely for the dollar of late—because we don’t know a better   one to make—which is that it will change only little going forward; and the futures path for   commodity prices  So the projection that import prices will decelerate in stepwise fashion through   the second half of this year and into 2006 is very much a reflection of these two conditioning   assumptions  And we don’t have a whole lot of information other than that  "
7547,2005-06-29," Well, I trust you did receive or are aware of the background document we   circulated on the foreign experience    We didn’t do price-rent ratios, and given what Josh has described in terms   of the care he has to put in before he feels he has something close to the right number, I think we   might feel a little hesitant to do so  I take it back; there are price-rent ratios—[laughter] in the back   portion of that paper  What data we have, we used  But there are huge variations in the financing   practices in housing markets across foreign countries  There is some degree of securitization but   less than here  Practices with respect to the tax-favored treatment of borrowing to finance houses   differ relative to those in the United States  There’s a host of different characteristics, in terms of   variable-rate, fixed-rate, and other types of instruments used in various foreign countries   But one of the things our paper was intended to point out was the prevalence of really rapid   rises in house prices  According to this chart—the first few pages of which are right here anyway—   that shows through to an increase in the price-rent ratios as well  So, I refer you back to this paper                                                        June 29-30, 2005 49 of 234  There is only a subset of the countries we covered for which we have price-rent charts, but there are   some in the paper    I guess I wouldn’t necessarily associate it with, say, the development of   the secondary market or the ease of equity extraction, and those sorts of things, but I’m not saying   they’re irrelevant  For example, in this chart, Switzerland—which is a country that I think of as   having made little progress in that regard—doesn’t have much of a price-rent ratio increase  And   the UK, which does have a more market-oriented approach, has a huge one   But it’s also true that that’s where the price differences have been  I think we’d be hard-  pressed to link too tightly the increased liquidity that we ascribe to US home equity as now having   taken on the role of the single driving factor anyway  It might be relevant, but I don’t know that it   distinguishes these countries    Well, for one thing, the UK’s 1990 cycle was amplified by regulatory   changes that preceded it, which led to mortgage lending that was excessive and not well supervised   It was a kind of blind-leading-the-blind situation The regulator changed the rules and the financial   institutions moved into the market and practices and norms changed  A great deal of lending took   place  The supervisors were learning as much as the lenders were and—well, let me put it this   way—it didn’t go well    In the past, there has certainly been a correspondence between household consumption and   housing wealth in the UK  So when they suffered the big drop in the 1990 rundown of housing   prices, they also had a big change in household consumption out of disposable income, and so forth,   and they had the makings of a recession as a result                                      June 29-30, 2005 67 of 234  Now, a couple of the characteristics of the UK market have always led us to think that it’s   not a telling example One is the prevalence of variable-rate mortgages, which causes the process of   tightening monetary policy to contain the macroeconomy to have a bit of extra leverage over the   discretionary income of households—to an extent that is not the case with fixed-rate mortgages   Obviously, there’s a counterpart effect on the earnings of mortgage lenders, and so forth, in the US   economy that you need to take account of to fully understand that  But there is that characteristic   And there is the fact that house prices actually fell in the UK, so they had big negative equity   problems, which complicated the process of how to unwind the interaction of household behavior   and financial intermediary behavior  To the extent people walked away from the houses, the   financial intermediaries were getting collateral that perhaps no longer equaled the value of the loan    On the other hand, some households didn’t walk away; they just remained in a negative equity   position for some time  And that had a long, dampening effect on their spending patterns  So there   were complex reactions involved     But this time around, at least based on my conversations with UK officials, they think   they’ve improved a lot of those things  So in that sense, there is something to be learned  Financial   institutions now know better how to maintain their balance sheets and how to do this lending  The   households know better, too; they’ve learned a bit  UK officials think they’ve seen a lessening to   some degree of this tight link between housing wealth and consumption so that they’re not both on   the run-up and then, when it stops, extrapolating what the consequences would be   On the other hand, I have to admit that I occasionally read my little machine while I sit here,   and in the last hour it carried three statements from a member of the Bank of England’s Monetary   Policy Committee who must have been making a speech  And all three statements the media chose   to pick up pertained to whether or not housing prices ought to be relevant for monetary policy                                        June 29-30, 2005 68 of 234  [Laughter] And all of the statements were slightly two-handed, along the lines of Monetary policy   should not be driven by housing prices, but we must look at them closely  [Laughter]   I think there are lessons to be learned; I’m not saying there aren’t  But certainly the 1990s   episode had some characteristics that were far more extreme and that would never happen here   because of institutional differences  And the present episode, which has remedied some of those   earlier problems, I think is not such a bad deal  They’ve slowed the increase in housing prices    They aren’t having negative equity  They don’t have financial institutions that look like they’re   going to become or technically are insolvent  I think in that sense they moved to improve their   infrastructure, so to speak  They talk about the issue a lot but I think they feel the situation is okay   at this time    I don’t think so  [Laughter]    The way we handle the oil price is really a technical assumption    I think it’s the dollar    Sticker shock, sticker shock, and more sticker shock    Absent a dollar depreciation that’s now probably on the order of 8, 9, or   10 percent, the deficit is going to steadily worsen  If the dollar were to start depreciating, that would   slow the rate of deterioration  If the dollar depreciation that we put into the forecast were to get as   high as 8 or 9 percent, that might plateau the deficit    To the extent that China’s electricity system is a source of demand, China   has a lot of coal reserves, whereas they have no petroleum reserves  So in principle they could   expand their electrical capacity—which is obviously a big part of the infrastructure effort that’s   going to be necessary for China to keep growing—by using coal   Most of the thoughts about the long-run picture in this regard relate to the uncertainties   imposed by environmental considerations—whether it’s refining capacity, expanded use of coal for   the generation of electricity, more use of LNG [liquefied natural gas] to spread the natural gas   resources of the world in ways more in tune with demand for natural gas, and so forth  All of these   things pose fairly substantial environmental hazards or have shortcomings, and they get tied up in   the politics of it Now, we’re fairly convinced that in the long run these elasticities are powerful    But the people who trade on these forward curves know at least as much as we do, and they   probably know a whole lot more than we do  So we’re implicitly saying that we think this is built   into that forward curve                                         June 29-30, 2005 102 of 234   One issue is the fact that some of these countries subsidize  That is, the   price run-up to date has been passed through only partially to consumer demand in many of the   emerging Asia countries  And as a consequence, some of these governments have had a big hit to   their budget deficits because of these subsidies   Now, if you think about 2004 versus 2005, the run-up in oil prices last year proved to be a   transitory phenomenon, and I think they believe that that policy worked well  They buffered their   populations a bit, and they didn’t take the political heat about higher oil prices  And they were   right; the oil price came down and all was well  They tried it again this year, and they are now   confronting these high futures prices that Mike was emphasizing  So some of them are now   relenting and are proposing to pass through into consumer prices, over some staggered path, the   price increases that we’ve seen  I would assume that will have a measurable effect    I can’t give you an actual number, but I’m sure in the longer run it’s   minus 1 or something like that People will say that in the short run it’s almost zero  I think even   that is an exaggeration  You can always turn down the heat, or whatever  But I think you’d get a   reasonable number like minus 1 if you looked over a five-year period    We know from past history that the oil intensity of GDP stepped down in   the period immediately following the oil price shock event, but it did not continue to improve   continuously That chart is very much like a step-function; most of the gains occurred early on   when we first experienced the significant changes in relative oil prices  We also know that there’s a   lot of difference across countries in oil intensity  Some people conclude that that means we can all   be as efficient as the most efficient country, so there’s a lot of room to improve  That’s a little naive   because some of those differences reflect industrial structure and the like  Somebody has to   produce the aluminum, right?  We can’t all save money—save oil and energy—by not producing   aluminum  So, some of those differences are more permanent  But some of them involve just a   failure to take the steps that others have taken  There’s scope there, too I think there’s no better   solution to this problem than to let prices show through    Yes And remember, what we’ve done is just decelerate foreign activity;   and we’ve hugely decelerated commodity prices    The dollar could well continue up  Much of this more favorable outlook   owes to the fact that the dollar, on balance, has risen rather significantly over the course of 2005;   and indeed it has risen rather significantly over the past six weeks  In looking at the global   economy and listening to the chatter out there, I think there’s no reason that one could ever say with   confidence over a horizon of one year—or even two or three years—that we know the dollar will be   lower at that future point than it is today  We don’t know that  We know that probably a lot of   things that are consequences of the dollar continuing to rise will lead to some buildup of pressures   to eventually stop that rise  But over the kind of horizon we deal with in the Greenbook, we have   learned the hard way that the random walk is the best attitude to have  "
7576,2005-08-09," The staff outlook for real GDP growth abroad is little  changed this time from that in the June Greenbook  Economic expansion in our  foreign trading partners has rebounded from its subdued first-quarter pace, and  we expect that it will firm somewhat more later this year and next   Nevertheless, three elements of our baseline outlook this time are  sufficiently changed from the previous forecast that they warrant attention  today first is the very sizable, positive change that recent data have implied to  the contribution to US real GDP growth from the external sector; second, the  long-awaited announcement by Chinese officials of a change in their exchange  rate regime; and third, yet another discrete upward revision in our projection for  global oil prices   We now estimate that net exports made an arithmetic positive contribution  of 14 percentage points to real growth in the second quarter, a figure slightly  less than that reported by the BEA in the advance real GDP data for the quarter   With June nominal trade data yet to be released, both the BEA and we must  guesstimate that number in constructing a second-quarter figure for real GDP   Our estimate of the contribution is now significantly larger than the 055  percentage point that we had incorporated into the June forecast  The nominal  trade data for May surprised us with stronger exports and a bit weaker imports  than we had anticipated These data account for 05 percentage point of the  revision The remainder of the revision to the contribution owes to a markdown  of imports in line with the advance NIPA data, which contained a different  translation gap between the balance of payments data and the national income  data than that for Q1, which in turn had been the basis of our projection     The overall revision to second-quarter imports is somewhat greater than that  to exports We now estimate that real imports of goods and services actually  declined in the second quarter whereas real exports grew at over a 12 percent  annual rate; very strong nominal exports in April were followed by even slightly  larger exports in May   Over the forecast period, we expect that real imports will resume growing,  at an annual rate of about 6 percent  Positive but slowing impetus from US  output expansion largely explains the growth of imports, with relative prices  switching from being a small drag to providing a slight boost to core imports   We project that real export growth will step down in the second half of this year  and a bit more next year, to rates more in line with stimulus from output growth  abroad and diminishing impetus from dollar depreciation over the past three  years All in all, the contribution from the external sector reverts to negative                                 August 9, 2005 18 of 110  this quarter in our baseline forecast and is about minus 04 percentage point  over the next year   The July 21 announcement by Chinese officials of a change in their  exchange rate regime ended speculation about when such a move would come  but left many other questions unanswered  Following the initial 21 percent  revaluation of the renminbi in terms of the dollar, the exchange value of the  Chinese currency has fluctuated very narrowly  Essentially no information has  yet been provided about the composition of the Areference@ basket of currencies  that is now part of the regime  Scope has now apparently emerged for future  moves in the exchange rate in terms of the dollar, but some official statements  have emphasized that such further change will be gradual   To construct our forecast of activity abroad, we needed to make a specific  assumption about the Chinese exchange rate regime going forward  Holding the  renminbi pegged at its current dollar exchange rate seemed to give too little  recognition to the major step we thought was implied by the announcement   But we saw as arbitrary any specific projection we might make of further  bilateral appreciation of the renminbi against the dollar  Accordingly, we chose  to harmonize our treatment of the renminbi and most other currencies  For the  purposes of the forecast, we have projected that the renminbi will appreciate  slightly in nominal terms—at a rate comparable to that we project for the euro,  the yen, the Canadian dollar—and have made small adjustments to other Asian  emerging market currencies as well    This trend nods in the direction of the downward pressure that we judge will  at some point be visible on the dollar as a result of the financing burden of our  growing external indebtedness We realize that when it occurs this pressure is  not likely to be evenly distributed across all bilateral dollar exchange rates with  other currencies  Nor is it likely to occur smoothly and gradually over time   However, we do expect that the real index of the dollar in terms of all our  important trading partners is likely to move down on balance over a reasonably  long horizon because of global imbalances  Adding the renminbi into that mix  has resulted in a slightly more rapid rate of real dollar depreciation than we had  previously been incorporating into the staff forecast    The spot price of West Texas intermediate (WTI) crude oil moved up over  the intermeeting period to exceed $61 per barrel on August 4 as the Greenbook  was completed and has risen further in the days since then  The prices of oil  futures contracts with more distant expirations have surged as well  This most  recent run-up in spot WTI prices has been accompanied by a widening in the  spread between that price and the prices of heavier, more sour, crudes  This  WTI premium is expected to unwind, but not immediately, resulting in a  forecast for the US oil import price that is little changed on average over the  second half of this year but is more than $3 higher in 2006 than we had  projected in the June Greenbook                                            August 9, 2005 19 of 110  Various factors appear to have contributed over the past six weeks to the  upward pressure on oil prices; most of them relate to risks to the available  supply reaching the market  Destruction by fire of a large oil platform owned  by India was particularly important because it provided light, sweet crude  The  death of Saudi Arabian King Fahd appears to have raised political risks in the  world=s largest oil exporter, even though the new king, Abdullah, had been  managing most of the kingdom=s business during the 10-year illness of the late  king Warnings of an unusually active hurricane season have raised concerns  about a possible repeat of the kind of supply interruptions experienced last year   Other issues of regular maintenance or delays in completing new sources of  supply have arisen as well   These various events all occurred against a background of perceived strong  world demand and little spare capacity  Possible political risks are seen as  creating uncertainty with respect to supply from Iraq, Iran, Venezuela, Russia  and other global trouble spots In the event of any serious disruption in such a  trouble spot, there is little scope for other sources of supply to fill the resulting  excess demand  As a result, market participants see little likelihood that prices  will decline in the future The far-dated contract for delivery in December 2011  is up to $59 per barrel   To date, the global economy has absorbed the rise in prices with few signs  that overall economic activity will ease off in response  Higher oil prices have  boosted consumer price inflation in some regions  However, inflation  expectations appear to remain well anchored, and our baseline forecast calls for  CPI inflation abroad to recede a bit next year  This projection depends  importantly on oil prices remaining elevated but flattening out early next year,  as anticipated in the futures curve Renewed upward pressure on global oil  prices remains a risk to the forecast, however, as higher oil prices for consumers  tend to erode domestic demand in importing countries and regions, and oil  exporters take some time before increasing their expenditures    David and I will be happy to answer any questions    With respect to the trend, over the Greenbook forecast horizon, the   dollar is now, on average, depreciating in real terms about 1½ percent, and in previous   Greenbooks the comparable figure would have been about 1¼ percent  So we’ve deliberately                               August 9, 2005 22 of 110  constructed it so that the 1¼ percent embedded the notion that a block of Asian currencies was   pegged to the dollar If we’re going to undo that assumption, it should show through  So it’s by   construction, basically; this is just our attempt to signal this and let the rate of depreciation rise to   1½ percent   I have to say that when we do Greenbook extensions that find their way into background   uses in the Bluebooks and so forth, that rate of depreciation so allows the external imbalance to   explode that we actually have to up it So, any time we do anything that runs longer than the   Greenbook horizon, we put in a number like minus 4, because otherwise the external sector   behaves in such a dominant way that the simulations don’t seem useful  But for the Greenbook   horizon, that period is so short that in all honesty the real dollar could go up and not down at all    So we now have that minus 1½ percent in place as a sort of marker  "
7600,2005-09-20," Thank you, Mr Chairman Spot prices for crude oil were   especially volatile over the intermeeting period, as uncertainty about the   consequences of possible hurricane damage, along with other risks, drove up prices   before Katrina hit the Gulf shore and as evolving expectations of the near- and   medium-term implications of the storm damage induced fluctuations in the weeks   following Katrina In the last few days, concerns about Tropical Storm Rita have   been added to the mix  As has been our practice, we again relied on the futures   markets to sort through the uncertainties about crude oil supply and demand over the   forecast period, and our projection of WTI [West Texas intermediate] prices through   the end of 2007 is drawn from the futures curve as of September 12    The complexities of Katrina=s effect on energy prices are such, however, that   specifying the WTI price still left unanswered a number of questions about related   prices and quantities, both for the global outlook and for the US economy  With   normal US refining capacity only accounting for roughly 80 percent of US   demand, and with four refineries in the region still closed, we have projected a partial   substitution of refined products for crude in US oil imports in the near term  In   addition, with global refinery operations already about at capacity, at least in terms of   refineries capable of producing products that meet US specifications, there is no   scope for US demand to draw upon global supply without having an impact on   price As a consequence, prices for refined products abroad, particularly for gasoline,   have risen We have assumed that all of the refineries will be operational by the   beginning of 2006                          September 20, 2005 10 of 117  US crude oil production in the Gulf remains at about 50 percent of the level  before Hurricane Katrina, with some of this reduction offset by release from the  Strategic Petroleum Reserve  We expect that repairs to the damaged facilities will  occur over time and have incorporated into the forecast a gradual recovery that is  completed early next year  Consequently, we have bumped up our projection for  crude oil imports in the first quarter to account for the transitory shortfall  The net  effect of these developments is that we have raised our projected price for spot WTI  oil by $140 per barrel in the fourth quarter of this year and by $180 per barrel next  year However, in the near term we have raised our projection for the US oil import  price by more, $260 per barrel in the fourth quarter and just below $2 per barrel in  the following quarter, to reflect the change in mix toward imports of refined product  and the rise in product prices as well as crude prices  The net result is a forecast for  the oil import bill that is notably higher in the near term, but is less so by the end of  next year   Other elements of the external forecast that were affected by Hurricane Katrina  include the shipments of non-oil goods into and out of the United States through the  region=s port facilities The immediate percentage impact on exports is judged to be a  bit larger than that on non-oil imports, as imports have greater flexibility to be  diverted to other ports The port facilities are reopening quickly, and these effects,  particularly on a net basis, should be small  In addition, the current account balance  will be positively changed by receipts by US insurance firms of payments owing to  reinsurance abroad and, to a lesser extent, by aid contributions from other countries to  the US economy  These items will appear as transfer receipts in the nontrade  portion of the current account On balance, this range of impacts from Katrina is  expected to be transitory and of limited magnitude     The outlook for foreign growth and inflation is, of course, also influenced by the  change in our forecast for global energy prices and by the changes projected for the  US economy In the near term, these two factors work in the same direction to  lessen foreign growth Over a longer horizon, with US growth projected to rebound  next year, they are partly offsetting  Upward pressure on inflation from energy prices  is a growing concern of central banks and officials abroad  The event of Hurricane  Katrina reinforced the trend toward elevated oil prices that has been unfolding over  the past few years In some foreign countries, particularly emerging-market  economies, officials have controlled domestic energy prices to blunt the effects of  higher global prices As elevated oil prices have continued, foreign officials have  started to remove or lessen these subsidies, with consequent effects on inflation  pressures  David will continue our presentation    Yes They have been around the longest in the United Kingdom and in   the early years indexed securities were very clearly held in response to the tax incentives  So   there was a certain disconnect; there wasn’t a notion that people who viewed those expectations   as differing from their own would trade and the market would settle into reflecting their   expectations on the margin     I’m not aware that people generally view that as a solid predictor, but I would say that we   probably should look into that more  We haven’t done our own independent work on that     Not by us    Yes, a 17-year high I volunteer to run the gold price  [Laughter]     Right    I have not looked at that enough in the last few days to give you an   answer to your question There have been, obviously, over the past year or more, periods of time   in which the nature of trading in the energy futures market seemed to be evolving  Indeed,   energy futures came to be thought of as an asset class for which hedge funds and investment   banks would open up departments and would trade aggressively  It was a profit center, so why   not?  I don’t know that that has ended   But some of the other instances about which people were most concerned died down and   I think the number of contracts that were thought to be noncommercial would ebb and flow as   time went by  The fact that the price came back down helped because there was a time when it   looked somewhat like the Japanese stock market in the late 1980s  It was just about a sure bet   that if you could buy some of the stuff, you would make money  And that went away as the   price developed some two-way fluctuations and so forth   But to be honest, I don’t have the information to give you about whether post-Katrina we   have seen a real change It was certainly startling how quickly the price moved yesterday when   it became clear that Rita was going to cross into the Gulf  That volatility may reflect more   traders of different backgrounds acting more quickly  I wouldn’t interpret that as indicating that                September 20, 2005 26 of 117  somehow those movements are superficial  I think there is a genuine increase in the extent to   which people believe the global supply of energy is vulnerable to random events and has very   little buffer capacity in it Those things, I think, are real   Whether on a given piece of news the trading is mostly done by hedge funds or is mostly   done by people who have a genuine need to hedge in the commercial sense, I don’t think we   know But there is a change in tone People feel that the supply capability both at the refinery   level and at the extraction level is not there to meet the projected demand and that we’re going to   be on a bit of a knife’s edge And they believe that developments on the political side in Russia   or in Venezuela could easily tip the balance  I think that is for real     Well, I can’t speculate on how the domestic politics of this would play   out in some of those countries  The IEA [International Energy Agency] authorized the sale of 60             September 20, 2005 29 of 117  million barrels from the strategic reserves of its members—30 million from us and 30 million   from the others  Most of what we were going to release from the strategic petroleum reserve was   crude; that’s all we store  And in the bidding that took place for that oil, as of two or three days   ago, 11 was the number of bids that were accepted, not 30  So there’s some question in the   minds of our staff experts on this about whether that means a second round and a third round will   be done to eventually work up to the 30 million  Or is the thinking that maybe they don’t need to   do all 30 million?  Of the 30 million that is to be done from non-US stocks, much of that will be   product rather than crude oil, and much of it will simply be sold into the market  The global   market for gasoline just needs more supply  It’s not a question of their targeting it necessarily   toward us   So, I think what we’re seeing is that they have the oil and they have the product  They   could do more than what they’ve done, but what they’ve done so far has not stabilized the price    And there is political resistance in Europe  Now, I think that’s a bit naive in a sense  If they   don’t release more, presumably the price would go even higher, right?  The market is never   going to be fragmented, and they’re always going to feel the effect of our attempt to buy more   gasoline  But there’s the interplay of domestic use versus selling it into the market and there’s   pressure, particularly in Europe, regarding their gasoline taxes And this is where I think the   essence of the fight is being waged right now  Most people who are arguing about the long-run   interests of rational energy policy in the EU [European Union] Commission and anybody who is   a bit above the politics is saying, “Whatever you do, don’t cut the gasoline taxes”  But some of   the actual governments who face the electorate a bit more directly have caved already  Others of   them are going to postpone planned increases  Some of them are wavering                   September 20, 2005 30 of 117  If they go the route of trying to protect their domestic populations by temporarily   lowering taxes and so forth, my guess is that they won’t be putting the gasoline into a   distribution that would appear to be bailing out the Americans at the expense of the French   farmer  That isn’t going to happen  They will try to protect their stocks and they will try to   segment the market  So I wouldn’t count on that as a big source of transitory relief on price   pressure—more than we have already seen—because I think the politics of it is getting very   complicated    Well, regrettably it’s not David’s problem  It’s mine  [Laughter]    Let me take it in two halves  I’ll talk a little about global energy use,   and then we’ll come to the import price part   We model energy demand, energy consumption, energy production, and the implied   change in inventories on a global basis And we do it using all of the information we can muster    But it is understood by the people in that world that there is a lack of good information  There   has been an outcry for more transparency about energy production and energy capacity than now   exists Some of the volatility that President Fisher was speaking to derives from the fact that   when the IEA makes an announcement of a change in their estimate of what demand was last   year it will move the market So, the quality of the information that is available for the global   market is certainly far from ideal  And some of the countries involved, of course, are in rather   troubled political areas where being transparent about anything is not in their interest, so they   don’t provide data So that adds to the complexity     But we have an oil model and we use a lot of judgment—the add factors that David was   talking about—and we attempt to account for total oil production in essence by country  It’s not   that we think any individual number in that mix is going to be right in any sense, but we try to be   consistent through the story So we start with the futures curve for WTI, and we make some   judgments about the spreads on things like Dubai and other oils that loom large in the global   market, and we use the model to infer what the balance of supply and demand would have to be    And given that we have relied on the futures markets—basically for want of a view that we could   do better than the futures market—supply becomes the residual  So we have forecasts of global   demand of GDP  And we have different weights that apply to those that are the oil-using   weights as opposed to the trade weights or the GDP weights that we might use other places             September 20, 2005 32 of 117  Now, part of your question was how often we change those weights and how sensitive we   are to the shifts in production that are taking place in the world  I can’t speak to that specifically,   but in general we revise our weights every year  It’s not as if we have weights from 1970 and we   just keep cranking away using those weights We’ve gone to this variable weight approach as in   the GDP and everything else So, we specifically do at least attempt to take account of how   different countries use energy versus how other things happen  We have a set of energy-using   weights that we apply to world GDP, and that gives us, in essence, a different aggregate for   world growth than if we were doing it for some other purpose, which we do   So we’ve got a price and we’ve got demand, and we back out supply; supply becomes the   residual For example, two years ago when prices seemed to us to be rather high, we were   inferring a need for supply to pull back in order to sustain those prices  And OPEC has played   that role—Saudi Arabia, in particular  Go back and read Greenbooks from two to three years   ago, and we had a story about expecting supply to contract in certain places in order for futures   curve prices to be realized, as oil suppliers target prices, and so forth   That has not been so true lately Indeed, we’ve been tapping capacity increasingly over   the last two years And the notion that global supply was more than enough to explain the prices   we were seeing has flipped to become a question of where we are going to get the extra supply   For a time Russia and the FSU [Former Soviet Union] were a big source of extra non-OPEC   supply That seems to have changed more recently  So, there is a supply story that tries to take   these things into account that matches demand and the futures curve to give a crude oil picture    And it has to account for enough barrels to make that true  If we were to run into a real                September 20, 2005 33 of 117  contradiction there, we would have to go back and say something to ourselves about our   assessment of demand   We take that picture, and for the United States—particularly this time more so than   most—we have to ask questions about domestic capacity to supply the residual part  Would that   have to be imported?  And what would be the mix of those imports?  So we try to make all of   that fit  That leaves us then with an oil import price which can move differently than global   crude prices because of the mix factor  And the oil import price is what feeds into the domestic   economy and then drives the elements of pass-through and domestic production and so forth   Now, in our forecast of import prices the oil price portion is distinct from the non-oil   portion, and it is non-oil import prices that in the projection come down  Those prices have been   kicked around hugely by natural gas and by non-oil primary commodities  We have now   internally, but we don’t put it in the Greenbook, import prices less natural gas as a check on   whether we are fully incorporating what we think is happening to natural gas  But we don’t have   a comparable setup for the supply and demand balance of natural gas that we have for oil, and   the natural gas that would be relevant, obviously, is for North America as an almost isolated   market  There is liquefied natural gas on the margin  There are some imports on the margin    But we are thinking that we might have to do something about the quantity of natural gas   because it’s a hidden uncertainty in the overall non-oil import price, and it’s uncomfortable that   we haven’t been able to have a better control over that   Even so, the non-oil, non-energy primary commodities have been the big story in import   prices; they caused the import prices to move up  And the fact that those futures markets are   telling us that those prices have peaked or are even coming down is what lies behind our forecast                    September 20, 2005 34 of 117  that import prices are decelerating yet again—and to very low levels in 2006 and into 2007  That   outlook is really a combination of what we think the non-energy futures markets are telling us   about commodity prices and the maintained assumption we make about the dollar  Either of   those things could change, and the forecast is completely conditional on them, with the added   wrinkle of this role of natural gas that is embedded in non-oil import prices, but which probably   should be separated out Now, at least in terms of the work we do, we try to do that partially but   maybe we should do it more explicitly  "
7622,2005-11-01," I would say that has been the case since moving out of the recession—since   early 2003 or something like that  We benchmark this correlation from time to time  I don’t know   that we’ve done it quite as a rolling correlation but we easily could, and we will    It is It’s also, though, indicative of the nature of the shocks that are   perceived by market participants  So, to the extent those are idiosyncratic to individual countries, it   tends to cause the correlation to fall apart  To the extent they are perceived to be global, those rates   move together                                                      November 1, 2005 8 of 114  On top of that is the issue of whether or not portfolio holders are holding a sufficiently diverse   portfolio that any adjustment they might make in response to a shock is going to be spread across   markets, because they’re going to rebalance and they’re going to achieve the new risk-return mix   that they’re looking for  And there’s some of that going on  That’s, I think, what you mean by the   term globalization—that portfolio holders, by the way they adjust their portfolios, do some of this    But it’s certainly true that this comes and goes a bit, and we can look to see how the correlation   coefficient has developed    Well, I think these securities were targeted to international investors more  I   find it a little puzzling why it works this way, but it was not the case that these were sold into the   domestic market and happened to be bought by international folk and, therefore, isn’t that a good   sign These were really targeted for foreign investors, denominated in the domestic currencies, so as   to give them the Brazilian interest rate and the Colombian interest rate  It is thought that people   who are searching for yield would want to add these sorts of securities to their portfolios, and they   did    No You are basically taking on country risk and exchange rate risk when   you buy these issues    I’m not sure either  In Colombia’s case, given that there is to a certain   extent a dollar component of their economy—    The staff forecast for real GDP growth and inflation abroad  is little changed this time from the forecast in the September Greenbook  This is  the case despite additional hurricanes, volatile energy prices, and a notable rise in  long-term interest rates in several foreign industrial countries during the  intermeeting period  The futures path for WTI [West Texas intermediate] crude  oil prices retraced somewhat in October  Accordingly, we have incorporated into  this forecast global oil prices through 2007 that are about $2 per barrel lower than  in the previous forecast  Nevertheless, the outlook for global crude oil prices  remains elevated at about $60 per barrel for WTI and is more than $8 above the  level six months ago   Clearly, factors related to crude oil supply have contributed at times to upward  pressure on global crude oil prices In addition to disruptions as a result of the  hurricanes, there are market concerns about the change in leadership in Saudi  Arabia, politics in Iran, Venezuela, and Russia, and reduced production as a result  of violence in Iraq However, the trend increase since 2003 in not only spot  prices but also in far futures prices occurred despite expansion of global oil  production, evidence that underlying global demand for crude oil is also  importantly responsible for the price pressures  This persistent, strong,  underlying demand for energy reflects fundamental robustness in global economic  activity—perhaps more than has been generally recognized  As a consequence,  we have observed during this year further moves up in energy prices and in prices  for nonfuel primary commodities along with average real growth abroad that has  remained moderately strong, although a bit below the rapid pace of 2004   As in September, we are calling for real GDP abroad on average to expand at  about 3 percent in the current quarter, following growth at that pace in the third  quarter, and to accelerate a bit in 2006 and 2007  This favorable picture  incorporates a return to steady expansion in Japan and solid, albeit slightly  moderating, growth in the emerging Asian region  In addition, real growth in  Mexico should recover from a disappointing outcome during the first half of this  year   Our judgment that the pace of foreign economic activity remains firm is  reflected in a range of positive indicators in Canada, including employment,  industrial production, monthly GDP, a rebound in manufacturing orders in  August, and a high pace of housing starts Japan=s Tankan business conditions  index moved up again in September, with projections of capital spending this year  and forecasts of sales and profits all revised up  Indicators for the euro area are                                  November 1, 2005 18 of 114  mixed, but in Germany industrial orders have come in strong and the October Ifo  measure of business climate jumped to a five-year peak  Among the emerging- market economies, Chinese industrial production accelerated through September,  and retail sales growth remained above 12 percent  Korean real GDP growth rose  to 75 percent in the third quarter, and Brazil continues to enjoy very strong export  sales   The mix of sustained global growth and upward shifts in commodity prices,  particularly crude oil prices, naturally heightens concerns about higher consumer  price inflation Headline inflation rates abroad have moved up significantly with  the rise in crude oil prices Our outlook, however, is for these prices to decelerate  over the forecast period given our projection (and that of the futures markets) that  crude oil prices will be about flat next year and edge down in 2007 and given that  the effects of previous increases in crude prices on inflation will wane and then  end Such an outcome depends upon an absence of significant second-round  effects of oil prices on domestic prices and wages abroad  To date, core inflation  in the major foreign countries confirms this is the case   The combination of continued growth and contained inflation pressures  sounds optimistic  Rest assured, we have found numerous risks about which to  worry The elevated energy prices could sap consumer demand more than we  expect, undermining the pace of real growth  In the face of higher costs, business  spending on new capital could falter, particularly in emerging Asia where few  countries have petroleum production sectors  Wage demands could react to the  increase in headline inflation and threaten to ignite a set of second- and third- round effects We do not see evidence of these developments at this time, but it is  too soon to conclude that the danger of such actions has passed   A second feature of the international forecast that merits a few minutes is the  approximately neutral contribution of real net exports to US real GDP growth in  the third quarter, following a positive contribution in the second quarter  The  third-quarter NIPA [national income and product accounts] data released last  Friday imply a slightly smaller, less positive, contribution than we had  incorporated in the Greenbook baseline forecast or in the September forecast   However, in the current quarter, compared with the September forecast, we are  assuming a greater rebound in exports and have reduced our assessment of the  extent to which the external sector will provide a drag on GDP growth   Accordingly, we expect that on a four-quarter change basis, the external sector  will record a slightly positive contribution to US real GDP growth for the year—  the first annual positive contribution since 1995  However, we are not ready to  declare that external adjustment has arrived, and we expect a return to a small  drag on US growth from the external sector in the current quarter and on balance  over the forecast period   On a quarterly basis, both imports and exports are highly variable  Seasonally  adjusted real oil imports impart notable quarter-to-quarter variance to real                                   November 1, 2005 19 of 114  imports  But recently we have experienced weakness in other components of real  imports  During this intermeeting period, imports again surprised us on the  downside, with August data for nominal imports much weaker than expected   This negative surprise included both goods and services, and within goods, it was  particularly the case for imports of consumer goods and industrial supplies  For  the near-term forecast we have included some effects as a result of the hurricanes  and the disruption to general trade they caused  As a result, there is some implicit  payback in the forecast for real imports in the fourth quarter  Nevertheless,  compared with the September Greenbook, we have lowered the growth of real  imports in 2006 and 2007 in response to the somewhat softer outlook for US  activity and to a higher path for import prices   Growth of third-quarter real exports was also revised down, although not by  enough to offset weaker imports Hurricane effects also figure in our estimate for  third-quarter exports More significant has been the recent strike at Boeing  We  judge that the strike had a more pronounced impact on September=s exports than  we previously thought, leading us to weaken real exports for last quarter  But the  rapid conclusion of that strike also led us to strengthen real exports for the current  quarter For 2006 and 2007, we expect export growth will average a bit above 5  percent per year, consistent with our outlook for steady real output growth abroad   In sum, actual trade data through August, our estimates of how the turbulent  weather of recent months has affected exports and imports, and our projections of  global primary commodity prices, particularly crude oil, combine to imply  unusual quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in growth of real exports and real imports   Some of these developments have surprised us since the September Greenbook   Going forward, however, we expect that the transitory weather effects will fade  by early 2006 We look for real exports and imports to expand at similar rates on  balance in 2006 and 2007 With imports substantially greater than exports, this  outcome implies a negative contribution from the external sector of about ⅓  percentage point each year   David and I will be happy to take your questions    Well, that’s always present for a time    But for example, our J-curve effects last for two or three quarters after the   exchange rate changes  People look for this in particular when the dollar is coming down, and the                              November 1, 2005 20 of 114  dollar decline ended last December, roughly  So I would say there is presently very little J-curve in   the pipeline There may be a little bit from the dollar’s rise, but the dollar hasn’t risen so very much    In nominal imports, but it’s sort of going the wrong way  You might say   it’s the effect of six months of slight dollar depreciation; it could be  But oddly, import prices have   been higher than anybody was expecting  So pieces just don’t fit for the J-curve  And I think the   effect of the dollar depreciation that occurred through the end of 2004 has largely gone away    Yes    I take your point    I’m sure Vincent would be prepared to organize a survey and would respect   the Committee’s wishes    Let me make one point, if I may  We have wrestled with the notion of what   constitutes a neutral assumption about the exchange rate, and it is not obvious because we know that   the forward rates implied by interest rate differentials are very, very poor forecasters  Everybody   knows that  So, taking that as an assumption and giving it weight—and having it run through the                                         November 1, 2005 25 of 114  forecast—does not seem attractive to us  But the alternative is an approach that is kind of   “consistent with the other pieces of the forecast and neutral”  It’s a tough call  We have clung to   something that is close to, but not exactly, the random walk version of things for a while now  We   certainly don’t see our exchange rate forecast as having a determining effect such that we’re driving   the forecast by making this assumption  We try not to do that    Okay We appreciate that  I recognize that the outcome in Mexico during   the first half of this year certainly raises questions, because Mexico has not enjoyed the level of   production that would have been consistent with previous relationships to US GDP  So whether or   not Mexico will, in fact, strengthen is certainly a risk in the forecast  "
7644,2005-12-13," This is a longstanding paradox in international economics  When you run   uncovered interest parity and embody the forward rate as the expected future spot rate, you actually    get the coefficient with the wrong sign in those regressions if the time series is long enough  And you   never get it to confirm interest rate differentials related to exchange rates only in the positive direction   and with the magnitude that you expected  There are all sorts of reasons for that  My short one is that   you’re running two endogenous variables on each other and, therefore, the regression doesn’t make   any sense, and so the results don’t make any sense                                   December 13, 2005 7 of 100   Well, there are times when interest rate differentials seem to be the right   story, and this is one of them    In defense of this chart, let’s just say that there are also theoretical reasons   why at times there is this relationship    This is the time of year when folks young and old look forward to  receiving a pleasant surprise or two—and not necessarily something that can fit inside a  single stocking We in the International Division have found ourselves pleasantly  surprised by the strength of global economic activity during the third quarter, which is  now evident in the data, and the indications that some of that strength is continuing   Accordingly, we have revised up our estimate of foreign real GDP growth for 2005 to  near 3½ percent, about the pace we were projecting early last year  The baseline  forecast this time calls for economic activity abroad to continue expanding at about that  pace through the end of 2007     The greater-than-expected buoyancy of the global economy was widespread and  does not appear to be explained by one or two special developments that have limited  implications for future growth  Among the industrial countries, the strong performers  such as Canada had another good quarter, with Canadian Q3 real GDP growth at 36  percent But more sluggish regions, for example the euro area, also did moderately  well, at 26 percent real growth  Labor markets have either continued to improve or  remained solid  And German and Canadian orders data portend continued solid  expansion Among the Asian emerging-market economies, China, Taiwan, Hong  Kong, Korea, the ASEAN countries, and India all performed well in the third quarter   In Latin America, a sharp rebound in Mexican GDP growth raised the average for the  region despite a very weak quarter in Brazil   Some elements of recent foreign activity do raise questions about whether strength  is transitory or will prove more persistent  In the United Kingdom and some smaller  economies such as New Zealand, further increases in housing prices appear to be  contributing to sustained or accelerating consumption  However, an end to the inflation  of housing prices could trigger a sharp slowing of consumption  Euro-area growth  remains dependent on export demand and lacks support from domestic consumption   And the rebound in Mexico was primarily in the agricultural sector and did not include  a significant bounceback in manufacturing  These factors suggest a transitory element                                  December 13, 2005 14 of 100  in the recent data  In contrast, in the major regions of the global economy, inventories  do not appear excessive and in need of reduction  Private fixed investment has shown  vitality in Japan, the euro area, the United Kingdom, Canada, China, and Mexico   These elements suggest the expansion will prove durable   In most foreign economies, financial conditions remain very favorable for growth   Equity prices, in particular, have risen substantially over the year, providing support for  both private investment and consumption  Since the end of last year, equity prices have  recorded double-digit increases in the foreign G-7 countries, with the more than 30  percent gain in Japan being particularly noteworthy  Among the emerging Asian  countries, stock prices in Korea have surged over the year  In Latin America, Mexican  and Brazilian stock prices have risen very sharply  Except for Canada, the major  foreign industrial countries have all experienced expansionary depreciations of their  currencies on balance over the year  For these countries, long-term interest rates  remain low, ranging from about 1½ percent in Japan to 4¼ percent in the United  Kingdom   We interpret the positive surprise in the pace of third-quarter activity as indicating  somewhat greater fundamental economic momentum abroad than we recognized in the  previous Greenbook That momentum, in combination with the generally supportive  foreign financial conditions, should sustain foreign real GDP growth, and we have  accordingly raised our forecast for 2006 slightly  We expect that this continued  moderate real output growth will be accompanied by little change, on average, in  inflation abroad as the flat path projected for global crude oil prices over the forecast  interval should result in some shifts down in headline inflation  Of course, risks of an  acceleration in consumer prices abroad, owing to second-round effects from previous  oil price rises, remain  Both the Bank of Canada and the ECB raised policy rates  during the intermeeting period to counter any upward drift in inflation pressures or in  inflation expectations We expect further policy tightening in Canada in the next few  quarters, more limited additional action by the ECB, and an end of the Bank of Japan=s  policy of quantitative easing some time in 2006     By itself, somewhat stronger activity abroad should work to narrow our external  deficits in 2006 and 2007  But we have also slightly raised the forecast path for the  dollar in this forecast from that in the October Greenbook, and the level of US real  GDP has been revised up as well Together, these last two factors outweigh the effects  of stronger activity abroad and, as a result, we expect a greater US current account  deficit during the next two years, with the upward revision reaching about $50 billion at  an annual rate in the fourth quarter of 2007 About $30 billion of the increased deficit  is expected to be accounted for by a wider trade deficit, with the remaining $20 billion  arising from a downward revision to net investment income  Our outlook incorporates  a deterioration of more than $100 billion in US net investment income from the  second quarter of this year to the final quarter of 2007, with negative net income  expected for the current quarter With the current account deficit soon to reach $900  billion and projected to cross the $1 trillion mark in 2007 and with net investment  income significantly negative, market attention to the burden of the US external                                          December 13, 2005 15 of 100  deficits could increase This feature of the December forecast is not such a pleasant  surprise Given today=s prices for energy, perhaps we would be better off with a lump  of coal   David and I would be happy to answer any questions    Well, two or three things come to mind  No one of them alone would seem   to explain it, but in conjunction they may be a partial answer to your question  One is that following   the Asian financial crisis, and no doubt in part in response to what has been happening in the United   States, particularly since say, ’95 or ’96, most of these countries have been running current account   surpluses and acquiring international reserves  The Asian countries have been doing it to the extreme    They’ve been piling up reserves and protecting themselves from being dependent upon the whims of   foreign investors ever since that crisis  And they’re still doing it, although I noted an article in today’s   Wall Street Journal quoting some Chinese officials as saying that maybe they now had enough  So I   took that to be an interesting sign                             December 13, 2005 16 of 100  The Latin American countries—for many of the same reasons, but without quite the same   capacity—have nonetheless put themselves in a position of an external plus instead of a minus  Now,   the Latin Americans, in particular, and some of the Asians have outstanding debts, so they have   payments schedules they have to meet  It’s not as if they are not in some sense still embroiled in the   consequences of their histories and so forth  But their position vis-à-vis global capital flows has   turned around enormously, and they have never gone back to policies that reflect an attitude of “the   crisis is over, full steam ahead”  They have retained this preference for keeping themselves net   lenders in a flow sense in the international capital flow  There are many reasons to view that as a   problem as much as a good thing, but it explains, I think, why Argentina didn’t have much contagion   effect and why these countries seem to us to be doing better    Well, most of their exchange rates are floating, yes    Yes So very few are trying to peg to an overvalued exchange rate  Even a   country like Malaysia gave up on its pegged exchange rate  So the floating rates have certainly   improved the situation  But, you know, the peso and the real are strengthening vis-à-vis the dollar    So it’s not mercantilist It’s not that these countries have somehow allowed their exchange rates to   become and remain undervalued and that they are benefiting from that  But again, I think the flow   changes the risk character of these countries and their ability to interact with international investors   I think a second fundamental is that Asia, largely because of China but also because of India   to some degree—because of the Asian Tigers, as we used to call them—has become a second   independent source of vibrant global economic activity  It was derailed a bit in the late ’90s, but   actually only a pretty short period elapsed before they were back on their feet  And their capacity to                                December 13, 2005 17 of 100  succeed economically is very great  They are a high-saving, highly productive, strong work ethic part   of the world  And unless something happens to forestall that, they’re going to be an economic region   that’s growing   And, third, they’re becoming more market-based  The orthodoxy, so to speak—the increased   reliance on markets, the additional flexibility, and the more stable macro prices—is paying dividends   in these regions as well  You still get a country like Venezuela that, but for its oil reserves, would be   totally in some tank somewhere  And its politics are leading it in crazy directions, but it’s the   exception at this point; the others are more as I’ve just described    There are still shortcomings, no doubt  It’s still the case that Asian market   capitalism is not Anglo-Saxon market capitalism  And China could still find that the enormous task it   has set itself of changing that economy at a very rapid pace could run into troubles  These are not   guarantees, but I think it’s in some sense a description of where we’ve been  And even all the shocks   that we’ve all talked about so much—9/11, Enron, stock market collapses, et cetera—which were   every bit as much global as they were US-only, have been absorbed remarkably well, not only here   but abroad    Just as a quick answer, we have put assumptions into the Greenbook about   the size of those capital flows, as a financing of our deficit  They don’t influence the current account   because the earnings on US investments abroad are booked as occurring on a flow basis—when they   happen—whether they are repatriated or not  So the repatriation in light of this special tax break that   will ultimately expire would be a financing flow, not a change to the current account  And probably   the numbers are big enough to be meaningful but not huge, not dominant   What we don’t know—probably can’t know—is the extent to which the flows back to this   country are already in dollars in some sense  Are they earned in dollars or are they transferred into   dollars over some long period of time?  If they are sort of sitting there waiting to come back in dollars,   they wouldn’t have any particular role in explaining, say, the run-up in the dollar over the last six   months or so  Without very disaggregated data, we can’t really tell that  And the turnover in the                                December 13, 2005 20 of 100  exchange market is so huge that numbers on the order of magnitude that this tax break involved   would never show up as a sudden outlier in a particular month, or something of that sort  We’ve put   something in there as an assumption, and it’s probably a piece of the story  It’s providing a little bit of   extra ease in financing the current account deficit right now and is, therefore, a bit of support for the   dollar  But I wouldn’t think it is a dominant factor    I certainly don’t dispute that it is useful to know things like the amount of   private versus official financing, and the nature of some of the flows, and so forth  But let me caution   you that, in the end, the actual data recorded for capital flows will conform to the current account   balances There are certain market equilibria that imply certain identities  So the fact that the   numbers are what they are isn’t so important  What matters are the terms on which those flows occur    So things like exchange rates, interest rates, and equity prices will tell you the characteristics of the   returns to assets that had to be realized in order to get the flows to be what the flows had to be  "
7688,2006-03-27,"  We now have complete fourth-quarter data for US trade and   the balance of payments  Several elements of those data seem to me to be worth  mentioning at this meeting as they correspond to issues with which we have wrestled  in putting together the international portion of your Greenbook forecast       The US current account deficit came in at an annual rate of $900 billion in the   fourth quarter—7 percent of nominal GDP  The jump from the previous quarter was  sizable, and the number gives me, at least, a bit of sticker shock  With $900 billion  already recorded, it is not surprising that our forecast for the current account deficit  crosses $1 trillion and reaches about 8 percent of GDP by the end of the forecast  period  With the US economy projected to perform well through the end of next   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 16 of 167       year, we have no reason to expect that the financing of such a large deficit will cause  problems in foreign exchange and asset markets  But the risk of such problems is  again a factor in the forecast       The deficit on goods and services, at $790 billion, accounts for most of the fourth-  quarter current account deficit  Of that figure, the non-oil merchandise balance is  about 70 percent  The balance on trade in services is actually a small positive  We  look for the bill for imported oil and the balance on services trade to change little  through the end of 2007  However, we expect that the non-oil merchandise balance  will widen significantly over the forecast period, contributing a little more than one- half of the increase in the current account deficit, and that deterioration of net  investment income will largely explain the remainder  Net investment income had  remained stubbornly positive even as the United States became a large net  international debtor  The initial release of fourth-quarter balance of payments data  shows a small negative for net investment income  Even if that negative is  subsequently revised away, we expect a negative change in the income balance  through the end of next year that is almost as large as the widening in the non-oil  merchandise trade balance  The decline we anticipate in net investment income  reflects both the growing US net debt position and the projected rise over time in the  interest rates applied to our net position in fixed-income assets      The information available to us about the financing of the external deficit for last   year as a whole supports our view that there is no basis for expecting an imminent,  disruptive consequence for asset markets of the growing US external imbalance  In  2005, private foreign investors made net purchases of US securities that totaled  almost as much as the entire current account deficit  This category of financial flows  increased greatly from the previous year, consistent with upward pressure on the  dollar in exchange markets over much of that time  The appetite of private foreign  investors for corporate and municipal bonds was particularly strong  Foreign direct  investment into the United States also rose during 2005 to a figure that is quite robust,  even if not at the scale of the extremely large inflows in the late 1990s and 2000  The  offsetting flows of direct investment abroad by US entities were small, reflecting the  temporary, favorable tax break on repatriated foreign earnings       Reported foreign official holdings of dollars in the United States did increase last   year, but at a rate significantly below that in 2004  Of the $217 billion increase in  foreign official holdings reported in the Greenbook for 2005, a very large portion is  due to increased official holdings by China  Although official Japanese holdings of  dollar assets had significantly risen in 2004, the ending of exchange market  intervention by Japanese authorities in March of that year resulted in no further  official acquisition of dollar assets last year by them  Oil exporters, particularly  Russia, accounted in 2005 for a moderate share of the change in foreign official dollar  holdings  All told, foreign official acquisition of dollar assets does not appear to have  been a dominant feature in the picture of financial flows painted by the balance of  payments statistics for last year       March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 17 of 167       Beyond the current quarter, our baseline forecast calls for real exports of goods  and services to expand at an annual rate of 5 percent  This export growth mainly  reflects our outlook for real GDP growth abroad  We project that, over the final three  quarters of this year, average real output growth abroad will be comparable to that of  the US economy; for next year, we expect foreign growth to exceed US growth by  about ¼ percentage point  We see the global expansion as broadly based across  regions, with real GDP growth in the emerging market economies significantly faster  than that in the industrial countries, but with both groups doing well  We expect that,  among the foreign industrial countries, Canada and the United Kingdom will continue  to be relatively strong and Japan’s recovery will become well established, although its  rate of output growth will abate somewhat going forward  Among the Asian  emerging market economies, we look for a slowing in the rate of growth from recent  rates, importantly in China, but expect that on average those economies will maintain  a pace of expansion of nearly 6 percent  In Latin America, we project that our major  trading partners will all see solid growth that averages almost 4 percent this year and  a bit less next year      Although the dollar moved up slightly over the intermeeting period, we again   forecast some dollar depreciation in real terms, as we remain mindful of the financing  requirements posed by our external deficits  Over time, that depreciation should work  to boost our real exports, although for the forecast period the lagged effects of dollar  appreciation during 2005 are more dominant and the contribution from the dollar  diminishes rather than strengthens through the end of 2007  Dollar depreciation  should add somewhat to import price inflation this year and next  However, changes  in global commodity prices have been sizable and have largely determined the path of  nonfuel core import prices  Prices of global nonfuel commodities have ratcheted up  further in recent months  Futures prices for these commodities indicate some future  flattening, but lagged responses to these increases should boost core import price  inflation to 3 percent this year before some deceleration occurs next year       Our projections for the US economy, for relative prices of nonfuel imports, and   for global energy prices combine to imply a rate of growth for real imports of goods  and services over the remaining seven quarters of the forecast period that is slightly  greater than that for exports  With nominal imports currently more than 150 percent  of nominal exports, the resulting implication for the nominal trade deficit is inevitably  a further widening  In our baseline for this Greenbook, the contribution of exports to  US real GDP growth for the rest of this year and next is, at an annual rate, just a bit  more than 05 percentage point  The arithmetic contribution from imports varies by  quarter, in part because of the way real imports are seasonally adjusted  On average,  imports subtract more than exports add, resulting in a net negative contribution to  GDP growth from the external sector that is 03 to 04 percentage point at an annual  rate       I just cannot resist the temptation to make a brief response to your   comment, and then I will answer your question  [Laughter]       You know, one can approach a general equilibrium process in any number   of ways, and finding things that are truly exogenous to that process is very, very difficult  So it is   certainly true that the capital flows might be exogenous  However, my guess is they are responding   to endogenous economic activity in the United States and the way we are behaving  Trade is   certainly endogenous  Saving and investment behavior has some exogenous characteristics and   some endogenous characteristics  I take your point, but it is still nonetheless true that, even if the   rest of the world wants to invest in the United States, if we saved more, we would not have to   borrow just because they wished to lend  And our saving more would have an implication for asset   prices and exchange rates and incomes that would lead to a generally improved outcome that would,   over time, have a different characteristic than the one that we have observed  So no one exogenous   thing is driving everything else, and that statement is as true for the capital flow part of the story as   it would be to say that the current account is the driver and everything else is in response     We have very little information on inventories elsewhere  There are data   through the International Energy Agency on inventories in countries belonging to the OECD, but   they really do not tell us much, and, to be honest, I do not have them with me  The information may   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 20 of 167       be buried here somewhere, but I do not know that I have it, and I will not take the time to look for it    The picture of where inventories are is generally incomplete, particularly because the major Mideast   producers and the major emerging market producers are not reporting their inventories to the   OECD  The inquiry is unanswerable   Now an effort, of which the United States is very supportive, is under way to improve the   quality of the data in the energy markets, and that effort may some day speak to the question  Some   of these inventories may be in gas tanks next to factories or next to generators; some of them are   held in huge tanks in ports  The location varies hugely   All of that said, I always think that the risk premium in the oil futures curve must somehow   resolve itself the way you suggest, but it is not something that happens over a short period of time    The inventory behavior is strategic; it is not the residual  It is every bit as much deliberate as   anything else is  And so, as a consequence, when oil supplies seem risky—as, say, the events in   Nigeria of last week or the general situation in Iran—people want to hold more inventories  So   there may be upward support on that price until inventories reach the level at which people are   happy, and then the price might recede; but it is not as if that price increase is somehow a purely   financial phenomenon and has no economic consequences  On a fundamental basis, price is driving   that inventory accumulation, and it is consistent with the inventory accumulation that people want,   given that they perceive supply to be risky     I don’t have as good an answer for you as I wish  One of my concerns for   some time now has been that the forecasts I observed from other reputable folk, and   Macroeconomic Advisers is among them, do not contain as much deterioration in the external sector   as our forecast because I interpret at least one possible resolution of that is that they and others and   their customers are going to be surprised when they turn out to be wrong and we turn out to be right    [Laughter]  And I ask myself, “What are these people drinking for breakfast?”  [Laughter]    I have some papers with me, and I can give you a quick answer  Looking through to 2007,   so over the whole forecast, they have lower real imports than we have, yet they have a stronger US   growth rate, on balance, and higher exports than we have  Their dollar forecast is about like ours  It   has a small dollar depreciation in it  The rest-of-the-world picture is not as fully articulated as ours,   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 23 of 167       so I cannot really say, but I doubt very much that they have the rest of the world just growing like   gangbusters and that just explains everything  I have to assume that down deep they have   something structural in their model that is either some combination of less asymmetry in the income   elasticities on real imports versus real exports and/or more sensitivity to the exchange rate than the   roughly 1 percent elasticity that we have  How much is each of those pieces?  I do not know  Let’s   put it this way  The number they have down here for the annual average for 2007 is below the $900   billion in the nominal current account balance that we have already achieved  I cannot imagine that   anybody looking right now at the global economy thinks that we have peaked in terms of the current   account and that we are going to start improving  I cannot imagine why anybody would think that     I’m just going to waffle right from the very beginning  [Laughter]     I’m not so sure exactly—we will give it thought  There’s a fair amount of   literature developing about global capacity utilization  Is it defined?  We don’t talk, for example,   about capacity utilization in Oklahoma  We assume that if Oklahoma needs stuff from the rest of   the United States, it just gets the stuff, and vice versa  Why is the global economy any different?  Is   the United States small enough relative to the whole world that it can just do that?  That’s sort of the   epitome of the small open economy model whereby it can buy anything it needs at the going world   price and it can sell all it wants at the going world price  But if I take that model as my benchmark,   it really does that all through prices  It says that the small open economy can buy imported   products, resources, inputs, whatever, just by knowing the prices, and sells to an infinitely elastic   demand curve for its output   So it is certainly true that we have paid attention to things like global commodity prices and   global energy prices, as the activities elsewhere in the world have shifted global demand and have   moved those prices  It is no end of frustrating to me that the futures markets always say that,   however much those prices have gone up—or maybe even occasionally down—over the past so   many weeks or months, they are going to flatten starting tomorrow  You just get very little dynamic   out of those futures prices  No one is out there thinking about the global economy over the next   three years, looking ahead at this, that, or the other thing  On the other hand, we’ve talked about not   using those futures prices, and I don’t know whether on our own we have the capacity to do better   than those prices  So I’m stuck  But I understand the point, and it is certainly the case that huge   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 28 of 167       changes—supply shocks to the global economy—are in some sense part of what’s happening and   that they ought to have some repercussions for us  Partly, I think, that’s a little bit of what’s going   on in this notion of whether pass-through has declined over time   But we’ll give the subject some more thought, and we’ll see if we can come up with some   other sorts of indications, such as bottlenecks, as when the shipping industry was having problems,   whether it was just port congestion, huge prices on capacity, or something else  You could trace   back bottlenecks, and you could think about the consequences of them for the US forecast, say    But something that is more inclusive than particular bottlenecks for particular kinds of goods is a   tougher question     Well, again, over a longer period, I think we face a real energy issue as a   global economy  And I find it very hard to believe that energy prices are, in fact, going to be five or   six or seven or eight years from now where that far-dated futures price is putting them right now    But I’m sure they’ll go both up and down in between  And for the period over which monetary   policy is made, I can’t do better than what the markets are seeing  I am expecting that, over time,   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 29 of 167       the standard of living of many, many, many people on the planet is going to rise  And I’m assuming   that the rise will imply some overall higher consumption of energy per capita and that the higher   prices are indeed precisely what we need to stimulate new technologies, to stimulate substitutions in   all the right places  It will be because the economy is growing that prices of energy will go up, not   because the economy is somehow going to get in trouble   Other things can also arise  The political situation in China is by no means guaranteed  I   may be a bit more concerned than others about this subject, but I see no reason not to think that   we’ll have another bad hurricane season  I just don’t know why people don’t see serial correlation   in what’s going on with the hurricanes  Not only in the Caribbean but around the world, we’re   seeing more and more weather-driven phenomena owing to the higher temperature in the oceans   and various other things   But I don’t see endogenous weaknesses  I think the global economy in a very fundamental   sense actually has balanced risks—many of the worst shortcomings in many of the economies with   whom we trade, both financially and in real goods and services, have been fixed  I think the   conduct of policy is better, broadly speaking  I think we could have a very good five years  I can’t   put my finger on anything that in the next five years is inevitably bound to cause us a problem  But   I think that over some long period, as more and more people have higher standards of living, we are   going to have a big change in relative prices  And some economies are going to do a better job of   absorbing those relative prices than others  But the US economy might do one of the best jobs in   absorbing those relative price changes  "
7712,2006-05-10,"  On the international side, two major developments during the   intermeeting period merit some further discussion this morning  the rapid and sizable run-up  in global prices for crude oil and the significant depreciation of the exchange value of the  dollar in the second half of the period  Those developments occurred against a background  of continued strong global growth, with some economic indicators again surprising us on the  positive side for some countries  As a result, we are still expecting moderately strong foreign  real GDP growth at an annual rate of 3½ percent over the forecast period, with inflation  projected to remain contained although upside risks are a concern      When we finalized the March Greenbook forecast, the spot price of WTI was just over   $60 per barrel  Last week, as we completed the forecast for this meeting, that price reached  about $75 per barrel before partially retracing  The intervening seven weeks had witnessed  almost daily tales of woe of higher prices, with the supply problems in Nigeria proving more  persistent and serious than earlier thought and tensions over the nuclear program of Iran  adding to heightened pressures on energy prices  In addition, outages of US crude  production as a result of the hurricanes continue, as do issues regarding supply from Iraq and  Venezuela  Events in Bolivia have also rattled the energy market  As a result, and consistent  with the shift in futures prices for the rest of this year and next, we raised the projected path  of the US oil import price about $10 per barrel  As in March, that path rises slightly  through the end of this year and then is about flat in 2007      One significant and direct consequence of the higher oil prices is an increase in the US   oil import bill from that forecast in March  In the baseline forecast, the value of oil imports  has been revised up $34 billion for this year and $48 billion for next  As a consequence, of  the approximately $150 billion widening of the US nominal trade balance that we now  project from the fourth quarter of last year to the final quarter of 2007, just about one-third is  accounted for by the enlarged oil bill  The overall trade deficit is now expected to be about  6½ percent of GDP at the end of next year      A second consequence of higher global oil prices is that the revenues to the world’s oil   exporters have significantly increased  This positive change to the external revenue of these  countries has raised a number of questions about their propensities to import and from whom  and their decisions about how to hold the funds that they have received and have not as yet   May 10, 2006 15 of 120    spent on goods and services  Data on the portfolio allocation of oil revenues by many  exporting countries are sparse; in many cases, the funds are held by national oil companies or  in special stabilization funds, neither of which are likely to be included in reports of foreign  official reserves  Moreover, officials in some of these countries tend not to reveal detailed  information about their holdings  A case can be made that increased revenue flows to these  countries over recent years likely added to overall global net saving and contributed to low  long-term interest rates globally  It is still uncertain whether their behavior has had or will in  the future have a systematic influence on exchange rates       From US TIC data, we have some limited information about some categories of dollar   holdings that are current through March of this year  As was reported in Part 2 of the  Greenbook, inflows of foreign official assets in the United States held by OPEC countries  were quite strong in the fourth quarter of last year and in January  However, in February and  March those inflows dropped sharply, as did aggregate official inflows from other non-G-10  countries  For total portfolio inflows to the United States that combine public and private  investors, funds from oil exporters (including the Middle East, Mexico, Russia, and Norway)  were more than $25 billion in the first quarter—a pace comparable with that in 2005  The  $25 billion inflow compares with estimates of the net oil revenues of the oil exporters of  about $200 billion in the first quarter  Again, the monthly data show a sizable step-down in  the size of inflows after January  Among the oil exporters, there is some variation across  countries in their inflows into the United States  After showing positive inflows in the  previous two years, net outflows were recorded for both Russia and Venezuela in the first  quarter  In contrast, inflows from Middle East oil exporters, Mexico, and Norway were  strong  All told, although total inflows for oil exporters remained near rates in 2005, there  are some hints of possible diversification away from assets held in the United States by some  oil-exporting countries, especially in more recent months  I should note that these countries  may hold dollar assets outside the United States; changes in such holdings are not captured  by the TIC data and may give rise to entries for countries such as the United Kingdom that  are the location of major global financial intermediaries      We have only extremely partial data for US financial inflows in April, so it is not   possible to relate the recent sharp depreciation of the dollar to any pattern in such data  The  exchange value of the dollar fell significantly against all the currencies of our index of major  industrial country trading partners as well as against the currencies of Brazil, Korea, Chile,  and most other Asian emerging-market economies  This broad-based decline reflects a  significant change in preferences on the margin among at least some global investors and  may alter expectations of some of those holding large amounts of dollar assets  Over the  intermeeting period, US long-term nominal interest rates moved up nearly 40 basis points   But rates rose 20 or more basis points in most foreign industrial countries  Real long-term  interest rates taken from inflation-indexed, sovereign securities in Japan and the euro area  also rose about 20 basis points, comparable to the change in US inflation-indexed rates  A  significant decrease in the market value of the dollar with no evident change in relative real  rates of return on comparable fixed-income securities could indicate an increase in the risk  premium attached to holding dollars, or it could signal a change in perceptions of the long- run real exchange value of the dollar        May 10, 2006 16 of 120    Even given lags in the underlying relationships, the weaker projected path of the dollar  does show through in our forecast  For real exports of core goods, the drop in the level of the  dollar to date and the slightly faster pace we now project for real dollar depreciation imply  that relative prices will boost growth of these exports about 1 percentage point more over the  remainder of the forecast period than we thought in March, based on our model  For real  exports of services, the story is similar  For core import prices, our equations imply a  positive effect, concentrated in this year  However, when incoming data and other factors are  taken into account, our projection for import price inflation is only a little above that in the  previous Greenbook, and so the net effect on real imports is negligible  For real imports of  services, a negative effect from higher relative prices is evident in the baseline projection       For the nominal measures at the end of the forecast period, total exports are revised up,   but total imports are up more  The enlarged oil bill accounts for virtually all of the upward  revision to nominal total imports  As a consequence, the trade deficit has been revised to a  somewhat larger figure  That change is significantly offset by the effects of the lower dollar  on projected investment income  The lower dollar is positive for investment income as it  translates earnings abroad of US firms into more dollars  In addition, in our forecast those  earnings are directly boosted by higher oil prices  All told, our outlook for the current  account deficit is for more-rapid deterioration this year than we previously thought but a  deficit at the end of 2007 that is only slightly larger than we had been expecting in March   David and I would be happy to answer any questions       Well, as to the first question, we have not really done a lot to address this issue,   which you have raised with us before, but we are trying to give it some thought  One thing struck me over   the weekend, when Governor Kohn and I went to the BIS Governors meeting  Certainly the sense of strong   May 10, 2006 25 of 120    global growth was pervasive and more forceful among that group than I can remember for a very long time    So, if I had the Greenbook to do over again, I might push people to raise global growth a little based on   what I heard the others saying at those meetings   What we are observing in China is to some degree the result of deliberate policy actions that   Chinese authorities have taken partly to respond to the pressures they are under internationally  They are   seeking ways, ways perhaps not based on the exchange rate, to raise domestic demand in China  Among   their concerns about how to make that happen and deal with their own perceived domestic problems is the   issue of migration from the rural areas into the urban areas and the source of domestic demand arising from   the huge amount of population that remains in the rural areas  So they are looking to keep people at home   on the farms, so to speak, because it is attractive to be home on the farms, and they are looking to get the   people home on the farms doing more consuming as a share of the total of China   To some degree they have succeeded  Through various tax and subsidy changes and other   administrative means they have raised rural incomes  One thing we have observed is very responsive   behavior on the part of the Chinese population so that, if the attractiveness of being in one manufacturing   urban area changes relative to being in another, you see labor moving in response  Now that you see   something of a change, in general, between the manufacturing urban areas versus the rural areas, you’re   also seeing people willing to go back home or to stay home in the rural areas  That is a good sign that the   labor force allocation in China seems to be quite responsive to what we think of as the normal economic   incentives that a market economy kicks up  That said, it does suggest that the notion of a perfectly elastic   horizontal supply curve of manufactured goods out of China is a distortion and that the curve has some   slope to it  But, of course, that is what we want, so we shouldn’t lament that outcome   Over the weekend there was some interest in talking about how strong the global economy was and   how much inflation might be around the corner, not just here, but everywhere  Nonetheless, reported   May 10, 2006 26 of 120    inflation in China is down, and most of the variability in China’s inflation, as best one can tell, has been in   food prices  So what made Chinese inflation appear to go up was a food-price event, and what has made   Chinese inflation appear to come down is a food-price event  I’m not sensing that as yet there is a   consequence of, say, this wage behavior or this relative-incomes pattern within China, in terms of a very big   effect on the price at which the rest of the world can buy Chinese goods or on the availability of those   goods  But it certainly has the potential to have such an effect, and it is something for which we should try   to develop more sources of information     Well, it is certainly true that resource utilization in certain industrial countries—  Japan, for example—is moving in that direction  Even Europe to some degree is moving in that direction    For the major emerging-market economies of India, China, and so forth, where we have seen the big   increase in the global labor force that has been thought to lie behind some of the downward pressure on   wages everywhere and some of the flatness in finished goods prices, I am not so sure I did get a sense that   we are reaching some kind of capacity constraint   If anything, China surprised everybody in Q1  The numbers that they released are on a sort of Q4-  to-Q4 basis  We translate those internally and, therefore imperfectly, into quarter-on-quarter changes, and   so we have Chinese Q1 growth that is a 12, 13 percent rate  I do not see any sign that China is slowing    The whole debate about a hard landing in China is just gone  So in that sense, I do not really see that we are   hitting global constraints where it most matters   We probably do have a permanent terms-of-trade change—or at least an extended, persistent   terms-of-trade change—in terms of raw materials as a result of a change in the composition of global   May 10, 2006 27 of 120    growth, and I do not think the composition of global growth has to go back to being almost all industrial   countries with most emerging market countries barely growing  I do not see that happening  The countries   that have enjoyed terms-of-trade gains because they have commodity resources are probably going to   continue to enjoy them; and what they do with those resources, how they choose to consume them, or what   they do with domestic investment will become, I think, an important factor in this notion of global capacity   I do not have any real new news on port capacity, bottlenecks, or shipping rates; but since nobody   has been talking about these subjects for quite some time, I take no news to be good news, and I do not   think bottlenecks in that area have contributed much to what we have been seeing lately  "
7736,2006-06-28,"  It’s not a straightforward thing to calculate in some sense  The world   does seem to have two engines instead of one  That is to say, we would argue strongly that the   global experience in the late 1990s would not provide a clear, accurate benchmark for what we   would think today  China, in particular, has reached a status and an independence from the United   States that wasn’t present in the 1990s, and to the extent that it has achieved a certain dynamic in   domestic demand, in a reorientation of production in Asia that has very closely linked those   economies with China, the Chinese economy has, if you will, a momentum or a dynamic to it that is   not totally dependent on the United States and so could, indeed, continue to grow rapidly if the US   economy were to slow    Nonetheless, forecasting what will happen is a bit more of an art than a science because to   some degree, for example, investment in these economies, while it is measured as a component of   domestic demand, is undertaken with an eye toward export sales  So the interactions of consumer   confidence, of prospects for exports, and of relative price changes that shift the terms of trade for   some of these economies all have to be factored into the projection, and I’m sure we don’t get it   precisely right by any means  But I would just say that, at the present time, the extent to which   other sources of strength are arising in different parts of the global economy is, we think, an   accurate representation, say, in comparison with ten years ago      Yes, it certainly is     Why don’t I give an overview?  Then Steve can speak a bit about where   we think we are  The topic has obviously become of great interest  It’s cropping up in any number   of places, including the BIS  When we think about it, the first problem we confront is that we were   never able in the simpler world of ten years ago or so to get Phillips curves that were the least bit   acceptable for almost any foreign industrial country you could name  There was always great   tension in international meetings, in research efforts, in conversations that we would have with   central bank staff in some of these countries, and so forth to reconcile the way we thought about   inflation and the forces driving inflation because they didn’t think in terms of slack and price   pressures  If you go back far enough, obviously they had a lot of faith, somehow, in money growth   or medium-term things  The OECD has tried often—indeed, people on my staff have tried often—  to identify roles for gaps, in many of the European countries anyway  These things we call speed   effects—which indicate that what matters is how fast you’re changing (not whether you have a lot   of slack in resources but how quickly are you closing that gap)—always seemed to loom large in   certain countries, and effects of gaps were very hard to find  For example, the whole period of   Japanese deflation defies explanation in terms of a Phillips curve that has any kind of reasonable   properties, or the deflation would have gotten worse and worse and worse over a long period of   June 28-29, 2006 34 of 177    time, and it did not  So you’re starting from a world in which the links between capacity as we   normally think about it and inflation were never strong and never commonly shared across a range   of countries   Now we add a level of complexity in that we have a more-globalized economy  We have   had what amounts to a big, positive supply shock of labor, at the very least via the China-India-  former Soviet Union line of reasoning, and suddenly people are now making arguments and   estimating equations in which a global capacity measure is behaving better than I could ever find   individual capacity measures to apply in these countries  It leaves me in a bit of a quandary   I was in Basel over the weekend  The BIS released its annual report in time for its annual   general meeting, and I was lucky enough to find myself seated at lunch next to the authors of some   of the work  I said, “You know, I can’t imagine a variable that really captures what I think of as the   range of effects that something like China might have and China’s labor force might have on the   process of pricing in the global economy  You have this paper that you’ve written, and it’s reflected   in the annual report, and you have five different measures   ”  He basically replied that they   haven’t solved that problem and that the measures they used, in and of themselves, could readily be   criticized, but they got some results  He swore to me that they had beaten on this equation with   every possible negative rationale that would explain it other than being valid, and it still kept   coming back at them as though something was there   So I guess I am prepared now to look a little harder and try some of this ourselves, which we   have been pretty skeptical about doing  But there’s a big gap between the notion that there are   800 million Chinese who might potentially be engaged in global economic activity and the reality of   what’s determining prices in real time today  The fact that these people are potentially there but are   June 28-29, 2006 35 of 177    nowhere to be seen other than in the rural areas of China, growing their own food, just makes it very   difficult to think that one has captured something    So I am certainly sympathetic with the notion that there are key bottlenecks—there are some   features through the commodity markets or there are some other aspects within manufacturing in   particular sectors where you see global capacity effects  But disentangling the relative price pieces   of this story from something that might relate to the interaction of overall capacity and inflation is   very, very difficult  I think we’re just beginning to do that  In terms of this outlook, Steve may   want to make a few comments about where we think we see global growth and how that might   matter  "
7763,2006-08-08," From the perspective of the global economy, one of the  important revisions in this forecast from last time is the projected path for crude oil  prices We have incorporated into the baseline forecast a path for both West Texas  intermediate (WTI) prices and the US oil import price that is more than $5 per barrel  higher in the fourth quarter of this year and nearly $7 higher by the fourth quarter of  next year than was the case in the June Greenbook  It is still true, however, that the  projected path, based as usual on market futures prices at the time the forecast was  made final, is quite flat     The sizable jump in oil prices this time reflects the volatility that we have seen in  market prices for oil since late June, when the previous Greenbook was being  finalized Spot prices for WTI moved from below $70 per barrel at that time to a  recent peak of $77 in mid-July and again yesterday, following BP’s announcement  that pipeline repair in Alaska will shut in about 400,000 barrels per day of crude oil   Price fluctuations during the intermeeting period reflected market concerns about the  potential effect on supply of ongoing events in the Middle East, some disruptions to  production in Nigeria, and a slight reduction in output by Saudi Arabia, as well as an  awareness that hurricane season has arrived No doubt the underlying strength of the  global economy is contributing by maintaining overall demand as well  As of close  of business yesterday, the futures path for WTI oil prices during the remainder of this  year and next year was about $2 per barrel above the Greenbook baseline path   Clearly, further moves in oil prices are a risk to the forecast   August 8, 2006 8 of 158                      Another important element in the foreign outlook is the continued elevated level  of nonfuel commodity prices, especially the industrial metals  Metals prices are down  from their highs in May, but they are also up from their near-term lows in June   During the intermeeting period, spot prices for copper and zinc rose through mid-July  and then partially reversed their recent increases but since have moved up again  On  balance, metals prices are modestly higher since the time of the June Greenbook, but  prices of other primary commodities are somewhat lower  As a result, our projected  path for nonfuel commodity prices in this forecast is very similar to that of last time   The elevated level of these prices means that they will continue to have lagged effects  on US import and export price inflation for a time  The flatness of the path going  forward means that we anticipate that the implications for import price inflation will  abate noticeably in 2007, contributing to a sharp drop in the rate of inflation for core  imports  Further fluctuation in the prices for these global commodities is also a risk  to our baseline forecast   These developments in global commodity prices, both fuel and nonfuel, along  with other data released over the intermeeting period, led us to revise up some our  forecast for inflation abroad through mid-2007  We expect that the upward pressures  on inflation in the industrial countries will be felt in the near term, particularly this  quarter, whereas those in the emerging market economies will be evident later this  year and into next The revisions are small, in part because foreign industrial  countries have to date been very successful at containing the inflation consequences  of higher crude oil prices and several have tightened monetary policy and in part  because emerging market economies have continued to suppress domestic energy  prices, delaying their effects in the process  Some monetary policy tightening has  also been implemented by a number of Asian central banks   We continue to read the evidence for foreign real GDP growth as indicating a  solid pace of expansion, with the possible exception of Canada, where output growth  slowed in the second quarter We have fine-tuned our outlook for expansion abroad a  bit—strengthening last quarter and this quarter and lessening the pace just a little next  year; but the overall path for foreign real GDP is about the same as in June    Indicators from most of our important trading partners—for example, from Japan, the  euro area, and China—suggest considerable momentum in foreign economic  expansion at the present time     Global financial markets confirm a generally favorable climate for continued  strong growth, and many of the signs of increased risk concerns and heightened  volatility from earlier in the year have faded  Over the intermeeting period, stock  prices in many of our trading partners have risen  Equity price indexes in emerging  market countries, in particular, have rebounded from the lows of mid-June but  generally have not returned to the levels reached in early May  Other than in the  United Kingdom and Japan, yields on ten-year sovereign bonds have moved down  10 or more basis points in the major foreign industrial countries since your June  meeting, and spreads on dollar-denominated emerging market sovereign debt have  partially retraced previous increases and are not far above the lows observed in early   August 8, 2006 9 of 158                                  May, with the exception of spreads for Turkish debt  On balance, the dollar is down  just a little over the period   The bottom line is that the staff’s picture of the global economy implies an   essentially neutral effect of the external sector on US GDP growth over the forecast   period, although one must remember that there are risks on both sides to that picture    The arithmetic contribution of real net exports to GDP growth for the rest of this year   and next year is essentially zero—with a small positive contribution over the second   half of this year, unusual for us, followed by a small negative contribution in 2007 as   a whole Exports of both goods and services are expected to grow strongly, supported   by steady expansion of real GDP growth abroad  The step-down in US real GDP   growth should restrain import growth somewhat over the next six quarters    The nominal trade deficit on goods and services is projected to widen about   $75 billion from the estimated figure for the second quarter to that for the fourth   quarter of 2007 The change in the non-oil nominal trade balance accounts for only   one-third of that $75 billion This change in the overall trade balance is sufficiently   small that the projected ratio of the trade deficit to GDP is steady at about 6 percent    Nevertheless, the current account deficit is projected to exceed $1 trillion at the end   of 2007, and the ratio of the current account deficit to GDP rises from 65 percent to   7 percent next year A growing net deficit in investment income flows largely   explains the further deterioration in the current account balance  That change, in turn,   is accounted for by a substantial widening of the deficit on portfolio income that more   than offsets a gain in the balance of direct investment income  The financing   requirements of our external deficit remain large and will continue to grow as long as   the level of the trade balance remains far from zero  David and I will be happy to   answer any questions     If I could just comment on the worldwide aspect of your point, I’d say   that the one piece that’s missing is that globally we have not seen this inflation pressure translate   into an acceleration in wages and labor compensation—not so much here in the United States   and not in rest of the world Even in places where central banks are tightening monetary policy   in recognition of the inflation that they are experiencing in their consumer prices, one is not   hearing stories about an acceleration of wages     So there’s truth in everything you’ve said, and I wouldn’t disagree that it’s worrisome,   but we’ve seen huge changes in the structure of global economic activity  Those changes may   have effected significant changes in relative prices, particularly of energy on the one hand and of   other kinds of primary commodities on the other  We keep saying that those price changes are   going to end, right? Every FOMC I come here, and I tell you that those prices are flattening out   August 8, 2006 12 of 158                         starting this morning [Laughter] Then I come back six weeks later, and I say it again—and   that’s not lost on me   However, there is a question in my mind as to trend versus relative price effects here, and   I think there are surely some of both types of effects  It may be wrong to attribute the pressure   entirely to a relative price shock that’s going to go away immediately, but it’s certainly also   wrong to call it all inflation trend with no relative price component     I suspect that there is, but I confess that I’m not really able to give you   the details this morning  We have not attempted to do a major project of that sort  There are two   things that have to be immediately taken into account if you’re thinking about some kind of   cross-country, or at least non-US, look at this  First are the tax features  Many of the other   industrial countries have specific taxes, much higher specific taxes, on fuel products of one sort   or another, particularly on gasoline but also on other things  Those economies will experience a   much smaller percentage change in the wholesale and retail prices for any given change in the   crude oil price than we will  The shock is always damped by that on the upside but also on the   downside, of course So that’s a factor that we point to often, and that is why ocular regression   kinds of pass-through would make you think that pass-through is less abroad   August 8, 2006 15 of 158                             Second is the exchange rate effect If the dollar is trending down a bit, for a short time   anyway, it needs to be taken care of in the dynamics of the equation rather than in the structure   of the equation because we believe that the dollar oil price adjusts to global demand and supply    But for short episodes in particular, if one thought the dollar was experiencing a spike or a this or   a that, then obviously the changes in the exchange value of the dollar look to other countries as a   piece of how much oil prices have gone up for them  In general, many countries—say, Japan   and, for that matter, even Europe—have a sense that overall the effect is less because their   energy intensity is less They are constantly lecturing us that we consume too much energy    Whether, ceteris paribus, the actual parameter in terms of the price shock really differs I can’t tell   you, but the specific taxes and the consequent reduction in energy intensity that they have helped   to produce, and other factors that have made them less energy-intensive, do make the problem   seem to be smaller in most of the other industrial countries    I would say in a kind of notional sense that most especially China, for   example, has not slowed to the degree that we and everybody else had been expecting  There was a   significant positive surprise in the Q2 numbers for China  At the time we saw what we called the   “volatility” of May-June, when it looked as though some commodity prices were coming off and   the stories that they had been held up by speculators and so forth seemed true, and it looked as   though those prices might actually adjust downward and stay down  Well, that perception was very   short lived  The fundamental demand for some of these products seems to have reasserted itself,   and many of those prices are back up where they once were  So based on those kinds of indirect   signals, I would say that the strength of the global economy is at least what it was three months ago   and perhaps a tiny bit stronger    If the full trajectory going through the rest of this year that is in the   Greenbook takes place, then the United States is going to take the world back just a bit, and it will   bring Canada with it probably  At least that is what our forecast says will happen  We see China   August 8, 2006 20 of 158                                stepping harder on the mechanisms that it uses to try to slow its economy  In some sense, I would   say that the Greenbook picture we’re painting is that global capacity utilization is perhaps at a peak   right about now and that we anticipate the slowing in the United States and the efforts in China   certainly to outweigh the continued strength, say, in Europe or Japan, which is probably going to   happen  Still in all, that may be the mean of our forecast, but there’s a distribution around that, and   it’s certainly possible that there are upside risks as well as downside risks in those capacity   pressures  "
7786,2006-09-20," In the international economy, the striking development over the  intermeeting period has been the rapid and substantial drop in crude oil prices and in  prices for some nonfuel commodities  The spot price of WTI crude reached a recent  high of about $77 per barrel on August 7, following news of problems with the BP  pipelines at Prudhoe Bay Since then, it has declined to less than $62 in trading  yesterday, decreasing about $15 per barrel  The far futures price is down somewhat  less, nearly $10 per barrel, leaving a barrel of WTI crude for delivery in 2012 priced  about the same as a barrel of crude in the current spot market    As has been our practice for many years, we have assumed for the Greenbook  baseline forecast that oil prices over time will match those contained in the futures  price curve that held when we finalized the forecast last week  The timing of our  forecast this Greenbook and last and the smoothing from quarterly averaging results  in our forecast path for the oil import price shifting a bit less than did the spot price of  crude The downward revision in the oil import price amounts to nearly $12 per  barrel in the near term and narrows to somewhat more than $8 per barrel by the end  of 2007   Some other commodity markets were remarkably volatile over the intermeeting  period as well The spot prices for gold declined more than $60 per fine ounce since  the time of the August FOMC meeting  Many of the industrial metals also moved   September 20, 2006 16 of 132                        down sharply in the past week or two, but in some cases these declines merely  retraced run-ups earlier in the intermeeting period and resulted in only small net  changes   Regarding the implications of the lower oil prices for our forecast, it is helpful to  remember that our assumed price for WTI crude in the fourth quarter is near, but still  more than $1 per barrel above, the average price that prevailed in the first quarter of  this year, when we regarded oil prices as very elevated  In addition, the forecast path  for WTI now rises into 2007 and then is about flat at close to $70 per barrel through  the end of 2008 It also is relevant for constructing the forecast to ask why oil prices  have come down as they have  The new developments that triggered the reaction in  market prices seem to be importantly about the risks attached to future supply  Some  aspects of geopolitical tensions, such as the conflict in Lebanon and the ongoing  dispute with Iran over its nuclear program, seem to have eased  The Atlantic Ocean  hurricane season has pleasantly surprised, with fewer storms than previously expected  and none so far threatening the Gulf of Mexico  One factor that likely influenced the  price reaction to the apparent lessening of risks to supply is the high level of  inventories of crude oil at the present time  Current demand and supply plus market  expectations of future demand and supply combine to determine spot and future  prices plus desired inventories  With inventories already high, news that future  supply is less uncertain sharply lowered the price required to clear the spot market  and the premium that buyers are willing to pay to ensure future access to oil   Nevertheless, the positive slope to the futures curve over the forecast period suggests  that, on balance, market participants are not expecting future supply to be as abundant  relative to demand as is the case currently       With respect to the implications for our forecast of foreign growth and inflation,  we needed to consider the direct effects of lower energy prices and also to ask  whether actual or prospective slowing of global economic activity and, hence,  demand for oil and other primary commodities have contributed to the downward  shift in these prices On balance, our outlook for real GDP growth abroad generally  remains quite strong  However, we do expect a decrease in the average rate of  growth of foreign real GDP from about 4 percent at an annual rate in the second  quarter to 3¼ percent in the second half of this year and over the remainder of the  forecast period In both the industrial countries and the emerging-market economies,  the pace of real growth was particularly vigorous during the first half of this year and  contributed to continued strong demand for oil and other commodities  Monetary  policy has been tightened in response to concerns of inflation and overheating in  many countries, measures to tighten fiscal policy have been passed in some cases, and  officials in China have imposed additional administrative measures to restrain  growth Prospective moderation of the rate of foreign growth was a feature of our  forecast in August Data from Canada and Japan already provide evidence of a  lessening in the rate of growth in those countries  However, available data on activity  in the euro area, China, and Mexico continue to be buoyant     September 20, 2006 17 of 132                            In putting the pieces of the forecast together, we have concluded that the lower oil   prices are consistent with overall foreign growth remaining moderately strong and   will help to ensure that it remains so  At the same time, the projected pace of global   economic activity is consistent with oil prices remaining quite elevated and rising   somewhat into next year  We judged that the implications for foreign growth of the   downward revision to the outlook for US real output growth were partly offset by   some boost to foreign growth that we otherwise would have incorporated in response   to the reduced energy costs, although these factors differ across countries  As a result   and given data received since the August forecast, the path for foreign real GDP   growth was little revised on balance from that in the previous Greenbook      We have revised down our forecast for headline consumer price inflation abroad a   few tenths for the second half of this year and next as a consequence of the lower path   for energy prices We project that in the industrial countries other than Japan   inflation will move down somewhat over the forecast period  In contrast, Japanese   inflation is expected to edge up but to remain below 1 percent  Some   emerging-market economies in Asia still have controls on or subsidies of domestic   fuel prices, which delays any pass-through of higher energy prices into domestic   inflation Accordingly, we project that increases in global oil prices earlier this year   will push inflation in emerging Asia temporarily above 3 percent during the first half   of next year We look for inflation in Latin America to remain contained near present   rates    We see the risks to this forecast in many respects as balanced  We have been   surprised on the upside by the strength in foreign real activity during the first half of   the year, and strong domestic demand in some regions could push off into the future   some of the slowing that we are projecting  Alternatively, foreign activity may be   more sensitive to the US slowdown than we currently envisage  We feel especially   uncertain with respect to the outlook for oil prices, given market reaction to recent   events; the sharp change in prices caught us and the futures market by surprise     Although we are once again assuming that oil prices will follow the path implied by   futures prices, we recognize that a much larger move up or down is quite possible    David and I will be happy to answer any questions     To be honest, I don’t know of any real data that the staff can bring to   bear on this question We have some data on the trading contracts and who is trading, and to   some degree these data may shed light on a measure of how much of the trading is fundamental   and how much of the trading is, for want of a better word, speculative  But that’s just   nonfundamental traders, non-end users  I don’t know that such knowledge would tell you how   much of the price change is due to which sort of activity  My remarks this morning attempted to   highlight the fact that the endogenous part of this behavior is the price structure and the   inventory behavior that emerge  I think that there was an interaction in those things, although as   yet we don’t have real formalized models of inventory behavior that I want to claim any   systematic truth about  But I think that the volume of trading and the volatility it might induce in   prices does feed back to demand for actual physical product through the behavior of inventories    So although it’s also true that the speculative traders are adding to the upside and the downside,   they are eliciting a response from the oil producers on the one hand and, to some degree, from   the oil consumers on the other to change their inventory behavior  That also feeds back on how   September 20, 2006 19 of 132                            the price dynamics work  Right now, I think basically they are providing liquidity to this market,   but they may well be amplifying the swings—but I can’t put a number on it; I really can’t     Part of the difference is the weighting that they use  First, our number   is total foreign, whereas their number is world  However, the US numbers are probably below   average If anything, we should go the other way, although in the past it has worked my way    [Laughter] Second, we use weights based on US export behavior  We’re trying to construct a   September 20, 2006 20 of 132               variable that we’re going to then put into an equation or use in thinking about the volume of US   exports They’re describing global economic activity  So they tend to use GDP-type weights,   and we use US export weights That puts a lot of weight on Canada in our number, and Canada   is on the lower side on growth, relative to the average  In their case, especially if they use PPP   (purchasing power parity) weights—and I believe that they do in most of the numbers you see—   that puts a lot of weight on China and China’s growth and more weight on China’s growth than   we put That raises their average Thus, some of the differences are due to differences in   weights   Nonetheless, there is a real country-by-country difference in that we are on the low side   of their numbers—for example, for the euro area and certainly for the United States, although the   United States isn’t in our total foreign number  But were we going to put it in and mentally   calculate some kind of average, the United States would be a part of that story, and Europe   would be another part I guess maybe we’re just reading the current data a little differently    We’re not as persuaded that Europe is really going on a sustained growth episode  We have   Japan doing fairly well, but we have numbers in the ones and not any higher  So I think we are a   little bit less optimistic, if that’s the word, about the pace at which foreign growth will continue    We see the monetary policy actions that people have taken, we see the slowdown in the United   States, and we’ve got a slower picture for the rest of the world   "
7811,2006-10-24,"  Once again I find myself reporting to you that movements in  global oil prices are among the developments during the intermeeting period that  were factors in our deliberations about the external sector  Global crude oil spot and  futures prices fell further following our September projection but by differing  amounts over the maturity spectrum  When we finalized the current baseline forecast,  spot prices and very near term futures prices had moved down more than $4 per  barrel; futures contracts that mature at the end of 2007 had recorded price declines of  about $2; those maturing at the end of 2008 had price declines of about 50 cents   Indeed, for contracts maturing beyond 2009, prices actually rose such that the  far-dated contract for December 2012 had moved up about $1 per barrel in price  We  adjusted our projection for US oil import prices by amounts similar to these changes  in futures prices  The differential movement in prices implies that, even though  prices have moved down all along the path through the forecast period, this path now  slopes up more steeply than it previously did  So our outlook is for oil prices to rise  rather sharply over the forecast period, although from a lower starting point than in  the September Greenbook  The reasons for the additional decline in prices during  September and October include the return of production to near previous rates at  Prudhoe Bay, the absence of any sign of late-season hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico,  and awareness of current high inventory levels  These inventories are by their very  nature transitory; hence, market participants seem to believe that some of the current  abundant supply will diminish over time, leaving limited spare production capacity  and chronic risks to production in Nigeria, Iran, Iraq, and elsewhere  Late last week,  OPEC announced production cuts of 12 million barrels per day as of November 1   Although the size of actual cuts by individual OPEC suppliers remains to be seen, we  judge that significant cuts, albeit not as large as those announced, are needed for  prospective demand to be consistent with prices in the futures curve  Those prices  remain elevated—around the levels expected at the start of this year      We again asked ourselves how the substantial drop in oil prices since their August   peak matters for the US economy  As Dave mentioned, some of the near-term  variance in US real GDP growth reflects the path of real imports, including oil  imports  The nominal trade deficit is clearly narrowed as a consequence of lower oil  prices  We expect that the average oil bill in the fourth quarter will show an  improvement from the third quarter of $60 billion at an annual rate  The net trade  balance on nominal goods and services will improve by just about the same amount  as other trade components experience small, offsetting changes  As oil prices rise  going forward, the nominal value of oil imports should move back up; but for 2007 as  a whole, we expect that the total figure will be about the same as the total for this  year, followed by a moderate increase in 2008        With respect to our forecast for exports, we again expect that real exports of   goods and services will expand at an annual rate of about 4½ percent through early  2008 and then will accelerate slightly, to about 5 percent, over the second half of  2008  We see this pace of export growth as reflecting moderately strong growth of  trade in both services and merchandise  These components in turn reflect solid  average growth of around 3¼ percent in foreign real GDP  The projected   October 24-25, 2006 11 of 203    acceleration in real exports in 2008 reflects a boost from relative prices as US export  price inflation moderates  This projected pace of export growth is somewhat below  that observed in recent years, particularly in the first half of this year  To some  extent, the double-digit growth of US real exports early this year reflected rapid real  GDP growth abroad at that time  But our models cannot explain all the strong  growth, and a sizable positive residual has emerged in our model  During the first  quarter, exceptionally rapid growth of real GDP was widespread abroad as most  industrial countries and many emerging-market economies in both Asia and Latin  America recorded particularly robust real expansion       The rapid growth moved many foreign economies closer to potential and was not   sustainable over the long run  We read recent indicators of activity abroad as  generally confirming our expectation that slowing from those very rapid rates would  occur through the year  According to the data, among the industrial countries,  Canada and Japan have GDP already decelerating in the second quarter  In contrast,  the pace of expansion strengthened in the euro area; but with further tightening of  monetary policy and an increase in the value-added tax in Germany to take effect at  the start of next year, our outlook calls for a slowdown in growth there as well  For  the emerging-market economies, the most important news is Chinese third-quarter  real GDP growth, announced just after the Greenbook was distributed  Based on the  data and our best estimate of a seasonally adjusted series for the level of Chinese  GDP, real growth in China was at an annual rate of about 5½ percent in the third  quarter from the second quarter, following two quarters of growth above 12 percent   These data are only approximate as they are inferred from the annual growth rates  published by the Chinese authorities  However, it does seem clear that the measures  implemented by Chinese officials to cool the economy have had some effect  We are  projecting that growth going forward will return to rates between 8 and 8½ percent   Of course, the band of uncertainty around this forecast is significant  We judge  growth at that pace to be consistent with Chinese potential and acceptable to Chinese  officials  This picture of real output growth abroad is a benign soft landing  We are  projecting slowing that does not overshoot in many foreign economies, including  importantly the euro area, Japan, and China  We believe that domestic demand  growth in Canada, Japan, the euro area, and Mexico will continue to sustain their  domestic expansions and growth in the global economy and will underlie ongoing  moderate strength in US exports     With respect to the current quarter, trade data for August surprised us with the   strength of exports and led us to revise up by more than 2½ percentage points our  estimate of the annual rate of growth of real exports in the third quarter  The surprise  was widespread across categories of merchandise trade other than computers and  semiconductors and included strong exports to most of our trading partners, with the  important exceptions of Canada and Mexico  With no special stories or specific  components of interest, we have projected that real export growth will revert to its  historical relationship with foreign output and relative prices  However, the positive  surprise in August reminds us that there is upside risk to our forecast for real exports  as well as downside risk should foreign growth slow more than expected  Real   October 24-25, 2006 12 of 203    merchandise imports in August came in above our expectation as well  We have  accommodated that surprise in part by reducing real imports projected for the fourth  quarter, particularly real oil imports       All in all, our baseline forecast for the combined contribution of imports and   exports to US GDP growth over the forecast period is for a small negative effect  during the second half of this year that becomes slightly more negative through the  second half of 2008, reaching about 04 percentage point as strengthening US real  GDP growth boosts import growth above that for exports  David and I will be happy  to answer any questions           Well, I don’t know that we have enough detailed information to speak   definitively to the question of whether some capacity constraints were reached  We do see the   slowdown occurring, importantly, in the sector of fixed investment  That is, the GDP numbers   themselves do not give us real component information, but other measures of investment did turn   down in the third quarter in a way that’s consistent with seeing GDP slow  The timing of the   latest round of administrative measures suggests to us that we are seeing some effect from those    I don’t know that I would call it monetary policy exactly, but I think the bundle of moral suasion   and, to some degree, real actions that, in and of themselves, have some bite contributed to this    After two quarters of what we infer from manipulating the numbers as very strong growth, is it   possible that in some particular places capacity constraints are reached?  It certainly could have   been the case   From our attempt to turn the series into quarter-to-quarter changes rather than the data   that are announced, we certainly had higher numbers for the first half of this year than were   October 24-25, 2006 18 of 203    generally talked about  The released numbers were tens and so forth, and we had twelves    Similarly, as a consequence we had a much greater slowdown than the released numbers, and we   could be exaggerating both  Possibly it wasn’t really quite as strong as we thought in the first   half, and it may not have slowed quite as much as we saw in the third quarter  But it would be a   real gamble on our part to conclude that it wasn’t, at least in some important sense, due to the   administrative measures that they took  I don’t think the officials are so unable to have a   consequence with their policy tools, such as they are, if they are really determined—and they   certainly seemed to be determined  Thus I would attribute much of the figure to the   administrative measures, but we can’t rule out some capacity constraints here and there  "
7862,2007-01-30,"  If I may add a footnote—I think you also need to watch the pattern of   how inventories have behaved  When prices were being pushed up in the process from, say, the   end of 2003 to their various local peaks, the incentive to hold inventories rose  At some point in   2006, inventories were very high—we had basically filled every bucket we could find with crude   oil—and inventories feed back  It’s a dynamic  Price changes create the demand for inventories    The real-time value of inventories feeds back on the price  So I think you saw some of that   going on as well in 2006 in terms of driving the price versus driving usage  Purchase for   inventory is not well measured  We have inventories only for the OECD, so separating   production from consumption is not perfect because we can’t always capture the inventories and   they are measured as consumption in some cases      The net export numbers are based on trade data only for October-  November, and we each make an estimate of what December is going to be  Perhaps half of our   miss, or not quite half, was due to differences of opinion about December  Looking at what   they’ve done for December, we will take some information from that  Some of what they’ve put   in December is information that we didn’t otherwise have  To some degree, it’s statistical and   not really about trade  It’s something called a territorial adjustment  Maybe a quarter is   differences about things in December for which we are not prepared to change our minds at this   point  So we would not go to as strong a positive contribution from net exports as they go   because we retain some difference of views about what the December numbers will turn out to   be  The other bit of news we received was very strong exports of services  We’ll take that, and   we’ll probably give most of the adjustment, but not quite all of it, in the number we write down   next for Q4  We will actually want to reverse that thing called territorial adjustment in Q1  So   January 30-31, 2007 91 of 255    we’re actually going to make imports stronger and the net export contribution slightly more   negative in Q1 as a result   "
7886,2007-03-20,"  Constructing our outlook for the rest of the global economy this   time entailed assessing the information in and implications of varying indicators of  activity from different regions, the somewhat weaker prospects for US output  growth, and the backup in global oil prices  In addition, we struggled to understand  the likely consequences of the episode of financial market volatility that emerged in  global equity and credit markets at the end of February as well as the risks to our  forecast that this episode might foreshadow  In the end, our baseline forecast for real  GDP growth abroad is just slightly stronger over this year and about the same next  year as in the January Greenbook  Our projection for foreign inflation has been  revised up just a little in response to the higher level of our path for oil prices  The  resulting contribution for US real GDP growth this year from the external sector is  about neutral and that for next year is a small negative; we now see exports, relative  to the January forecast, as contributing slightly more positively to US GDP growth  over the forecast period and are projecting an arithmetic negative contribution from  imports that is a bit smaller in magnitude, especially this year       The favorable news for activity abroad was mostly from the major foreign   industrial countries  We were particularly surprised by Japanese real GDP growth in  the fourth quarter, which in the latest data was an annual rate of 55 percent,  2 percentage points above our expectation in January  Household consumption  showed some signs of strength—a development that has been lacking in Japanese  economic activity for a long time  In addition, private investment spending increased  at a double-digit rate  Available indicators for activity in January, such as machinery  orders and household expenditures, support the view that solid expansion is  continuing, and we have revised up our near-term forecast such that our projected  growth rate for 2007 is ½ percentage point stronger  The economic expansion in the  euro area continues to firm, and we were surprised by the fourth-quarter growth rate  there, as well  The 36 percent annual rate of growth recorded for last quarter was  1 percentage point higher than we had expected in January  That strength was due  particularly to investment and to export demand  We have revised up our outlook for  growth over the forecast period about ¼ percentage point as a result       Within emerging Asia, real GDP continues to expand vigorously in China and in   India, sustaining expansion in the region at an average annual rate of about 6 percent    March 20-21, 2007 19 of 196    We see average growth in Latin America this quarter as having been slowed by  weakness in Mexico that is related to softness in US manufacturing production    Mexican growth should rebound in line with the projected improvement in US  industrial production, resulting in average growth in the region of about 3½ percent  over the forecast period  We have revised down slightly our forecasts for growth in  Mexico and emerging Asia relative to the January outlook       On balance, we do not see the negative implications of the slightly weaker US   projection this time as outweighing the indications of robust domestic demand in  Europe and Asia  Accordingly, our baseline forecast continues to be for vigorous  growth on average abroad  A weaker US outcome than projected is clearly a  downside risk for the global economy, however  The rise in oil prices over the  intermeeting period erased some of the inflation restraint that the low January level of  global crude prices provided  We have added a couple of tenths to our inflation  projection as a result, with most of the upward revision projected for the Asian  emerging-market economies that are very dependent on imported crude oil     The heightened financial market volatility that appeared in late February was a   global event, with stock prices in several major foreign countries declining 2 to  6 percent through the date of the Greenbook and then retracing somewhat over the  past week  Credit spreads widened for risky credit abroad, including emerging- market sovereign risk spreads, and yields on long-term governments bonds moved  down in the euro area, the United Kingdom, and Canada as investors shifted to higher  quality securities  But in many instances, these moves just brought the particular  price or yield back to its level toward the end of last year  Although the drop in  Chinese stock prices on February 27 was seen on that day as a contributing factor,  market developments on subsequent days support the view that much of the concern  of global investors is directed toward the US expansion and, in particular, the US  subprime mortgage market  We do not see the market correction to date as a source  of significant restraint on spending abroad  In addition, the evident weakness in the  US housing sector has limited potential for spillover to economic activity abroad   Accordingly, we have strengthened a little our forecast for foreign real output growth  and reduced the magnitude of the net subtraction from US GDP growth implied by  the projections for exports and imports  Clearly, global financial market participants  are ready to react strongly to any news suggesting less-favorable outcomes on  investments  This poses a negative risk to the global outlook as the financial market  response to a negative shock may intensify the consequences of that shock for credit  extension, spending, and ultimately global growth  On the upside, we have been  surprised by the strength of domestic demand in some foreign industrial countries,  and we could be underestimating its momentum  In addition, a more buoyant  outcome for China is always a possibility      Last week we received data on the US balance of payments for the fourth   quarter, completing our picture for the year as whole  Although the annual total for  the current account deficit rose in 2006, the balance for the fourth quarter narrowed  quite a bit  That narrowing is due to a reduced trade deficit and a swing to positive in   March 20-21, 2007 20 of 196    the figure for net investment income  A decrease in our nominal oil bill largely  accounts for the improvement in the trade deficit, but the non-oil trade balance also  narrowed somewhat  The smaller bill for imported oil in the fourth quarter resulted  mainly from lower prices, although the quantity imported declined as well  The  balance on the portfolio portion of US net investment income was a sizable deficit  that widened about $4 billion at an annual rate from the previous quarter  However,  the positive balance on direct investment income jumped nearly $40 billion at an  annual rate as receipts continued to be robust and payments fell sharply  The decline  in payments was widespread across sectors and countries  The net result was a  positive figure for total investment income of nearly $19 billion        Going forward, we expect that the current account deficit will resume widening   from its reduced, fourth-quarter level and will reach about $950 billion, or 6½ percent  of GDP, by the end of 2008  We project that a widening of the trade deficit will  continue, with the oil and the non-oil components of the merchandise balance both  becoming larger deficits  However, a positive change in the balance on services will  partially offset the deterioration in the deficit on traded goods  The net investment  income balance should account for a larger portion of the current account widening   The positive balance of direct investment income should drop back in the near term  but then rise slowly to record a small, positive net change over the forecast period   However, the negative balance for portfolio income is expected to increase in  magnitude significantly, as our net international investment position records yet  greater net indebtedness  This increasing net indebtedness and wider current account  deficit will continue as long as the trade deficit remains sizable  David and I will be  happy to answer any questions       Well, it is complex  I would say “yes”  There are three things  First,   people find the statement Rube Goldberg-ish  It just seems odd to say that it is less than 2 percent   but close somehow, right?  If you mean 19 percent, why don’t you say 19?  Certainly criticism is   directed there especially  Second, the fact is that the ECB hasn’t achieved it  On this back page, if   you look at their 2 percent line, you’ll see that very seldom do they ever achieve it  That hasn’t   helped the communication piece  Third, in general the ECB had communication problems  I can’t   sort out those three, but I would say that my sense is that most people still see expressing it that way   as a weak point     The policy people endorsed it even though all the papers that they had   prepared for the conference didn’t     March 20-21, 2007 171 of 196      I guess they would think that they had put on a ceiling and that it answers   that question at least as well as any other statement that has a number attached because they have a   ceiling  The fact that they have not hit it is a different question, but they put it in place  "
7908,2007-05-09,"  The basic message from the rest of the global economy is that   economic conditions are favorable and appear likely to remain so through the end of  next year  Although small variations in the basically optimistic outlook are present,  real GDP growth in the foreign economies seems poised to continue at an average  annual rate of about 3½ percent throughout the forecast period  Inflation risks are  present as slack has been reduced in several foreign economies  However, we  anticipate that central banks abroad will respond further as needed such that inflation  abroad will edge up only slightly through the end of 2008  In this forecast round, the  staff had to contend with a move back up in global crude oil prices and further  increases in nonfuel commodities prices—shocks common to the whole global  economy  In addition, for the US outlook, we needed to take account of the  depreciation of approximately 2 percent in the foreign exchange value of the dollar  over the intermeeting period, as Dave discussed       We have recently revisited the question of whether we could improve upon the   forecast for crude oil prices embedded in market futures prices and have convinced  ourselves based on empirical evidence that we cannot  As a result, our projections for  future WTI spot oil prices and the average oil import price are shifted up and down  over time by fluctuations in spot and futures oil prices  This has been an “up”  forecast round  After reaching a peak around August of last year, global oil prices  fell through very early this year and then reversed to trend back up, but not smoothly   The upward move of oil prices over the intermeeting period was apparently a  response to the surprising degree of continued production restraint from OPEC and  heightened concerns about supply from Iran, Iraq, and Nigeria  The strength in global  demand for energy, too, no doubt provided support for continued elevated prices  In  this forecast we also had to take into account a deviation in the usual price spread  between West Texas intermediate and other grades of oil  Reduced refinery activity  has led to an unusually large accumulation of crude oil stocks in the Midwest, the  delivery area for WTI, and depressed its price relative to that for other grades       When we were finalizing the baseline forecast, spot and futures prices implied an   increase to our projection for WTI crude oil in the current quarter of about $450 per  barrel relative to the projection in the March Greenbook; however, this change   May 9, 2007 11 of 130    understates a bit the upward shift in overall oil prices because of the change in  spreads  These considerations led us to revise upward the average oil import price in  the Greenbook for the current quarter about $650 per barrel  We expect that over the  forecast period the relative prices of WTI and other grades will gradually move back  toward normal, so our upward revision narrows somewhat in future quarters,  particularly by the second half of 2008  The baseline forecast reflects the  consequences of these higher oil prices for the US economy and the rest of the  world  Turning points in the ups and downs of oil prices have an uncanny way of  happening at the time that we are finishing the Greenbooks, and such a turning point  might have happened again  Since the Greenbook path was set, crude oil prices have  moved back noticeably  If we were concluding our forecast today based on  yesterday’s futures prices, we would show an upward revision in the near term of  only about half that in the Greenbook  For 2008, our upward shift would be about  two-thirds of that in the Greenbook  The effects of this more benign level for oil  prices would be slightly positive for real GDP growth both in the United States and  abroad  Such a lower projected path for oil prices would also slightly lessen the  pressures on headline inflation rates that are a feature of the baseline forecast      Another element in the forecast worth a brief mention is the upward revision to   both core import price inflation and core export price inflation for the second quarter,  to annual rates of 45 percent and 55 percent, respectively  Prices for core imports  and core exports accelerated in the first quarter as prices for food and industrial  supplies, particularly fuels and metals, surged  Metals prices have continued to rise in  recent weeks, and the increase, along with the recent depreciation of the dollar, led us  to revise up our current-quarter projections  In constructing our forecast for these  trade prices, we base our projection of the commodity-price component on market  futures prices  Again, we have done recent work to see if a better alternative is  available, but we have concluded that none is  Despite rapid increases in prices of  various traded commodities over the past few years, the futures markets are implying  a path through the end of 2008 that is about flat for an index of nonfuel commodities   In combination with our projection for only modest real dollar depreciation and no  major changes in overall inflation rates here and abroad, such an outlook for  commodity prices yields a deceleration in both core import prices and core export  prices  Our forecast for the increase in these prices in 2008 remains low, at 13  percent     Although oil prices have been revised up this time, their projected path flattens in   mid-2007  This outlook and the flat projected paths for commodity prices and the  dollar imply a waning of the upward push to consumer prices that has resulted from  rising oil and commodity prices  Consequently, in the Greenbook forecast, only  limited further tightening by some foreign central banks is required to contain  inflation  That events in these markets may surprise futures traders and us for yet  another year with additional commodity-price increases is a major risk to our outlook  for inflation  David and I will be happy to take any questions    "
7929,2007-06-27,"  Aircraft are roughly 5 percent of exports     More like 20 percent of capital goods and 5 percent of exports     We have updated the elasticities since ten years ago  When you   first heard us nattering on about the unsustainability of the US current account situation,   we had perhaps a more extreme view of those elasticities  If you drop out the 1970s and   you restrict your estimates to a more recent period, you tend to get elasticities that move   toward each other a little  But the basic asymmetry is still there, and we haven’t   responded to 2006 in some specific way  We’re letting a little more time go by to see   what happens going forward  "
7955,2007-08-07,"  President Fisher, I have a tiny bit of information in that regard  Once a   year there are surveys taken of US liabilities to foreign holders, and they are done security by   security  We went looking for the securities that had been downgraded—by Moody’s I guess it   was, or maybe it was both Moody’s and S&P—in CDO packages to see if we could find them    We found a certain fraction of them in the survey, which meant that the others that we didn’t find   were not held abroad because the custodians didn’t report them as foreign owned  Of the   fraction of the securities that were actually found, 40 percent were owned abroad, which implied   about a 10 percent ownership of all the downgraded securities  Not all of the securities, but all of   the downgraded securities  A meaningful number—but not a huge number, not 50 percent, not   more than half, but a fraction—were in the survey; of those, 40 percent of the total outstanding   were what was held abroad  However, not all countries are forthcoming with what they own,   and it is certainly possible that the system doesn’t capture all foreign ownership  China, for   example, is very unforthcoming  But our liability survey doesn’t depend on their answering the   questions; it depends on custodians answering the questions  So I would say it’s significant, but   I think I come away from this information thinking that perhaps we are exaggerating a bit how   much of it is abroad     This survey, which we basically have received just recently, is dated   June 2006  So there is always a lag of several months to a year in the information that you can   get out of this survey  But the survey itself is very comprehensive     The financial market turmoil over the intermeeting period has   not been confined to US markets  In today’s financially globalized world, events in   August 7, 2007 21 of 136    one asset market frequently have consequences in other markets and other countries;  both the level and the volatility of asset prices abroad have moved with US asset  market developments  Equity prices are generally down, although not in China   Yields on long-term sovereign fixed-income securities are also generally down  CDS  spreads, corporate bond spreads, EMBI+ spreads, and similar measures are generally  up  With so much action happening in global financial markets, you might have  expected some major revisions to our outlook for foreign real growth and inflation   Yet with the exception of revisions to some second-quarter numbers because of  surprises from incoming data, the baseline forecast this time is little changed from  that in June      Two reasons for the lack of significant macroeconomic consequences in the rest   of the global economy from these financial events seem particularly noteworthy  One  is that there is no sector abroad in any of the major regions that corresponds to the  US housing sector and its direct ties to credit problems related to subprime  mortgages  The second reason is that we do not observe any telltale signs, such as  overexpansion by one or more industries or fragile household balance sheets, that  would suggest that some repricing of risky assets and perhaps some restraint in credit  creation would trigger significant changes in real economic behavior of firms or  households  The global economy expanded strongly in the first half of this year with  the underlying strength broadly distributed across regions and sectors  As a result, it  is in robust condition and is likely able to withstand the adjustment proceeding in  financial markets without substantial risk to continued real expansion or creation of  inflationary pressures  Of course, we cannot be certain that continued or more- intense disorderly conditions in financial markets will not trigger a negative  macroeconomic reaction, nor do we know for sure that problems are not already  present but are not yet visible to us  So we see the events of the past several weeks as  giving rise to an abundance of downside risk to our forecast of real activity rather  than to changes in the baseline     Despite a basically unchanged outlook for the rest of the global economy, two   elements of the international forecast merit some further discussion  global oil  market developments over the intermeeting period and the staff’s judgment that US  real imports of goods and services will expand at a rate about 1 percentage point  lower than we projected in June  On July 31, the spot price for WTI rose above $78  per barrel and attracted attention for having reached a new peak value  Although that  price subsequently moved back down somewhat, the spot WTI price was about $7 per  barrel higher on the day we finalized the Greenbook forecast than it was on the  comparable day in June  In part, the upward shift in the spot WTI price reflected an  unwinding of most of the unusual discount for WTI relative to Brent and other grades  of oil that persisted from mid-March until recently as a result of large inventories of  WTI at certain locations  By comparison, the spot price for Brent crude oil rose  nearly $4 per barrel over the same interval  The upward pressure on spot prices  appeared to arise from the supply side, with production restraint by OPEC a factor  However, although prices moved up noticeably at the front of the curve, futures  prices for oil dated later this year and early next year moved up much less; and   August 7, 2007 22 of 136    futures prices for crude oil in late 2008 and beyond actually moved down  As a  consequence, the oil futures curve returned to what is called “backwardation,”  meaning that the spot price is above futures prices, which tend to flatten out at more- distant dates  Putting all this together, our forecast for the US oil import price is  more than $4 per barrel higher for the very near term than it was in June, but it is little  changed over 2008  So the impact of higher oil prices on our trade deficit is limited   Whereas some upward push to consumer prices abroad might result from the recent  increases in crude oil prices, our expectation, based on futures markets, that they will  prove transitory means that few sustained pressures on inflation should result     Our forecast for the growth of total US imports of goods and services has been   revised down about 1 percentage point for the second half of this year and nearly that  much for next  The resulting annual growth rates of 2¾ percent in the near term and  3 percent next year are about 3 percentage points below the growth we are projecting  for real exports of goods and services  Although in the near term slightly weaker  projected imports for oil and natural gas are part of the story, further out weaker  growth in imported core goods and services largely account for the revision  For  these two categories, the downward revision reflects the changes in this forecast to  the projected level of the dollar and to the path for US real GDP     We have made some small adjustments to our outlook for the constituent   currencies in our broad dollar index that by chance are offsetting, leaving the staff  forecast for the rate of depreciation of our real broad dollar index going forward about  the same as in June  However, the depreciation of the dollar that has already occurred  since your June meeting resulted in a downward shift in the current-quarter starting  value for our forecast path of about 1¼ percent  That real depreciation works to  restrain imports of core goods and of services somewhat, especially in the near term   Parenthetically, it also has a stimulative effect on our exports of core goods and  services     The lower path for US GDP growth going forward is the primary explanation of   our downward revision to projected import growth  With US GDP now expected to  grow at an annual rate of 2 percent, rather than 2½ percent, imports of both core  goods and services decelerate more than in proportion, as our best estimate of the  income elasticities for each of these categories is above 1  Of course, the baseline  path for US real GDP takes into account the lower imports and the simultaneous  nature of the determination of GDP and its components  But the information  contained in the annual revision to past US GDP growth and the prospect of lower  potential GDP going forward was “news” to our import model and led us to make the  downward revisions I have just described  With growth of real exports of goods and  services revised up only slightly, their positive contribution to real GDP growth is just  a bit more positive  In contrast, the negative contribution from real imports is now  significantly smaller in absolute value  As a result, the overall arithmetic contribution  from real net exports to real GDP growth over the forecast period is positive at an  annual rate of about ¼ percentage point  Such an outcome would mean that real net  exports have contributed or will contribute positively to real GDP growth in each of   August 7, 2007 23 of 136    2006, 2007, and 2008  From the perspective of real GDP, a positive contribution  from real net exports is one very reasonable criterion for external adjustment, should  it be sustained  Brian will now continue our presentation       Yes  "
8010,2007-09-18,"  In the International Division, we, too, were challenged to assess   the avalanche of events and information that arrived during the intermeeting period  and to make our best judgment as to how these developments would affect the rest of  the global economy and the US external sector  One striking feature of the baseline  forecast that resulted is the difference between prospects for the industrial countries  and those for the emerging-market economies  For the industrial countries, the  surprises in the latest data were generally negative, and considerable financial turmoil  has been evident in the markets in the euro area, the United Kingdom, and Canada   In contrast, the most recent surprises in economic data for the emerging-market  economies have generally been positive, and so far there has been little evidence of  financial disruption in those countries  We have revised down total foreign growth a  bit less than ½ percentage point for the second half of this year and ¼ percentage  point for next year  This downward revision is due entirely to revisions to projected  average growth in the industrial countries       The foreign industrial countries are largely being spared the direct effects of   contraction in the residential construction sector so far  But they are vulnerable to  negative effects on the pace of overall economic activity from increased volatility and  impaired functionality in financial markets  As market participants have demanded   September 18, 2007 22 of 188    higher returns for risky assets and have withdrawn from some exposures, many asset  prices in Europe and Canada have fallen sharply  As in the United States, these  developments have had implications for bank balance sheets and earnings, as banks  have experienced calls on lines of credit or have taken other steps in response to  funding difficulties of conduits and other entities sponsored by them  Some markets  have experienced severe disruption, particularly European ABCP and a portion of the  Canadian ABCP market  Although it is too soon for us to have actual data on the  consequences of stresses being put on bank balance sheets, we think it is likely that  some constraint on credit extension will result  In addition, business and consumer  confidence could well be impaired by the general awareness of heightened risk and  uncertainty as strains persist in financial markets  We have very little historical  experience on which to base a projection of the magnitude of these effects  Our  downward revision of the forecast for real GDP growth in the industrial countries in  response to recent financial market events has been small, but we acknowledge that  recent financial events have been severe and have lasted long enough that they likely  will have some effect on domestic demand in the affected countries       Other channels of transmission from developments over the intermeeting period   are more straightforward  The downward revision to US real output growth causes  us to lessen projected export demand growth in our trading partners; for Canada, this  channel could be particularly strong  In exchange markets, the intermeeting period  has seen upward pressure emerge on the euro, with the dollar-euro rate reaching new  highs  This euro appreciation should weaken demand by other countries for exports  from the euro area  The downward revision of real growth in the United States and in  other industrial countries should, in turn, reduce demand for exports from emerging- market economies     Economic indicators of activity from months before August have also led us to   revise down projected growth in the major foreign industrial countries  In Canada,  both retail sales and real manufacturing shipments fell in June  In Japan, second- quarter real GDP growth has been revised to show a decline of more than 1 percent at  an annual rate, and industrial production and real household expenditures fell in July   In the euro area, some moderation in expansion is implied by recent data  Real GDP  decelerated in the second quarter, and a number of measures of business sentiment,  some of which contain responses after August 9, have moved lower  Taking all this  together, we revised down our outlook for real GDP growth in the foreign industrial  countries, with the change for the second half negative ½ percentage point at an  annual rate  Accordingly, we now expect that monetary tightening measures in those  countries this year and next, which we and the markets had been projecting in August,  will not occur except in Japan        The upward revision of our figure for average second-quarter real GDP growth in   the emerging-market economies from 6 percent at an annual rate to about 7½ percent  is indicative of the magnitude of positive surprises we received about activity in these  regions  The news was broadly based across Asia, Latin America, and other areas   Importantly, at the time of the August Greenbook, we had already received data on   September 18, 2007 23 of 188    China’s nearly 15 percent real growth in the second quarter, so the developments  underlying this upward revision arose outside China  Our forecast calls for real  growth in the emerging-market economies to slow to a more sustainable pace of  nearly 5 percent over the forecast period from the very rapid second-quarter outcome   We judge that, going forward, the upward boost provided by faster activity earlier this  year is about offset by the implications of the weaker outlook for the United States  and other industrial country economies, and so our projection for real expansion in  the emerging world is about unchanged from August  At this time, we do not see  sufficient evidence of financial stress in these countries to warrant incorporating into  the forecast restraint from credit channels or from confidence effects         We do recognize that there are risks to the moderately strong forecast we have for   the emerging-market economies  On the upside, with the pace of growth so strong in  China, we may once again find that the government is unable to put in place sufficient  restraint to cause a discrete step-down in real output growth there  However, Chinese  stock prices have continued to rise very sharply, and we see a possible downside risk  to growth from a bursting of that bubble with consequent effects on real spending  It  is also possible that we are underestimating the spillover of contractionary pressures  from the industrial countries onto activity in the rest of the world  For example, one  channel by which such forces could weaken activity in Mexico more than we now  expect is through reduced remittances  With the US construction sector particularly  weak, earnings of immigrant labor and remittances to Mexico could be reduced, and  the result could be a slowing of growth in Mexico by more than we have forecast      Another element of the forecast worth a brief mention is the price of crude oil    The price for spot WTI recently surged above $80 per barrel as recent data on US  inventories and some signs of hurricane activity led market participants to bid up  prices for very near term oil  However, prices further out on the futures curve have  moved down since August, and our overall path for the price of US oil imports is  little changed to down slightly by the end of 2008  With the futures curve showing  pronounced backwardation, the spot price is very sensitive to unfolding news  Should  a serious hurricane or some other factor threaten near-term production, we could see  an outsized reaction in the spot price of crude oil       With the shock to the global economy this time arising largely in the US   economy, it is fitting that we might look to the rest of the world to provide some  support to overall demand, some contribution to stabilizing global economic activity  in general, and some help in damping rather than augmenting fluctuations in US  economic activity  As we now read the evidence, such an outcome is likely this time   Strength in the most recent data has led us to revise up projected real export growth in  the third quarter  Although foreign GDP growth has been revised down a bit, thereby  weakening exports, the dollar is on a path slightly lower than in August; and relative  prices should provide a bit more boost to exports than we previously thought  All in  all, the contribution to US real GDP growth from exports should be somewhat more  positive over the forecast period than we expected in August despite the global  financial turmoil  If the Greenbook forecast is realized, net exports should make a   September 18, 2007 24 of 188    positive arithmetic contribution to US real GDP growth of about ⅓ percentage point  during the second half of this year and about ¼ percentage point next year  Brian will  now continue our remarks       The situation in the United Kingdom is an unfolding drama that is just   a soap opera in many respects  At the root there seem to be some severe differences of opinion   of what the right response is to situations in the markets  In the beginning, there was virtually no   explicit action by the Bank of England to counter heightened demand for liquidity on the part of   banks in UK markets  So the spreads of overnight pound LIBOR, relative to target, opened up   widely, and they were not addressed  They were allowed to just sort of sit there  The term   pound market had a problem, too  Of course, many of the dollar issues that we have spoken of—  and that Bill talked about—are really being captured as a London phenomenon  But you might   say that, from the point of view of the Bank of England or the UK economy, these dollar issues   September 18, 2007 31 of 188    are somewhat separate from the domestic economy  There is some truth to that, but also the   institutions are involved, the institutions have obligations, and the shocks to the institutions   reverberate back into the domestic economy, it seems to me  That process went on for a while,   and it is to some degree a function of the way the Bank of England manages its reserves and the   system of reserve market interaction that exists  It has, among other features, a monthly   timetable, not a two-week timetable; so even though the Bank of England operates daily in the   sense that we do, it ties its own hands a bit each month  Toward the end of the month in which   August 9 occurred, it announced that the subsequent month it was going to ease things just a bit   in response to a lot of pressure both perhaps from disagreements inside the bank and criticisms of   the bank  It has taken some steps to provide for greater flexibility within its existing system than   it had for the three weeks before the month turnover in August  Indeed, the Bank of England did   a two-day operation last night, or this morning UK time, which is the first temporary extra   injection of reserves it had done on this basis  So it is moving in the direction of introducing   flexibility into the market that was not there on August 9 and wasn’t there for some time after   August 9   I think there is a great concern in the Bank of England, or certainly in the person of   Mervyn King, with the moral hazard aspects of enabling the markets to solve their problems and   deal with the consequences of their own decisions by the Bank of England’s providing them   more liquidity  That lies behind some of his reluctance  On the other hand, we now have the   Northern Rock issue  That is somewhat distinct from the problems of overnight lending or even   term lending, in that Northern Rock has been questionable for a while, has been looked at for a   while, has been kind of talked about a bit, but has not really been on anybody’s radar screen for a   while  It is an institution that funded itself to an exceptional extent in wholesale markets as   September 18, 2007 32 of 188    opposed to from a deposit base, and yet it had grown to be a very, very large mortgage lender in   the United Kingdom  One might say that it is a bad coincidence that somehow Northern Rock   hit a turning point this month, but that is perhaps going too far  I think the fact that the wholesale   markets were disrupted had to interact with its business plan, had to be part of the reason that   concerns that have been festering for a while became acute, and so forth  The actions that the   Bank of England took with respect to Northern Rock were really from its lender-of-last-resort   institution-based mechanisms as opposed to market concerns  But they came out basically on the   same day  They announced that they were going to introduce flexibility into their reserves   management system, and a different announcement was all about Northern Rock  They got it   wrong on Northern Rock, quite understandably  That, too, was a function of their deposit   insurance system, which is now under review because it is prone to this sort of thing  It was just,   if you will, one thing after another, all of which are interacting     We have revised down somewhat our UK GDP forecast  In general, the industrial   countries are where we see the weakness  That economy was, in terms of domestic demand,   pretty strong  We think it can absorb some of this  But the set of factors is very complex—some   of them are deep and structural, like the way they do deposit insurance; some of them have been   ongoing for a while; and some of them are related to this crisis  I think the differences of opinion   among the Financial Services Authority, the Treasury, and the Bank of England aren’t helping,   the differences of opinion within the Bank of England aren’t helping, and the situation remains to   be totally sorted out     But, I have to say—as when President Fisher asked that question about   whether we know what we don’t know, to which, of course, the answer is always “no”—  [laughter] five days ago, I wouldn’t have brought up Northern Rock  So, I can’t promise you   that there aren’t—       The Spanish banks, for example, and the Spanish mortgage market are   places, if I were going to dig deeper and look for hidden problems, that are a possibility     I think there are some inflation risks out there  In general, Mexico, say,   or Brazil—some of the countries that target inflation—are operating pretty near their target,   maybe even a tiny bit above it  One of the pre-August but sort of persistent problems we have   been facing for about six to nine months, maybe even for a year, has been to understand food   September 18, 2007 35 of 188    prices  Why does everybody say that our inflation is up but it is food prices?  Sometimes it’s hog   disease in China, and sometimes it’s an allusion to biofuel issues or other kinds of one-off things   that you might see in some emerging-market countries  But the strength of demand in these   economies—and Asia is really operating at a very high level of capacity and at a very strong   growth rate—raises the potential for upward pressure on prices in some of these countries  Now,   China is obviously an outlier in this regard, right?  The numbers are crazy; the numbers aren’t   trusted  Again, the government says it is food  But if most of the food is domestically produced   and food is approximately one-third of the weight in their CPI, maybe that’s where you ought to   look  The most important thing you can do with respect to trying to achieve an inflation   objective would be to do something about food prices, either by addressing your supply-side   policies or by doing something about the rate of money growth or both  So China is a unique   case in this regard  I think people are very skeptical about some of the data  People fear that the   inflation problem might be even worse  It has always seemed to me that the obvious solution to   China’s problem is to let the exchange rate rise  It would solve many, many ills, including   lowering food prices and getting the inflation rate down  I don’t hold out much hope for that   In places where markets are more effective and where monetary policy works in ways   that look more like our experience in the service-sector economies, we are probably going to see   some monetary tightening continue to be in place  Some of those countries are experiencing a   little exchange rate appreciation, and that will help  But I think they are operating with as much   inflation as they really want  The industrial countries probably won’t be doing some of the   tightening that we had in mind for them and that the markets anticipated, but some of these   emerging markets—India, for example—need to continue tightening, and they need to be very   September 18, 2007 36 of 188    alert on their monetary policy  There could be some cases in which their policies aren’t able to   do the job or they don’t move quickly enough     In conjunction with the establishment of the ACF, the staff   proposes that the FOMC authorize temporary reciprocal currency arrangements with  the European Central Bank and the Swiss National Bank  These facilities would  provide dollar financing for parallel credit auctions for euro area and Swiss banks,  which the staff understands would be conducted in a manner broadly similar to that  provided for US banks by the ACF, which Sandy just described  The proposal is for  swap arrangements that would authorize the ECB and the SNB to draw up to $10  billion and $5 billion, respectively, each week with individual draws for a period of  twenty-eight days  Cumulative totals may reach $40 billion for the ECB and $20  billion for the SNB  The swap arrangements would expire after six months unless  renewed  The purchases of US dollars with foreign currency would be based on the  prevailing spot exchange rate, and the ECB and the SNB would charge their banks  and pay interest on the swap at the rate established each week by the US auction      These temporary swap arrangements are proposed so that dollar funding   problems now faced by European banks, particularly at terms longer than overnight,  can be addressed in a parallel manner and at the same time that dollar funding  problems of US banks are addressed  Improved conditions in European dollar  trading would guard against the spillover of volatility in such trading to New York  trading and could help reduce term funding pressures in US markets  Establishment  of these swap lines in parallel with the ACF could have broad, positive confidence  effects  Given the financial positions of these two central banks, the swap lines  would involve virtually no credit risk on our part  By providing dollars to the ECB  and the SNB to use in their efforts to address the term dollar funding problems in  Europe, we benefit the credit markets without ourselves providing support to banks  overseas        Well, the Europeans are going to impose a structure  It’s not “no   limit”; it’s the sum of the two     Could I add a couple of thoughts before you move on to the next thing?    The concerns of the sort you raised are part of the reason that the swap is being proposed at all    Consider just doing the ACF  These are duly licensed depository institutions in the United   States  If we were to create the ACF but to say that no duly licensed DI in the United States with   a foreign parent could participate, that’s a huge change in our national treatment policy  That’s   enormous  So without a decision to really change the way we approach licensed entities in the   September 18, 2007 137 of 188    United States, we don’t have a way of distinguishing foreign parent organizations from   domestically licensed DIs     I’ll leave that to the lawyers to decide  But I am suggesting that by   creating a swap, the staff had a presumption that the Europeans could work with the ECB and a   certain hope, if nothing else, that they would work with the ECB  Otherwise, with no swap, we   have basically put them back in the position that they are getting this directly from us     Right  "
