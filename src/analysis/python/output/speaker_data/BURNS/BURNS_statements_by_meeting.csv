4,1976-03-29,"  Gentlemen, we’re ready This will now be a meeting of the  Federal Open Market Committee, and we’re in executive session  I’m going to call on Tom  O’Connell to advise us on the status of the lawsuit    Thank you, Mr O’Connell  Are there any questions?   [Unintelligible] to conform to the Freedom of Information Act    Thank you  Any questions or comments?    Any other questions?    That’s correct    Very well  I want to make a comment on the Memorandum of  Discussion  Let me recall what took place at the latest meeting of the Committee  Governor  Coldwell presented a report on behalf of his committee dealing with the future of the  Memorandum of Discussion  We had a lengthy go-around, and the sentiment of the Committee  clearly was that, with certain kinds of modifications, [the] recommendations of their committee  be adopted  At the end of the meeting, I suggested that, while I was in whole sympathy with that  decision, each of us [might] do a little more thinking about the future of the Memorandum of  Discussion and we [would] take a formal vote at the next meeting of the Committee     The reason I suggested that was that it’s an important matter, and in view of the status of  the work in our Secretary’s office, nothing would be changed there, and the delay would have no  consequences as far as the Secretary is concerned  And each of us could spend a little more time  weighing that tentative decision     Well, I have weighed that tentative decision because I’ve [had some] additional  experience  In carrying through the exercise ordered by the court, and including now the  expurgated [edition] of our memoranda for January and February, members of our senior staff  spent a great deal of time on it, a very heavy investment of effort, and I spent 2-1/2 hours,  approximately, going over their decisions [I] disagreed with a number of them, didn’t impose  anything on the staff, but after a full discussion, we arrived at a consensus     We all recognize that the determination of what is a fact or what is not a fact is a subject  that is surrounded by great difficulty  But no two individuals going through that exercise with a  lengthy document before them will arrive at the same decisions  Now I differed with our staff on  one point--they included factual statements about procedures as facts--and convinced them  I  argued that what the court was interested in was facts concerning the economy rather than facts  concerning our procedures, and that argument prevailed with our staff     But, looking at the expurgated document, I became aware of certain difficulties that I had  not thought of previously  First of all, here’s a document, and the amount of factual material  [unintelligible] and I can see that [the] document is not going to stay with the plaintiff--it’ll be on  Capitol Hill before very long, and I can [imagine] derogatory statements that might be made on  Capitol Hill  “This is what that Committee [does]  They sit around, and they talk, and what they  know and the number of facts that they consider is very scanty It’s a talking Committee” And  that would cause some mischief     Next, I became aware of a fact that individual statements, you see, can so easily lead this or  that member of the Congress to ask for documentation, which obviously must exist, and  additional reports  Now, I recognize that the recommendation of the Coldwell committee would  reduce that burden and reduce that difficulty, and that was the purpose of that committee’s  recommendation  I don’t think these difficulties are going to be eliminated  I see myself,     3/29/76 - 7 -    unfortunately, having to devote a good deal of time after the Committee staff has done its  work--they’ll come to me with questions because there’s always a gray zone and it’s pretty large     I see also the very real possibility that after all of that is done, there will be individual  statements that will be picked up by members of the Congress, or members of the press, or both,  that will cause us additional work and, what is worse, embarrassment  And therefore, I want to  ponder this matter further     But two weeks from today, which is when I think the next regular FOMC meeting is  scheduled--    Three weeks from today, the chances are that I will be  recommending to the Committee that we do away with the Memorandum of Discussion and that  we expand the Record of Policy Actions, so that the public will be informed rather promptly, not  only of our decisions, but of the reasons for our decisions and of any shadings of views within  the Committee  Now, it means a break with tradition, but so does the sanitized version that the  Coldwell committee had recommended     We live in a new world, and I think we had better adjust to it  I have not reached a firm  decision on that--it’s a painful decision for me, but that is the way in which my thinking is going   I mention it now to you because we’ll have to reach a decision I say “have to”--we don’t, but we  should reach a formal decision at the next meeting one way or another  That’s all I have to say    Well, we may have a little more information  That isn’t going  well in the legislation  Our efforts to defeat it are not prospering  We still have a chance, but it  doesn’t look very good to me  Do you have any more detailed knowledge?    Well, we may have a change on the House floor  If we do, I have  excellent reasons for thinking that we could get constructive assistance from the Senate  conference     3/29/76 - 8 -     Well, I think that that is a complicated legal question involving the  FOMC, which Tom is still in the process of studying  Is that correct Tom?    Depends on Mr Coldwell, whether he wants to hear the  complications  I don’t  He well may, and therefore he’s entitled to    Any other questions?  Mr Broida has an announcement to make    Well, the one question that I think Mr Broida would be able to  answer is--now you send the Record of Policy Actions around to members of the Committee, do  you not?    And do you find many criticisms made by members of the  Committee?    Well, I would draw the inference that if the present [Record of  Policy Actions] were double their lengths, there would be more comments but it would not be a  huge burden on the Secretariat  Is that a fair inference?    That isn’t what I had in mind  Governor Wallich argued the case  for the kind of document that I have in mind  I don’t think that this Record of Policy Actions  should identify individuals    I don’t think my name or the flavor of each individual’s thinking  should be represented  Here is [unintelligible], let’s say we do it by symbols  Here is A’s  thinking, here is B’s thinking  Now let us say a member of the Committee felt that the Record of  Policy Actions as prepared by the staff did not convey the majority’s thinking or did not convey  a divergent sentiment that he had expressed clearly to the Committee He would suggest a  sentence or a paragraph, and I would expect the Secretary to adopt it  Do you have any opinion,  Mr Wallich?    Well, now, wait  His reason for dissenting would be noted if he  elected to [explain his dissent]  [But] isn’t that a privilege of a member?  He [could instead] just  vote    That’s right     3/29/76 - 10 -     But I think the sentiment would be indicated  If I were the  Secretary I would indicate that virtually all members of the Committee agreed that the economy  is continuing to expand; and to cover that individual or two [who disagreed], well, I’ll tell you,  the Secretary has great skills in that regard  And he has able assistance, and all of the cumulative  knowledge of the Secretary’s [office] is now in Mr Broida’s brain, and he would serve us well in  that capacity  We’d have more questions with the longer statement, there’s no doubt about that,  but I doubt it would be a great burden in view of the experience that we’ve had  Gentlemen,  we’ll break now and reconvene at approximately two o’clock   [End of executive session]   [Lunch recess]    Gentlemen, we are ready to discuss the study that has been  conducted by the Subcommittee on the Directive, on which Mr Holland serves as chairman I  am going to call on Mr Holland to indicate to the Committee where, in his judgment, we ought  to come out at the end  Now, we may or may not want to follow [the recommendation of] Mr  Holland’s [subcommittee], but if we know the thrust of [his] subcommittee’s recommendation,  then we can follow the discussion in a more informed way  So, Mr Holland, tell us where you  think we ought to come out today      I don’t know what that means, exactly The Manager has not paid  the slightest attention to RPD for many months, I suspect  Is that correct?    We can take care of that last recommendation at once--we bless  your efforts up this point and want you to continue    We can take care of the third, too--let the staff continue [its  investigations]     Now, the first recommendation, what does it really mean?  We have paid no attention to  RPD, and you are recommending a ceremonial burial and the announcement that a new regime is     3/29/76 - 12 -    being instituted  Wouldn’t it be wiser to separate these two? We don’t need a ceremonial  burial--we can just drop RPD, which has been so much excess baggage, and then announce  nonborrowed reserves after experimentation for several weeks or, preferably, several months    That is not our operating target--we use the federal funds rate with  a view to reaching certain [targets for the] monetary aggregates    Well, the Committee will have to debate that, but as I understand  you, you are not really recommending that we adopt the nonborrowed reserves as [part of our]  operating procedure immediately and use it at the Desk [but rather that we should] let the Desk  carry through some simulations, some experiments, and advise us    Well, I think you have made it pretty clear where we want to go,  and we’ll debate that later on And now we’ll turn to a member of the staff, Mr Kalchbrenner,  who will advise us on what the studies by our staff indicate concerning the relationship between  the federal funds rate and various measures of bank reserves on the one hand and monetary  aggregates on the other, and what that relationship seems to be    To guide me, how much time do you think you will need?    Well, you can have 15    Thank you very much--how good are any of these predictors?    Now, I’m accustomed to thinking of our monetary aggregates in  terms of growth rates rather than in terms of dollars An error of $3 billion--would that be equal  to a 12 percent error, approximately?    And therefore an error of $1 billion would be equal to a growth  rate error of plus or minus 4 percent?    And therefore--looking at nonborrowed reserves in table 3--in  seven months the error is about $1 billion, and therefore the error is larger than 4 percent  In  other words, you are shooting at 4 percent [and] you might get 8 percent--    Let’s say the error was merely $1 billion and you are shooting at 4  percent, and you may get, what, between 0 and 8 [percent] in what percentage of the cases?    Two-thirds of the time Well, what good is any of this?  Now you  take one, two, three, four, and five months of 12, the error is over $2 billion  And therefore if  you are shooting at 6 percent, that would be within the range of minus 2 and 14 two-thirds of the  time  You might as well throw it all away  Well, that’s life  I mean, why kid ourselves about  the [unintelligible] of the predictive value when the predictive value is negligible  Am I wrong?    What would that mean in terms of the Committee’s operation?  If  you go beyond one month?  We meet once every three months, we reach a--     What makes you think that your judgmental efforts produce an  improvement?    I’m not saying they wouldn’t--    I know, but you are implying that an improvement will result    I want to turn to another question--I suspect the bias in this effort  and I’m going to call the shots as I see them  On page 62 of, I guess, the second stage--    It’s the staff supporting document, and here is how it goes “Given  current incomplete evidence, it appears the federal funds rate should be rejected tentatively on  the grounds that, first, the relationship between the federal funds rate and the monetary  aggregates is not closer than the relationship between nonborrowed reserves or the nonborrowed  source base and the monetary aggregates”  Well, a purely objective statement would be, if  there’s nothing to choose between them, why reject a federal funds rate?    Well, you know I want to put this right on the table--there is a  monetarist bias, I think, in these documents  Now that’s all right if, first, there is evidence to  support it--and even if there is no evidence to support it, if that is the Committee’s inclination  But I would be inclined to argue that, just as the quantity of money has its repercussions on the  behavior of the economy, so do interest rates, and if we choose to ignore or minimize the  importance of interest rates, let’s do that deliberately and not because we have a preference for  the money supply  And I see, as I say, a definite bias, and I can read many statements in the staff  report that indicate bias to me  Now, your answer might well be that that’s the trend of thinking  in much of the economics profession, which I think is true  Well, interest rates have also played  a significant role in the thinking of the economics profession     3/29/76 - 15 -     No, I think the critical question is, do you put all of your emphasis  on the growth of the monetary aggregates or do you put emphasis on that and also on the  behavior of interest rates?    That’s right    Tell me, your estimating equations covered what period?    And is that a long enough period to give you stable results?   Especially in view of the intercorrelation of successive figures--serial correlation?    You did    Would you just be good enough to repeat that?    Well, now, on the matter of lagged reserves, the Board’s staff has  been working on that, and I for one have the feeling that we ought to make some change there no  matter what we do as a Committee  And your studies of that are pretty far along, Steve?    Well, now, your sample period is a much longer period than the  period outside, isn’t it?    Well, now, wait--that seems to mean that you have a  generalization with very little predictive value    Mr Partee    You’re on table 2?    What year are you on?     3/29/76 - 18 -     Why try to control something which has little predictive power?    Well, let’s put the judgmental factor aside  When you say  operating over a longer period, could you make that more concrete for me?  What do you mean  precisely by the phrase ""operating over a longer period?""    Yes, but I want to understand that  The Committee makes that  decision today--does the Committee then go home for six months?    Then I don’t know what you’re talking about  We are--    Wait a minute, 6 percent in what?    M1    Well, that’s what he’s suggesting    Wait now, what is obtainable?  The nonborrowed reserve figure?    I still am not grasping the point  I understand Steve’s comment if,  let us say, with regard to nonborrowed reserves the Committee makes the decision as to where  we’re going to be for the next 6 months, and in the meantime did nothing else  We don’t meet,  or we meet and talk about all kinds of things but don’t change that target figure, then I  understand Steve  But if we’re going to make adjustments month by month, then I no longer  understand Steve, and I want to understand    You’re going to have monthly adjustments    Okay    What’s the evidence for that statement, and for your saying  “probably”    How much less?    Wait a while, in the first two models?    How do you use the GNP projection?  Is it the absolute figure or  the increment?     3/29/76 - 22 -     Do you see the reason for my question?    What about the monthly model?    The increment, all right    Wait now  The nonborrowed base What is the nonborrowed  base--[nonborrowed reserves] plus currency?     3/29/76 - 23 -     What are the reasons?    Now, let me just stop you there [unintelligible]  How would you  characterize our practice over the past few years?    You don’t mean that the federal funds range would be done away  with?    Suppose the Committee went along with your thinking on the role  of nonborrowed reserves, and we set certain targets for nonborrowed reserves  Now could we  also have a federal funds rate constraint with the range of movement of the federal fund rate  being limited, let us say, to 3/4 of 1 percent, or 1 percent?    Well, now, how would that differ from the present procedure,  which is what we’ve done in the last few months, pretty much?    What I’m having a little difficulty with is, RPD is dead--it’s been  dead for some time  Now to say that we’re substituting nonborrowed reserves for something that  is dead, that troubles me  That either means  that nonborrowed reserves will be stillborn--and  you can’t possibly mean that--therefore, you mean something is going to be introduced which  will have life and significance in contrast to RPD, which now has none  It’s not that we’re  substituting one thing for another  RPD is dead    That’s true, but that’s just excess baggage that we’re carrying and  should have abandoned long ago; we haven’t done so, and maybe there were good reasons  But  it is dead, and therefore, you’re not substituting nonborrowed reserves for something that exists   You’re introducing something new    RPD is unfortunately misleading the public, because we’re  publishing that among our targets, and we pay absolutely no attention to it  Is that an  exaggeration, Al?    Now, in terms of the goals towards which you’re striving, would  this make sense, Bob, to drop RPD?  Just drop it henceforth, now, and not as yet adopt  nonborrowed reserves  Wait a few months, have some further study or indicate we’re thinking  of it, but haven’t yet arrived at it  Would that make sense from your viewpoint?    Well, but how can the Committee publish a nonborrowed reserve  target if the Committee hasn’t yet decided that that is a desirable thing to do?  Or how much  attention to devote to it?    Well, but if the Committee continues to operate as it has been  doing for some time, paying no attention to RPD and as yet not being thoroughly convinced  about nonborrowed reserves as a target--and your recommendation is that we’re not quite ready     3/29/76 - 26 -    for it, we ought to have further study and experimentation--then why should we put down such a  target?    Well, all right, then why not wait until we are used to it,  sufficiently used to it, and then adopt it as the target?    But now I’m thinking of our public posture  I think we owe it to  ourselves and to the public to drop RPD, since we’re paying no attention to it  But is it really  proper for us?  Might it not be premature to indicate that we have a nonborrowed reserve target  when we’ve reached no such decision, and are not likely to do so today, and when that isn’t even  your recommendation?    Well, I can see the Committee putting out a release saying we’re  dropping RPD, we have not found it useful, and we are considering substituting for it  nonborrowed reserves and some further studies are under way  Now that, I think, would be  completely in harmony with your suggestion and yet not involve a commitment by the  Committee or an indication to the general public that we’re doing something that we as yet have  not decided to do    But I feel somewhat uncomfortable, and I think probably all of us  do, in continuing to publish the RPD figures, which are sheer ritual, ritual that doesn’t even have  emotional value    Well, that’s another possibility    Yes, but Bob you have not recommended that this be done as yet   You recommended further study    Well, you know, if Alan comes and tells us week by week or  month by month what he would have done, I think it’s going to be very confusing, really  I  would rather think that we request Alan to take some specified number of months, it might be as  short as three--six probably would be better--and ask him to simulate Desk operations during that  period on the assumption of a nonborrowed reserve target and how that target might be set for  him by the staff, you see, and how we would have fared and what the difference would have  been  And in addition, to simulate over this period what Desk operations would have been like  and what the results with regard to the monetary aggregates would have been if nonborrowed  reserves had received a certain specified weight along with M1 and M2 in the Desk’s operations   Could you do that, Alan?     3/29/76 - 28 -     You say it’s not very good    Ah, well, without belaboring the difference, you would have him  report at every meeting, and I’d have him report after a period of months  But in view of what  Alan said, your suggestion is better than mine  That’s the way I interpreted Alan’s comments    Well, I think that’s a fair question    Is that necessarily true?    Well, I wonder how much difference it really makes  Now  suppose you have a reserve target, and to achieve that reserve target you find that interest rates  keep on shooting up at a rate which members of the Committee will find disturbing because of  prospective economic effects, and I’ll say nothing about your political science  What’s the use  of kidding ourselves--not all of us, I know, but some of us do regard interest rates as playing a  significant role in the economic process    Well, that’s one way of looking at it, and another way of looking  at the world is to judge what reasonable movements of interest rates are from the viewpoint of  our more basic economic objectives     3/29/76 - 31 -     Well, this assumes that we know, or have a way of knowing, what  rate of growth of the aggregates will produce optimum results for the real economy--    --and your argument seems to imply that we know that as far as  monetary aggregates are concerned, but do not know that as far as interest rates are concerned  I  can grant the second part of the argument without also granting the first    You know, each one of us has his own impression both of what  economic proof is, or may be, and also of Federal Reserve policy  I think that, as a practical  matter, we have been aware of two channels of influence on the real economy through monetary  policy  First, through the monetary aggregates, and second, through interest rates, and we paid  attention to both  I think that the Committee--over the years, we’ve made our mistakes, but we  haven’t done too badly  Sometimes the emphasis is shifted in one direction and sometimes in the  other direction  I think that by paying attention to both we are probably utilizing what economic  knowledge exists more wisely than if we put all our bets on one rather than the other     Now in fairness to your subcommittee, the subcommittee that you served on with Mr  Holland, you’re not ignoring interest rates, you have an interest rate constraint  But you would  allow the federal funds rate to move within a wider range than we typically have--for example,  during the past year  And second, in response to a question of mine, Mr Holland has indicated  that the narrow range we have had during the past year and many months for the federal funds     3/29/76 - 32 -    rate is entirely consistent with the recommendations of this subcommittee  I think you said that  Bob    Oh yes, not with the--the mechanism    No, I realize that your subcommittee would favor a wider range,  but as far as the mechanism is concerned and the accent that you think is proper for nonborrowed  reserves, all that could be respected and we still could operate either occasionally or invariably,  if we so chose, with a narrow federal funds rate range    Not that, we’ll get the right results because we’re lucky    You know, from the viewpoint of public relations, one could make  an argument in favor of your recommendation along the following lines  We have no way,  really, of controlling M1 or M2--the linkage between reserves and these monetary aggregates is     3/29/76 - 33 -    loose, and the multiplier, if you want to call it that, keeps on shifting and it’s unpredictable   What we can control is reserves, and more specifically, nonborrowed reserves  We set certain  targets for ourselves that we believe are reasonable on the average, and that is something that we  can do and we are doing  And we’re obtaining the targets that we have set, and don’t ask us to  do that which we can’t do     Now there may be a certain advantage in that in our public relations, but that goes very  much further than anything you’ve recommended, you see, because you still want M1 or M2 or  M3, and it becomes only a question of how you can best get there  What I’ve just said goes far  afield from that  nonborrowed reserves, the quantity we can control--we do no more, and don’t  ask us to do any more; we’re not magicians    What’s the trouble?    Plenty of intellectual talent that in--    Why would you have had to tighten, Alan?    I see, you’re sure of that?    Well, now, that may be the theory of the subcommittee  I asked  Mr Holland to advise us where he would like to [come] out  He made no such  recommendations    I don’t want to debate ultimates because I don’t know whether we  will even go to the first step  The Board [of Governors] still has a meeting, and we’ll have a  difficult meeting  We’ll have to bring this FOMC meeting to a conclusion very soon and I’d like  to come out with some decisions  Now let me, under 4a, make this suggestion and see if it’s at  all agreeable to the members of the Committee  Let’s accord RPD a decent burial, and a decent  burial would be to publish an article in the Federal Reserve Bulletin reviewing our experience  with RPD, and why we consider it a failure, and then review some of the studies that we’ve been  making of other reserves measures and indicate that there are other reserve measures that are  more attractive, perhaps particularly nonborrowed reserves, and stop at that point as far as A is  concerned  I give you that as a target to shoot at, to accept or to reject  Does that suggestion  make reasonably good sense to the Committee?    Well how long would it take to prepare such an article, Steve?    I don’t think so, call the shots as you see them and as the facts are    That isn’t necessarily a criticism of the Committee--in fact, that  may be evidence of the Committee’s practical wisdom  But you’ll have to write it up in an  objective spirit and not suggest that the Committee failed because of its federal funds rate  constraint, and be neutral as between that and between or suggesting that it acted wisely Mr  Gramley    Well, all right, this is what--     3/29/76 - 36 -    GRAMLEY  --which I take it is a view that most academic critics have taken  This is  very difficult to write up in print    All right  Now let me ask you this question  Can we bury RPD  without an explanation?    Well, I…I honestly have a very good conscience about all of this,  and I think that is true of the whole Committee    Gentlemen, I want to move along  Drop that suggestion about an  article in the Federal Reserve Bulletin and let me suggest that we just drop [RPD] and not say  anything about it  I’m going to the other extreme now  First is a full scientific explanation in a  scientific journal; the second is a very quiet death, we say nothing about it, we drop it    All right, does that suggestion meet with the--let’s have a show of  hands from the members of--    Yes, please    What you’ve said I think is entirely accurate, but it’s not a lie  we’ve had  You know, we’re traditionalists--    No, I don’t think there’s been any lying  It’s been just a failure,  you know we’re just a tradition-bound group, and it’s been a failure to recognize that, and I think  it’s negligence on our part rather than anything else  But I’m quarreling with you on your  language, not on your thought  There I have to be with you  Well, let’s face it, let’s have a show  of hands, do we drop now, say at the next meeting, with such a paragraph in the Record of Policy  Actions, or do we wait a few months as Mr Coldwell suggested  The first suggestion is A, the  second is B  Let’s have a show of hands of those who favor A   SPEAKER(?) This is drop now, Mr Chairman?    Just those who are voting yes, members of the Committee    Well, I think the majority of the Committee would favor that   Next we have the [unintelligible], what do we say, if anything, about nonborrowed reserves at  this time?  Now, let me make a suggestion on that  [We could] indicate in the Record of Policy  Actions that we are experimenting with various other measures of reserves and as yet have not  reached a conclusion as to which is the optimal measure  Would that be acceptable?    Same paragraph, or a sentence or two in the immediately  following paragraph    Well, we can word it so as to avoid that kind of confusion, that  kind of interpretation     3/29/76 - 38 -     Well, let’s first take the narrower sentence or paragraph as I  suggested it, and then we’ll add your thought  How many would favor doing that in the Record  of Policy Actions, indicating that we have been studying and are continuing to study other  measures of reserves for possible use in our operations at the Desk?  Simply a sentence along  those lines    All right  Now, next, let’s consider Governor Wallich’s  suggestion, which is to add a further phrase to the effect that nonborrowed reserves appears to be  perhaps the best of these measures but not say that it is or that we’re adopting it  How many  would favor such an additional sentence?    Well, then, we don’t do that at the present time  And we can do  that, you know, at the next meeting or--now under B in the 4A in our agenda, emphasis on  reserves as compared with monetary aggregates     Now let me ask this, Mr Holland, whether it would serve and be entirely in harmony with  the recommendations of your subcommittee if we now agreed that at each meeting of the  Committee, the Manager would indicate how we might have fared if he had relied on  nonborrowed reserves completely or in part  And we do that for several months when he gives  his report on operations at the Desk--that at the end of that report he takes a minute or two to  indicate what might have happened if he had paid more attention to nonborrowed reserves    But you have not been reporting--    You’ve not been reporting to the Committee  Now is that in  harmony with your suggestion?  Your second suggestion?    That certainly was Governor Holland’s suggestion, the suggestion  of his subcommittee, and I think that would give us all something to study before we come to the  meeting    Well, as to the scope of that appendix, at this stage we ought to  leave that to the staff without putting fences around them  Is that acceptable to the Committee?   Let’s have a show of hands    All right  Now as to the federal funds rate constraint, I would  suggest to the Committee that we do nothing about that at this time until we learn more about  this--let our thinking mature as to the federal funds rate constraint--and operate as we have been  operating  By that I don’t mean that we do what we did the last time, but that each time we reach  our best judgment as to what the federal funds rate range ought to be, and that we not try at this  meeting to decide they ought to be wider or narrower  We’ll leave that question open  Is that  suggestion acceptable to the Committee?    Well, the worst part of it is that we have a lot of private  methodology, individual methodology    Well, gentlemen, I don’t know how Mr Holland feels about this  meeting or [how] the other members of this Committee [feel] but I think we’ve made some real  progress  How do you feel, Mr Holland?    Well, I thought that we all had the impression that the public  pretty much knows that we’ve been paying no attention to it     3/29/76 - 40 -     Well, what about the economists that pay attention to money, do  they think that we are using it effectively?  Henry, do you have an opinion on that?    Look, we’ve got criticism from the monetarists no matter what we  do  It’s their destiny to criticize, it’s their place in life    Well, I think you ought to say the staff has been studying that  intensively, and you might even list, that is, indicate the range that the staff is considering  I  think, Bob, your concern is over the possibility that we may forget about nonborrowed reserves   That’s the way I interpreted your comment    Well, outside people are ready to leap in, they know all the  answers and we’re not that smart  Now, I do think that because Alan has now assumed a definite  obligation to the Committee--the report on nonborrowed reserves; what difference specific  attention to that would have made; operations of the Desk; and assuming that obligation at every  meeting henceforth--the Committee is not going to forget about nonborrowed reserves    Well, unless a member of the Committee wants to raise any other  question, I think we’re ready to adjourn    Well, then, I think that Mr Balles’s suggestion about the  somewhat longer time span of a few months ought to be explored pretty thoroughly, and that  ought to come before the Committee before too long     3/29/76 - 41 -     Well, as Steve indicated earlier, this will come before the Board  before the month is over    Three or four weeks from now, I think more so    Well, that fills me with deep regret  I’d like to see a monetarist in  the group  It’s hard to live in this world  But I think that we  owe a debt of gratitude to Mr  Holland, and to his colleagues--Governor Wallich, Mr Morris, Mr Balles--who worked with  him and also to our staff, who have worked very diligently, very imaginatively on this problem  for a good many months now  Well, thank you   END OF MEETING      "
26,1976-04-20,"  All right, gentlemen, we’ll get our meeting under way  As you all  know, we have scheduled a luncheon in honor of George Clay at 1 o’clock  And also, sad to say,  this is the last meeting that Governor Holland will be attending, and we’ll break bread with Mr  Holland at luncheon on the day of our May meeting     First item on the agenda is to take care of the minutes of the March meeting  Is there a  motion to approve?   SPEAKER(?)  So move    Motion has been made and I hope seconded  They’re approved   Now let’s turn to Mr Holmes, who will report on foreign currency operations    Thank you, Mr Holmes  Any question or comment?  Mr Black,  please    All right, yes, Mr Partee     4/20/76 - 2 -            I think it might be useful at this point, Alan, if you informed the  Committee a little more precisely about the safeguards we have taken in the case of the Italian  line    These are interesting facts  What is your interpretation of these  facts?    Mr MacLaury    There’s no takeout provision in the Mexican drawing, is there?     4/20/76 - 4 -            Any other questions?  Thank you very much, Mr Holmes  Now,  at this point a motion to confirm the transactions of the Foreign [Trading] Desk would be in  order    The motion has been seconded  I hear no objection  Mr Holmes,  do you have any recommendation with respect to--    Well, I think it would be useful, Alan, for the subcommittee to  take up the question raised by Mr Coldwell, and I doubt that we can make any progress at this  meeting, but I do think we ought to sit down, and we might even call on Messrs Volcker and  MacLaury--we know how to tempt the Treasury for assistance in our deliberations at the  subcommittee level  I take it that we have a motion before us to accept the Manager’s  recommendations    And has been seconded  I hear no objections, and I take it that the  motion is approved  Let’s turn now to Mr Gramley’s report on the economic outlook    Thank you, Mr Gramley  I’d like to ask one question  How do  you reconcile, Lyle, the Commerce figure of 7-1/2 percent annual rate of growth and physical  volume of the nation’s total production with the Federal Reserve’s more restricted measure of  industrial production, which shows a low rate of growth?  Now, I don’t think that is an easy  exercise    Well, that’s interesting  This has been my guess, that the  [unintelligible] may be that the Department of Commerce is now overestimating the increase   I’ve had the uneasy feeling for some time that our industrial production index is understating the  rate of growth    I think on that point, as Mr Zeisel suggested, were these  projections being made today instead of yesterday and the day before, they would probably be  higher, that’s point number one  Point number two, the differences between the several lines  corresponding to different rates of growth of M1 appear small as compared with the difference of  the 5-1/2 percent figure [for GNP] estimated by our staff and the 7-1/2 percent figure estimated  by the Commerce Department for the first quarter of this year  Therefore it is very difficult for  me to take these figures as being more than indicative of the probable direction intended    Yes, because you really are relying on a model that, during the  past 18 or 20 months, has produced poor estimates of the relationship between money and  economic activity    I thought it was 60 days    Figures I’ve heard are a 30-day leeway for the truck manufacturers  and 60 days for the automobiles    This is for real GNP?    What is your guess?    I think there has been a difference for some months between the  larger banks and the smaller banks across the country      Let me answer that  Nothing on Capitol Hill is done by  economists  [It] is strictly political--it’s just bad economics      There’s an element of truth to all things erroneous    I think we have gone as far as we usefully can at this point in our  discussion of the economic outlook  Let’s turn to Mr Sternlight’s report on operations at the  Domestic [Trading] Desk      You’ve done that?  Well, I’m sorry, I just haven’t read that    I just had some difficulty following the last part of your report,  and I don’t know whether others did  I may not be sufficiently awake this morning Yes, Mr  Coldwell    Mr Black    Mr Kimbrel, please    My guess would be that it ought to be done in one-month chunks;  otherwise you would be piling assumption on assumption--you wouldn’t begin to know where  you are  I think you can learn something, if, let us say, we do this for six months  At the end of  the six months, using the cumulative evidence of the one month’s chunks, [we might conclude]  that we would have done better had we relied on nonborrowed reserves to a larger extent     Well, that would affect our judgment with regard to the future  But, of course, it might be  better with that scheme for six months and then do more poorly in the next six months--that’s  something else again, but that is the risk that goes with whatever we may do     I would like to ask one question  If you had operated on nonborrowed reserves, do you  think that, considering the objectives of our monetary policy, which I am not going to define at  the moment-- I’ll let you define it in your own way, and don’t do it out loud, please--do you  think that you would have done better than we have done during the past month?  Do you have a  view on that?    Well, we will get a long discussion if we pursue that thought   Obviously, no matter what we do, we are not doing these exercises for their own sake  We are  going through these exercises in the interest of the real economy as far as employment goes,  production goes, and the price level    Or this might look a little different six months from now      Take the end result, the rising federal funds rate--six months from  now that might look awfully good to us    It’s a [unintelligible] to be on the side of luck    To elaborate on that point, if we’re to say, we ignore zones of  tolerance, and if we attempted fine tuning under our present scheme, I think the Desk would have  been raising the federal funds rate a week or so before [unintelligible]   SPEAKER(?)  Very recently, very recently  But not the most [unintelligible] period    Well, I think we’ve entered the wrong possibilities     Let me ask you this question  In operating through this simulation  exercise on nonborrowed reserves, did you allow for a zone of tolerance, if my question makes  any sense?  What I am trying to say is that the two methods [unintelligible] should be  comparable, and if one [method] allows for a range of tolerance, then so should the other    I think there’s a technical point here that we ought not to try to  unravel  It does seem to me that there may be a flaw in the comparison  That kind of  hypothetical exercise could logically be compared with the method that we have been operating  under without the zone of indifference  Engaging in [unintelligible]   SPEAKER(?)  I think that’s right    I think this is something that members of the staff ought to discuss  and perhaps revise the estimating procedure that you engaged in  Or you might reach the  decision that you are just going to try  But I don’t think we ought to pursue that here any further   Any other questions?  Thank you Mr Sternlight  A motion to confirm the transactions of the  Domestic Desk will now be in order   SPEAKER(?)  So moved   SPEAKER(?)  Seconded    We want to turn now to our longer-run targets, and I want to say  something on the subject before we turn to a discussion       4/20/76 - 19 -           As I believe the members of the Committee know, we must testify once again on the  subject, and the testimony is now scheduled before the Senate Banking Committee on May 3  At  that time we will need to announce our prospective monetary ranges for the year starting in the  second quarter of 1976, and we’ll have to reach a decision on that at this meeting  I’d like to  review with you some of considerations that will bear on our decision as I see it, and I’ll make a  recommendation to the Committee  But first a few words by way of introduction     One year has now elapsed since, acting under House Concurrent Resolution 133, we first  announced our expected monetary ranges  Looking back over the past year, we’ve come rather  close to the monetary ranges that we announced last year  Between March of 1975 and March of  this year, M1 grew by 5 percent, [whereas] our announced range for M1 was 5 to 7-1/2 percent;  M2 grew by 94 percent, and our announced range was 8-1/2 to 10-1/2 percent; and M3 grew by  121 percent, and our announced range was 10 to 12 percent  So, M1 was at the lower end of the  range, M3 at the upper end, and M2 close to the middle of the range  And therefore a fair  conclusion I think would be that we’ve done reasonably well  We’re meeting our own  expectations as of a year ago     That, however--and we must always remind ourselves of this--is no cause for self- congratulations  The congressional resolution recognizes clearly that we, members of this  Committee, must feel free to modify our goals and that we may do so at any time  The  congressional resolution recognizes that our objective is and must be the good performance of  the economy, not the achievement of this or that predetermined monetary magnitude  And if we  judge ourselves by that criterion, namely, the performance of the economy, as I think we should,  we could all take some satisfaction from the way in which monetary policy was conducted  during the past year     Now another word or two by way of introduction  Since March 1975, we have changed  our monetary ranges to some degree  Last October we reduced the lower limit of M2 from 8-1/2  to 7-1/2 percent, and at the same time we reduced the lower limit of M3 from 10 percent to  9 percent, and this January we made another change--we reduced the lower limit of M1 from  5 percent to 4-1/2 percent  So during the past year we have made three changes and all in the  direction of lowering the lower limit, with the consequence that our ranges have become wider,  and they were not narrow to begin with     The question before us is, of course, where do we go from here, and let me comment first  on M1, which, to my judgment unfortunately, is still the monetary magnitude that is followed  most closely--a fact that we cannot ignore  There are several considerations, I believe, that point  to the desirability of lowering our range for growth in M1  One fact, of course, is that the  expansion is now one year old, and we’re looking another year ahead  Therefore, we are looking  to a point in time that is two years away from the trough of the recession  One could reasonably  argue, and I would, that some moderation of monetary stimulus would appear desirable if  inflationary pressures during the coming year are to be kept under reasonable control     A second consideration pointing to the desirability for lowering the range [for M1] is that  we’ve said all along, often to ourselves and at times to the general public, that our longer-range  objective on the price front, looking beyond the [coming] year, is for a return to general price  stability  And being in the more advanced stage of the expansion, this may well be an opportune     4/20/76 - 20 -           time to take [a] small step toward the goal of returning [growth of] our monetary aggregates to a  level that is consistent with general price stability     That magnitude is variously estimated and, without discussing the matter in any detail,  we’re well above any such magnitude with the M1 figure  Even ignoring changes in financial  technology that would be consistent with general price stability, it is probably in the range of 1 to  2 percent and, in my own judgment, closer to 1 percent than to 2 percent     There is still a third reason for lowering the expected range of growth for M1, as follows   During the past six to nine months, the growth of M1 has in fact been even lower than the lower  limit of our present range for M1, and the growth that we’ve had has clearly been sufficient to  finance a good economic recovery  So it appears that the rate of growth that is needed to finance  a good economic recovery has been overestimated, and this is the subject that our staff has  commented on at some length, and this is a matter that we’ve testified on at congressional  hearings     But the arguments do not all point in one direction  I think that several cogent arguments  can also be advanced for leaving the range of M1 where it now is, or possibly even raising it   One argument pointing to such a conclusion would be that unemployment is still very high, and  those inflationary pressures perhaps have eroded, and that any lowering of the range for M1 at  this time would be premature     A second argument that could be advanced to support such a conclusion would be that we  cannot be certain that the demand for M1 will continue to decline relative to GNP or economic  activity at large, and that a reversal is in fact possible   Still a third argument that could be advanced in favor of leaving the range [for M1] where  it is or possibly even raising it might well be that we’ve experienced low rates of growth of M1  during the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year, rates of growth well below  our expected range  We therefore may wish to compensate for the relatively low rates of growth  in the immediately preceding quarters     Now these are the considerations, pro and con, as I see them, and there will be others  On  balance, as I see this problem, I believe the case is stronger for lowering the range of M1 than for  leaving it unchanged or raising it, but I also believe that the reduction should be small, and I  would suggest to the Committee that we merely reduce the upper limit of M1  In other words,  the range of growth that we announce would be 4-1/2 to 7 percent instead of 4-1/2 to  7-1/2 percent, which it is at the present time or which it was when we last made our  determination  The change that I suggest, while small, would in my judgment justify and help to  reinforce the widespread confidence that the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy now enjoys in  our country     On the one hand, it would mean that we remain mindful of the need to prevent a  resurgence of inflation and that we are working gradually, very responsibly, toward a restoration  of general price stability  At the same time, the modest change that I recommend would also  mean that we are willing to tolerate for the next year a rate of growth that may be as high as  7 percent in M1  This rate of growth is well above anything that we have experienced during the     4/20/76 - 21 -           past two years, so I see no reason why, if we announce a range of 4-1/2 to 7, anyone should be  concerned about a shortage of money or credit developing during the coming year     So much for M1  Now let me turn much more briefly to M2  I would be inclined also to  lower the upper limit of M2 by, again, 1/2 percentage point, and some of the reasoning that I  have gone through about M1 carries over M2  But beyond that and more specifically, I would  point out that experience during the past year indicates that we simply have not needed as much  scope at the upper end of the M2 range as we’ve allowed in our projections     Turning to M3, there, perhaps a bit paradoxically, I would leave it alone, leave it where it  is, for two reasons  First, in contrast with M2, we have actually used in full the upper end of the  range for M3  In fact, we have exceeded it slightly, but there is another reason that I think  deserves some weight  M3 contains, as you know, the deposits of the thrift institutions, and if  we lower the range or lower the upper end of the range for M3, that is bound to lead to some  interpretation and speculation  People are bound to say, I believe, that we at the Federal Reserve  expect the flow of funds to our thrift institutions to be reduced  because we expect market  interest rates to rise, so that incipient forces of disintermediation would be released     Now some of our critics, and we have one or two in our country, would stop there, but  some might go on and say that not only do we expect market interest rates to rise but, since we at  the Federal Reserve control interest rates, we are planning to make them rise  I would find such  an interpretation troublesome at a time of tranquility as far as the Federal Reserve is concerned     So by way of summary I would recommend that we announce at the May 3 hearing a range  of 4-1/2 to 7 for M1; a range of 7-1/2 to 10 for M2; and a range of 9 to 12, as it now is, for M3   And I’ve taken longer than I perhaps should have but this is a highly important subject, not an  easy one, and I thought we might save time in the end if I ran through some of the major factors  that bear on our decision, just as I see them  Now let’s turn to a discussion  Mr Coldwell    Thank you, Mr Coldwell  Let me comment on the range  We’ve  been criticized a bit, and I think really fairly, for making the range 3 percentage points last time,  though we had our reasons  We wanted to move gradually, that was the main reason, but the fact  is that in the process of moving gradually, the range was widened  I think some of us, at least,  recognize that as a cost that we on balance were prepared to face  You see, in determining the  range of growth for M1, I think that we have typically, at least in recent months, taken a range of  4 percentage points  Is that correct Mr Holmes, Mr Sternlight?    Well, now, if a range of 4 percentage points is proper for a two- month period, then a range of 2-1/2 percentage points is, if anything, on the high side for a full  year  I believe that is a reasonable statement  [Unintelligible] empirical tests that our staff has  made  Is that correct, Steve?    Well, I think that’s the comment I had  Mr Eastburn, and then  Mr Wallich    That would mean that we’ve lost all interest in home building   That would be a sin  Mr Wallich now, please    Thank you, Mr Wallich  Mr Mayo now, please    Thank you, Mr Mayo  I just want to comment on your technical  point  I think that the best reading of House Concurrent Resolution 133 is that we are to make  our projection for a 12-month period  Now, if you’re not changing the base in a systematic  way--that is, [you are] looking 12 months ahead, and so you have to take as your base where you  happen to be--I think that has two advantages  First, I believe it conforms best to the language of  the resolution  Second, if we deviate from that rule, then you can be charged with manipulation,  and a whole new flood of criticism may come our way  Now, this way, our critics may charge  that we are stupid, but at least we’re stupid in a consistent way, we’re not manipulating     And in this post-Watergate environment, where one is so eager to jump to accusations of  manipulation on anything that even remotely smacks of that nature, I think we must absolutely  avoid [anything that] is susceptible to that kind of interpretation  Well, thank you for your  suggestion, and now Mr Kimbrel    Well, thank you Mr Kimbrel  Perhaps we might break for coffee  now, and then return to this subject--    [Coffee break]    We’re ready to resume our discussion, and let’s hear now from  Mr Gardner    Thank you, Mr Gardner  Mr Jackson now, please     4/20/76 - 25 -            Thank you, Mr Jackson  Mr Partee now, please    Your figure of 7-1/2 percent was a year-over-year comparison    Could be lower    Thank you, Mr Partee  Mr Black now, please    Thank you, Mr Black  Mr Holland now, please      Thank you, Mr Holland  I’d like to say a word about the credit  proxy  I didn’t comment on that at all  I made no recommendation to the Committee because I  didn’t have enough time to study the matter, and I think it’s a difficult question  We’ve been so  wide of the mark in the credit proxy that even the continuance of it is somewhat in doubt, and  that opinion has been expressed around this table  The main reason for continuing with the  credit proxy is that we want to indicate to the congressional committee and to the general public  that we’re not only concerned with the money supply but also with the amount of credit that is  extended by the banking system     Now I would suggest that we handle the credit proxy as follows  After we reach our  decision about the three Ms, let our staff go to work on that and make its recommendation  And  then a subcommittee of this Committee--perhaps consisting of the Chairman, the Vice Chairman  of this Committee, and Mr Gardner--could work with the staff and then accept or modify [the  staff recommendation] on behalf of the Committee  We’ll discuss this proposal later on   Because you may be right, Mr Holland, saying we ought to leave it    You’ve studied it  I haven’t studied it, and I would hesitate really  to go one way or another without listening to the staff and doing a bit of work myself on the  subject  We’ll come back to that  I’m glad you have studied it, and if we proceed by the  subcommittee device, let’s have at least one member of this Committee who has studied the  matter, and that means you, Mr Holland    Well, you will be in a period of grace over the next two days, I’m  sure, and our staff will get that under way  No, I don’t want to lose this knowledge that you’ve  accumulated    Mr Volcker    No, I don’t think that should be--I think we must all suffer    Well that’s all that we’re concerned about [unintelligible] waiting   Thank you, Mr Volcker  Mr Balles now, please    Thank you, Mr Balles  Mr MacLaury now, please     4/20/76 - 30 -            I’m sorry, would you mind, I want to follow your argument--    All right, I [unintelligible], and he knows why  Thank you very  much, Mr MacLaury  Anyone else like to speak?  Yes, Mr Morris      By a longer period of time you mean what?    You speak of incompatibility, you mean what?    Well, I understand that, that’s why I asked you a question  But I  honestly think that that would put us on the wrong track because then our objective at this table  would be to make some predetermined set of numbers come true, and that must never be our  objective  It’s not required by the Congress  Our objective is the economy, not some set of  numbers that we dream up at this table     And you talked about our procedures  Well, I think there’s some point to your criticism,  but we might have gone into a deeper discussion than we have, you see  But I don’t think the  incompatibility should worry us at all  If we’re getting good results in the economy, what else  do we need?  Suppose, let us say, that our monetary growth figures turn out to be 1 percent for  M1 and 5 percent for M2 and 6 percent for M3 but that employment was rising, and production  was rising, and the price level is no longer rising as fast as it had been, and interest rates are  fairly stable?  Well, we ought to be quite content with those monetary growth rates even though  they depart, and depart materially, from figures that we had projected    Well, you’ve answered your own question  That is to say that  you’ve come out with the judgment, apparently, that was close to that of the Committee, even  though you’ve considered the questions that have not been, in your judgment--and I agree with  you--been talked about sufficiently at this table  And I suppose part of the answer to the  procedural question might be to have the staff elucidate some of these magnitudes and relations  more fully than has been done, but I suspect that what you describe as a defect in procedure may  be that only to a limited degree     If every one of us does his homework--time is limited, so we don’t go through the full  process of reasoning that leads us to a conclusion because we all speak rather briefly--I’m an  exception to that, I talk too much  Thanks very much, Mr Morris  Mr Winn please     4/20/76 - 32 -            Thank you, Mr Winn  Anyone else?    Thank you, Mr Baughman  Anyone else?     Well, I think we’ve had a good discussion, and Mr Broida has kept a record of the  thinking conveyed by members of the Committee with his usual [unintelligible] care  I think I  can summarize by saying that the numbers [I presented] originally at the opening of our  discussion are favored by a majority of the Committee, and therefore we now ought to go to a  formal vote, and we’ll be voting on a range of 4-1/2 to 7 for M1, 7-1/2 to 10 for M2, and 9 to 12  for M3     Ah, Mr Broida--while trained as an economist--has, by the virtue of the secretarial duties  and the legislation passed by the Congress, become an expert attorney as well, and he advised,  and I will not give his reasons, that there are strong reasons for not taking a formal vote but  merely for determining whether or not what I’ve stated conveys the consensus of the Committee   Let’s have a show of hands on the existence of such a consensus of Committee thinking on the  part of members of the Committee rather than a vote on the magnitudes that I have decided     Now, if you want to know the legal reasons and so on, they will be recited with meticulous  care by Mr Broida, who will be supported by Mr O’Connell, and I will go to sleep while they  talk, and the rest of you can do as you please    I don’t really understand, either  But since I think it will make no  difference whether we proceed one way or the other, and since I’m advised by learned counsel  that there are good reasons for proceeding by the consensus route rather than by strict voting,  that is my--I just accept that  But if you want to know the reason--Art is eager, look at the way  he’s sitting  [Unintelligible], just itching to do that, give you a full learned explanation  He can  do it in one minute  Go ahead, Art    But I don’t understand, we do publish--    Now we better hear from a man who has a law degree and years of  training practice  Mr O’Connell    Let me ask this question  Suppose we decided to take a vote, a  formal vote, which is the route I was going to follow  What terrible consequences might follow,  if any?    I’m just not following you  If they were pried out of us on the  afternoon of the meeting--this is on the assumption of this court decision?    That would be unfortunate--    --because we testify before a congressional committee, and  courtesy alone--and also respect for the oversight function of the Congress--almost dictates that  the first announcement be made before that committee    I would be inclined to be guided by our counsel on this issue, and  members of the Committee may or may not share that view  What is your advice, Tom?  What is  your advice to us as of today, without any prejudgment about what we may do or want to do in  the future?    I would argue otherwise because I confine facts to the economy   Now the procedure, projections, and so on, expectations--I would not call them facts, but I could  see how--now, the plaintiff in this case, you see, has argued with our definition on what a fact is   We [may] have to agree with the plaintiff, and this may acquire the honorific status of fact, what  we do here  An expectation or a projection may become a fact from certain points of view--of  course it can be described as a fact    Well, I’ll tell you what--let’s not extend the ranges of  [unintelligible]  We have advice from our counsel, and we may or may not take it  I do think  that this is a question that should be gone into more deeply than we’re able really to do at this  time around this table  Now let’s have a show of hands on the recommendation of Mr  O’Connell     4/20/76 - 36 -           SPEAKER(?)  [Unintelligible]    For this time, Mr O’Connell’s recommendation is accepted, and  therefore now let’s have a show of hands on the existence of a consensus on the numbers that I  have recited    Now we’re ready to turn to the current monetary policy, but before  we do that let’s have a few words from Mr Axilrod    Thank you, Mr Axilrod  Mr Axilrod, the Committee sooner or  later will want to know about the Treasury financing plan    All right, thank you very much  Any questions to Mr Axilrod?    All right, any other questions?    All right, we’re ready for our discussion  Who’d like to speak  first?  Well, let me call on Mr Volcker, then  Would you like to speak or not?    Thank you, Mr Volcker  I’ve quite independently arrived at much  the same opinion as Mr Volcker has just expressed  For simplicity and to give some  definiteness to the discussion so that members of the Committee may either move as I suggest or  differ strongly, I would suggest that we take 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 for M1; 8 to 12 for M2; and 4-1/2 to  5-1/4 or possibly 5-1/2, though I doubt that we would want to go as high as 5-1/2 in practice, for  the federal funds rate  Who would like to speak now?  Yes, Mr Jackson    Thank you, Mr Jackson  Mr Partee now, please    Oh no, I say if the staff is right we haven’t had quite so good a  quarter--    Thank you  You’re probably right in your recommendation, but I  think that in some respects your comments may prove misleading to the Committee  Under  alternative B you had 4-1/4 to 5-1/4 for the federal funds rate, and the range that I suggested was  4-1/2 to 5-1/4, though I spoke of 5-1/2    I mentioned that as a possibility  Now, the difference between the  two as far as the midpoints are concerned is just 1/8 of 1 percent, and I simply wanted to record  that     4/20/76 - 40 -            Well, that’s all right, but you see, there again, you may well be  right, but the difference is very, very small  You may be shading in the right direction, there’s no  question there, but I do want to point out that the difference is very small  Mr Mayo, please      Thank you, Mr Mayo  Mr Guffey now, please    Thank you, Mr Guffey  Mr Kimbrel, please    Thank you, Mr Kimbrel  Mr MacLaury now, please    Four does equal 8 on the basis of the errors involved on the  seasonal calculations    All right  Thank you, Mr MacLaury  Mr Black    Do you want to comment on Mr Winn’s--    Thank you, Mr Black  Mr Coldwell now, please    Thank you, Mr Coldwell Mr Balles now    Thank you, Mr Balles  Who’d like to speak next?  Mr Wallich    Thank you, Mr Wallich  And who would like to speak?  Mr  Gardner    Thank you, Mr Gardner    Thank you, Mr Winn  Who else would like to comment?    Yes, Mr Baughman    Well, thank you, Mr Baughman  Would anyone else like to say  anything?    Yeah    With a midpoint of 4-7/8?    That is, the 4-1/2 to 5-1/4 percent range would mean going up 1/8  but no more than that    And it would mean--well you’re not going to have much  information, you see  All that you’ll have is, you’ll have new information tomorrow and  Thursday on the aggregates    I don’t know, I am puzzled why you say that  I’d say that it’s very  soft    Why do you say that?  The figures aren’t in--    Well now, I still don’t know what your problem is, Chuck  The  upper limit for your federal funds rate suggestion was--    --5-1/4, and therefore, as of today, why do you breathe heavily  when you say that you still say 5-1/4    As I said before, Mr Partee may be entirely right, but I do think  that you are engaging in very fine tuning  The difference that is being quarreled, 4-1/2 to 8-1/2  and 5 to 9--I can toss a coin on that, really, when it comes down to it    No, no, no, no, there I--    Who else would like to speak?  Well, if no one else does, then let  me indicate where I think we are  Now, the federal funds rate, to start with that, I think that there  is a pretty clear consensus for a 4-1/2 to 5-1/4 [range]  We can test that out, but that’s the way I  read the summary  Now, we don’t have to test the lower limit  Let’s test the upper limit  The  members of the Committee who would prefer the 5-1/4 percent will raise their hands, please    All right, [my vote] would make that eight  Now, as for the  monetary growth rates, there is a little more dispersion in the thinking of the Committee, but the  differences are within a very, very narrow range  There is some sentiment for 4 to 8 for M1,  there is some sentiment for 5 to 9, a very thin majority favors 4-1/2 to 8-1/2, but it’s a razor thin  majority, and let me just put this question to the Committee  Let me have a show of hands  Not  what you prefer--those who would find 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 acceptable will kindly raise their hands    Well, as for M2, our recording secretary, who is always so  thorough and so meticulous, hasn’t given me enough information, but on the basis of the  incomplete reporting on this tally sheet, 8 to 12 seems acceptable  Let us have a show of hands  on 8 to 12, those who find it acceptable for M2     4/20/76 - 48 -            Well, next we have to determine the language of the directive    Well suppose we indicate to the Desk through a show of hands  whether equal weighing, approximately equal weighing, would again be the wish of the  Committee      All right, now, let’s turn to the language of the directive  Would  the language at the top of page 3, alternative B, namely, “to implement this policy while taking  account of developments in domestic and international financial markets, the Committee seeks to  achieve bank reserve and money market conditions consistent with moderate growth in monetary  aggregates over the period ahead”  Would this be an acceptable directive?  Let us have a show  of hands on that    Well, unless members of the Committee want to raise questions or  make further comments, I think we’re ready for a formal vote  Now, we’ll be voting on the  following  the rate of growth of M1 for the two-month period of 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 [percent]; M2 of  8 to 12 percent; a federal funds rate range of 4-1/2 to 5-1/4 [percent]; equal weighting,  approximately, of M1 and M2; and the language of alternative B  Any questions as to what it is  we’ll be voting on?    And an understanding of the zone of indifference of 2 percentage  points if that is acceptable to the Committee  All right we’re ready for a formal vote    Well, we’re not ready for that  We’ve decided to go through a  study period    Now during that period, what did we decide about RPD during the  study period?     4/20/76 - 49 -            All right, we do some things right  Now let’s take the vote    Well, it is time for lunch, and we’ll reconvene in executive  session   [Lunch recess]   [Executive session]    Now gentlemen, we’re ready to take up the Memorandum of  Discussion  It’s still a very troublesome subject  And we wish we didn’t have this problem to  deal with, but here it is  Now, Mr O’Connell, I think, ought to advise us as to recent  developments in the lawsuit we’re engaged in and of any developments that are unhappily not  favorable--we’ve got to deal with the facts as they are  Mr O’Connell, please    Thank you, Mr O’Connell  All right, any questions?    Any other questions?    Any other questions?    Well, gentlemen, I would now like to return to the Memorandum  of Discussion  We talked about this at some length at the preceding meeting of the Committee,  [the executive session] preceding the regular meeting of the Committee, and Mr Coldwell at that  time made some recommendations on his own behalf and on behalf of several members of [the  subcommittee] who served with him  Those recommendations by and large, with one or two  amendments, seemed entirely congenial to members of this Committee, including myself  I had  a lingering doubt, not articulated clearly in my own mind, then  I felt that the matter was of such  importance that it might be best to defer a final decision for a few weeks so that we would have  the opportunity to appraise second thoughts, if any occurred to us     Now, working with the staff on the problem connected with the lawsuit I did develop  second thoughts  And I communicated those second thoughts to members of the Committee at a  special meeting [on March 29], when I indicated that I would probably be making a  recommendation to this Committee that the Memorandum of Discussion be discontinued  I  reached this conclusion, and I have not reached it lightly     I must say that I had a certain attachment, nostalgic perhaps, to the Memorandum of  Discussion, which has been a part of our institution for many years  How useful it has been to us  or to scholars, I really don’t know, but I’ve been quite willing to assume that it’s been very  useful  And that’s been my judgment, although there’s never a judgment based on concrete or  definite knowledge  We’re living in a new and very different world, and I think the time has  come to take a determined step in recognition of the new environment [in which] we find  ourselves  It’s not an environment of our own choosing, but reality has to be faced     Now, in the memorandum that I’ve submitted to you, I indicated that premature disclosure  of segregable facts, such as the court in this lawsuit has ordered us to do, could in some cases  damage the work of this Committee, particularly if the present court or some later court rules that  we acted inappropriately in withholding certain facts about foreign currency operations or certain     4/20/76 - 53 -           facts about procedural matters  That could embarrass us and weaken us as a monetary policy  committee     The second point that weighs increasingly on my own mind is that, as long as the  Memorandum of Discussion exists, some of us--certainly senior members of our staff and  probably some members of this Committee, including myself--will have to spend a large amount  of time in the effort to comply with court orders that may come our way to make portions of the  Memorandum of Discussion public     And the third point that has led me to the present conclusion is that the procedures that our  staff is now proposing seem better than our existing procedures  From the point of view of the  general public, we’d be disclosing a good deal more, and disclosing it with some promptness,  rather than five years later  And perhaps it may also be a better procedure, though that is less  clear from the viewpoint of the Committee  I think that one thing we can be sure of is that the  adoption of this new--what do you call the policy record [the Record of Policy Actions]?    This new and more elaborate policy record, the adoption of  that--its prompt release--would go a long way toward meeting the charge which keeps on being  made that the Federal Reserve operates in an atmosphere of secrecy  Now, in my note to the  Committee, I made another suggestion, and I think these two suggestions should be discussed  separately  They’re related in my own mind because they both bear on the general charge of  secrecy, [and they give us] a way, I think, through the suggestions that I’m putting before you, to  deal with it effectively     In my note to the Committee, I also suggested that the 45-day lag for the release of the  policy record be shortened to approximately 30 days  Now, not so long ago, we reduced the lag  from 90 days to 45 days, and this reduction did not create any market problems, or none of any  special significance that I’m aware of  And I believe that further reduction from 45 days to  approximately 30 days would also have minimal market effects  Well, that is something that  Alan Holmes could judge better than the rest of us, certainly better than I can  Now, the  reduction from 45 to approximately 30 days in this lag could place some strain on our staff,  particularly if we also decided to expand the policy record, doing that as a substitute for the  present Memorandum of Discussion  But Mr Broida advises me that both proposals are  feasible--can be managed by the staff     Now, some changes will be required in the review process, and, if we decided to go this  way, members of the Committee would have to cooperate in expediting the process of clearance   But the proposal, or both proposals, are feasible     Well, I make the first recommendation sadly, but firmly  The second recommendation, I  don’t have any feelings about  I think that it’s probably  harmless from our own standpoint, and  from the public standpoint probably a wise move, and I have no sentimental attachment to the  45-day lag  Though I confess to a certain sentimental attachment to the Memorandum of  Discussion, I think the time has come to give it up  That’s my recommendation to the  Committee     4/20/76 - 54 -            No, unfortunately, it wouldn’t be the equivalent, but Tom  O’Connell can answer that best    Oh really?    When?    When did they start this?    Well, would you be good enough to check that out?    This is--there is some work to be done in the Rules Committee and  therefore--    As far as the Government in the Sunshine Act states its rules, I  would say that no matter how that legislation is handled--suppose it dies tomorrow--but in my  own judgment, we would not be affected because the problems that we’ve been dealing with  have not grown out of the Government in the Sunshine legislation, they’ve grown out of the  Freedom of Information Act and [from] this judicial ruling and kinds of judicial ruling that may  become law    That depends how we present it  I would want to make a virtue of  this, and never mind how we arrived at it  We were not seeking virtue for the sake of virtue, I’m  not going to argue that, but if, let us say, we decide to drop the Memorandum of Discussion, all  right then, we’re doing away with an instrument of secrecy retained in the archives for a period  of five years  We have a Record of Policy Actions, and that policy record is now going to be  very much fuller than it was, so the public will be informed promptly and much more fully,  that’s another virtue  And third, if we adopt the second suggestion, you see, cutting the period,  that goes further in that direction, and I would present it as a deliberate attempt on the part of the  Federal Reserve to rid itself of the perennial charge of secrecy  I think that’s the way to present  it to the public  Historically, it didn’t arise that way, that’s true, but I think that is not an unfair  interpretation     4/20/76 - 57 -            It may, that is, as far as the existing Memoranda of Discussion  over the past five years are concerned; there’s nothing we can do about that  We’re at the mercy  of court rulings    Well, I would answer it by saying, this is something that we don’t  have to do today  But I would also say that we are taking risks that, in my judgment, we ought  not to be taking any longer  And this can become a question of judgment  We live in a very  different environment, and we might as well recognize that    And I think that maybe we would want to emphasize the point, rid  ourselves of this awful charge of secrecy that keeps on being brought against us    Now, look--something that you withhold for five or six years is of  very little interest  When you make the [Memorandum of Discussion] available to the Archives  after five or six years have elapsed, is that publicized, Joe?    Here, we’d be putting out a Record of Policy Actions so people  learn relatively promptly--after 30 days or 45 days depending on what we do about that rule--a  great deal more about what goes on within this Committee  This meets, practically, the charge of  secrecy  And keeping a record  [the Memorandum of Discussion] hidden for five or six  years--you know, demagogues have been making a good deal of noise on that basis    Well, all right  You know, there’s one thing that I’ve become  accustomed to in my life at the Federal Reserve, and that is, no matter what you do, you’re going  to get some criticism    Well, I wouldn’t mind debating that issue, in which we put out  promptly twice as much information about our doings  And anyone who charges us with secrecy  would have a tough time defending that position  It doesn’t mean that criticism like that won’t  be made    Well, this is something Mr Broida can address best    Well, but that is not necessarily the case, you see  If the  Committee felt that things of that nature should become a part of a policy record, then that’s  what we would do     Now there is apparently a gray area, and therefore, if you travel this route, the suggested  route, I don’t know whether I put that in the memorandum to the Committee or not, but what I  had in mind is to have the Secretary make recommendations and then have a subcommittee of  this Committee go over these items on the gray area  And that subcommittee, pursuant to a  decision of the entire Committee, might wish to keep this gray area severely down, you see, to  put as much as is possible, perhaps even procedural detail, into the policy record     So that’s conceivable to me, but the suggestion about items for file, that suggestion might  go by the board  I don’t think that decision needs to be made immediately, and I think that  decision ought to be tested out    I think you ought to answer that question in two parts  First, how  is that handled now; and second, how do you visualize it being handled under the proposed new  method    It wouldn’t do what?    Well, that course could be chosen under the present method with  the Memorandum of Discussion    Thanks    Would you like to comment on that Mr Broida?    I don’t think you’re giving a convincing answer to Mr  Baughman’s suggestions    You mean the Minutes of Actions becoming an appendix to the  Record of Policy Actions?    Oh    So you prepare the minutes first, and then sometime later, you  prepare the policy record and that which is prepared later becomes an appendix to that which you  prepared earlier    Well, that is not Mr Baughman’s suggestion  Mr Baughman’s  suggestion is--    Is that right, Tom?    Let me ask a critical question  Suppose you stop doing that, and  waited, let’s say, 30 or 45 days, depending on what rule we adopt  Let’s say the present rule is  45 days; would you be acting in conformity with the law?  That’s the critical question    All right, therefore Mr Baughman’s suggestion is out of the  window, not because it’s a bad suggestion but because it doesn’t conform to law, period    And it would be hard, particularly if we were to adopt a  significantly expanded Record of Policy Actions, to do that in less than 30 days  As it is, we’ll  be strained when we put it on the [unintelligible] staff  We have the staff’s judgment that this  can be done    Mr Jackson now, please     4/20/76 - 66 -            While I like Mr Baughman’s suggestion, I would like it [more] if  our attorneys indicated that it would be conformative to law  I don’t see any significant  additional faults in having two documents instead of just one  Am I wrong on that?    In other words, the amount of trouble to which the staff would  have to go to would be much the same one way or the other way  And therefore, this can’t be a  matter of very large importance to us    Well, that indeed could be done, and all that means is you add one  word to the Record of Policy Actions --you write “Appendix” at the top  Any other comment on  the Memorandum of Discussion?     4/20/76 - 67 -            Mr MacLaury    Mr Willis, please    There’s still room for narcissism, looking for the future    Well, there is a cost, a heavy cost, a pretty cost to our senior staff,  and while I will never ask this Committee to cut down on my own labors--that’s something that I  should be able to control myself, one way or the other  It’s been a pretty sizable burden in my  own case recently; more important work had to be set aside  So there is a burden, there is a cost  right now    Well, I have no difficulty with the suggestion that you make  I’m  not sure what it involves, but proceeding deliberately is something that I instinctively have a  preference for, and therefore, let me modify my original suggestion to the Committee  And that  is that we vote today not on abandoning the Memorandum of Discussion, but that we vote today  in principle to do that, with the precise timing, etc, and final action to be taken at a later time    That’s right  Voting in principle means that final action has not  yet been taken    Well, as far as an expanded Record of Policy Actions is  concerned, one that would set forth the flavor of our debate and the reasons for the decisions that  we take, I don’t see how there can be any question but that it would serve the public interest  better than it does at present  You have the Record of Policy Actions, which is an abbreviated  policy record--the kind that we have--plus the Memorandum of Discussion  But the  Memorandum of Discussion is not used by the public  It is unknown to the public, unknown to  the newspapermen, even  Now, according to Joe Coyne, if I understood him correctly, he could  recall only one instance in which a single newspaperman referred to it    So, on that issue, I don’t see that there is any room for debate   The public would be informed currently to a much fuller degree  Now, one could have an  expanded Record of Policy Actions and also a Memorandum of Discussion, that’s true  But  what the point of that may be, I don’t know  The Memorandum of Discussion is proving  troublesome, and it may prove increasingly troublesome in the course of time in view of the  national legislative and judicial trends    When you come to historians, they’d want us to save all these  worksheets    Literally    You can think some nasty thoughts    Well, you know I have been talking--well you know, I talk, talk,  talk, and it’s hard to find someone who listens  I’ve been talking to Allison for some time now,  to hire an economic historian and to have one on the staff  An economic historian, one who  would keep track not only of our [failures] but also who could advise of historical questions that  keep occurring  I don’t remember talking to you about that, Bob    Well, but you have certain administrative authority at the Board,  let that be one of your legacies to the Board, to find that historian    Well, if George had the strength, he’d be an ideal man  George  Garvey was an economist in the New York Bank for many years     Well, gentlemen, would you like to discuss further, or is a vote in order?    Well, we take it up separately    Two parts  First, on the Memorandum of Discussion, the motion  would be that we agree in principle to substitute an expanded Record of Policy Actions, as  suggested by the staff, for the Memorandum of Discussion  This is to agree in principle that we  do that, with the time for final action and time for implementation to be decided later    With the understanding that it would be published tomorrow,  I--well--     4/20/76 - 71 -            I think I have to be guided by our attorney, and therefore, I’m  going to seek a show of hands on a consensus on the--you can’t call it a motion--on the statement  that I just put before the Committee  Let’s have a show of hands in favor  Just the members of  the Committee    Well, now, let’s turn to the second question, and would you state  now your specific question    Well, I think we ought to again express a consensus, if there is a  consensus, on a point of principle  And I would describe that as cutting the period from  approximately 45 days to approximately 30 days  I want to leave that vague because I’ve been  having discussions with the staff, and there are some fine points of detail, you see, as to whether  you release on a Friday or on a Thursday, and I don’t think those points of detail are going to  matter much to the members of the Committee, but they do matter much to our attorneys and to  Joe Coyne  And therefore, I don’t think we ought to try to go beyond an enunciation of  principle    Well, I don’t know that I necessarily want to tie it to the next  meeting  Approximately 30 days--it would work out in that fashion, and I think there are good  arguments for doing it after the next meeting  Having a vote at the next meeting and then early  release    I think that’s all right  I think that’s all right  But I just would  prefer not to have that worked out in detail  Now that can come back to the Committee, the  detail you see  After it’s been thought through by the staff fully and that is not the  [unintelligible] times    Gentlemen, if all we’re going to do today--and I think it would be  wise to do that and no more--is to reach a consensus on principle, then it is not necessary to  attach a specific interpretation to the phrase approximately 30 days  This will have to come back  to the Committee  And when it comes back to the Committee, and when we take final action, at  that time we will specify in detail just what we mean by approximately 30 days    Yes, the changes are what we will be talking about   SPEAKER(?)  Yes, and I think we would appear to be stretching it if we put 30 days in  our consensus    Well, under the 31- to 38-day rule, how often would it be 31 days  and how often 38?    And therefore it would be 31 days    Well, that’s not too bad, Bob    It would work out to 32-1/2 days on the average, and 30 is a good  round number for 32-1/2  [Unintelligible] of what I’ve just been doing     4/20/76 - 73 -           SPEAKER(?)  Are we protected better by less than 40?  Does that look better?    Well, we can decide  Let the vote in principle--vote is not the  right word--let the agreement in principle, if we are capable of reaching an agreement at this  hour, let it be simply, we’ve got more work to do, gentlemen  We have to bring this to an end,  that we decide to reduce the period by something like 10 to 15 days  And that would cover all  the sins that have been mentioned at this table  And if we find that there are additional sins, then  we’ll be able to take care of those, I’m sure, at the time when we take final action, if and when  and as we get to that stage  Is that all right?  Or troublesome?  If not, let’s have a show of hands  on agreement on principle as just stated    Well, all right now, I think that we have concluded    I think we’ve concluded our meeting as the FOMC   END OF MEETING      "
54,1976-05-18,"  Gentlemen, we’ll get our meeting under way  During the past two  or three meetings, we have deliberated on the desirability of continuing the Memorandum of  Discussion or discontinuing it, and also the desirability of changing the character of the Record  of Policy Actions and of reducing the lag in its release     Now, at our [March 29] intermeeting [meeting], the Committee agreed in principle with  the following  (1) the Memorandum of Discussion should be discontinued, (2) the Record of  Policy Actions should be expanded to include more information on the factors or considerations  underlying the Committee’s policy decision, and (3) the lag in the release of the Record of Policy  Actions should be reduced by some 10 or 15 days from the present lag of approximately 45 days   This was an agreement in principle, and the Committee did not act formally at the  intermeeting  The Committee did not act formally in part in order to enable the staff to consult  with the Justice Department about these actions in the light of the lawsuit that the Committee is  presently involved in  And Mr Broida informs me that members of the Committee have been  advised that a representative of the Justice Department has concurred in the reasonableness of  our proposals--in other words, he sees no objection or difficulty from the viewpoint of the  lawsuit  Is that correct?    To go on with the review of where we were and what has taken  place since the meeting, at the April meeting the Committee also left open the questions of the  specific duration of the lag in releasing the Record of Policy Actions  Our staff, [which] has  studied various possible schedules, has concluded, and I’m inclined to agree, that the best  procedure, all things considered, would be to release the record for each meeting on the Friday  following the next meeting  In other words, we hold the meeting--this is the May meeting--and  some four or five weeks from now we’d be meeting in June; the Record of Policy Actions for the  May meeting would be released on the Friday following our June meeting, held on a Tuesday     Now, to [give] you, the Committee, some insight into the new procedure, if we choose to  adopt it, the Committee drafted a preliminary version of an expanded Record of Policy Actions  covering the meeting  And this was done in order to test the feasibility of the new procedure if  we finally decide to take that road  And I understand from Mr Broida that the process of getting  comments from members of the Committee went well, and Mr Broida may want to say  something about that a little later on     Now, we’ve privately agreed to [take] formal and final action today  And if the Committee  decides to adopt the new procedures, namely, to drop the Memorandum of Discussion, to have  an expanded Record of Policy Actions, and to release it some 30 or 35 days after our meeting, I  think it would be desirable to hold a press conference to explain these procedures at the time  when the first policy record is released on the new schedule  Regrettably, I will be out of the city  on Friday, and such a press conference, if we proceed in this way, would have to be delayed until     5/18/76 - 2 -         next Monday  But the plan would be to make the release, henceforth, on a Friday following the  Tuesday meeting     Now two elements of the proposal of this new approach were left open at the time of our  April meeting  One was the suggestion that the Secretary place in the files memoranda that  would summarize informal Committee decisions and understandings; and the second item that  was left open was that the minutes of the Committee’s deliberations be expanded to include  explanations of procedural actions  Now we could hold a long debate on these outstanding  items; I would suggest that we not do so  I would suggest that occasions may arise when such  procedures would be appropriate, and that a committee or a subcommittee--special  subcommittee--be appointed to deal with these unresolved technical issues  That subcommittee  might have a great deal to do, and again that subcommittee might have literally nothing to do   Now that is a summary of where we are or where we might want to go, and before we  proceed to an informal voting, we might want to address specific questions that members of the  Committee may have  The questions may be directed to Mr Broida, to Mr O’Connell, or to me   Are there any questions?     Yes, Mr MacLaury    I’m going to turn this over to Mr O’Connell    Let me just interrupt  I think this is a statement that literally  should be kept to ourselves  We should not--no member of the Committee should discuss that  with any of his aides or anyone else at any time because we run the risk of amendment that might  make life a good deal more difficult for us    All right, any other question or comment?    Yes, yes, it certainly is    That wouldn’t help a historian very much  It would make his task  much more difficult    I follow the trend of thinking and I don’t think I wholly agree, for  two reasons  One is purely formal  We are describing this document as an expanded policy     5/18/76 - 4 -         record  We’re providing more information than in the past  And that is partly the justification  for eliminating the Memorandum of Discussion  Now, on the basis of this concept, the  document should be longer, you see, must be longer, and this is a formal consideration that  cannot be neglected, and we need some additional pages     Now, as for the information that is contained about the economy, well, I think you credit  individuals who follow the Federal Reserve with more knowledge than I think many of them  really have  I think it is a useful summary  Those who feel that it merely repeats that which they  already know will have no difficulty skipping paragraphs or pages  Those on the other hand,  who may find such a recapitulation useful, or find that they derive new knowledge, will have an  opportunity to be instructed fully     And therefore, while I understand these criticisms, I think that if anything, this document  may be criticized on the grounds, coming back to my first formal point, that it is not long  enough  Now, when this document was first shown to me, it was hardly longer, or just about a  page or two longer--two pages longer than a policy record was in the past  And I told members  of the staff, “Well, that will not do  I’m not going to tell you how to add additional pages, and  I’m certainly not going to say that we should do anything that remotely resembles padding, but  produce several additional pages”     I think that’s a good comment, and I think our staff should strive  toward somewhat fuller statements in the future Now, they will vary from time to time      Now to [unintelligible], on the basis of discussions that I’ve held  with the staff thus far, and on the basis of the discussion that we’ve had at this table last month, I  would say that the present answer probably is no  Now, that may not be a good answer, and  therefore we might well want to minimize the occasions where they are simply informal     5/18/76 - 5 -         understandings and [instead] seek a maximum of formal explicit understandings which would be  included in the Record of Policy Actions  Now, Mr Broida, you have thought more about these  questions than I have, and you, Mr O’Connell, have, and would each of you try to answer Mr  Coldwell’s question?      I think that it might be beneficial to indicate explicitly just what it  is that we are talking about when we discuss informal understandings  If we just talk about  informal understanding in the abstract, we may create a conspiratorial mood within this  Committee or convey a suggestion  Now, you’re the author of the concept of informal  understandings, Mr Broida; would you be good enough to enlighten us as to just what it is that  we might have informal understandings about     Let me ask you a question  You have a technical reason here, but  suppose we had decided to have a sentence in the Record of Policy Actions that we’re dropping  the RPDs, suppose we had decided--    We do what?    Then I missed the point that you just made    All right, suppose that we not only decided to do that--well,  suppose that the Record of Policy Actions reported not only the decision but some of the major  considerations that led to that decision  Would we be violating some statute that should concern  us?    All right, therefore, I’d say this is something that [unintelligible]    Yeah, have an extra paragraph, and another half page      You see, our difficulty--    Let me say just one word  I think that--responding not to the  precise question, but I think to the thought that was at the basis of Mr Coldwell’s question--what  we ought to do, really, is to seek to minimize [in]formal understandings, and the examples that  you’ve cited I think, are matters that could very well--I see no reason why, myself, [they] should  not be included in the Record of Policy Actions  And, therefore, the problem of informal  understandings in these instances wouldn’t arise  Now and then, something may arise, but the  Committee could then determine whether or not that specific item should be omitted from the  policy record, and if so, whether a minute should not be retained within our files       5/18/76 - 7 -         So we handle this, I think, on an ad hoc basis, but I would like to think we’d handle it with  the understanding now that we would maximize inclusion of items in the Record of Policy  Actions and thereby largely eliminate the need for so-called informal understandings     No, I don’t think that’s true because the items that Mr Broida is  referring to are items that have not gotten into the Memorandum of Discussion  Is that correct?      But I think that the question that Mr Coldwell has raised is a good  one and I think the proper answer is let’s proceed on the principle that there will rarely be  informal understandings  Now and then there may be and that’s something we will act on, on the  ad hoc basis  Mr Balles?    Not at all    Do you really want to be educated on this distinction now?    All right    It must be made--     5/18/76 - 8 -          All right, any--yes, Mr Willes?    Well, I think you would find that a good many members of this  Committee carry your sentiments  It’s the recent turn of events, within the Congress, within the  courts, within the environment in which we dwell that has moved members of this Committee  towards the kind of decision that we may be taking today  But it will be done with a feeling of  sadness by me and by a good many members of this Committee     Any other question or comment?  Well, if not, I think we are ready for a formal vote   There are three steps that we need to go through or [unintelligible], that is to say, if we decide to  move in the directions that we have been going, I would proceed systematically  First, we need a  motion that the Memorandum of Discussion be discontinued after the memorandum of the  March meeting     SPEAKER(?)  So moved   SPEAKER(?)  Seconded     5/18/76 - 9 -          Motion has been made and seconded  Any further discussion of  the motion?  If not we’ll take a formal vote now      All right  Now, next we need a motion that the Record of Policy  Actions for each meeting of the Committee is to be released to the public shortly after the next  regularly scheduled meeting of the Committee--meaning by that, normally on the Friday  following the Tuesday meetings   SPEAKER(?)  Mr Chairman, clarification, I’m assuming you mean Friday afternoon after  the markets are closed?    Yes, that is correct    I would interpret it, if I may  Let’s take today’s meeting  The  release would be three days after our June meeting, and if there are any decisions taken between  now and the June meeting by way of telegram or telephone conversation or a special, physical  meeting of the Committee, all that would be included in the Record of Policy Actions  Now  that’s my interpretation, is that correct?    It would     5/18/76 - 10 -          Now, there is a question there in my own mind  When members  of this Committee have held telephone meetings or conversations via telegram, we announce the  decision  We would not have gone beyond that  And I would assume that if members of this  Committee chose to talk about something and no decision was reached, then there would be no  clear reason for including that in the Record of Policy Actions  And I would leave that to our  lawyers    But I would say, again, that this is a procedural question that  members of the Committee may choose to decide one way or another in the future What I’ve  described, and what Messrs Broida and O’Connell have described, is the procedure that we have  worked with or under up to the present time  This Committee makes its own procedures--to  change any time that we as a Committee decide to do so    I don’t think this is a matter that should really trouble us because  it’s only a matter that we should be sensitive to--we should be alert to our own thinking  If we  have a meeting and no decision is reached, and if we want that recorded, I see no difficulty with  recording it  Why not?  On the other hand, I might see a difficulty if we held a meeting to  discuss a specific, sensitive issue, then we’ve reached no decision  Then I would seriously doubt  the wisdom of disclosing the sensitive issue on which we met and [on which we] decided to take  no action      5/18/76 - 11 -          That’s different, because then an action would be taken, you see   Here is an application that we are [unintelligible]  We would assemble for the purpose of acting  on [unintelligible]  But I see no difficulty, really     I can’t think of a case where we did not have--    Tom has indicated something that we are to keep in our own  bosoms and not communicate to anyone that the present best legal interpretation--of Tom and  our other attorneys--is that this Committee will not be subject to Sunshine legislation  And to  keep this--never to discuss this in these sensitive days  I cannot emphasize the importance of  that too much because it would be so easy to amend the Sunshine legislation to make sure that  we are covered  Any other question?  Yes?      May I say a word?  We have had interim meetings during the past  several years, and we have reported those within the interval of 45 days     Oh well, yes, 90 days, and then    And, I’m not aware of any difficulty that has arisen as a result of  reporting these special meetings, and all that is involved now is shortening the period from 45 to  some 30 or 35 days     Well, that’s the purpose of--instead of having a mere press release,  it seemed wise to hold a press conference to explain the reasons for these changes, and to give  newspaper men, financial writers, an opportunity to ask such a question      We want to provide the public with maximum information in the  shortest possible time  Yes, Mr Broida wants to comment on Mr Volcker’s--    Well, not only that but by that time the market will have validated  the Committee’s special decision     That’s true, but I want to modify a statement I made previously  I  think that if we do have a special meeting, telephonically or otherwise, and if no decision, no  policy decision is reached, the fact that such a meeting had occurred I think should be made a  part of the record even though no action was reached  I think it’s a better [unintelligible] and I  think I spoke hastily at the outset    All right, the motion has been made  Should the motion be  repeated?  The motion is simply that the Record of Policy Actions for each meeting of the  Committee be released to the public shortly after the next regularly scheduled meeting of the  Committee  Now the reason for saying shortly after is, there may be special circumstances for  making the release not on the Friday following the meeting of the Committee but a day or two  later and it’s to take care of contingencies of that sort  One such contingency is arising  immediately  That is, we want to make this release at the time of the press conference, and the  press conference cannot be held on Friday  Well, we are ready for the vote      All right, now, we have a third item that we have to vote on, and  this is an item that I’m going to ask Mr Broida to explain  I shall vote for it, then I hope I shall  understand it    Any question or discussion?  Well, we are ready for a vote      Well, I think we’ve disposed of the--oh, I’m terribly sorry, Mr  Broida is calling my attention to a note that he prepared in my behalf  I’m not sure that it is  necessary to take this up, but I also see no harm in doing so, and therefore I will read the note  that Mr Broida prepared for me  The suggestion is that we arrive at an informal consensus--we  may already be in trouble--that it would be desirable to expand the Record of Policy Actions to  include more detailed information on members’ views concerning longer-run and current policy   I think we’ve decided all that  We ought to have an expanded policy record  Do you have  anything else in mind?    Well, let’s leave this quickly then  Now there is a fifth item  I am  advised that it need not be covered because it already had been covered  Let’s leave this quickly   All right?  Are we legal?    Let me appoint a subcommittee, but the intention would be to give  this subcommittee nothing to do  We talked about informal understandings to be recorded in our  files  I think we have reached a decision, a consensus, that we will minimize such occasions and  try to proceed in such a fashion that there will be no need for informal understandings  And yet  we have to be pragmatic and recognize that such a need may arise  To help our Secretary  discharge his duties, and to take care of troubles that may arise, and which I hope will not arise,     5/18/76 - 15 -         let me appoint a committee consisting of Mr Gardner as chairman, Mr Volcker, and Mr Partee,  who are to be consulted by the Secretary     But now let me ask you, you know I’ve been away, and since getting back I’ve had to  prepare a speech and cover a lot of ground, and I’m less well prepared for this meeting than I’d  like to be or ought to be  But I seem to recall that we felt a need for a committee, not only for  this purpose but for a wider purpose  The Secretary may need assistance and some guidance   There will be comments from committee members that he may find difficult to resolve  Didn’t  we discuss that?  Or is it my imagination?      Well, can we not do this, consider this a committee that the  Secretary may find it useful to consult in connection with difficult questions that arise in the  preparation of the policy record?  All right?  Well, I think we are ready for our regular meeting   Let’s take a recess for two or three minutes  To stretch our legs    Well, we are ready to proceed with our meeting now, gentlemen   And may we have a motion to act on the minutes of the April meeting   SPEAKER(?)  So moved    Motion to approve the minutes is before us  I discern that there  might be a second  I hear no objection I take it the minutes are approved and we are ready now,  Mr Holmes, for your report on foreign currency operations     Thank you, Mr Holmes  Any questions?  Any comment on the  foreign exchange market?      Has not yet had a chance to meet, or the committee has not yet  met?    All right, any other comment or question?  Very well, a motion to  approve or confirm transactions that have been conducted by Mr Holmes at the Foreign  [Exchange Trading] Desk is now in order   SPEAKER(?)  So moved       5/18/76 - 16 -         The motion has been made and probably seconded, hear no  objections  And Mr Holmes, do you have any recommendations?     Any questions on that?  I think taking things all in all, this is to my  mind clearly the right thing to do  Is there any difference of opinion on that?      Well, I hear no objections  Any other recommendations?    Thank you, Mr Holmes  We are ready now for your report, Mr  Gramley     I’m sorry, I’m sorry--Mr Broida insists that everything be done  properly and legally, and we are all grateful to him  The Manager’s recommendation has not  been formally approved by the Committee  May we infer that the Committee has formally  approved?  I hear no objections  Yes, Mr Gramley    Thank you, Mr Gramley  I believe that the report on housing  starts and building permits will be released--    This afternoon  I’ve gotten a preliminary reading on that report,  and I think members of the Committee should know that the reported figure on housing starts for  the month of April is somewhat lower than for the month of March     All right, Mr Morris, let’s, for our economic discussion--ah, but we want to concentrate on  any differences of views  from the approach or interpretation presented by Mr Gramley and also  on any supplementary information that members of the Committee think should be brought to the  attention of the Committee  Mr Morris       Really?    Yeah, but Mr Partee inquires whether correction for the difference  of Easter dates is being respected in this calculation     Using last year’s seasonal factors      Well, that takes care of that Easter problem     Lyle, first of all, would you comment on the historical point, that  is, how we judged the rate of utilization of capacity or misjudged, or whichever it may be, during  the preceding boom    Well, now, Lyle, let me try to stimulate your recollection  We put  out a new index on the rate of utilization of capacity of major raw materials industries, and when  we did that new index    When did the new index appear?  When did we first have it?  Do  you remember the date?     April 1973?    Well, now, that was not too late was it?      It would have been better to have had it in 1972  I just want to  ask-- Yes    Yeah, alright, that’s helpful  Now, Mr Morris has asked a very  important question  How can we equip ourselves so that we would not make a similar mistake?    Lyle, let me follow up on Mr Morris’s question  Our index of  capacity utilization apart from the raw materials group is unsatisfactory     All right  Now, some work has been under way for some time to  give us a significantly improved overall index  What is the status of that?     I see    Well, I would think it would be very useful  And you think it  would be available within, say, six months?       5/18/76 - 20 -          Well, now, next let me ask this  You know I’ve been impressed  over the years with the reports, Mr Mayo, we get from Chicago--your meetings with  economists--    --and presumably meetings like that are held in our [Reserve]  Banks across the country, [but] I don’t see reports such as we get from Chicago  Now, keeping  in touch in systematic fashion,  not so much with financial economists or general economists, but  industrial economists, those working for industrial firms, I think would be one way of meeting  the needs that Mr Morris has described  And this certainly can be done by the research  departments of our District Banks, and perhaps we ought to be looking to the future and be  sensitive to the problem that Mr Morris has described so well and Mr Gramley elaborated on     Perhaps we ought to strive for a collation of such reports over the next year, not  committing ourselves to a “Purple Book,” you know  But over the next year, [collect] such  reports from the research departments of individual Banks--these reports to be based on  conversations with industrial economists and being compiled for the System  Now, Mr Morris,  what is your own reaction to that suggestion?    Yeah, but look, first of all, the index that Mr Gramley described  will show numerous industrial components, it does now, and he’s planning an expanded index,  and therefore there will be broader industrial representation--     Now then, second, these surveys that I am thinking about--well,  talking to industrial economists, they are going to talk about their industry, their firm, you see,  and that’s what we want, and therefore the reports will be on a disaggregated or specific  industrial basis      5/18/76 - 21 -          That’s very helpful  Mr MacLaury?    Well, we are not going to make mistakes like that    Well, this is a very basic question, a very difficult question  I  worked on that 40 years ago, and I knew more about it then than I know now  Oh, more than 40  years ago  I don’t think we can do anything in this area now  I think we’ve got to somehow use  the rough, raw material that we can gather, while our staff continues working on the basic  conceptual question that you’ve so rightly called attention to  Does my suggestion meet with  any--it doesn’t seem to meet with any enthusiasm  I still think it’s a good suggestion    SPEAKER(?)  Sure    Well, I think this would have to be, if it’s going to be done, you  know we need more than encouragement  We don’t need too much system, but we need to  organize ourselves for the purpose, and--    I’d like to get started sooner  Mr Mayo, would you be willing to  assume responsibility for getting the Banks, you see, to compile reports of this sort to be made  available?  These could be brief reports, gathered from conversations with industrialists and their  economists?      Now, I think that’s a splendid suggestion    Well, I think that’s a very useful comment  You know, that’s  another area where we all went wrong in our judgment of the inventory situation during 1974 in  particular  But that was traceable to our faulty statistics, and our statistics were so faulty because  our statisticians could not take adequate account of  inflation; the inflation was distorting the  meaning of our inventory figures  Is that a correct statement, Lyle?      And we were surprised by the magnitude of the accumulation, by  the magnitude of the inventory boom that apparently had occurred      I think that all that we can really do in this fashion is to gather  impressions in a more systematic way than we otherwise might, but I think that in the absence of  authentic statistical data, it’s very important that we try to form impressions of what is going on  as fully and as promptly as we can  Mr Partee?     5/18/76 - 23 -          Now, isn’t that interesting    I like very much Mr Jackson’s suggestion about improving in this  respect the Redbook  And my own idea as to a possible  [“Purple Book”] and so on, I withdraw   Your idea is much better, and that can develop  And we can do something next month already,  you see, and the fact that individual Banks will go about this task in different ways, there’s no  harm in that  This Redbook has been useful, even though each Bank approaches the matter in a  somewhat different way  Well, I want to thank you, Mr Morris, for your alertness and your  suggestion  Let’s hear from Mr Balles now    Well, that’s an interesting point  Are other Bank presidents  getting similar impressions from their fellow directors?   PRESIDENTS  Yes, yes, yes, yes [etc]    Generally true?   SPEAKER(?)  Mr Chairman, since our last meeting, we conducted a series of meetings  around the District with industrial leaders, major retailers, key businessmen, and with our own  directors, both Branch and head office  We are getting a very strong feeling that the recovery is  proceeding much faster; business thrust is considerably stronger than these numbers would  indicate  There is a definite feeling that prices are generally going to rise faster, that inflation  thrust is much stronger than we project  They are making decisions based on that and are  proceeding on that  I think we get a very strong feeling of that in our District   So I guess the only other question I would like [to ask] Lyle [is], what industries might be  calculated to be the strongest capital spenders in your projections    Now wait, 5-1/2 percent is the unit labor cost?    Even if OPEC did nothing    You know, I’d say capital expenditures are still [unintelligible]    Well, but I think that’s precisely what Mr Balles had in mind  He  said take it into account, he didn’t tell us how    I don’t think there is any doubt about that    Well, I think that’s fair  All right,  Mr Black, please    What about textiles?    Thank you, Mr Black  Mr Winn, please    Have you heard about that?     Who’s in charge of our data on this area?      Be sure to call--    All right, thank you very much, Mr Winn  Mr Wallich, please    It could develop in 1977    I’d go further and say that that is, as of today, a reasonable  expectation     You don’t need stimulative policies  There’s been so much  stimulation around the world that momentum has been built up within the private economy   That’s certainly our condition, and it’s the position of Germany at the present time  I think  France is close to it  And before too long, I think others will join that procession  So I’ve had  my eye on the possibility of a worldwide economic expansion in 1977  I think that’s exactly the  direction in which we are moving  Mr Partee?    Well, and hopefully it will be a little more responsible, etc, but I  think the distinctive viewpoint to keep our eye on is price developments  Not be too  [unintelligible] My instinct tells me that the businessmen are more likely to be right than  economists on this issue, but all we can do is to be as alert as we can to the developments and not  have closed minds, and I don’t think anyone around this table has a closed mind  Any other  comment?  Yes, Mr Winn    You notice it takes so much longer to expand capacity  [unintelligible]  Mr Jackson?     5/18/76 - 30 -          Well, they’ve managed to do not too badly even during the severe  recession that we’ve gone through      Yes, Mr Balles    Now what is the reason for that--expectation [of a] price rise?      When will the legislation expire?  Wasn’t it [to last] around four  years or so?     SPEAKER(?)  I think about 3-1/2, something like that  But there is a fairly long gestation  period between drilling and getting the product in the market  And there is also the interpretation  that some current weakness in product prices is viewed as temporary and that demand will soon  turn that around  Drilling costs are down in some respects, that is, rigs are available at lower  rentals, and pipe is available at a lesser cost than it was a number of months ago, when there  were shortages       5/18/76 - 31 -         And apparently also some fields which were uneconomical now are becoming economic  because of some changes in technology  Apparently they have techniques available now which  enable them to fracture the rock down in the oil-bearing strata and thereby get a greater release  of the product than had been previously the case  This is showing up in specific terms at the  present time in the so-called Pearsall-Devine area  Those two little towns are now boom towns,  primarily because they feel [unintelligible] which is long known to exist [unintelligible] there,  but just on economic [terms] is now seeing quite a strong play in development     I would just record, without any attempt to evaluate, that the retailers on our board of  directors were much less optimistic at our last meeting than at the preceding meeting--well, I said  [I wouldn’t evaluate]--but my own interpretation is that it’s because they are not looking through  the effects of the [recent] pattern  But they’re knowledgeable, experienced people in this  business, so I may be doing them an injustice in that respect  These are general merchandise  retailers  There was a tendency on their part to explain what they judge as less vigorous retail  activity on the grounds that the automobile dealers are getting [more business]  And they are  inclined to feel that, with automobile sales real strong, it’s harder for them to capture the portion  of the consumer dollar that normally would come their way  But in terms of the staff’s general  forecast, we see the general picture essentially as has been described in their documents     Thank you, Mr [unintelligible]  Mr Wallich, please    Mr Gramley, you’ve already commented on that    I would second what Mr Gramley has said, but I would call  attention to a growth phenomenon which I have not studied during the past 20 years, but which I  did study very intensely in earlier times  What I found in our studies of business cycles at the  National Bureau [of Economic Research] was that if you take all [of the] some 10 business cycle  expansions prior to the 1940s or 1950s, you find that in about 8 out of 10 instances you had what  we at the National Bureau called a mid-expansion retardation  That is, your GNP, if you like,  expands and then there is retardation and then a re-acceleration in the second half or last third of  the expansion  You’ve got 8 instances out of 10     Now I don’t know the record for the past 20 or 30 years, which is much more relevant to  judging the future  I don’t know it nearly as well and I don’t know in [unintelligible] precise  terms  But I would keep in mind that this phenomenon was very prominent in the business cycle  history of this country in earlier times  Any other questions or comments?  If not, the hour for  the coffee break has come, so--   [Coffee break]    Thank you, Mr Sternlight  We are ready for discussion of Mr  Sternlight’s report  Any questions or comments?    Well, Mr Axilrod is apparently a little bolder than Mr Sternlight      Semi-even-keel    We’ve done that  We’ve had a new look for some time--in  practice      Just not to leave the matter in doubt, we are paying much less  attention to even-keel, and the Treasury understands this thoroughly and is not raising any  questions or expressing any doubt       5/18/76 - 34 -          The term that I just coined, semi-even-keeling, doesn’t correspond  precisely to the thought I had in mind  I think we’ve moved away from even-keeling by  something more than 50 percent     Might agree with that, but the difference here is so subtle  The  Desk got to the 5-1/4 figure--possibly I might have gotten there a couple days sooner, but it’s a  difference, practically speaking, without much meaning  Mr Holmes, you have been engaged in  this activity for a long time  How would you describe the attitude of the Desk toward even- keeling in general and more specifically during the past month?      The New York [Reserve]Bank had a lower estimate than our staff  had  They were revised      5/18/76 - 35 -          Well, this time it was wrong, next time it will be right      Any other questions or comments?    I think that’s valid  I think Mr Partee’s point--that in view of the  magnitude of Treasury financing, we must regard traditional even-keeling as a thing of the  past--this is something that now and then deserves repetition  Let’s go on to Mr Axilrod now   And you are not going to forget Mr Coldwell’s question     No, no--I think you gave a very reasonable reply to Gov  Coldwell’s question      Any other questions or comment?   How much did we issue?    So that adds up to a major factor    Well, it’s still a minor factor  Any other question or comment?     Any other questions?    Any other questions?  If not, we are ready for our discussion of  monetary policy, and I’d like to make, if I may, two or three introductory comments briefly     I think it’s entirely clear that our monetary aggregates have been increasing of late at a rate  that is simply unacceptable, and these increases have been widely advertised  I think it’s highly  important to recognize the fact that the moderate monetary policy that we’ve been pursing has  made a certain contribution to the return of confidence across our economy  And if confidence  in the economy and in the Federal Reserve System is to be maintained at its present high level, I  think we must respond to the apparent explosion that is now taking place in the monetary  aggregates     At the same time, I think we should proceed cautiously because this spurt that has been  experienced recently may be a temporary aberration, and we should not overreact to what has  taken place  Some definite reaction I think is in order, but we must not, in my judgment, run the  risk of overreacting to the oversized increase in monetary aggregates     Now, we will be discussing the specifications for the monetary aggregates and also for the  federal funds rate, and let me indicate my own thinking  The members of the Committee may     5/18/76 - 40 -         feel very differently than I do, but perhaps by indicating my own thinking I’ll give you  something either to assent to or to criticize, as you see fit     I think that the federal funds rate suggested by alternative B is acceptable, but I would raise  the lower limit, and I think in view of what has been happening, the federal funds rate should not  go as low as 4-3/4 percent  I would therefore suggest a range for the federal funds rate of 5 to  5-3/4 [percent]  Now that would permit a moderate increase, if necessary, in the federal funds  rate  It would indicate a reaction on the part of the System to what has been happening to the  monetary aggregates  I don’t think that, as of today, I would want to see the federal funds rate go  above 5-3/4 in the month ahead     Now, as for the monetary aggregates--there I would be inclined to be less liberal than any  of the alternatives specified on page 6 of the Bluebook  I would place the upper limit of M1 at  7-1/2 percent  I think that’s high enough  And as for M2, perhaps reduce the upper limit to 9  percent  I think that’s high enough  As for the lower limits of those ranges, well, I’d be flexible  in my own thinking  We could continue, perhaps we should, with a 4-point range or possibly  make it a little narrower if the Committee were so inclined  I have no strong feelings on that,  one way or the other     Now that’s where I come out at the moment, and I’d like to listen to my colleagues  I’ve  given you figures to attack or to endorse as you see fit  Who would like to speak first?  Mr  Mayo    Let me comment on that  Your analysis, I think is entirely correct  and that specifications I suggest might land us at the 5-3/4 figure sooner than would otherwise be  the case  But [in] looking ahead as best I can at the moment, I doubt I would want to see the  federal funds rate go above 5-3/4  An upward adjustment between meetings might take place of  course, but I would not want to contemplate that because the federal funds rate moved up some  50 basis points within the past month  A range of 5 to 5-3/4, assuming that the 5-3/4 figure is  reached, would mean another increase of 50 basis points, and to go faster than that at this stage  strikes me as premature  I thought more confirmation would be too sudden a jolt  Well, that’s  my thinking     5/18/76 - 41 -          I think our Manager, well, let the Manager speak for himself  My  guess would be that he would stretch things out and not get there too soon    Well, Mr Holmes, do you have a comment?    Well, Mr Volcker, I think you wanted to speak    You came out where?    Thank you, Mr Volcker  Mr Jackson, please    Thank you, Mr Jackson  Mr Kimbrel, please    Thank you  Mr Coldwell now, please    Now wait It does matter because it can cumulate, you see    Thank you, Mr Coldwell  Mr MacLaury now, please    Thank you Mr MacLaury  Mr Balles now, please    Well, thank you, Mr Balles, for very instructive comments  Mr  Gardner now, please    Thank you, Mr Gardner  Mr Winn, please    Thank you, Mr Winn  Mr Partee, please    Thank you, Mr Partee  Who would like to speak next?  Yes, Mr  Wallich    Thank you, Mr Wallich  Who would like to speak now?  Mr  Black and then Mr Baughman    Thank you, Mr Black  Mr Baughman now    Thank you, Mr Baughman  Yes, Mr Roos, please    Thank you, Mr Roos  Anyone else? Mr Guffey    Very well, thank you, Mr Guffey Who would like to speak now?   No one else  Well, I think the general direction of the Committee’s thinking is quite clear and  uniform  On specific numbers there is some dispersion, more dispersion than we’ve had in the  past meeting or two, but that is thoroughly understandable     Now, let me test the Committee’s thinking  The range is fairly large in the case of M2, but  a figure of 4 to 7-1/2 may be somewhere close to the average  Running from 4 percent to 7-1/2  percent for M1 may be close to being the mean of Committee thinking  Let me therefore put the  question to the Committee, and ask for a show of hands on the part of members of the  Committee, whether a range of 4 to 7-1/2, while not preferred necessarily, would seem broadly  acceptable     5/18/76 - 49 -          Well, I would say this  Now, I think Mr Holmes has given the  correct answer as far as normal Desk operations are concerned  But I would still space out the  adjustment of the federal funds rate  Rather than move up promptly, I would move it up  gradually over the month, and that is something for the Committee to decide    Well, let’s proceed then, tentatively  That is, we can retrace our  steps, but let me continue the way I’m going  These are tentative indications of Committee  thinking, and we’re certainly not voting formally  I therefore ask for a show of hands on 4 to  7-1/2 percent [for M1]--whether that is generally acceptable even though not preferred    Then I would make that a pleasant six, it just tips the balance   Now and then, the Chairman--even though we are not voting--can make his influence felt  Now  let me test the Committee’s thinking on M2  There the range [of opinion] is narrower, and let me  test the range of 5 to 9--5 percent to 9 percent for M2, and let’s have a show of hands    Well, we come out the same way  Now let me test the federal  funds range of 5 to 5-3/4, taken on the assumption that the M1 range will be 4 to 7-1/2     5/18/76 - 50 -          Well, we’ve had some test of Committee thinking  Would you  like me to continue to test the Committee’s thinking further?     Well, then, you see, the high monetary aggregates are in the  minority of the Committee, but let’s take 4 to 8 for M1 and for M2--well, perhaps 5-1/2 to 9-1/2  and the funds rate of 5 to 6  How many would feel more or less comfortable with that  specification as over against, I will have to repeat this--this is getting quite complex--an M1  range from 4 to 7-1/2, an M2 range from 5 to 9, and a federal funds rate from 5 to 5-3/4     All right, I’ve got the numbers down, and now we have to get them in our minds  I’m  going to distinguish between package A and package B     Package A is as follows  M1 at 4 to 7-1/2, M2 at 5 to 9, and federal funds 5 to 5-3/4   Package B is as follows  M1 at 4 to 8, M2 at 5-1/2 to 9-1/2, and federal funds 5 to 6     Are the specifications of packages A and B clear, or should I repeat them?  I take it they  are clear, and we will now have a show of hands on which we prefer, package A or package B   Those who prefer package A will kindly raise their hands    Gentlemen, I don’t know whether--you know the difference  between A and B is not very large, and I would join those who prefer A  We’re ready for a vote  unless members of the Committee want further testing or further discussion    Well, all right, do you want to give me your numbers?    This is now package C    Well, this is going to be good and complex and I’m not going to  make it simple for you  You’ve got to blame Mr Volcker, you can’t blame me  I’m a servant of  the Committee, the servant of every member of the Committee, and now Mr Volcker’s servant,  and the complexity falls on his shoulders  We’re going to indicate a preference as among A, B,  and C  Is that the way you want to do it?    Well, you got us into this    A is--    All right    Package A  M1 at 4 to 7-1/2, M2 at 5 to 9, funds rate at 5 to 5-3/4     Package B  M1 at 4 to 8, M2 at 5-1/2 to 9-1/2, and funds rate at 5 to 6     Package C  M1 at 4 to 8, M2 at 5-1/2 to 9-1/2, and funds rate at 5 to 5-3/4     Now, those members of the Committee who, on balance, prefer package A will raise their  hands    Okay, now those members of the Committee who prefer package  B will raise their hands    Members of the Committee who prefer Package C will now raise  their hands      5/18/76 - 52 -          Well, since package A would also have my dedication, I think  we’ll have a formal vote on package C, and the differences here--   ALL  A, package A     That’s that  Well, the hour is advancing, and we have to vote also,  of course, on the language of the directive  I would suggest that we stay particularly at this time  with the monetary aggregates proposal      Well, let’s have a show of hands on that  The language as it  stands as over against Mr Kimbrel’s suggestion to read “with more moderate growth”  How  many prefer the language as it now stands?      Well, all right, we’ll vote now on the monetary aggregates  proposal, the language as in your work sheets--with a range for M1 of 4 to 7-1/2 percent, M2 of  5 to 9 percent, and a funds range of 5 to 5-3/4 percent--and with M1 and M2 receiving  approximately equal weight at the Desk  And with the understanding also that if these numerical  guides should suggest a prompt move in the funds rate to the upper limit, that the Desk would  not proceed in that way--that if an upward move was indicated, it would be spaced out over the  month in gradual fashion      Well, would be spaced out in gradual fashion, which could mean  over the month, which could mean over three weeks  I think we have to leave some flexibility  for the Desk    A very small move  I think you’re just about where you are    Well, there are no further comments, we’ve exhausted our  arithmetical propensities, I believe, and we are ready for a vote  Would you be good enough to  call the roll?    Now, what else do we have to do?    Well, we’ll carry it over then    Well, I think members of the Committee who have definite views  on the graphic presentation should communicate those views to the staff, and the staff should  take the thinking of the members of the Committee into account  Well, I think we’ve completed  our meeting   END OF MEETING             "
80,1976-06-22,"  Gentlemen, we have a special meeting, and our newest Governor  David Lilly, I am glad to say, has joined us this morning     I might have said that, yes  Newest Governor, but an old Federal  Reserve hand     As members of the Committee have been informed, Henry Reuss has filed a suit against  our individual District Banks and individual Bank Presidents  And I’ve asked Mr Broida to  make copies of Mr Reuss’s letter along with the civil action that he’s brought and asked that it  be made available to the Committee  I’ve written a brief note of acknowledgment merely saying  that I received his letter and that I will make sure that members of the Committee are properly  informed  Now, I’ve asked Tom O’Connell, our counsel, to tell us whatever he may be prepared  to say about this lawsuit  Mr O’Connell      I might just say one word I have very much on my mind  We have  had numerous inquiries from the press, and I’ve given strict directions to Mr O’Connell not to  comment in any way, and that is precisely what I’m going to do if anyone asks my view--I will  say I have no comment  And I hope that each of you will do exactly the same  No good can  come from a [public] discussion of this lawsuit  Mr O’Connell    Thank you very much  Now, gentlemen, just one question  Our  12 Bank Presidents are going to be sued  They will need counsel  Will you serve as counsel  along with some members of the Justice Department, or do you have enough to use?    Thank you  Any questions?      Well, let me say a word about that  Fortunately, of course, each of  you has counsel of his own  And, of course, the opinions of your counsel should be transmitted,  but this must not be regarded as a suit that is brought against anyone of you as an individual  It’s  a lawsuit that is really brought against the fuller concept of the Federal Open Market Committee   And therefore, a single unified legal defense, I take it, is essential  To draw upon the best legal  ability that we can--that we do have--is only good sense  But I think it would be clearly wrong  for individual members of this Committee to go off in individual directions  This must be a  single unified legal approach, at least that’s the way it appears to me    Good     I think that the story in the Wall Street Journal this morning takes  care of the matter for the time being, beautifully  Mr Reuss tried to get this kind of provision  through the Congress  He has [not been able] to do so even in the House Banking Committee   And now, being frustrated, he turns to the courts  And I would suppose Mr Reuss would look  rather ridiculous before his colleagues in the Congress  He has not been able to persuade his  colleagues  He has emphasized the importance of larger congressional controls  So suddenly, he  turns to the courts to resolve the problems that he could have resolved if he had had the support  and backing of the total Congress  I think that, for the time being certainly, we ought not to  comment on the case, and I would believe that others will do the commenting for us very  effectively       6/22/76 - 5 -            SPEAKER(?)  My I say, sir, that the briefer story in the New York Times takes much the  same line    It’s hard for me to see how he can gain stature among his  colleagues in the Congress by this [unintelligible]    SPEAKER(?)  If pressed by reports, I would [unintelligible] is a point to be made that we  cannot comment at this time in view of the legal proceeding, [which] we would complicate?     I think that any comment runs the risk of igniting passions  And  the calm attitude on our part, I think is only good sense  There is a lawsuit, it’s before the courts,  it isn’t even proper to comment  Any other questions?  Mr Mayo    Mr Balles    Any other question?  Yes, Mr Mayo      Any other question?  Yes, Mr Guffey    I interpret Mr Guffey’s question to me as follows  Suppose that  you reach the conclusion that outside counsel could be helpful and that some outstanding  constitutional lawyer might join you in the defense  I take it that was the question, and I would  assume that you would have the authority  Could you do that?      We will have such assistance if you deem it advisable  That is, do  you have the authority to do that or would you need authority from this Committee to empower  you to employ a consultant if you reach the conclusion that outside legal counsel could be  helpful?     Well, let’s give Mr O’Connell that authority now     6/22/76 - 8 -           SPEAKER(?)  So moved   SPEAKER(?)  Seconded    Any objection?  All right  That is the authority, it’s not to hire  legal counsel--    --the authority is to hire legal counsel if you, in your judgment,  arrive at the conclusion that that would be helpful in defending the Committee, the individual  members of [unintelligible] against this lawsuit    Yes, Mr Gardner?    You say crippled--[but if that is] the decision of the court, then the  powers of the Federal Open Market Committee would be taken over by the Federal Reserve  Board, and the Federal Reserve Board could act five minutes after the court decision is handed     6/22/76 - 9 -           down  So the [Federal Reserve] System, in its operations, would not be crippled  At least that is  one interpretation   SPEAKER(?)  Well, Mr Chairman, we get curious results if he enjoins the Banks from  carrying out open market operations  Conceivably that stops all of the action of this Committee   The Committee itself does not conduct the open market operations, it must be done by the 12  Banks on the statute    It would have to be done on the basis of some understanding  between the Federal Reserve Board and the Banks, and immediately with the New York Bank in  its operations of the Desk   SPEAKER(?)  Well, I guess what I’m suggesting--    All that I’m trying to say is that if the worst happens, we are not  going to have a national financial crisis, as I see it      Not in this lawsuit     But let’s say the court handed down the decision in favor of Mr  Reuss  Then another lawsuit may be brought against Bank Presidents because of early actions in  which they participated--am I romancing?    The court hands down the decision in favor of Mr Reuss, and I  bring a lawsuit on the grounds that my personal fortune has been hurt because interest rates went  up  And this increase in interest rates and loss in capital value of the securities that are held was  brought about by the Bank Presidents acting unlawfully in this Committee  Acting  unconstitutionally  I couldn’t do that?       6/22/76 - 10 -            I understand  Let me ask this question  Is Mr Reuss acting as  chairman of the House Banking Committee or as a private citizen?     Personally, I would think he’d be in some difficulty with his  committee to the extent that he acts in this capacity as chairman of the committee  I assume that  he hasn’t consulted with his full committee   SPEAKER(?)  Is it not conceivable that his committee could disavow this action and  remove him as chairman?  In other words, when things start working within--    I would think so    Well, I don’t know if members of [his] committee would react, but  a member of the committee might raise the question about the propriety of Mr Reuss’s acting in  this manner without first consulting with the committee  That is, bringing the lawsuit,  addressing such a letter to me, and using legal staff of the committee for the purpose     Well, there is another dimension that I think you should bear in  mind, Tom  The President of the United States is indirectly involved in this case, because what  is being questioned is the exercise of his appointment power  And that may possibly have some  bearing on how the Justice Department looks at the case, and that ties in with a question that  Governor Coldwell raised before  All I suggest is that you keep this dimension in mind      And it’s an authority that [US] Presidents traditionally and  constitutionally will seek to defend  That is the point of my comment      Very good  Any other questions?  I think we have probably gone  as far as we can on informing ourselves about this lawsuit      Very good    I think Tom has already answered that question    Gentlemen, I need hardly say that life at the Federal Reserve is  very interesting  We’ll turn to our regular business     [End of executive session]    We would like to have the report of the Foreign Exchange  [Trading] Desk    Are there any questions?    Any other questions?  Thank you, Miss Green  And now a motion  to approve would be in order  I take it that the transactions for the Desk are approved  I should  have asked you this question, Miss Green  Is the Bundesbank participating in trading in sterling?   Did it intervene?    Did it not intervene at any time?    In sterling, since the 53 billion standby [unintelligible]--    All right  Thank you  May we have your recommendations, Ms  Greene?    Very well  Any objection on the part of the Committee?    Any further questions?    All right, is the Committee of a mind to approve a renewal of the  Mexican drawing?   SPEAKER(?)  Moved and seconded    Are there any questions?    SPEAKER(?)  Is this a renewal?    And we are not likely to  No action is required on the Italian  [unintelligible]  Any further questions?  We owe you thanks, Miss Green  We will now have  Mr Gramley’s report on the economy    We’re ready for the economics discussion, and let me just say one  word before we turn to that  At the last meeting, the Committee decided to expand on the  discussion in the Redbook, and particularly to gather information from our [Reserve Bank]  directors concerning the rate of utilization of industrial capacity  Mr Mayo took the  responsibility of monitoring that effort, and this month’s Redbook is a great improvement over  the past  I have been very pleased with it, and I hope the rest of the Committee has found it of  substantial benefit as well     Well, we’re ready for our discussion, and I think what we would want to do in the course  of this discussion is to not concentrate on detail and technical matters but either reinforce or  question the judgments that Mr Gramley has expressed  Any comment?    You mean that people are saving up a little money to spend on  automobile travel in conjunction with vacation, etc?  That is the thought?    Well, should this be the peak season?  Or is not the peak season  ahead of us?  If 80 to 85 percent now, it might well be 95 percent for the first weeks in July      Below last?    Below last year’s  That’s very, very--   SPEAKER(?)  Mr Chairman, we had a conversation over the weekend with the May  company people, headquartered in St Louis, and they’re normally quite sensitive to trends   They’re still totally on dead center in terms of not having a real feel for which way consumer  spending is going on the retail level  They’re cautious  They’re not pessimistic, but they’re far  from exuberant in terms of their analysis of the rest of the year    Mr Partee    Thank you  Mr Black, please    Any other question or comment?  Mr Wallich, please    Lyle, what does the Federated Department Store price index  show?    I haven’t either, and it would be interesting to check because that  may provide an answer     SPEAKER(?)  At least a partial--    A partial answer to Mr Coldwell’s question    Mr Partee    Well, the homebuilders and realtors I’ve talked to on that  subject--I was surprised at the optimism that was being expressed by this very unscientific  sample of mine  Do you have any observations on that subject, Mr Jackson?    The permits figure is up, and multifamily starts were up rather  sharply last month    Mr Winn?    Very interesting point  Any other comments on the economy?   Well, we are in position to move ahead, and perhaps we will take a coffee break and resume our  deliberations after     [Coffee break]    We are ready to start Mr Sternlight’s report     6/22/76 - 23 -            Thank you, Mr Sternlight  It’s generally true that the operations  at the [Domestic Trading] Desk are carried out with considerable skill, and I thought that during  this past month it was especially true    Without implying any preference [unintelligible] operation over  against another, if he had mechanical failures, you’d fall back on the federal funds rate because  you had nothing else    Any other question or comment on the Sternlight report?       6/22/76 - 25 -            I think these [simulation] operations are useful  If there’s going to  be any change in the method of operating at the Desk, I think we need a little more experience,  and I think the observations that have been made here are helpful to the Committee in thinking  about our method or techniques of operating the Desk, but I don’t think we can decide, or should  try to decide, on a change in operating the Desk at this time  We need a little more time to  observe what has been happening and to study the simulation exercises a little more for a longer  period  If the members of the Committee are ready to change or want to discuss a change now,  of course, we can do that  I doubt that we could--    Are we ready for that?  If we are ready to include nonborrowed  reserves as one of the factors to follow directly in the Desk’s operations, let’s indicate that by a  show of hands  Well, the majority of the Committee clearly wants a little more time to--    Well, I haven’t kept precise track of the period, but let’s make it a  six-month period     6/22/76 - 26 -            Anything else to be said on that subject?  Any further comment on  Mr Sternlight’s report?  If not, a motion to approve operations at the Desk would be in order   Motion made and seconded    Thank you, Mr Axilrod  Any questions to Mr Axilrod?    Any other questions?  Yes, Mr Black    I think we’d better stop at this point--we might become a little  more precise  Any other question or comment?  Yes, Mr Wallich    I think that’s right  Any other comments?  Well, if not, we are  ready to turn to our discussion of monetary policy and the kind of directive we want to issue to  the New York Bank     I think we have a relatively easy job to do this morning  As far as I can see, the economy  is expanding quite satisfactorily  The decline in the rate of growth of real GNP during the  second quarter is, by and large, I think a very healthy development--the continuation of the rate  of growth of 8-3/4 percent would generate boom conditions very quickly     Now, a good deal has been said this morning about the lull in consumer buying  As all of  us know, during the course of business cycle expansions, lulls of this type are a very frequent  occurrence, and our more recent weekly data on retail sales and on automobile sales suggest that  the lull is just about over  And in any event, there is a significant pickup in activity in the  durable goods sector, and I find the new orders figures very telling, particularly new orders for  business capital goods     The stock market certainly is reflecting a great deal of continuing and probably expanding  optimism  As for money and interest rates, since mid-April, we’ve had a considerable run-up in  short-term interest rates and a modest run-up in long-term rates  More recently, interest rates in     6/22/76 - 28 -           the short-term markets have stabilized  The move that we’ve taken, I think, has been a prudent  one, though we have received some criticism; by and large, it has been well absorbed by the  markets, and it has been well received, by and large, as well, by the business and financial  community     My own feeling is that specifications under alternative B as indicated on page 6 in the  Bluebook are close to the mark  Some stability in money markets is indicated at the present  time  And actually, I would like the fed funds rate specification a little better if it were 5-1/4 to  5-3/4 rather than 5 to 6,  but I could go either way     So as I see it, we are in a period where we ought to mark time, and I don’t think that we  have a very difficult problem to deal with at this meeting  But these are my simple thoughts, so  let’s hear from members of the Committee  Who would  like to speak?  Yes, Mr Jackson    Mr Partee    Thank you, Mr Partee Mr Mayo now, please    One factual point  I have just checked with Mr Broida, we would  be releasing our policy--what do we call the policy actions?     --the policy record--on July 23, and the testifying would take place  on July 22     Thank you, Mr Mayo  Mr Eastburn now, please    Thank you, Mr Eastburn  Mr Coldwell now, please    Thank you, Mr Coldwell  Mr Volcker now, please    Thank you, Mr Volcker  Mr MacLaury now please    All right  Thank you, Mr MacLaury  Who would like to speak  next?  Mr Guffey, then Mr Morris    No, no  Mr Sternlight, would you explain how you operate at the  Desk in view of our recent practices?    That zone of indifference would not be equal to the full M1 range    If it were 4 to 8?      No, I don’t think so    Or at the top    Thank you, Mr Guffey  Mr Morris?    Well, I think that question is better addressed not to Mr Sternlight  but to members of the Committee  Let me attempt an answer, and members of the Committee  may wish to comment  As of today, I would like some stability for a little while  The money  markets have stabilized, the monetary growth rates have moderated  I see no clear reason for  moving in one direction or the other     To move down to as low as 5, well, if the general expectation--and this extends far beyond  our own staff--for some rise in short-term interest is valid--it’s certainly widely held--then to  move down to 5 and then move up again very shortly I think would create unnecessary flurries   And likewise, to move up to 6, well, there is an element of uncertainty  Mr Partee underlined it,  Mr Coldwell did  I did not, but I don’t differ, really, from their views  I doubt whether that is a  wise decision today  Two weeks later, one month later, it may well be    That’s well worth keeping in mind    It would be interpreted to indicate some movement toward a  tightening today   SPEAKER(?)  [Unintelligible]     6/22/76 - 33 -            Yes, I do  I think that is a valid observation    Thank you, Mr Wallich  Mr Fossum now, please      It’s an interesting comment  Is that the deepest in the country or  [just] in your District?    That’s the way I read the Redbook      Thank you, Mr Fossum  Mr Baughman now, please    Very good  Thank you, Mr Baughman  Mr Balles, next please    Well, that’s a very interesting comment  I only wish we could  have the time to pursue it  The only comment that I would make is you have been entirely silent  on the velocity factor  [There] has been a change, and the change seems to be the dramatic  increase that we have had over three quarters that isn’t being repeated in the present quarter and  may not be in the succeeding quarters    I don’t think that the level we had in the third and fourth quarters  of last year and the first quarter of this year is going to be repeated  I think we will get a little  lower level     6/22/76 - 36 -            If that is Mr Altmann’s comment, I don’t think you should take it  too seriously    If we think a bias is misleading us, there is a very simple way of  correcting for it and that is to have a lower rate of growth for the next 12 months     We’ll have difficulty either way, I think--    I think we have had a useful discussion  There are differences  among us that I think are at the margin  I think we could start, perhaps, with the fed funds range      6/22/76 - 38 -           There is some margin within the Committee in favor of a 5-1/4 to 5-3/4 range, but let’s test that  with a show of hands from the members of the Committee [to see whether] that range will be  generally acceptable [if] not necessarily preferred  And then we can test another range, a wider  range, if that is the Committee’s wish  All those who can be relatively comfortable with a range  of 5-1/4 to 5-3/4 for the fed funds rate range will kindly indicate that by raising your hands      Would you want that tested?  No strong wish as to the range for  M1  I think that, on the basis of the record before me, a range of 4 to 8 seems to be preferred by  a thin majority of the Committee  I think there is a good case to be made for 3-1/2 to 7-1/2 and  that might be a compromise for the views expressed all around the table  Let’s choose between  the two  Those who prefer 4 to 8 as over against 3-1/2 to 7-1/2, would you kindly raise your  hands  Three     Now let’s see if our arithmetic is correct  Those who prefer 3-1/2 to 7-1/2 as over against  4 to 8, would you kindly raise your hands  Eight     I think that implies that M2 would be 6 to 10 rather than 6-1/2 to 10-1/2     Now there is a question about the directive  Now logic is something to be recognized but  not always to be effected  Logically we have the money market directive if we go with a 5-1/4 to  5-3/4 percent range  But as I say, logic is not and should not always be respected in life  Let us  have a show of hands  Those who prefer a money market directive and the language of the  money market directive which reads, “The Committee seeks to maintain prevailing bank reserves  and money market conditions over a period ahead, etc”    Now those who would prefer a money market directive as over against the monetary  aggregates directive will kindly raise their hands  Three     It’s reasonably clear that the monetary aggregate directive will express the sentiment of the  majority somewhat better, and I prefer it myself, even though logic is thrown to the wind    We were proceeding in this meeting on the principle of assigning  approximately equal weights for the two    Any view on that?    I have not observed any degree of uncertainty with regard to  projections of M1    Any sentiment to move away from the approximate equality?   Apparently there is no such sentiment     I think we are ready for a vote, and we’ll be voting on the following  a monetary  aggregates directive; a range for M1 at 3-1/2 to 7-1/2; a range for M2 of 6 to 10; a range for the  federal funds rate at 5-1/4 to 5-3/4; and understanding that M1 and M2 will receive  approximately equal weight at the Desk Any questions?  We are ready for the vote     Small or large    Well, I think that, I must confess I’ve gotten into the habit of  having so much to do that I have paid very little attention to the general paragraphs--I think you  are right  It can be interpreted as a blessing by us  I would just omit the word and have it read,  “the advance in the index of average wage  rates was larger in May than the gains in other recent  months,” and so on  I don’t think we ought to bless it by characterizing it one way or the other    Well, I think that point is very well taken  Any objection to  deleting the word moderate on 16?      Well, I think that’s a very good observation  All right, our staff  will do that     Let’s turn to item 6, and this arises because of Mr Holland’s resignation  If it’s  satisfactory to the Committee, I would suggest that the responsibility previously borne by Mr  Holland now be assumed by Governor Gardner and in his absence by Governor Coldwell  Any  objections to that?  All right    Now, item 7 may or may not evoke a debate  There is one reason--quite apart from the  factor of time--for delaying it, and that is that Mr Holmes is absent  All right, we simply have to  confirm the date for the next meeting, and I take it there is no question involving that, and  therefore we conclude our meeting at a very early hour     SPEAKER(?)  Could we note for the record that we started at 930 this morning and had  an executive session, and nevertheless we ended at 1 pm   END OF MEETING      "
105,1976-07-19,"  Gentlemen, we have a brief meeting scheduled for this afternoon   There are two items to take up  First of all, when I testified recently--what was the date?    Yes, June 30, before the Joint Economic Committee, I was asked  about the Memorandum of Discussion by Mr Reuss and also by Mr Proxmire  I’d previously  heard from Mr Proxmire, who had written me a letter, and both urged that the Committee  reconsider its decision to eliminate the Memorandum of Discussion  Now, I believe that Mr  Broida sent you a copy of the transcript of that discussion  As I recall, at the hearing, I dealt with  the questions adequately, or at least I thought so at the time  The Memorandum of Discussion  and what we should do with it was considered very carefully by the [Committee], and we  discussed it formally over a period of several months, and informally all of us have thought  about it for some time     There’s only one new fact that I’m aware of, which is that, since we reached that decision,  the only criticisms that we’ve received have come from these two gentlemen  And I indicated  that at the hearing, and since then I haven’t heard a word from anyone, either directly or  indirectly  That is the only new fact that I know of  Now the question is before the Committee  [unintelligible] to reconsider that decision  If so we shall do so  If not, we shall inform the two  chairmen that this was taken up by the Committee and we’ve decided that the earlier decision  should stand  What is the wish of the Committee?    Well, we haven’t had any outcry  That is really what we  anticipated--we anticipated that there would be very little criticism, but I must say I did     7/19-20/76 - 2 -   anticipate more than we’ve received  To repeat, we’ve been criticized by Mr Reuss, by Mr  Proxmire, and I’m not aware of any other criticism from any other source  Yes, Mr MacLaury    Well, I don’t think, if I may say this, I don’t think that the  Supreme Court analogy which Mr Jackson has just made played any role in the Committee’s  decision  Mr Jackson has given his interpretation  Well, that’s the way he looks at it  I see the  world a little differently  The real question is not whether you agree with Mr Jackson’s special,  personal interpretation  The real question is whether or not you believe that we ought to  seriously sit down and reappraise our earlier decision on the Memorandum of Discussion    Well, that document will be in the public domain    Well, let’s be clear about one thing  Do we want a fresh debate on  the Memorandum of Discussion?  Let us not go into the merits one way or the other  Let us have  a show of hands on that   SPEAKER(?)  Voting members or all?     7/19-20/76 - 3 -    What’s that?   SPEAKER(?)  Just members or all of us?    Yes, well, let’s have a show of hands of all of us    Well, perhaps Mr Broida can  I do not recall specifically enough    But that’s not the question    I don’t recall  Yes, Mr Mayo    Yes, please    Mr Wallich   MRWALLICH  Well, if that plaintiff wins his suit, would that mean that, subsequently,  Memoranda of Discussion might have to be presented or a precedent set so that others could  request the same thing?    Mr Volcker now    Well, I don’t know if it’s a correct judgment or not  I am  impressed by the fact that no one, literally, apart from these two gentlemen, has raised any  question, in writing or orally, directly or indirectly, with me     And while I did not anticipate much criticism, we’ve looked into the matter, and Joe Coyne  explored this for me  I did anticipate a number of protests  And there haven’t been any  Now  Mr Reuss at the hearing called on the journalistic fraternity, you see, to communicate with him   Well, I haven’t heard from one [journalist]  I haven’t seen an item in the press on this  On the  other hand--what do you call it, the monthly policy record?    Well, the press is paying a good deal more attention to that, I think  for two reasons  First, because we put it out more promptly, and second it’s a more informative  document than it used to be  And in my testimony, I indicated that our staff is learning how to  do this job  And I meant that most sincerely  I’ve had numerous conversations with our staff on  that, and I think that the monthly policy record is going to improve in quality and become  increasingly more informative  I think the public is far better informed now than it was before   And as this document improves, that will continue to be the case     Well, gentlemen, we’re almost involved in a debate, whereas the real question at the  moment is whether or not we should be debating this issue  And therefore, I return to the  question--does the Committee want to reconsider our earlier decision with respect to the  Memorandum  If there is sufficient interest in that, we’ll schedule a full-fledged debate on it and  take whatever time is needed  You have a question, Mr Guffey    Any other comments?    Oh yes, that’s exactly what we’re doing now    We’ve reconsidered it before the question of reconsideration is  put     That’s exactly what I intend to do [unintelligible] in the response    I listened with the gravest of interest to Mr Guffey’s comment,  and I cannot very well suggest any such legislation to the Congress  But I would welcome it   Because, in that case, if there were such legislation--listen carefully, Tom--I assume that the  court would not interfere, and that we could withhold that Memorandum of Discussion for a full  five years as being the will of the Congress that we do so    Well, it could be the language of the statute  Now, I’m not a  lawyer, but you could write the statute indicating that this is the law without regard to what any  other statute may say on a related subject     7/19-20/76 - 7 -    And also, I think such a statute would help enormously in the  whole debate on secrecy  But I don’t think such a statute is going to be written by the Congress,  and I don’t think I’d be in a good position to suggest it, but I would welcome it  Yes, Mr Roos    Well, we could turn the tables here  Here we have two members  of the Congress urging us in effect to maintain secrecy over a period of five years  And this is  something we’re not willing to do because we believe in openness and therefore we will reveal  our doings after a period of only approximately 30 days  And that’s exactly what the monthly  policy record does     Now, it [omits] one thing, and one thing only  It omits the names of individuals  But after  all, what the public wants to know is the thinking, the range of facts, the range of considerations  that went into the Committee decision  I do think that the monthly policy record will have to be  expanded considerably  It should become a richer document than it is  And I think the second  one was better than the first, and the third will be better than the second  I think our staff has to  learn how to do this job better than it has yet done it  This could be an artful letter to write, and  let me call on you for assistance on that letter    Oh no, no, no, no, no--   SPEAKER(?)  Well, [unintelligible] does our answer to this request have any bearing on  what Congress might do on the Government in the Sunshine bill?    I doubt it  I doubt it very much  What does have a bearing on it,  I’m afraid, and this is surmise on my part, is the pronouncement that Mr Carter made on the  Sunshine [bill] the other day  Now I believe that Mr Carter referred to [unintelligible]      7/19-20/76 - 8 -   Unfortunately, the Sunshine legislation as it stands in the Congress is very imperfectly  understood by members of the Congress     And the fact is, or at least I’m so informed time and again by our counsel, no Sunshine  statute in any of our states calls for a verbatim transcript  And if the present legislation were  amended to eliminate the requirement of a verbatim transcript, not all of our criticisms or  difficulties would be met, but the greater part of our difficulty would just vanish  We consider  ourselves in reasonably good shape  But I doubt if Mr Carter knows this, and I would bet that,  of the 535 legislators on Capitol Hill, you couldn’t find a half dozen who know this and  understand it  That’s the difficulty with the legislation  [Its] name is so attractive  Particularly  at this time  However, there is this about the political situation--I think some understanding is  gaining on Capitol Hill     Mr Horton is going to offer an amendment, and he may offer more than one  Well,  suppose that the Horton amendment carries  Very well, then Sunshine legislation will still pass  the Congress, the House overwhelmingly--[but] with the Horton amendment--and we will be in  reasonably good shape  Now, next, if the Horton amendment fails, then I think members of the  Congress will still overwhelmingly vote for that legislation  What I’m saying is, therefore, that  those who understand the difficulties that the Sunshine bill [present for] the Federal Reserve and  one or two other agencies are not taking any significant political risks in voting for the Horton  amendment  They’ll still be for the Sunshine legislation, you see, no matter which way the  Horton amendment goes  And this is now understood by a fair number of congressmen     Also, I’ve been away for a few days--and Mr Guenther couldn’t help, he’s been away,  too--but the “Dear Colleague” letter has been prepared by Mr Horton’s office, and it’s an  excellent letter  And a fair number of signatures of Republicans and Democrats are now attached  to it, and we’re going to have the strong support of Mr Pepper, a Florida Congressman who has  considerable influence, I think, as an elder statesman in the House of Representatives and a man  who’s known for his liberal views  Do you have any knowledge of that, Tom?  How that is  progressing?    Well, we have a chance, anyhow  Three months ago, two months  ago, it seemed almost hopeless, but we kept on fighting  And we will continue    Well, you know calling [unintelligible] Abzug is not doing us any  injury in the House of Representatives    --whether that is entirely fair or not, I don’t know, but I’m not  complaining  Any other question or comment on this first item of reconsideration?   SPEAKER(?)  It seems to me, Mr Chairman, that Mr Guffey has summarized it about  right  We did consider all available facts, and there has been no substantial change in the  facts--therefore, no substantial basis for changing our views      That is the letter that will be carefully written  I’ll do my best to  do that--emphasizing the new document and the plans for improving it and how much more  enlightening it is going to be    No, it will not be  It will continue to be an analytic document,  whereas in the Memorandum of Discussion you have the flow of conversation back and forth  and therefore, to make much sense of it, you have to analyze it and distill what you can gather  from it    That’s a good point  I’ll keep that in mind    I think it can be done  I think the sentiment of the Committee was  that this should not be done  That would also be my view  I think when you start mentioning  names, identifying positions with individuals, one is inviting a certain emphasis on differences   And remember that this is a document that is now released approximately 30 days after our  meeting  To have the differences displayed by name could excite some of us unduly to extreme  utterances  And I think also that our critics on Capitol Hill and elsewhere would maximize and     7/19-20/76 - 10 -   exaggerate the differences among us, and the unity and the consensus that we should be striving  for might well be lost in the process    Well, that option is still available  As a matter of fact, we have an  opportunity right now because Mr Broida indicates to me that we should have a formal vote on  the reconsideration   SPEAKER(?)  Mr Chairman let me just suggest that both the real problem and the  strategy with our congressional friends would be ill served by reconsideration at this time  And I  say that simply [because] we have a request only from the chairmen of these committees  They  do not [unintelligible] at this Committee, and for us to react too quickly because they requested it  would be viewed by some of our very strong friends, I am afraid, as something [unintelligible]  and I would be reluctant to do that at this juncture    That’s right  The vote will be not to change our earlier action   Not to rescind    All right  Let’s put it positively  We’ll vote to reaffirm our earlier  action  We’re voting on that motion    Very good  Let’s turn to the second item, which is the lawsuit  [regarding the appointment process for Reserve Bank Presidents]       7/19-20/76 - 11 -   We discussed this lawsuit at the last meeting of the Committee, and we discussed it once  again in our telephone conference  Now in that telephone conference, members of the Board did  not participate apart from myself, but all the Bank Presidents did  The reason it was done that  way was that I had heard about a criticism coming from a Bank President, and therefore I wanted  to learn what I could about the sentiments of [all the] Presidents  Therefore, we could decide  what other action to take     My understanding of that telephone conference was that every one of the Bank Presidents  was generally satisfied with the procedures that we had developed for handling the lawsuit  Mr  O’Connell would you inform us now on this lawsuit’s status?    Well, I don’t understand that at all    He seems to be taking on the Senate as well as this Committee    Well, but encourage him in that    All right    What other argument?  I haven’t read this supplement    How does he argue the case that the five voting Bank Presidents  have done injury to him as an owner of Treasury securities?  Does he try to substantiate that?    Well, does he make any attempt to substantiate his allegation?    Well, you know, I haven’t done this recently, but I’ve made an  analysis of the voting by members of the Board and by the Bank Presidents and there is no  difference, really  And I believe that this is true  You’ve been examining this figure    No, go ahead, please    You know, I’d love to argue the economics of his complaint,  which is something very different from the law, because if his Treasury securities are worth  anything at all, it’s in large part due to the existence of this Committee and how this Committee  has functioned over the years  It’s been a restraining force, and inflation has not ruined Mr  Reuss  He has this Committee to thank more than any other group or individual  Left to himself,  he’d even be in ruins  We saved him from his mistakes    Tom, what are you going to do in this instance?  Merely argue on  the point of standing, or do you go beyond that?     7/19-20/76 - 15 -    Tom, let me just pursue this question of procedure  Assuming that  you proceed in this fashion, then what are the alternatives before the court?    All right    All right  You present your case    Now what about the plaintiff?  Is he finished now?    Can he present counterarguments?    All right  Do you have the opportunity to respond once again?    Motion for summary judgment means--?    Now wait, trial means that there will be oral pleadings?    Oral testimony by attorneys or attorneys and witnesses?    All right  Yes?   SPEAKER(?)  Just one question?  Tom, in the telephone conference a question was raised  [unintelligible] and your answer, as I remember, was that [there is] enough time to bring in  outside counsel  It might be advisable later, [unintelligible]    Well, I’m glad to see that attorneys pay attention to psychological  factors, something that economists are beginning to do  Any other question or comment?  Yes,  Mr Balles    I think it’s very wise not to raise that question, but if you  incidentally discover these facts, just file them away for some use I can’t anticipate  But it  would be useful to know the answer to that question  Let’s not pursue it in any deliberate  manner    Members of that committee are giving some thought to that  possibility--some members--but I have not raised that question, and I’m not going to  I think it  would be a mistake  It’s a question that obviously arises really in the minds of different  individuals, and that thought has already been conveyed to me    Exactly--oh no    Any other questions or comments?   SPEAKER(?)  One question on timing [unintelligible]  What kind of time, Tom, is  involved in possible [unintelligible]    What do you know about this judge, Tom, that has a bearing on  the outcome?    Gentlemen, a motion to adjourn would be welcomed by the chair   SPEAKER(?)  I move we adjourn    A motion has been made  Any objection?  All right   [End of executive session]   July 20, 1976    Gentlemen, we will get under way now, please  We need to act  first of all on the minutes of the June meeting  Any problem with regard to the minutes?  Is  anyone bold enough to move that the minutes be approved?  The motion has been made,  presumably seconded, no objections are being raised, so therefore we’re ready for Mr Pardee,  who will instruct us on foreign currency movements    Thank you  I understood Italy will repay part of its debt to us in a  few days  Is that correct?    Good, any questions?    Has the new president been inaugurated?    You mean they fear damage before he takes office?    All right, Mr Wallich, please    Well, this might be very timely in view of what happened  yesterday, and more so today, in the gold market  Perhaps before we do that, would someone  report on precise movement on the price of gold    Down to $110 is it?    Oh yeah?  Let no one say that prices do not move down  All right,  Mr Wallich, please    What did you learn about prices?  Prices charged by the BIS to the  central banks which purchased gold  I--    --I don’t mean detailed, but what percent did the price deviate  from the auction price?    Well, it’s very interesting, up to a point even instructive  Thank  you very much  Any questions?    Yes?    Any large denomination currency [unintelligible]    Any large denomination currency left in the Dallas Bank?    [Unintelligible] confused these purchases of real estate  Where  are they taking place, in Mexico, or in the US, or both?    All right now, Mr Pardee, do you have any recommendations to  the Committee?    You’ve heard the recommendations, and what is the will of the  Committee--   SPEAKER(?)  So moved   SPEAKER(?)  Seconded    The recommendations made by the Manager, hearing no  objections, are approved  We also need to confirm the transactions that have taken place at the  Desk  Is there a motion to approve and confirm?     7/19-20/76 - 24 -    Motion made seconded, no objection  Let’s hear from Mr  Reynolds      Thank you Mr Reynolds  Any questions?    Yes, Mr Wallich    Any other questions or comments?  Very well, let’s turn to the  domestic economy  Mr Gramley    [Unintelligible] Mr Gramley, and thanks to you, Mr Zeisel  I  think we ought to have now a discussion of the condition of the economy and the outlook, and let  us defer consideration of alternative monetary policy until we turn to the next subject, namely  our longer-term targets  Who would like to comment on the economy?  In particular, you ought  to be emphasizing, or calling attention to, or questioning factual observations and a little  comment made by Mr Zeisel  Mr Wallich    All right, thank you  Mr Black, please    What was the revision, Lyle?    What was it down, Lyle?    Did you reduce the estimate, and if so, what were the factors that  led you to that projection?    I think there may be a little confusion here  What we are talking  about is an estimate of business fixed investment in the second quarter  Oh, oh, well, I’m sorry,  then I was confused  I think Mr Black has raised a fair question  Why lower the projections?   The fact that shipments declined is not a good reason  If orders had declined that would be a  good reason    You didn’t confuse the issue, no, I was confused not by anything  you said  Well, I don’t think you’ve gotten a good answer so far    Well, I would differ on that judgment, but I think Mr Gramley is  certainly right in saying that the difference between the two figures, putting the direction aside, is  minor    Thank you  Mr Morris, let us hear from you now, please    I think that can be best considered when we turn to the longer-  range targets  [What we are] considering now is the condition of the economy and economic  prospects    Just to add an interpretative word, you have the extravagant  increases in sensitive raw material prices  And that has been going on for some time, but the  wage behavior is significantly better than one might have expected, and therefore the relatively  optimistic price projection is not unreasonable  I would question it myself, but I don’t think it’s     7/19-20/76 - 29 -   unreasonable in view of recent wage behavior  That, of course, was contained in your reference  to unit labor costs    All right, any further comment or question, Mr Morris?    Thank you  Mr Eastburn, please    Can you explain that, Lyle?    You still haven’t explained what systematic bias they have in  mind    In other words, the systematic bias adjustment may really be a  description of the past     7/19-20/76 - 30 -   Do they publish the figures in both forms?    Thank you  Mr Kimbrel now, please    Well, that plus relative ease in financial markets and a strong stock  market are also propelling strong [unintelligible]    In other words, I think that you’ve got a good deal more to go on  than past cyclical experience    All right  Mr Partee now, please   Thank you, Mr Partee  Mr Coldwell    Very good  Mr Winn now please    So are commercial banks    This recent banking survey [indicates they] have no interest in  multifamily housing    They look more favorable, but these fellows have had bad  experience    Badly burned    That reinforces Mr Partee’s observation    It’s a double box    What does an artificial basement mean?    How good are these figures on sales?    How good a sample?    To what degree do we have rent controls in our country at the  present time?  Does anyone have the facts in hand?     7/19-20/76 - 37 -    Well, yes, but I’m thinking of governmental controls    Well, they’re spread around the country, but I don’t know to what  degree  Could we have a factual reading on that?    Very good  And I think we’re having an excellent economic  discussion today  Mr Baughman    But it’s very small--those figures are so tiny    No, no, I mean the projected full-employment surplus  The--    No, I’m using the term surplus as a [unintelligible]  You take the  projected figures on the full-employment surplus [unintelligible] they are very small, and I don’t  think the trend is of any significance    I would dissent from that judgment  I think if we had a significant  increase in the deficit, it would have negative effects on the economy at the present time    Thank you, Mr Baughman  Mr Volcker, do you have any  comment?    Mr Balles, please    Well, I want to comment on this point That’s the mechanical  model, but then you introduce a judgmental factor, and at the end you don’t know what the  monetary assumption is     7/19-20/76 - 39 -    So does Lyle    Yes, please    Well, that's a significant factor    Be careful  When you talk about “average,” the average may be a  long-run trend average or an average for the expansion phase of a business cycle or an average  for successive phases of the expansion    Now, historically, the latter [meanings feature a] progressive  diminution on the average  But there is second fact to it, and that is changing financial  technology, which has been extraordinarily rapid  Therefore, [business] cycle experience is one     7/19-20/76 - 41 -   guide, and then [there are] these changes in financial technology partly induced by our own  regulations  It’s very hard to judge the future--and I didn’t know the staff projection of  5 percent; I just heard it today for the first time--but if I had been asked to make a judgment, it  would have been in that area--above [the] average cyclical experience and certainly above [the]  average secular experience    Well, Lyle has moved from 8 percent to 5 percent  The question is  should he have moved further  But you know, after you do all that, there’s still a judgment, and  that’s partly mechanical analyses as to where these are going     All right, before we break for coffee, would anyone else want to comment on the  economy?  If not, I take it this part of our discussion is at an end, and individuals may feel free to  return to the subject as they see fit   [Coffee break]    Gentlemen, we are ready to resume our meeting and return to our  discussion of the monetary aggregates over the coming year  I would like to make a few  observations on that subject by way of introducing our discussion     I think we always have to remind ourselves that our objective is not to achieve this or that  rate of monetary growth that we project  Our objective is to do what we can in the monetary  sphere to further our basic economic objective--that is the growth of our economy, a reduction of  unemployment, and reductions as well in the rate of inflation  Nevertheless, it’s useful to look  back and see to what degree our projections have been borne out     Between the second quarter of 1975 and the second quarter of 1976, the rate of growth of  M1 was 52 percent, just a shade above the lower limit of M1 as we projected it a year ago  The  rate of growth of M2 was 98 percent, a little above the midpoint of M2 as we projected it a year  ago  The rate of growth of M3 was 121 percent, or just about at the upper limit of our projection  of M3 a year ago  So if others want to judge us by our projections, we’ve once again done quite  well  But I want to repeat that that’s not the way in which we want to judge ourselves     We are all keenly aware of the very sharp rate of growth of M1 during the second quarter   The rate of growth, I believe, was 84 percent  Even so, the rate of growth for the year, including  that quarter, was merely 52 percent  In other words, we had a sizable overshoot in that quarter,  and we had undershoots in earlier quarters  So let’s keep that fact in mind as our discussion  proceeds     Now there are certain principles that we have been observing and that I think we should  continue to observe in setting longer-range targets  One is simplicity in formulation  We don’t  want to inform the public of some complicated scheme of monetary calculation or monetary  projection  We want to state something that is simple and can be readily understood  We’ve  done that hitherto, and I think we must continue to do that       7/19-20/76 - 42 -   Second, and I don’t think one could overemphasize the importance of it, we must  absolutely avoid any appearance of shifting our procedures  We have been making projections  for a 12-month period, as the current [congressional] resolution requires  We’ve been doing it on  the basis of a quarterly base  Now there ought to be a decisive reason for a change, and if there  is a decisive reason for a change it ought to apply not only to what we do today but to some  indefinite future  We don’t want to be charged with manipulating our figures  We can be  charged with stupidity; I can take that  We can be charged with incompetence; I can take that   But we must not be charged with a lack of integrity or with manipulation  The greatest asset that  we have is our integrity, and we’ve got to keep that in mind in what we do     Now today, as always, the arguments are for moving in one direction or another with  respect to our growth rates, but I think that our discussion today is likely to revolve around the  question, Do we leave the ranges unchanged or do we lower them?  I doubt if there will be much  sentiment in the Committee to raise them, and I will proceed on that assumption     Let me turn primarily to M1, though I’ll also have some observations to make about M2  and M3  I think there are some cogent arguments for lowering the range at this time  First of all,  the prospect for continued expansion of the economy is good, and an additional small step  toward a growth range that is more nearly in keeping with reasonable price stability could very  well be defended  The second argument for lowering the range might be that we had an  overshoot in the second quarter and that we may need to offset that overshoot     There are arguments also for leaving the [growth] range [for M1] unchanged  We’ve had a  very good economic discussion today  Some divergence of views were expressed  I happen to  be more optimistic than the staff  Nevertheless, I think it’s only fair to recognize that the real  economy has recently shown some signs of hesitation  Consumer spending rose considerably  less in the second quarter than in the first  The growth in industrial production has tapered off,  and residential construction has been weaker than many of us had expected  Now I believe that  these uncertainties are likely to be resolved on the side of renewed, rather vigorous expansion in  the late summer and fall  Business capital spending should be gathering strength     The general public would not understand a move toward a restriction at the present time   But once evidence of renewed vigorous expansion appears three months later, I think the public  would interpret [that as the] more appropriate time to move toward a firmer monetary policy    [The public] would understand that we are doing better  That is one reason for not rocking the  boat at the present time and for leaving the growth range for M1 unchanged     Now a second reason is that velocity [growth], or the rate of growth of the turnover of  money, has definitely moderated, and we cannot reasonably expect anything like the rapid  increase of velocity that occurred last year to continue  That is a second reason for not lowering  the growth range for M1, for leaving it unchanged     The third reason is that, [although] the overshoot [in the growth of M1] that occurred in the  second quarter was disturbing to us at the time and even in retrospect, it merely brought the  longer-run growth since early 1975 to a pace that is entirely consistent with the current  Committee range, and actually close to the lower limits       7/19-20/76 - 43 -   And finally, if some of us, or the Committee as a whole, would wish to make up for the  rapid growth of M1 in the second quarter, there is really no need to signal the move toward  restriction  We have a pretty wide range  We can do that as we move along from month to  month by aiming toward somewhat the lower part of the range  So as I think about the problem,  and I have pondered this over recent weeks as I know the rest of you have, I reach the conclusion  that there is really no clear reason to alter the range for M1 at the present time     Now, I feel a little differently about M2 and M3     All that I’m saying is, we had a range from the first quarter of  1976 to the first quarter of 1977 of 4-1/2 to 7 percent  I’m saying that the range from the second  quarter of 1976 to the second quarter of ’77 should continue to be 4-1/2 to 7 percent  That is my  suggestion to the Committee     As I say, I feel a little differently about M2 and M3  We had a considerable slowing in the  inflow of savings during June  Now the inflow in the early days of July was much improved  I  think most of us expect interest rates to rise later on in the year, although we’ll differ as to the  degree of rise  Therefore a lower rate of growth of M3 and of M2 is only to be expected   I’d be inclined to reduce the upper limit of M3 by 1 percentage point, that is have the range  run from 9 to 11 instead of 9 to 12  And I’d be inclined to reduce the upper limit of M2 by half a  percentage point and have it run from 7-1/2 to 9-1/2 instead of 7-1/2 to 10  But I [propose those  changes] not really for the reason that I indicated--[which was] mainly expectations with regard  to interest rate behavior and savings inflows  I would like to do it for another reason  By this  slight move we would continue to move gradually toward somewhat lower monetary growth  rates that are more consistent with general price stability  And I think we can do that quite  safely, quite reasonably, and the general stance of our policy both in the short run and over the  longer run I think would be well served by such moves     That’s my advice to the Committee  We are likely to have more than one opinion at this  table on a question that is so complicated  There’ll be arguments in all directions  Let’s hear  from members of the Committee  Mr Morris, please    Let me just make a comment  To do what we can in the way of  longer-run objectives is salutary  And that’s not inconsistent with anything that we have to do  today and in later meetings  But we have to do something very specific today, mainly to set  monetary growth ranges for the next 12 months for the interval between the second quarter of  this year and the second quarter of next year    Well, it’s a matter of judgment, you see  I think that over the  longer run, over the next few years, we should get our monetary growth ranges down to a level  where they are consistent with general price stability  That was the last point that I made  That’s  why, even though I would like to stay with M1 where it is as of today, I did want to make a  further move on M2 and M3 to continue what we’ve been doing in recent meetings--moving  slowly, taking small steps  But taking small steps that are prudent and that inch [forward] over  several years give us a chance to get back to something close to general price stability    I have stopped doing that    They were underestimated--excuse me?    You’re a good student, Mr Morris  I really paid no attention to  the credit proxy in thinking of our long-range target because I don’t understand it  I’m glad you  asked the question because I ought to understand it    All right, Mr Balles please    Now, just a question, are you referring to the figures that we  publish or are you referring to thinking by this Committee?    You would publish the moving averages    Well now, if your suggestion is that in putting out our weekly  reports on the money supply we add a column that would show a 13-week moving  average--without committing myself to that precise period--you are not going to have any  difficulty convincing me  I think it would be a good idea    Do we not?    Do we publish a 13-week or longer than three-month average?    Well, I think that a longer--    Now wait, now wait, the table that I visualize would show the  figure for the latest week and on the same line, an average covering, let us say, that week and the  12 preceding weeks, which means that the centering would be at the end of the period rather than  at the middle of the period    Well, you can interpret it that way, and I know all about that, but  the simple interpretation would be that this is an average for this week and the preceding 12  weeks  You have a longer-term average  You have now a four-week average--all right, a 13- week average; now there is some uncertainty here as to what we actually publish, and it’s  embarrassing to me not to know what we actually publish  Mr Jackson indicates that we were  already doing it    Does somebody know what we actually publish?    I would say the market reacts irrationally  I would also say that I  think there is some tendency on the part of this Committee--and because of this Committee, at  the Desk--also to react irrationally to these figures  I think we are in danger of becoming  excessively mechanical monetarists    Well, there are complex questions here  I do think that, during the  past year at least, we may have been overreacting in adjusting the federal funds rate to temporary  changes in monetary growth rates, and a little greater stability in the federal funds rate is an  alternative, really, to what you’re saying, Henry  But I think these are questions that we ought to  continue discussing and debating  Perhaps we ought to set aside a full meeting for a discussion  of this very question, and have good staff preparation for such a seminar    I hope you keep on repeating that suggestion, and I do think we  ought to plan for a seminar in the not too distant future on this question  Mr Partee, did you  have a comment?    I thank you, Mr Balles  Mr Guffey now, please    All right, thank you, Mr Guffey  Mr MacLaury now, please    Let me make one observation in timing  I can’t be at all sure as to  the date of the fall hearings under the concurrent resolution, but it would come normally either at  the end of October or early in November, and I would certainly do everything possible to have  that meeting come after the election rather than a few days before    Thank you, Mr MacLaury  Mr Wallich now, please    Let me just say a word about that  I want to be corrected if I’m  wrong, but my understanding is that the staff struggled hard with that question and finally came  up with the conclusion that probably [making] no change would be more consistent with leaving  growth rates for M1 unchanged; but this was a very delicate decision for the staff  Is that correct,  Mr Kichline?    Talking about M2    Thank you, Mr Wallich  Mr Black, may we hear from you?     7/19-20/76 - 52 -    Thank you, Mr Black  Mr Volcker now, please    Well, I must give you a thoroughly candid response  I think I can  explain it to your satisfaction and even to my own  But I do not think I can explain it to the  satisfaction of the general public, including the Congress and the international community    Thank you, Mr Volcker  Mr Eastburn, may we hear from you?    Thank you, Mr Eastburn  Mr Partee, may we hear from you?    Let me just interrupt to simply amplify what you said, actually   Here are the figures for M1, starting in March 1975, when we first begin making decisions under  the concurrent resolution     Between March 1975 and the second quarter of 1976, which includes the overshoot, the  annual rate of growth was 56 percent     From the second quarter of ’75 to the second quarter of ’76, it was 52 percent     The third quarter of ’75 to the second quarter of ’76 was 45 percent     The fourth quarter of ’75 to the second quarter of ’76 was 55 percent     That overshoot gets lost    To say nothing about the liquidity that has been built up    Thank you, Mr Partee  Mr Mayo, please    Thank you, Mr Mayo  Mr Kimbrel, may we have your views?    Thank you, Mr Kimbrel  Mr Coldwell    All right, I thank you  I’ll just comment on the last  There may be  a good time for experimenting along those lines, but I would hate to do it in any immediate  future because you can upset the markets, and no one can be sure of the consequences of a zone  of indifference for the federal funds rate  The consequences could be very serious in financial  markets  They could be beneficial over the long run, but I would anticipate a difficult learning  process    Yeah, but you know the minor wiggles in the market make  headlines today and they’re forgotten tomorrow  The same thing might happen under your  suggestion  Well, I think it’s a thoughtful comment, and we ought to consider it and have it  studied by our own staff, and possibly we ought to [bring in] some market specialists to discuss  various possibilities and get their reaction  And we would do that without indicating anything  about our specific thinking  since we can discuss a range of possibilities and get their reaction   They’d have no way of knowing which way we want to come out, or perhaps we ourselves at  that time wouldn’t know the way we want to come out  We want to learn  Well, thank you very  much    On the 27th of this month  I think it’s this coming Tuesday   That’s a week from today    Well, the market will when I testify--when will the June report be  released, Mr Broida?     No, that will be pretty much on the minds of some members of the  [congressional] committee, and its staff will examine this report undoubtedly, and questions will  be passed on to members of the committee  In fact, I will have to reread that report myself for  preparation    There will be talk all over the lot, I’m sure  I hope to be  adequately prepared    Thank you, Mr Winn  Mr Gardner?    With regard to M1 or also on M2 and M3?    I thought you did, but I wasn’t entirely sure  Thank you, Mr  Gardner    Mr Baughman    Thank you, Mr Baughman  Would anyone else like to speak?    It’s an increase in velocity    I think that would be the reaction  But what would trouble me  more is that we would be charged with altering our techniques--manipulating to choose one base  at one time, and the other time we choose another base  That would be most unfortunate  Now,  we may want to change our procedure, but if we do it [unintelligible] that would hold for an  indefinite future, and the indefinite future may be simply, oh, another year or so or two  But we  would be charged with manipulating and chicanery, and I’m so sure of that     Now we’re going to be charged by some with being stupid because of the overshoot  I  don’t mind that nearly so much as the charge of chicanery  We can survive a charge of stupidity,  particularly if we’re confident that our basic policy is right, as I do, because that charge will not  last  But in a world that has become so suspicious, particularly of government officials, and with  so many critics of the Federal Reserve charging us with secrecy and what not, I would be terribly  concerned about a charge of manipulation    I do think that we will have to do more explaining this time,  perhaps, than we have in the past to minimize this interpretation or criticism  We can’t prevent it  or eliminate it  If we were God’s angels on earth, we wouldn’t minimize it beyond a point     Well, gentlemen, I think we are ready to do some voting  I think that the majority of the  Committee favors leaving the range for M1 where it is, but I think we ought to test that  Will the  members of the Committee be good enough to indicate whether they are reasonably content with  leaving the range at 4-1/2 to 7    Well, we do these one by one, and then we can take the package  together  Now there’s more--it’s somewhat less clear about M2--though I think that, looking at  the summary, the majority seems to favor a range of 7-1/2 to 9-1/2, which means reducing the  upper limit of M2 by 1/2 a percentage point  Let’s have a show of hands on that range, 7-1/2 to  9-1/2 for M2    And again, I think a clear majority seems to favor a range of 9 to  11 for M3, which would mean a reduction of the upper limit by 1 percentage point  Let us test  that  The range of 9 to 11  How many would be reasonably content with that?    I think we are ready for a formal vote then  Well, I’m advised by  Mr Broida--whose counsel I invariably take, but other members of the Committee need not  follow me, obviously--that we have not voted on the longer-range targets formally in the past,  and by implication we should not do so at the present time    I must say I hear the explanation each time, and I understand it  when it’s made, but I forget it a minute after    All right, now, Mr Broida will state his reasons, and we will go on  to Mr O’Connell    Well, they sound like convincing reasons  I didn’t recall that at  all  Mr O’Connell    What is the judgment of the Committee?     7/19-20/76 - 60 -    I have some difficulty with that  In the monthly policy record, we  record dissents on formal votes only    Let’s see whether we have a practical problem or not  Assuming  that we took a formal vote, would any member of the Committee be definitely inclined to dissent  from a decision to have M1 at 4-1/2 to 7, and M2 at 7-1/2 to 9-1/2, and M3 at 9 to 11?    I think in view of the apparent path that no one is clearly inclined  to dissent at this meeting, I would suggest that we not have a formal vote today but that we give  the most serious consideration to having a formal vote in the future      We tested the opinion of the Committee, and apparently there will  be no dissent, but one or another of us may still change his mind, and I would leave that to a later  meeting and proceed today the way we have thus far this year  But I don’t feel strongly on the  issue  I think the considerations I have in mind, without spelling them out, are rather obvious   How many would want a formal vote today?  Members only  How many would prefer a formal  vote today?    Well, let’s postpone that in view of the majority sentiment  And I  do think we ought to move toward formal voting  I agree with Mr Partee and Mr Coldwell   Who’s the third one?  Mr Balles     Well, how many would be in favor, in principle, of formal voting, not as of today but in the  future  All right, I’m with you completely on it  I would prefer not to do it today     Well, all right, then, I think that we had better break for lunch and come back and pick up  the shorter-run targets and the directive  If we try to do it now I think we might hurry and rush  it  I think some of you will want to catch a plane, and you may have made arrangements;  therefore, 215   [Lunch recess]    Gentlemen, there’s one item we have to return to in connection  with the longer-range targets, and that is a growth range for the credit proxy  I suggest that we  proceed as we did last time and leave that decision to our staff--that decision to be consistent  with the money growth ranges that we’ve agreed upon  Is that suggestion agreeable?  I hear no  objections; we’ll proceed that way     Now, we should hear from Mr Sternlight on what the Desk has done recently  Mr  Sternlight, please    Thank you, Mr Sternlight  Are there any questions?    Yes, Mr Black    All right, any other questions or comments?  If not, we need to  ratify the operations of the Desk  Is there a motion to that effect?  Motion been made  I hope it’s  been seconded  It actually has been seconded  I hear no objection     Now, does the Bluebook raise questions of a kind that we need to turn to an economist to  clarify?  Or does the Bluebook answer its own questions?  Or are the difficulties of the sort that  no economist can help us on?  We have an economist standing by, ready to answer questions on  the Bluebook  Are there any?     All right, we will proceed then to our domestic policy directive and to its specification of  the monetary aggregates and the federal funds rate for the month ahead  Who would like to  speak first?  Mr Coldwell please     7/19-20/76 - 63 -    Very good--   [NOTE  Several members, including Balles and Black, indicate their agreement]    Well, I’m going to be a little unhappy  The federal funds rate now  is at 5-1/4  I, for one, would not like to see it drop by 50 basis points over the next month, nor  would I like to see it rise by 50 basis points over the next month  And as for the growth ranges  [of the monetary aggregates], I’d like to see these upper limits just slightly lower than specified,  but my feelings there are less strong than with regard to the interest rates  Mr Mayo, then Mr  Volcker    Thank you  Mr Volcker    Well, we could [have] asymmetry, you see  That is, 5-1/4 being  considered as the central rate, it could go down to 5 or go up 5-3/4  We’ve done that before  I  don’t see any difficulty in doing it, if that were the wish of the Committee    Thank you, Mr Volcker  Mr Partee, please     7/19-20/76 - 64 -    The only point about that is, if we were to adopt the  suggestion--this is hypothetical--to have a range of 5 to 5-3/4, the midpoint would be 5-3/8, and  therefore it means an immediate or an early increase to the central point, and why do that?    Well, but we’ve agreed not to do that  The range that we specify  is the range that we should be ready to use unless there is some significant factor that will lead  us--    Oh, no--    That’s the rule under which we operate    Well, now wait  M2 revived only toward the end of the month    Well below the middle    I have some difficulty with that  You know, we must not become  too mathematical, too mechanical  We must leave some elbow room to the Desk  We should  avoid excessive fine tuning  I think our instruction to the Desk recently has been to give  approximately equal weight to the two  We leave it to the Desk to interpret that  I would rather  do that than proceed by more mechanical formula    Well, I also have the feeling that we ought to stay with a certain  rule for a little while until misery, frustration piles up, and then we go to another rule, and misery  and frustration pile up  We shouldn’t change from month to month    Gentlemen, we want reach a decision, and who would like to  express--we haven’t heard from many members of the Board  Unless others want to speak, I’m  going to make the suggestion that we adopt the alternative C ranges for M1 and M2 and a range  of 5 to 5-1/2 for the federal funds rate  And if we do that we ought to have a money market  directive  But last month we decided to be illogical; I think being illogical now and then is  defensible, but to be illogical month after month is a little harder to defend  So if we took a  narrow federal funds rate, I really think we ought to have a money market directive    I think an explanation can be worked out  It wouldn’t make  anybody happy  Yes, Mr Balles    Well, speaking for myself in the present environment, I could live  even with a narrower range  Why do we want oscillating interest rates in the present  environment?  What advantage would we gain?  Why not wait until trends clarify?       7/19-20/76 - 67 -   Now, we talk about the federal funds rate, but there are people in the marketplace who see  fortunes made and fortunes broken and business thriving or business slumping as a result of  these interest rate movements  Now, we ought to be sure of our ground before we take moves  with regard to interest rates  Markets have gotten into a mechanical habit, unfortunately, and we  are responsible for it  [First, the] federal funds rate moves, then the whole family of short-term  interest rates moves, then three weeks later or some interval like that the prime rate moves; in the  meantime the stock exchanges react  Are we doing something constructive by bobbing up and  down?  Well, these are my doubts    --and when we are less tired than we are this afternoon  I think we  should plan for that--    Thank you    Even if the variations in growth rates reflected in large part merely  movement from the public to the Treasury and [then] back from the Treasury to the public?   MR, JACKSON  To a certain extent the Desk has offset those by its actions    Yeah  I think this is perhaps a very large part of the explanation   Why should we [unintelligible] some markets if that is what is going on?  Well, that is just a  question     The afternoon is drawing on  I’m moved to reflect a little on the time interval  Here we  are, we meet once a month  We’ve got to do something during that month  Now if we met every  three months, which is what this Committee did some years ago, we could have a pretty wide  federal funds rate range  But meeting once a month, and when there is some uncertainty as to  which way things may move, do we really want to see-saw markets?  That’s my doubt  This is  going to be the Committee’s decision  I’ve expressed my views  Who else would like to speak?    Well, I’d be entirely happy with that    Any other?    We are really talking about very small differences    No, you could have asymmetry    Well, we’ve done that    Well, I meant that I would, I don’t think we ought to--well, let me  not try to explain that  I think that we’ve done that in the past, and that [is] something we may or  may not want to do today    I think that’s a fair observation    Gentlemen, I think that we are first of all discussing minute  differences; second, I sense fatigue all around this table, and therefore let me test one or two  ranges and see what the thinking of the Committee, or the inclination of the Committee, may  be--I don’t know how much thinking we’re doing anymore     I’ll test the following  4-3/4, 5-3/4, 5-1/2  Now those who would prefer 4-3/4 to 5-3/4 as  against the other two possibilities [for the federal funds rate], members of the Committee, would  kindly raise their hand     The other question--4-3/4 to 5-3/4 is one possibility; let me call it A  B is 5 to 5-3/4  C is  5 to 5-1/2  Now if you are undecided you can raise your hand twice  If you are still undecided  you can raise your hand three times  Mr Broida will have an accurate arithmetical count  Those  who would prefer A kindly raise your hands  Eight  Those who would prefer B kindly raise  their hands  One  Those who prefer C kindly raise their hands  Two  Well, I think the majority  of the Committee prefers a range of 4-3/4 to 5-3/4     Now, I don’t think we need to do much testing on monetary growth ranges  I think that  sentiment ran largely in favor of the magnitudes specified under alternative C  How many would  be more or less content with the ranges under alternative C for M1 and M2?     All right, next we have to decide on [whether] we prefer the money market directive or the  monetary aggregate directive  I think that in view of the federal funds rate range, the argument  now tips in the direction of a monetary aggregate directive  But let’s have a show of hands [of]  those who would prefer a monetary aggregate directive as over against a money market directive   Eight     Well, there is one small change in wording that I would like to make  This is on line 5 of  the draft of the directive  Instead of saying “an apparent leveling out” in the rate of inventory  accumulation, have it read “little change” in the rate of inventory accumulation  Any objection  to that?     7/19-20/76 - 71 -    Very small, very small    So we’ll vote on the following  The monetary aggregates  directive and the range for M1 of 4 to 8; a range for M2 of 7-1/2 to 11-1/2 percent; and the range  for the federal funds rate of 4-3/4 to 5-3/4, and we will give approximately identical weight to  M1 and M2  Any questions?  Apparently not  We are ready to vote    Now, item 9 on the agenda--in view of the absence of the authors  of the memorandum on operations and Fannie Mae securities, the authors being Messrs Axilrod  and Holmes, I think we ought to postpone it  Gentlemen, I think we have done our business for  the day   END OF MEETING         "
135,1976-08-17,"  We are ready to start our meeting this morning  The first item of  business, as always, is to act on the minutes of the last meeting  Motion to approve  [Seconded]   The motion has been made and duly seconded  No objections heard    What is the remaining debt in this, Alan?    Are we carrying on conversations with the Treasury with regard to  the Swiss franc?    I’m not sure that is the case  I’d like to talk to you and Mr  Holmes, possibly this afternoon, about that problem    Any other question about that?  Very well, Mr Holmes, we thank  you for your report, and now is there a motion to approve the transactions at the Foreign Desk?   The motion has been made  Hopefully seconded  Inaudibly seconded  The Desk operations are  approved  Do you have any recommendation, Mr Holmes?    Can you tell us anything about our arrangements with the  Mexicans?     8/17/76 - 3 -      Do you think [you have] anything that the Committee ought to  know about our conversation with the Mexicans?    Would there be any serious concern on the part of the Committee  about the rollover of the Mexican indebtedness?    I think there may be some foreign policy considerations involved  that I think we should respect  No one is enthusiastic about a rollover--I take that for  granted--but I hear no serious objection    These are CDs repayable and in what currency now?    That may be more of a problem for the SEC than for us    I take it we are ready to change the subject and move on to the  economic outlook for the whole country  Mr Gramley, please    Mr Winn, please    Well, I think that was a moderately comprehensive recital of  doubts and uncertainties, and now would you want someone to comment on that?  Mr Gramley    All right, thank you Messrs Winn and Gramley  Mr Kimbrel    Please    Well, the final answer then will come a little later  Meanwhile,  let’s turn to Mr Black    Before you get a scientific reply, let me say to you that I just don’t  trust that figure  And all the statisticians I’ve had, you know, that’s something I’ve lived with  I  can tell you a lot about that--what I’ve learned from statisticians  How they’ve assured me about  the sanctity of their small sample and what has happened over the years, but I just don’t believe  that figure  But now, put that to one side  You’re going to get it    Yes, well, that would be a trend or longer-term phenomenon    All right, thank you, Mr Black  Mr Eastburn now, please    All right, thank you, Mr Eastburn  Mr Partee now please    Well, I’d like to comment on this issue  I think it is wise for us to  keep in mind, in our search for objectivity, the negative elements as well as the positive  elements  I fundamentally agree with the staff, and if I interpret Mr Winn and Mr Partee  correctly, they agree with the staff as well, although they are more concerned now about negative  possibilities than they were a month or two ago  That is also my own feeling     But I would like to make two supplementary comments  In addition to the lift that is  occurring in orders for capital goods, we’ve seen for the first time, really, in this recovery some  life during the past three months in the physical volume of construction contracts for industrial  and commercial building  And there has been a significant lift all along in the volume of  nonbuilding construction--as represented by pipelines and power plants and refineries  So the  picture on the capital side is one of recovery, although a slower recovery than many of us,  including myself, had anticipated       8/17/76 - 11 -     As to the cause of this, Mr Partee commented correctly on the element of caution in  business thinking  That should not surprise us  You now have among the men who control our  business enterprises today very few who have lived through an honest-to-goodness depression or  recession  Here we have the severest recession in the postwar period, by far  It was unexpected  by the business community  The business community had come to think of the business cycle as  being either dead or a very minor fluctuation, and here we have a very old-fashioned decline   They were caught by surprise  Such a thing couldn’t happen in our economy  After all, we had  learned how to control the business cycle  That was the popular thinking  Once confidence is  badly shaken, as it was, the self-assurance of the new business leaders was shaken  Confidence  revives gradually, I think that is human nature, and that is the history of mankind     Now one more observation  Mr Partee has warned us against this, and I simply want to  elaborate on the comment that he made  There is a tendency on the part of perhaps many  business observers to think of a business cycle expansion as a continuous upward movement at  more or less the same rate, or at a rate that gradually diminishes as the peak of capacity  utilization is reached  This is a picture that many of us carry in our minds, but it is not a picture  that fits reality     At the National Bureau [of Economic Research], as I think you know, we made extensive  detailed studies of business cycle developments in industrial countries  We found a phenomenon  that we described with the awkward phrase “mid-expansion retardation,”  which meant that after  a year or two of a business cycle expansion, there is stagnation for awhile, a lower rate of  growth, or even an actual dip  And then a reacceleration follows  That’s not the picture of the  business cycle that we have in our minds  But that is what we found some years ago     One of our investigators at the National Bureau wrote a sizable volume dealing with a  phenomenon described as subcycles, and these subcycles were subdivisions of business cycles as  historically identified by the National Bureau  These subcycles were in large part minor  inventory adjustments occurring in contrast to the larger inventory adjustments that have come to  be known as part of business cycle history  Mr Partee mentioned some historical instances  The  most dramatic one that I recall at the moment was in 1951, when many business commentators  spoke of a recession, and as we all know, this was a lull in activity     Now of course when you have a lull, it could be the beginning of an economic decline   That’s always true  But if the kind of sequence that occurs in business cycle phenomena has any  repetitive value, and I believe it has very considerable repetitive value, I don’t see how, on the  basis of sequences in leading economic phenomena, one can argue persuasively that a recession  is imminent  There isn’t any evidence to support that  One can argue, as Mr Partee and Mr  Gramley did, that if this lull in economic activity continues for a few months, then the sequences  in economic process that we associate with the early stage of recession could well come into  being  We are not at that stage now  But I think it’s healthy to bear in mind the possibility     My own judgment is exactly the same as Mr Gramley’s, that we’re experiencing a lull and  that the underlying trend is still clearly upward  That business confidence is not waning  That  it’s gradually reviving and that business capital investment is gradually reasserting itself as the  driving force of the economy  Well, I’ve talked too long, I think  Let’s listen to Mr Mayo now     8/17/76 - 12 -      You’re close to it    I’d like to comment on Mr Mayo’s question about the gimmicks   Now, unlike Mr Gramley, I have very considerable confidence in leading indicators, if only  because I made the original [National] Bureau [of Economic Research] study back in 1937  But  I’ve always viewed economic indicators in a rational context, never in isolation of other  evidence, and certainly not in isolation of economic interpretation  That specific ratio belongs to  the category of latter-day gimmickry that I want to have nothing to do with  And you have to  strain to rationalize that ratio  But for heaven’s sake, you can rationalize it in terms of  arithmetical patterns--ratio of the coincident indicator to the lagging indicator  And that ratio  will have, so it is claimed, a consistent long lead, you see  And you can rationalize that in terms  of rates of change of these two series, but you cannot give it, or at least I’ve been unable to give  it--well, I must say that when I see a gimmick like that, which is pure arithmetic, I don’t even  look for economic interpretations    Well, I will never argue against anything that gives any man an  added measure of comfort    Well, that specific thing, if it serves that purpose, it serves a useful  purpose  But I don’t think it goes beyond that     8/17/76 - 14 -      Well, I don’t know about vacation habits, but they may well be  changing  A good portion of mankind remembers that there is a month of August, and an  increasing number of people I believe are taking advantage of it  And whether seasonal factors  catch that phenomenon is not a subject that I’ve studied  I think it deserves study  Mr  Baughman, please    Good question  We’ll hear first from Mr Gramley and then from  Mr Axilrod    Mr Axilrod    But there is some question about the fact [of slowing growth in the  aggregates] itself  I would not interpret the figures on page 4 of the Bluebook as indicating a  slowing in the rate of growth in the money supply    You’re looking at M1    Tables which?    Is that the one with the quarterly figures?    Oh  Well, I think you have a useful summary, the past three  months, past six months, past twelve months, and on page 4  Well, one can read these figures  very differently  I appreciate that  Well, thank you Mr Baughman  Would anyone else like to  speak on the economic outlook?  Yes, Mr Wallich    Lyle, what do you know about the Commerce Department  measure of capacity utilization?    Really  I just learned about it recently, and it shows a  startling--well, Mr Wallich described it, you know--[only a] 4 point difference, I think--an index  of 86 at the peak of the latest boom and 82 now, not very far away, and it’s a startling measure   Whether there’s any degree of validity at all I don’t know  It would be very useful to learn  about    It’d be useful to send out a memo to all members of the  Committee    Thank you  Anyone else like to speak on the economic outlook?    I wonder if consumers really feel that way  I think consumers  think of the level and not rates of change  If consumer prices are going up at an annual rate of  6 percent, by Job they’re going up period  It’s economists who talk about stability of rates of  change  Consumers know nothing about that  They know the grocery prices and other prices are  going up    Any other question of comment?  Well, if not…   [Coffee break]    We’ll resume our deliberations, and if we do so promptly, there is  a chance that we will not go hungry today  An opportunity that we ought not overlook  We will  hear now from Mr Axilrod, who as usual, will be very brief    Thank you, Mr Axilrod  Any questions?    Any other questions?  Yes, Mr Guffey    All right, any other questions?  Yes, Mr Wallich    A certain quiescence has descended on this assembly, and  therefore I think we’re ready to move to a discussion of monetary policy and the domestic policy  directive  I’m not adequately informed about the vacation plans or doings of members of this  Committee  But I do know that one of our distinguished members has recently been away and  become reacquainted with the blue sky and calm waters and so therefore must have gained  perspective on the world we are living in and maybe moving into  So I’m going to call on Mr  Gardner to open this discussion    Well, Mr Gardner has brought a relaxed mind to our  deliberations  I bring a very tired mind to our deliberations  And I have a little more confidence  in my own judgment now, despite my tired mind, than I might have had were it not for the fact  that Mr Gardner brings a clear, relaxed mind to our problems     As far as I can see there is no reason for changing our basic monetary stance at this time   Alternative B as specified on page 5 I think is reasonably satisfactory  I would like a somewhat  lower federal funds rate  I would like a somewhat lower midpoint for M2, but these are subtle  differences; I would not press them  I’m not a believer in fine tuning, and if alternative B is  satisfactory to my colleagues, it certainly would be satisfactory to me  Who would like to speak  next?  Mr Coldwell, please     8/17/76 - 20 -      Thank you, Mr Coldwell  Mr Partee now, please    Thank you, Mr Partee  Mr Eastburn, please    Thank you, Mr Eastburn  Mr Black now, please    Thank you, Mr Black  Mr Morris now    Thank you, Mr Morris  Mr Kimbrel now, please    Thank you, Mr Kimbrel  Mr Jackson now, please    Thank you, Mr Jackson  Mr Mayo now, please    Thank you, Mr Mayo  Mr Williams, please    Thank you, Mr Williams  Mr Wallich now, please    Thank you, Mr Wallich  Who would like to speak next?  Yes,  Mr Volcker    Thank you, Mr Volcker  Yes, Mr Guffey    All right, thank you, Mr Guffey  Mr MacLaury, I’m looking at  you    Well, I have that very much on my mind, and I’ve had several  discussions with our staff about this, and staff work is going forward  I hope we can have such a  discussion at the next meeting  But I see no point in putting that on the agenda until I see where  the staff is in its preparation     As for your suggestions about 930, I must say to you in all honesty, that thought occurred  to me, and I thought it would be poorly received by this Committee, and that’s why I didn’t make  it  Also, a more rebellious thought actually occurred to me, namely, to suggest to the members  of the Committee that we not even hold a meeting, but then I thought it would be so rash, so  outrageous, that the Chairman would be accused of approaching senility  And I’ve reached an  age where that is the last kind of interpretation that I could take  We still haven’t heard from  several members of our family  Who would like to speak now    Thank you, Mr Baughman  Would anyone else like to speak?   Well, if not, I think we’re ready for a decision  I would like to test the sentiment of the  Committee on a money market directive  In my judgment, that is an appropriate directive, in  view of the [opinions] that have been expressed around this table at this meeting  Now, with a  show of hands, how many would find the money market directive acceptable at this time?    Oh yes, members    On M2, let me have a show of hands on a very subtle item, really,  a preference of 7 to 11 as against 7-1/2 to 11-1/2  Members of the Committee who prefer 7 to 11  and who are against 7-1/2 to 11-1/2 would kindly raise your hands    Now, as to the federal funds rate, I’d be inclined to leave it as is,  recollecting our discussion at the last meeting, but I can assure Mr Volcker that this is a matter  that not only the Desk but that I personally would watch very carefully  And I think they ought  to have a pretty convincing reason for going to 5-3/4, and I might want to communicate with the  Committee on that if a purely mechanical interpretation of our rules would lead the Desk to that  conclusion     In view of what may be happening at that time in the economy and the markets, I might  want to communicate with the Committee, and all that I can promise is that I’m going to remain  very alert to that because I’m sensitive to such a possible increase for what might be a purely  mechanical reason, just as Mr Volcker and, I believe, others around this table are  Mr Partee?    This is my preference  I hesitated a little to indicate it in view of  the somewhat painful discussion we had--    --at the last meeting, when one or another of us sounded as if he  might have a direct line to the Almighty himself, and the difference I thought was rather subtle   And we’re not asleep here, so I would go along entirely with Mr Partee  This is my own definite     8/17/76 - 26 -    preference, but it’s not anything that I would want to--in fact I’m not a belligerent on any subject  today  Well, let’s have a show of hands of those of us who would prefer the narrower range of 5  to 5-1/2 with adequate alertness on the part of the staff and the Chairman  Those who would  prefer that would kindly raise their hands   SPEAKER(?)  That’s on the assumption you have a money market directive    That’s right    Well, I think I’m breaking all records today  Is there any other  question or comment to take up before we have a formal vote?  If not, would you be good  enough to let me specify what we’ll be voting on?  We’ll be voting on a money market directive;  the range for M1, 4 to 8; the range for M2, 7-1/2 to 11-1/2; the range for the federal funds rate, 5  to 5-1/2  And I take it, although this has not been discussed with any thoroughness, that [the  Desk will give] approximately equal weighting to M1 and M2--a procedure we have followed in  recent meetings  I hear no objection to my statement of what we’ll be voting on  Therefore  would you be good enough to call the role  "
158,1976-09-21,"  We can get our meeting under way if someone will be good  enough to move approval of the minutes of the August meeting    Motion made and seconded  I hear no objections  Let us turn  therefore to Mr Holmes’s report on recent foreign developments      Thank you, Mr Holmes  Are there any questions?  Very well, is  there a motion to approve the transactions of the Foreign Desk?   SPEAKER(?)  So moved    The motion is made, there is no objection  And the credit that  we’ve extended to Mexico has recently been renegotiated in connection with a further  commitment made by the US Treasury  All this took place over a hectic weekend and was not  concluded until early Monday morning The foreign currency subcommittee acted in behalf of  the full Committee; there was simply no physical opportunity to deliberate with this Committee   And when you get into one of these negotiations, there is really nothing to deliberate over until  the very end because positions are not clearly defined or keep changing  That’s the nature, I’m  afraid, of the beast  Mr Wallich will report on the outcome of these negotiations    Thank you, Mr Wallich  Are there any questions?  Yes, Mr  MacLaury    You have an answer to that question  I don’t think we ought to  say one word about it  We all know what it means    Of course, that carries with it the danger that, instead of adjusting  their policies and moving in a constructive financial direction, they may declare a moratorium  and continue to do business at home politically the way they have  So there is a lot of  uncertainty in it    Well, I don’t know the exact figures, but there is a repayments  schedule, and then you don’t need to repay and you don’t need to pay interest on the outstanding  bill, and you don’t need to amortize or repay on the due date  How these figures come out, I  don’t know; they may come out exactly as I have suggested, maybe not     Gentlemen, no action, as far as I can see, is required by the Committee  We have this  renegotiation, and as a result of it we are no worse off, and we may be significantly better off   Any further question or comment?     All right, let’s pass to the Manager’s recommendations  Thank you, Mr Wallich, for your  report and for the fine job you and Mr Gardner did on negotiating with the Mexicans    All right    Any questions?  All right, I take it that the recommendation is  approved  Anything else, Mr Holmes?    Well, first of all, I think you are to be congratulated on working  out this agreement with the Swiss  The proposal that Mr Holmes is making has been put before  you in writing  You might read it, Mr Broida, to make sure that we all know what it is    Any questions or comments?  Yes, Mr Mayo    Well, this is a footnote  It’s useful to remind ourselves of it  But  less and less attention is being paid by the rest of the world to that footnote  We have to speak  much more loudly even to be heard on this    Well, whether that’s good or bad, time will tell    I would accept the conclusion  I would not accept the language   The Treasury is unwilling to give up gold or SDRs    I would share Mr Coldwell’s skepticism  I think that the Fowler  letter is unlikely to have much effect, if any, in the future    With the idea that there was still a Treasury [backup] in case there  is a serious problem for us; I think the Treasury would take that into account  But I don’t [think]  we can count on getting gold or SDRs from the Treasury, and I think that’s a realistic view  We  can understand it    Well, let me make two comments  First, yes, to be sure, we have a  floating regime, and the role of gold is quite different  But it seemed to us for a time that we  could more readily reach an agreement with the Swiss if some gold or SDRs were offered   That’s point number 1  Point number 2, as far as the Treasury taking over any of our  indebtedness to another central bank is concerned, I don’t think that we ought to leave the matter  having the Committee think that [this] is going to happen  It may or may not be going to happen   I don’t know how to assess the probability I doubt that anybody can at this time   [MR HOLMES or  I think you’re proceeding on what I consider to be a very prudent  course  I think that’s the assumption that should be made  Any other question?   SPEAKER(?)  I [noted] a technical detail that you mentioned first off, the [unintelligible]  through their willingness to sell us [Swiss francs]   SPEAKER(?)  Yes--   SPEAKER(?)  This is the thing, the very thing that makes it work    Well, I’ll tell you about technical details  I was shown a piece of  paper this morning which I refused to put before the Committee because I didn’t understand it  myself  This, I understand   SPEAKER(?)  I consider that a little bit stronger than a technical detail    Well, that is really the heart of the agreement, not a technical  detail   SPEAKER(?)  That wasn’t mentioned as briefly at [unintelligible] I’m perfectly happy  with this solution because I understand [unintelligible]    Well, you have a proposal before you written out on the sheet of  paper that Mr Broida read  Is there a motion, or do we need more discussion of the proposal?   SPEAKER(?)  Could I ask a question?  I’ve seen this before  The word “concurrent”  simply means, broadly, that [unintelligible] jointly with the Treasury but not does not specify any  amounts?    All right, any other question or comments?  If not, is there a  motion to approve the special authorization?   SPEAKER(?)  So moved     SPEAKER(?)  Second    Motion has been cautiously made and cautiously seconded, and in  view of the caution exercised, may we have a voice vote  All those [who] approve will kindly  say aye   [NOTE  Multiple responses “Aye”]    Any no’s?  All right, any other recommendation, Mr Holmes?    Are you going to be repaying the Belgians any money?     9/21/76 - 9 -      Well, I think this should be a happy day for us because we finally  are in the process of getting rid of our indebtedness  Let’s turn to the economic outlook  Mr  Zeisel, would you be good enough to report to the Committee?    Thank you, Mr Zeisel  This is the time for members of the  Committee to express their views on the economic condition of the country and the outlook for  our national economy  Mr Eastburn will speak first    All right  Thank you, Mr Eastburn  Mr Kimbrel, please    Are you taking into account what OPEC is likely to do in  December?    Intelligence reports are very strong on this issue, suggesting a 10  to 15 percent rise    Including the outside economy    Don’t make this calculation available to OPEC  Thank you, Mr  Kimbrel  Mr Winn now, please    This is under the Tandem plan?    I thank you, Mr Winn  Mr Black, please    All right, thank you, Mr Black  Mr Morris, please    I would think that while what you suggest is useful, we might  supplement it and perhaps even learn more by having Mr Mayo do a special exercise for us, the  way he did earlier on another problem on capacity, and canvas our directors on their price  expectations  Mr Zeisel, please    Well, would you expect any differences?    Theoretically they should be identical because they are the same  phenomenon    Well--which would suggest that the participants in the two  markets are not quite the same--they think a little differently  But such a difference is not likely  to persist very long    All right, thank you, Mr Morris  Mr Baughman, please    Those are very interesting comments  Thank you, Mr Baughman   Mr Wallich, please    Before you answer that, I would like to refine the question  The  question may be interpreted in terms of levels--actual and prospective business capital  expenditures--or the question may be interpreted in terms of recent and prospective rates of  change in capital expenditures  And the two answers are going to be very different  You will  have to refine the question before you answer it, or possibly answer both  The question on both  interpretations    All right, thank you, Mr Wallich  Mr Balles, please    I’m going to give Mr Zeisel a little more time to think over that  question while I comment on your first question  Exactly 20 years ago I made a rather extensive  study, a very careful statistical study of the effects of major or long strikes on the economy, and I  took the strikes in the railroad industry, in the coal industry, and in the steel industry for this  purpose  These are industries [in which] the effects may be reasonably expected to be  nationwide       9/21/76 - 16 -     I don’t recall precisely the period of the strike that I took for the purpose of my analysis,  but I’m quite--it was longer than a month  And the result was that, when you examine charts  drawn to a liberal scale, unless you knew the precise time when a strike occurred in any one of  these industries, you have [unintelligible] great difficulty determining that from the chart    Well, I made this study in 1956, 20 years ago, and I have not  studied it since, and maybe conditions are different, but I went back a good many years, and I  thought it would be of interest on this occasion     While you live through one of these strikes, you go through all kinds of anxieties  But they  don’t last more than a month or two, and the effects are rather minimal and more in men’s minds  than in reality  That was the conclusion I drew at that time, and I have no doubt that it was a  correct conclusion at that time  About the past 20 years, I’m not going to comment  I haven’t  studied the question  Mr Zeisel, you’ve had time to reflect now and--    Well, there’s that, and there’s also the effect on the used car  market--    --and that, in turn, with the run-up in prices on used cars when the  strike is over, there would be a rebound in purchases of the new cars  Because the differential,  you see, has become adverse    Now, I think that perhaps the time has come to introduce a strong  optimistic note into our deliberations, and since no one else is supplying it, I’d like to comment  on the economy as I see it     We were concerned for a time about sluggishness in retail trade  We’ve learned that  figures for earlier months had been underestimated  In August, if our statistics can be believed,  we had a very strong rise, an increase of well over 2 percent, and more significant, the increase  was widespread  General merchandise sales rose by well over 3 percent; furniture and  appliances by 3 percent; apparel, after rising sharply in July, rose a little under 1 percent; and so  on  And the reports for the month of September so far are quite favorable     As for business capital spending, I see rapid increases in the making in view of reports on  new orders for business capital goods, on construction contracts for commercial and industrial  buildings, and on new capital appropriations for manufacturing firms  The picture on housing  could be better, of course, but there is a slow upward trend, and the figures for August for starts  and permits are, I think, clearly reassuring     On the inventory side, I think businessmen are behaving in a cautious and admirable way   They’re monitoring their inventories and recently, retailers, wholesalers have adjusted their  inventories significantly  There are no excesses of any significance that I’m aware of, and the  expansion is proceeding in quite orderly fashion     Now, the reports on activity are reasonably satisfactory  The industrial production index  for July has been revised upward; for August it’s the same as for July  In view of our recent  record over the past year in estimating industrial production, the chances are that we’re  continuing to underestimate industrial production     The report on employment in the more reliable establishment series was quite favorable   As for the flow of incomes, you read reports about the retardation in the month of August in  personal income  Well, in the first place, you had a very sharp rise in July, reflecting Social     9/21/76 - 18 -    Security benefits  And secondly, the report is for total personal income, and the significant part  is nonfarm personal income because the farm component is sheer conjecture  It’s an artificial  figure  And [nonfarm personal income] shows a rate of increase of 8 percent rather than the  5 percent which has been so widely reported in the press     As far as business income--specifically, corporate profits--is concerned, well, there again, I  don’t think the reports in the press are very revealing  You lump a lot of things into these  reports, including profits of the Federal Reserve--which have been quite sluggish, and we don’t  regret that  But domestic industries are doing quite well  And look at manufacturing, the critical  industry of the economy  Look at the evolution of profits [after] allowing for inventory valuation  adjustment  Starting with the second quarter of ’75, $43 billion annual rate, $57 billion,  $55 billion, $61 billion, $66 billion  Now, between the first and second quarters you have a 52  [percent] increase on a base of 61, which is an enormous increase     Now, the picture looks very healthy to me, [but] I have been skeptical on the inflation side   I’ve been skeptical about our staff projections  Our staff has stuck with a figure of 5 to  5-1/2 percent, and I’ve stuck with a figure of 6 to 7 percent, and I continue to think that our staff  is underestimating what is likely to happen on the price front    Well, you’re quite right  As far as the effect on production,  employment, and the short run is concerned, it’s immaterial whether you spend money to  improve your technology or spend money to build new plant for environmental or safety reasons   But the effects on productivity are very different for the two  Now, we do have figures on that,  and there is enormous variation among industries on that  Do you have the figures in mind, the  proportion of total capital expenditure that is accounted for by so-called antipollution or safety  requirements?    Paper, steel, very high--    That’s exactly the figure I had in mind, around 20 percent     9/21/76 - 19 -      Well, it’s always been that way  Businessmen have always lagged  in their recognition  You know, I don’t hold out very much praise for the performance of  economists, but economists have a far better record in recognizing changes than businessmen,  and businessmen have a far better record in recognizing changes than does the consuming public   There are these lags in perception that have been characteristic for a very many years    I think businessmen will exaggerate just as they think economists  are likely to understate  But you know, to come back for a moment to the Ford strike, at the  present time what concerns me most about the Ford strike is the possibility of a whopping wage  settlement rather than the effects on economic activity  Yes, Mr Coldwell, please    You know, part of the problem is statistical reporting in our press  and even on the part of our staffs  Now you take what I’ve said about corporate profits and what  I’ve said about personal income--I dug it out for myself, you see  Our staffs continue to think in  terms of broad aggregates, and they do not disaggregate sufficiently  Well, that’s the tendency, I  think, of economists     You know, 40 years [ago], if you wanted to judge the economy, you had to dig down into  details because aggregates were not available  Now statisticians manufacture figures, and we  look at the aggregates, and, well, I do that myself  I rarely look to disaggregate, but I did a little     9/21/76 - 20 -    more preparing for this meeting than I normally do  We look at aggregates and they don’t  always tell the story     A profit picture looks very different if you look at aggregates than if you break the figures  down and take out--well, look, you know perfectly well that profits of the Federal Reserve  shouldn’t be looked at  You know perfectly well that profits of our banking firms are down, you  see  Take that out  Profits from outside activities, well, that has a bearing  But the domestic  economy, and then you take the most significant part, which is manufacturing, moreover, the  profits of manufacturing--I didn’t go into that; [profits] have been concentrated [there]  That is,  the great improvement has been in the durable goods sector  And I think that is quite significant   And in the nondurable goods sector, the profits recently have been flat, reflecting the flat activity  in that sector of the economy     And I think what we read in our newspapers about the economy is inadequate  Based on  global figures  Anyone else like to speak on the economy?  Well, if not, Mr Broida informs me  that coffee is ready for us, and we’ll have to take a short break   [Coffee break]    Thank you, Mr Axilrod  Any questions to Mr Axilrod?  If  not--oh yes, Governor Wallich    Any other questions?  Yes, Mr Winn    Of what variable?    Wait, wait, I’m not following this  What persists?    I haven’t been aware of that  I’d like to look into that with you,  Mr Axilrod  I didn’t know about this repetitive intra-year fluctuation  Any comment on Mr  Winn’s problem or any other?  Mr Baughman    We want to thank Mr Baughman and Mr Axilrod  If there aren’t  any further questions, let’s turn to our deliberation on monetary policy  In the interest of giving  the members of the Committee a target to shoot at, by way of either favorable comment or  complete demolition, let me suggest some policy miracle targets for the September-October  period     I am inclined to think that, [with] the economy behaving as it has; the economic prospects  being what they appear to be; the monetary aggregates behaving like they have; interest rates,  most important of all, adjusting downward--I think in good measure because of increasing  confidence and the fact that we have been standing still on the federal funds rate, I am inclined to     9/21/76 - 22 -    think we ought to remain pretty much where we are for the next month, and I would suggest that  we set a target range of 4 to 8 for M1, of 7-1/2 to 11-1/2 for M2, and stay pretty much where we  are with the federal funds rate  Who’d like to speak first?  Mr Coldwell    I’m sorry, I think I misspoke on monetary  I have various jottings  and I looked at the wrong one  Let me repeat the ranges that I had in mind 4 to 8 for M1, and 8  to 12 for M2  I think I said 7-1/2 to 11-1/2; that was last month’s target range  I’m sorry, Phil    Thank you, Mr Coldwell  Mr Kimbrel, please    Thank you, Mr Kimbrel  Mr Eastburn now, please    Thank you, Mr Eastburn  Mr Black, may we hear from you?    Thank you, Mr Black  Mr Jackson    You mean the announcement concerning money growth?    Thank you, Mr Jackson  Who would like to speak now?  Yes,  Mr MacLaury    Well, I spoke a little vaguely on that  I would prefer the present  range    The narrower one, yes    Thank you, Mr MacLaury  Mr Balles now, please     9/21/76 - 25 -      Yes, please    Thank you, Mr Balles  Mr Wallich now    Thank you, Mr Wallich  Mr Mayo, may we hear from you?    Thank you, Mr Mayo  Mr Volcker now, please    We haven’t done this frequently  We’ve done it before, and I  don’t think--it may or may not be desirable--but I don’t see any irrationality in it    Everything you say, Paul, by the nature of things, is rational    All right, thank you Mr Volcker, Mr Holmes  Mr Gardner now    Well, that’s not a matter for this Committee to act on, [not] in the  power of the Committee  I suspect that the Bank Presidents who are speaking on this issue have  in mind the [Federal Reserve System] membership problem at least as much as the problem of  monetary policy    Well, I think that what our Bank Presidents have to say on the  subject, and they’re close to the firing line--closer certainly than we are at the Board--deserves  respect on the part of the Board and will receive it   SPEAKER(?)  Could I ask a question?  Did I understand you, Steve, to be agreeing to  Governor Coldwell’s proposition?    I think that what Mr Gardner was seeking to convey is general  acceptance of the range and the asymmetry that Mr Volcker had suggested  That was my  interpretation  Is that correct?    All right, who would like to speak next, please  Yes, Mr Morris    Thank you, Mr Morris  Anyone else?  Mr Baughman    Thank you, Mr Baughman  Who would like to speak next?  Who  having already spoken would like to speak again?    Mr Wallich    Gentlemen, I want to make a proposal as follows  Now (1) that  we adopt the aggregates directive; (2) that we adopt an M1 target range of 4 to 8; an M2 range of  8 to 12; and a federal funds rate range of 4-3/4 to 5-1/2 with the understanding that the Desk will  operate on an asymmetrical principle  As far as I can judge, that comes close to expressing a  broad consensus of the Committee    Would observe the asymmetrical principle as previously described  by Mr Volcker    Well, there are two reasons in my own mind  One is, I don’t like  to see us repeating in successive meetings a money market directive  The Committee had  reached a decision to proceed normally on a monetary aggregate directive  I don’t want to see us  drift into [regular use of a money market directive]  Now the Committee, as it reconsiders its  policy, may possibly prefer a money market directive as a broad rule  I doubt if the Committee  will reach that decision  I would oppose it  It’s possible, but if we do it, let’s do it deliberately  and not drift into it, so that is one reason for my suggestion     Another reason is that we’re broadening the federal funds rate range a little, and that too, I  think, justifies a shift to a monetary aggregate directive  But all this is at the pleasure of the  Committee  Now I think that Governor Coldwell’s suggestion deserves an explicit vote, and  members of the Committee who are inclined to support Governor Coldwell’s suggestion on the  directive would kindly indicate that    The directive would read as follows  “The Committee seeks a  reasonably accommodative posture regarding bank reserve and money market conditions over  the period immediately ahead, provided that monetary aggregates appear to be growing within  the bands of expectation”  Well, there is no general support for that directive, as far as I can  judge     I think what is perhaps most uncertain about my suggestion or vote is what I’ve said about  the federal funds rate  And let’s have a show of hands on the part of members of the Committee  whether my suggestion, first, that the range be 4-3/4 to 5-1/2, and second, that the asymmetrical  principle be expected by the Desk, whether that suggestion is generally acceptable  Let’s have a  show of hands    Well, do we want more discussion before the vote?  Mr Black      9/21/76 - 30 -      Yes, I did not say that, and that is the principle on which we’ve  proceeded in recent meetings, and I have tacitly assumed that, but that should be explicit    Well, then, one would offset the other if that happened    What would you suggest, that we give more weight to M2?    Would the Committee be inclined to give M2 a larger weight?    Well, there does not seem to be any broad sentiment in favor of  that, so we’ll stay with the general principle of giving approximately equal weight, with  emphasis on “approximately” as well as “equal”    Pretty much, pretty much    If there are no additional comments or questions, and apparently  that is our situation now, let’s vote, and would you be good enough to call the role    All right, we have a Partee and a Holmes-Axilrod memorandum   And Mr Axilrod, would you be good enough to summarize the results of your deliberation--you  might want to call it a study  And then your recommendation to the Committee    Excuse me  Please continue--I’m familiar with your  memorandum  I have some notes on it, but I don’t seem to have a copy  Ignore my absence    I couldn’t find my notes, but recollecting as best I can, I had  questions  On page 8, the memorandum reads  “If the Desk simply permitted the funds rate to  move in, for example, a 1/2 percent band around its objective before intervening, rather than a  1/4 percent band, the market would probably behave a little differently”  Well, I don’t question  the judgment--I don’t know enough to question the judgment--but it is a judgment, it’s not a  statement of fact  What harm would there be in the experiment to see, well, so we’re  [unintelligible]  If it turns differently, there might be an advantage    Yes, I think that’s fair  Well, let’s hold that as a subject for  discussion  And another question that occurred to me is, on your page 9 you say, “While no  formal System announcement is now being made on daily Desk operations, the Public  Information Department has, upon inquiry, confirmed reports of Desk activity in the market of     9/21/76 - 33 -    the type recorded by Telerate”  Well, if you do that in response to an inquiry, then you’re  supplying an answer to some individuals  Then why not make it public to all [unintelligible]?    Well, but if you tell some people what you’re doing, you ought to  tell all alike  That’s the way it struck me upon reading it    Well, we might--    I’m not thinking of harm here, except harm to our public image   I’m not thinking of harm to markets, but I would feel very uncomfortable if the statement like  this were in the public arena and we’d be charged so quickly on Capitol Hill with making  information available to some market participants and not to others  I’m thinking solely of that   It’s not a good posture for us to be in, and we certainly ought to do the one or the other, I’m  inclined to think  You talk to no one, or talk to all of them    Well, that’s a little different, and some get it faster than others  I  feel uncomfortable, I just feel so uncomfortable reading that    Well, I think this, too, ought to be discussed rather fully  We need  not--in fact, any decision we reach today would be a hurried decision, and I don’t think we ought  to decide today, but let’s think about that when we have our special meeting  Any other  question?  Those were the two that I recall occurred to me  Yes, Mr Eastburn    Daily,  or maybe weekly     9/21/76 - 34 -      Well, that’s exactly the same    Wouldn’t we put Telerate out of business?    I’m not shedding tears    Let me ask this  This wasn’t clear to me  When the System buys  or sells on its own account, we don’t answer that question through the Public Information office,  and Telerate, they don’t publish it     9/21/76 - 35 -      They don’t know--but otherwise they do know the amount    But they do know that we’re operating  Well now, wait a minute  now  They know that we’re operating from the dealers, right?    And if they know from the dealers that we’re in the market, do  they not also learn from the dealers how much we’re buying or selling?    But the dealers will invariably or almost invariably indicate our  presence in the market on the buying or selling side    But we may want to go the other way    I don’t see why Why would you be compelled?  If you have a  policy of not explaining, of releasing figures without explanation--as a matter of fact, for years     9/21/76 - 36 -    I’ve been a proponent of statistical releases by government that carry no explanation because  I’ve seen too often that the explanations are self-serving    Well, there’s no shortage of that now    Oh no, we have daily figures on the money supply we don’t  publish  If you were to build a publication route, I’d want to have this--the staff, first, and then  this Committee, consider very carefully whether we publish daily information or, let us say,  weekly information    Because, after all, you know--    Overall    Well, that’s correct    Well, gentlemen, I have to leave  I don’t know whether the  Committee wants to deliberate further or not  If there were such a thing as a movement to  adjourn, would it receive your consent?  Well, let’s suppose there is a motion to adjourn     9/21/76 - 37 -     SPEAKER(?)  So moved    All right   END OF MEETING      "
179,1976-10-19,"  Let me call, at the outset, on Mr O’Connell for the brief report  [unintelligible]  Is Mr O’Connell here?     Thank you very much  Any questions?  Very well, we now need  to act on the minutes  And Mr Broida has submitted a memorandum to the Committee, dated     10/19/76 - 3 -   October 13, indicating that it would probably be desirable to invite the Committee to approve the  minutes with the understanding that a paragraph would be added regarding the recent  arrangement with the Swiss National Bank to pay off our debts     Now is there a motion to approve the minutes subject to that understanding?  That is to  say, the understanding that a paragraph be added of the technical details worked out by our staff  with the Swiss National Bank [that] are [to be] approved by me by October 22?  I’ve looked into  the matter some, and I want to make a final careful check [unintelligible] with almost certainty  be able to do that before [unintelligible]  Any questions about this action?  [Will] anyone be  bold enough [unintelligible]  The motion has been duly made  Anyone bold enough to second?   It has been duly seconded  And any objections?    Let us turn to the report from Mr Pardee on, well, before that report, perhaps a word or  two would be appropriate on the Manila meeting and certain additional travel that I just  concluded  The one outstanding event in Manila was the meeting of the [unintelligible]  committee which, as you know, consists of representatives of industrial countries, representatives  of developing nations in, well, equal numbers  Every finance minister [who] was at that meeting  expressed the view, unequivocally, [that] the number one problem facing the economic world is  the problem of inflation  I have [said] strong policy measures to deal with inflation are essential,  and that the unemployment problem will not be solved unless inflation is brought under control   Now this was to me an event of [unintelligible] and such unanimity or even a rough approach to  it would not have been possible five years ago or two years ago or even one year ago   Apparently finance ministers around the world, which means financial people generally, have  arrived at this conclusion  The summit meeting undoubtedly [unintelligible] the significant part  of helping to shape financial opinion  [At] that meeting, as you may recall, the several heads of  state indicated that the objective that they intend to work toward is the complete [eradication] of  inflation, not merely a reduction of [unintelligible], but achievement of general price stability   Now I think that was the main event at Manila, but perhaps Mr Volcker and Mr Wallich would  like to make some additional comments  Mr Volcker      I remember at earlier meetings how these financial representatives  fought for the [unintelligible] and abundance and favoring the less developed countries and the  link which means printing up extra money for LDCs      Thank you  Now, regarding my visit to China and Japan,  [unintelligible] I learned something about China  It’s fascinating  Reminded me most of the  people of Israel--as Leviticus records, Moses was able to call on the people of Israel to become a  holy people  That is a move in the nation [that] I thought I detected  How widespread it is, I  can’t say  Certainly it isn’t universal within the struggle between the so-called idealists and the  [unintelligible] if it were universal     What has been taking place in China--essentially, I think it is terrible to change human  nature  I think that’s what has been happening in China under Chairman Mao  Here is a country  that asks its people to build up the strength of China on their own and without foreign assistance  of any kind  And they will do it on their own; if it’s worth doing, they will do it on their own   They don’t want any grants, they don’t want any loans  And [for] that enormous earthquake  disaster, which according to various estimates--and I should say these are not wild  guesses--easily exceeded 500,000 deaths, China refused to accept any medicine, any help of any  sort from any other country     That’s symbolic of the attitude  Individuals have been taught to believe that, first, this  nation must rely on its own strength  That individuals are not to pursue personal goals or, to put  it a little differently, the chief personal goal would be to serve one’s neighbor and to serve the  nation  And it’s a highly [egalitarian] society, to the point where everybody seems to dress alike,  men and women included  The incomes are almost equal     The economy, well, it’s a preponderately agricultural economy--80 per cent of the people  are engaged in farming  The farms are enormously productive, as far as I could judge  Every  square inch of land has been utilized, cultivation is very intensive  In Peking, right in the heart  of the city, they have one farm after another  In Shanghai, at the airport, they have concrete  strips, and they have grass in between, and the grass was being harvested--what kind of grain  was being harvested, I couldn’t gather  The people seem to work hard     The shops [unintelligible] thoroughly impossible to get much useful information in talking  to economists and government officials  Actually, I was denied access to the university  But  that’s not unusual  I went from shop to shop to see what was being sold at what prices  And the  shops are filled with merchandise; you don’t see empty shelves  And much of the merchandise  is of high quality  You can now buy in a Chinese store a Swiss watch, a rather expensive one, if  you’ve got the money, very few do, but the watches are there  You can buy a fur coat, you can  buy a television set, you can buy a radio, buy photographic equipment  One thing is clear about  [unintelligible] and Chinese people do buy bicycles  Bicycles cost about $75, and with an  average wage, quite typical wage of $30, that means two and a half months pay     Now the prices to Americans are--I do have a Chinese bug, stay away from me--the prices  to an American are extraordinarily low  I took a party of six to dinner, and including beer and  wine and 10 sumptuous courses, $25  The price of a serviceable pair of shoes is about $6, and  that is close to a week’s wage  The prices are not low to a Chinese  When I got off the plane in  Tokyo on the way back, John [unintelligible] who was with me [unintelligible] namely he’d just     10/19/76 - 5 -   gotten a haircut in Tokyo, and it cost him $10  I told him I had news for him, [in China] I got a  haircut and a shave and it cost me 30 cents  Well, I could go on and on     But let me say two very brief comments  I had a three-hour meeting with the officials of  the Bank of China, and it was a friendly, candid meeting, and this is something I was told  couldn’t happen in China [unintelligible] and terribly nonpolitical  And propaganda or anything  [unintelligible] I found the central bankers extremely well informed about traditions of this  country and [elsewhere] abroad  Very well informed about the gold market, foreign exchange  markets around the world  The [unintelligible] as interested, perhaps neither one of us is, and  prospective economic trends in this country and prospective developments     In fact, you know, I was fascinated, it was so clear to me [unintelligible] of the news  breaking about the US, I knew so little about China  Of course, they get the Federal Reserve  Bulletin and other publications, and we are not given access to their statistical records  We don’t  know what they have  I will make available to the Committee in due course a report on how this  conversation took place, particularly the inference which was expressed [unintelligible] of  exchanging information and developing contacts in a free country  I found that very heartening    In Japan, I saw the leaders of the Japanese government, Mr [unintelligible] and  [unintelligible] and also their central banker, what’s his name [Mr Morinaga]  [I had] a  particularly valuable discussion with Mr Makuda, who almost certainly [will] very soon [be] the  next prime minister of Japan  He is a sound financial banker and fully understands that Japan  now faces a new environment, that growth rates of 10 or 12 percent, such as Japan experienced  during the postwar period, are out of the question for at least the near-term future  And [he] fully  understands the need to curb inflation, which is running at a rate of close to 10 per cent or  thereabouts in Japan  [The] business community is unhappy [unintelligible] economic policy,  and they’d like lower interest rates  They would like a cut in taxes and the [unintelligible] almost  certainly will exist     I think that’s about all I can usefully say at this time  As I say, as soon as I can get around  to it, I will distribute some notes on the conversations I had with the officials of the Bank of  China  Mr Wallich, you did some traveling, would you like to say a word or two on your travels  outside of Manila       Well, I’m very much interested in that, and I had been hoping by  now our bankers, who I think have gone hog-wild on lending to LDCs and to Eastern Europe,  would be becoming more cautious  From what you tell me--that they’re traveling around and  trying to drum up demands for credit and to unload the facilities that they have on others--I find  that terribly disheartening  I think we’re building up [unintelligible] possibility to recover   [Unintelligible] any comments on additional travel?    SPEAKER(?)  Well, I’ll make one additional comment on your comment and Governor  Wallich’s comment  I don’t know if it’s a fair generalization or not, Henry--I found the ones that  are most aggressive [unintelligible] loans are the underwriters, the middlemen, who would like to  place some loans of developing countries with the banks  But they don’t have any continuing  exposure; when they get their commission, they get out  I find the banks, I don’t think it’s  uniform, but some of them anyway are feeling a bit more nervous and cautious than they were,  but they [unintelligible] selling by now, I don’t     I just have the impression that the most aggressive ones at the moment are the investment  bankers  The commercial bankers were getting a little more cautious  But [unintelligible] I do  know there are some aggressive investment bankers going around  I just stopped at a very few  countries quickly on the way to Manila, mostly in the developed world  I observed that India  was doing very well  Production is up, prices are the same as they were a year ago, reserves are  increasing by 100 million a month  [Unintelligible]      Profits are being made--    SPEAKER(?)  And they feel a little better about investment, I think--they won’t admit  that, yet--about foreign investment  Help [unintelligible], but the observation I wanted to make  was, I was struck by--I got two [unintelligible] in every stop I made, however brief  They could  all quote precisely Mr Carter’s quotation from Playboy, that was fact number one  Fact number  two, very quickly on the heels of that was last week’s money supply figures, whatever last week  was, down to the decimal point  Whatever distant place in the world [unintelligible] followed  this quite so closely     SPEAKER(?)  Is that because the Wall Street Journal’s out there now?      10/19/76 - 7 -   SPEAKER(?)  Well, whether it’s done by telex, well, in one meeting, somebody came  running, “It’s just been published,” the last money supply figure  Whatever [unintelligible] to  know right away  Everybody up and down in those central banks looks for it      Well, facts that rule the financial world [unintelligible]  Well,  we’re finally ready for you, Mr Pardee  You’ve waited patiently    Thank you very much  Any questions?  Yes, Mr Black    Any other questions?  All right, you have no recommendations?   Very well, the motion to approve the transactions of the Desk will now be in order   SPEAKER(?)  So moved    Motion has been made  Seconded  I hear no objection  I’m  rearranging the agenda some  Let us move on to a report by Mr Sternlight on domestic open  market operations    Thank you, Mr Sternlight  Any questions?  Yes, Mr MacLaury    All right, thank you  Mr Eastburn    All right, Mr Kimbrel now, please    Mr Wallich, please    Any other question?  Any comment?  You know we’re indebted to  you, Mr Sternlight, for your report, and the motion to approve the actions of the Desk can now  be in order   SPEAKER(?)  Moved   SPEAKER(?)  Seconded    The motion’s been made and seconded  I take it there is no  objection  Let’s turn now to Mr Gramley’s report on the state of the economy      Thank you very much, Mr Gramley  Well, we are now ready for  our evaluation as a Committee of the state of the economy, and I think it’s particularly important  that we indicate agreement or disagreement, and the reasons for such agreement or disagreement,  with Mr Gramley’s report  We’ll hear first from [unintelligible] and then from Dave Lilly  I’m  sorry--Mr Black    All right, thank you, Mr Black  Mr Lilly please    It might be of interest to--I have before me this morning’s release  by the Commerce Department on the national income accounts  Let me read one sentence which  indicates the margin of error that attaches to your current estimates  “Based on past experience,  it is likely that the third-quarter change in real GNP, now estimated at 4 percent at an annual rate,  will not be revised above 6 percent or below 26 percent next July”  Well, that’s well worth  keeping in mind  In other words, there is uncertainty not only about the future, but there is  significant uncertainty even about the very recent past  So, the kind of difference that Mr Lilly  has suggested [between] his own view of the economic future and the staff view should not be  surprising  Mr MacLaury next, please    Are you referring to the August figure?    September figures to be released at 200 pm today    May I--before you go on--I have the September figure, but I’m  honor bound not to release it  I can say, however, that a truly dramatic increase in both housing  starts and building permits will be reported this afternoon and what the interpretation may be is  another question  Mr Partee called my attention to the possible disturbance in these figures  arising from governmental actions I was not aware of, and you referred to the same thing  And  as yet, our staff has not analyzed the figures and whether it would be possible to segregate the  housing starts attributable to governmental programs or not  I don’t know  I don’t have  sufficiently precise command over those figures to be able to say, but our staff is going to look  into it  They probably will not have an answer today    Just as an informational item, this morning’s national income  report reads as follows on governmental purchases  “The Federal Government purchases of  goods and services rose by $32 billion in the third quarter, compared with $2 billion in the     10/19/76 - 12 -   second quarter  Spending increased $17 billion on defense, and $15 billion on the rest  State  and local government purchases, on the other hand, were up $42 billion in the third quarter,  compared with $54 [billion] in the second quarter”  A fuller story will be needed  You’d have  to go back to the first quarter to see the recent developments in governmental spending as  reported in the national income account; you’d have to go back a little earlier to judge the  magnitude of the restraint on spending that has been in force  Mr Coldwell please    Well, I thought he stopped short of that    Well, we’re in the midst of a discussion that should and will take a  significant amount of time  But perhaps we ought to break now for coffee and then return   [Coffee break]    We are engaged in a very important discussion today on the state  of the financial economy, and in the course of our discussion we may want to broaden our  analysis and look at the international economy  Mr Kimbrel, let us hear from you now, please    Thank you, Mr Kimbrel, Mr Morris please    Which survey?    Well--    Well, I too have followed this Mr Sindlinger, and I have made an  effort to interest our staff in Mr Sindlinger  They have made studies, which I have not reviewed,  and I have been informed of their conclusions repeatedly, and their conclusions with regard to  Mr Sindlinger’s work in this area and others remain negative  Therefore I continue to look at  his indicator of consumer confidence [unintelligible] view with staff opinion  The value of that  indicator--I would not announce that publicly because I think you’re taking a certain risk, you  see, for your reputation, just as I am now taking similar risks with you by announcing any  interest at all in Mr Sindlinger    And I must say that I like to look at nuisances from all directions  and pay attention to crackpots--after all, the wise people of this world have misled us over the  years and maybe the crackpots will lead us on to a path of rectitude    Our staff does not know the meaning of bias    Thank you, Mr Morris  Mr Baughman now please    Say, incidentally, did you inform the Committee, in your report,  about the entire Mexico payment back to us?    Thank you, Mr Baughman  Mr Mayo now, please    I think Mr Mayo has raised a very interesting theoretical question,  which I will rephrase as follows  Suppose that the probability attached to successive forecasts is  held constant?  In that case, assuming that this is possible, would not the forecast itself now be  lower than Lyle has put it to you?  That’s essentially your question  And the real theoretical  issue is whether you could hold probability constant     10/19/76 - 16 -    I know that  It’s not what you’ve done, it’s not what you’re going  to do, it’s the question as to what you might do if it were at all a possibility--to hold probability  constant  Is that technically possible?    Well, I’m not sure it can be done at all, but [unintelligible] in the  hour of leisure, if it ever comes, you would have thought this question through, and I would like  to know your best answer  Any other comment, Mr Mayo?  Mr Winn now, please    This observation is based on precisely what interval during the  month of October?    I see, the first two weeks of October  Now, the retail figures that  we have; what’s the latest public retail trade figure?    You might have a difference in data, for October 9 and 14    When was the meeting?    Are interest rates being too low relative to--    Why should they come down in view of the lengthening of  maturity?    The risk is greater, so in effect they have come down    With increasing reliance on leasing, the volume of sales to those  same people should come down    We thank Mr Winn for the interesting observations  Mr Wallich  now, please     10/19/76 - 18 -    Well, if the general answer is along the lines that you’ve indicated,  let there be a sufficient decline in spending--makes no difference what the spending is on--and  the inventories that look normal today would look excessive later on  And then inventory  liquidation would follow  This does assume--to turn from this abstract proposition to judgment  about the economy--I think, more of a negative movement in the economy than Governor Lilly  assumed in his projection  He still had growth of 2-1/2 percent    Now you trouble me    Are you that precise that you can distinguish the mode and the  mean?    Thank you, Mr Wallich and Mr Gramley  Mr Partee now,  please    Thank you, Mr Partee  I would like to comment very briefly on  two of your comments  One is recent developments in personal income  Now Lyle, please  correct me if I’m wrong on these if you will  I believe that the decline in the rate of growth of  nominal personal income has been accompanied by, and is partly explained by, a decline in the  rate of increase of wages      Well, that’s a healthy development  Now, second, as for the  foreign economy, in the case of Italy, some restrictive measures have been taken, and perhaps  Italy’s gone as far as it can, given the political environment  But on the fiscal side, all that Italy  plans to do is to cut expenditures approximately $100 million--it’s as small as that      Yeah, it is being tightened  Now in the case of Britain, I don’t  know that my conclusions are any different, but I would certainly arrive at them in a rather  different way than you did  Whether we like it or not, the fact of the matter is the financial  people working around the world have very little confidence in the pound sterling  The only way  in which confidence in the pound sterling can be restored is by resorting to a highly restrictive  monetary policy, highly restrictive financial policy, stop all of the nonsense about nationalizing  industry, recreate some incentives for business people, business managers, particularly in the  intermediate classes  And that will mean a pinch in the real economy for a while, but it’s the  only way, in my judgment, that Great Britain can restore health to its economy      No, that’s what I mean, we arrived at the same conclusion      I think adjustments that have been postponed in one country after  another will have to be made  I think also that the sluggishness that we see in our own economy  is worldwide  And when a phenomenon repeats itself in one country after another, there are only  two lines of explanation  One is that sluggishness spreads from one country to others, and that  undoubtedly is true in some part  But there is a second line of explanation which I think is more  fundamental, namely that there are common basic causes [shared by] individual countries around  the world  And the common basic cause, I think, is the fact that the world has experienced a very  severe recession  It was unexpected  People around the world thought that was a thing of the  past, it could no longer happen  It did happen  And as a result, businessmen here and elsewhere     10/19/76 - 22 -   have become cautious in managing their inventories, they’ve become cautious in making plans  for large new investments in fixed capital     Now before, I think that we’ve been mistaken in thinking that the economy in our country  and the world could rebound quickly from the sharpness of the recession  So I think  sluggishness is a worldwide phenomenon now, and the need the world around is to restore  confidence, and the remedy will vary one country to another  Britain’s problem is certainly very  different from ours  But classical remedies such as a liberal financial policy may no longer work  in an environment in which inflation coexists with recession or with sluggish expansion in the  economy  I don’t disagree with your conclusion  I just wanted to comment on probably the  great necessity for the kinds of readjustments that are taking place around the world that have  been postponed too long      Which you have to try to overcome  You say working harder   Well, you have to work hard  I’d say there is still a question whether monetary and fiscal policy  is the right answer to the kind of environment in which we live  To a degree perhaps  But my  own judgment is that modifications of economic structure are probably necessary to restore  economic health, and that highly expansive policies are the difficulties from which we have  suffered      Thank you, Mr Wallich and Mr Partee  Mr Eastburn, may we  hear from you      Thank you, Mr Eastburn  Mr Balles now please      Thank you, Mr Balles  Mr Guffey, may we hear from you      Thank you, Mr Guffey  Mr Volcker      That’s very helpful, Mr Volcker  Mr Black, please      Which is one of the least reliable elements of the national income  accounts      Yeah, it’s, I remember, an increase of 44 percent in the third  quarter      I don’t have the figures      44     That’s my recollection, I don’t have it here  But it’s higher than  the increase in real GNP--I believe it would come out 44  All right, thank you, Mr Black  Mr  MacLaury      You say you see a large difference?      Thank you, Mr MacLaury  Any other comments on the  economy?  Yes, please      Well, you’ve contrasted the thinking of people as over against the  numbers that we’ve been concentrated on heavily, and I’m thinking your comments should help  all of us in restoring perspective just a bit  Mr Balles      I not only want to thank you, I want to say Amen  Any other  comment on the state of the economy?  Oh yes, Mr Gardner      Thank you, Mr Gardner, any other comment on the economy?   Yes, Mr Jackson      Well, thank you very much, Mr Jackson  Any other comment on  the economy?  Well, I just want to add one word  I’m disappointed, in the sense that I expected  more progress on the unemployment front by now than has occurred  I feel increasingly that     10/19/76 - 30 -   what I had to say in a paper that I presented some two years ago about a long economic wave  which ended in a speculative phase--speculation first in the acquisition of business firms, the  great merger [and] conglomerate movement; and then speculation in stock exchanges;  speculation in real estate; and then speculation in inventories--that led to a severe recession in the  economy  Where I feel that I probably made a mistake in economic analysis is in feeling perhaps  more optimistic about the rate of recovery than I, for one, should have  It’s a point I’ve made  here before  I don’t believe I made it in that paper  I haven’t gone back to it     Wishful thinking about the economy, unfortunately, is to some degree unavoidable; it’s a  hard thing to control  The thought that has dominated my own thinking during the past six  months is that we have a new generation of businessmen, a new generation of bankers  They’ve  gone through a severe recession  They were unprepared for it psychologically  Nothing that  they learned at the university prepared them for it  Nothing that they read in their newspapers or  magazines prepared them for it  And as a result, businessmen, bankers, have become cautious     Now gradually, I think, confidence has been returning, though I must say that I share some  of the feeling that Mr Partee expressed with regard to the stock market  That seems to argue to  the contrary  But in spite of that, I have the impression that, within the business community,  confidence is gradually returning  But we should have expected a gradual return, whereas we  didn’t  Or at least I didn’t  I thought the return of confidence would be speedier  And from the  viewpoint of policy, the critical question is, what can best be done to strengthen the state of  confidence  And for a country like Great Britain, I think the answer is pretty clear that drastic  changes in economic policy are necessary  A severe cutback in expenditure, which could be  accompanied by some easing of monetary policy and a stop to nationalization threats, etc     In the case of our own economy, I doubt--this is a point on which I disagree with Lyle--I  doubt that a more liberal fiscal policy would help matters  I do think that if we had a cut in taxes  accompanied by a cut in expenditures, and if the cut in taxes were concentrated in large part in a  reduction of business taxes, I do think that such a change in the structure of our fiscal budget  would help to restore confidence--would work in our direction  Apart from that, a great number  of structural changes in the economy with regard to the functioning of our labor markets, with  regard to our environmental programs, etcetera, I think would be helpful  Now I think monetary  policy can also be of some assistance to [conditions] like this as at any other time  But I would  agree with Lyle’s analysis that a given injection of monetary ease would have less effect in the  current environment than it had in earlier business cycle expansions     Well, I think we ought to turn now to our next subject  And let me say a word about how I  think we can best conduct our meeting from this point on  As I believe members of the  Committee have been informed, we will have to testify before the Senate Banking [Committee]  on November 11 on our monetary policy  And that means that some 23 days will elapse between  today and the date of the testimony  That is a much longer interval than the lapse between our  decision on longer-range annual targets and the disclosure of those targets to one or the other of  the banking committees     In view of that, I think it would be inadvisable to try to reach a decision on longer-range  targets today  I think we could usefully have a preliminary discussion, but that should be  followed up, and probably by a telephone conference meeting which could best be scheduled     10/19/76 - 31 -   [unintelligible] on November 8  And the reason for my choice of November 8 is that I have to be  in Dallas on November 4 and will not be back until November 5, which is a Friday  I’d like to  spend the weekend reviewing any fresh evidence that has come in, and therefore November 8,  which is a Monday, will still give us enough time to reach a final decision and still prepare the  testimony that has to be presented     So I think what we ought to do today is discuss first of all the short-range targets for the  two-month interval, as we do every month, and then turn to a discussion of the longer-range  targets  Now before we turn to that, we just have enough time before we break for luncheon, we  might have Mr Axilrod’s report on what the Bluebook has to teach us      Thank you, are there any questions or comments?      Well, Mr Axilrod has been unduly modest  I think that the little  study you made for me should be expanded and, in due course, perhaps by our next meeting,  distributed to the Committee  Now that little study shows the following, and the methodology is  not described here, and there is inevitably a considerable element of hazardous estimation  But  the results come out as follows  in the third quarter of ’75 and the third quarter of ’76, the  growth rate of M1 is 44 percent  Changes in financial technology reduced this growth rate of  M1 an estimated 19 percentage points, which means that in the absence of changes in financial  technology, the growth of M1 would have been 63 percent  Also, Mr Axilrod reports that in  making these estimates we have attempted to be quite conservative, which means that, if there is  known bias in the estimation, it is in the direction of understating the effects of changes in  financial technology      Yes, but earlier I have no calculations on that  But taking the  individual factors accounting for the 19, we know that these are very recent developments in the  largest part      Well, you have the NOW accounts, you have state and local  government accounts, you have NOW demand deposits at mutual savings banks in New York, I  don’t know how widespread that is, credit unions, money market mutual funds, telephonic  transfers--well, that would be business savings accounts  A rather large number of dramatic  changes of financial technology concentrated within the past year, or year and a half, or a  number of them go back four or five years      There was some rough allowance made for that in this calculation      It’s within that figure, a small component      Well, I think that if this does nothing else [unintelligible] our staff,  it helps to remind us that if you talk about the money supply, you’re not talking about a unique  [concept]  Mr Morris      The inference I draw from your comments is that, first, we’ve  been wise in instructing the Desk to give approximately equal weight to M1 and M2 rather than  to give identical weights to the two  [We] expressed the approximate part  Now the second  inference that I would draw is that this is not a matter that the Committee can properly deal with   A fairly liberal interpretation of the adverb “approximately” should be left to the staff, to take  account of the sort of considerations and to just mention--that would be my inference, and isn’t  that approximately or roughly what you have been doing?     SPEAKER(?)  I think so, Mr Chairman, yes     [MR BALLES]  Mr Chairman, even on that basis, by definition if you go 50-50 in a very  strict arithmetic sense, you’re really, based on the present quantities involved [unintelligible,]  have 72 percent in demand deposits and currency, and balancing the other components if we  have to [unintelligible]    SPEAKER(?)  John’s right, it’s because Ml is the major component of [unintelligible]   SPEAKER(?)  I’m not that smart and just figure the [unintelligible]     That is right, Ml is counted twice--by itself and second as a  component of M2      Well, gentlemen, I wonder if this isn’t as good as time as any--Mr  Black and Mr Wallich still have questions they want to put to Mr Axilrod      Well, gentlemen, [unintelligible] this specific moment  Let us  break for lunch and return at 230     [Lunch recess]    In the interest of brevity, I want to make some suggestions to the  Committee with regard to the short-run ranges and with regard to the longer-run ranges  And  then I think we ought to have a discussion of where we want to go in the short run, that is, with  regard to our two-month ranges  And after that to a discussion of tentative preliminary  discussion of our targets for the coming year     Now turning first to the short-run ranges, I feel, without stopping to elucidate, that a slight  easing move at the present time would be appropriate  I don’t think that you would be taking a  great risk  I think the movement should be very small  I can’t find my notes, but I think I know  what I want to say  I would suggest that the range for the federal funds rate during the months of  October and November be 4-1/2 to 5-1/4  Which means that we would move down  We would  lower the lower limit by 1/4 percent, and likewise the upper limit, from where it was during the  preceding months  I would raise M1 somewhat as specified under alternative B--5 to 9, I  believe; M2, 9 to 13  In other words, I’m recommending the specifications of alternative B with  slight modifications     SPEAKER(?)  Did you say M1 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 under B, or 5 to 9?       10/19/76 - 36 -    Well, I’m looking at alternative B, which I’m accepting  fundamentally  But M1 I would make 5 to 9; M2 I’d leave as is; federal funds rate 4-1/2 to  5-1/4      Well, the midpoint, I have an open mind on that  We could move  to the midpoint in the near future and have a symmetrical range or we could retain the kind of  asymmetry that we had last month  In other words, we have a 1/2 percentage point at the lower- end range and 1/4 percentage point at the upper end; we have the kind of asymmetry we had last  month  But--      On the symmetrical, if you move symmetrically, then the midpoint  would be 4-7/8, which means that we would get there in about a week, and then move to the left  or to the right depending on the behavior of incoming data on the monetary aggregates  A  second possibility is to retain precisely the kind of asymmetry that the Committee agreed to last  month  The federal funds rate would remain at 5 percent, for the time being, and then,  depending on incoming data, would move toward 4-1/2 or toward 5-1/4      It ought to be what?      I have been away and I have not studied the incoming evidence,  but I was under the impression that the Desk has operated strictly in accordance with the  instructions of the Committee, and ending the month at a 5 percentage point was precisely where  the Desk should have been, in view of the joint behavior of M1 and M2  I suspect that you’re  thinking mainly of M1, but I don’t have these--I have not studied the figures as closely as I  customarily do  Now, Peter, defend your own record or demolish it as you see fit      As I look at these figures, they seem to confirm what I said rather  than what you said, Mr Partee  Giving equal weight to Ml and M2      The sum of the midpoints as specified would have been 16  The  actual came out 147  The sum of the lower limits was 12  And therefore I’d say that on a very  literal reading, the federal funds rate should have been a little above 5 percent  I don’t think  anyone would want to read it that literally, and the kind of arithmetic I’ve just done, I’ve done  for the first time [as a] check on your observation  I trust my eye more than I do this kind of  arithmetic  Well, that shouldn’t detain us  I’ve made my suggestion, and members of the  Committee will deal with it as they see fit     Let me make a suggestion about the longer-run ranges  There, I would suggest that we  leave the ranges for M2 and M3 where they are but that we modify the range for M1  At present  the range is 4-1/2 to 7  And my suggestion to the Committee would be that we lower the upper  limit of Ml to 6-1/2  In other words, a range of 4-1/2 to 6-1/2 instead of 4-1/2 to 7  Now, my  reason for making this proposal is that I think it important that we continue making progress  toward achieving monetary growth rates that are more nearly consistent with price stability   We’ve moved very gradually in that direction during the past year, year and a half  I would  emphasize that our moves have been extremely gradual  If we continued the pace at which we  have traveled thus far, it would take us perhaps 8 or 10 years to achieve monetary aggregates that  are roughly consistent with general price stability in so far as we can now estimate it or as far as I  can now estimate it  So I don’t think I’m making a radical proposal     Now, the criticism that might be leveled against us--that this points to a more restrictive  monetary policy--that criticism would not be well founded  As things have turned out during the  past year, year and a half--it wasn’t a deliberate movement on our part, but as things have turned  out--Ml has been at approximately the lower limit of our growth range--approximately at 5  percent  During the 12 months, it’s been below that, a little below 5 percent  Therefore, while  the target range is lowered, there would be ample opportunity for this Committee to increase the  growth rate up to 6-1/2 percent, which is well beyond the zone that we’ve reached during any 12- month period  And, of course, at any subsequent meeting, we could readjust the growth rate     What I’m saying in effect is that we’ve had a range for Ml that we haven’t used  And  cutting back a little at the upper end would be realistic, and it would be another symbolic move  or demonstration on our part that we seek to return this nation’s monetary growth to a level that  eventually will be once again in harmony with, and not inconsistent with, general price stability       10/19/76 - 38 -   Well, these are my suggestions to the Committee, and I believe it would make for a more  orderly discussion if we talk first about the next month and what our target ranges should be for  October-November, and then turn to a preliminary discussion of the one-year targets  I don’t see  any hand up  Mr Volcker, why don’t you start  Mr Mayo will follow      I have no quarrel with that  I was influenced really by the  estimates that your Bank is making, and they’re above the estimates of the Board’s staff      That’s why I raised [M1 to] 5 to 9      Ml as well as M2?     What would you do?  Where would you lower them?       10/19/76 - 39 -    All right, thank you very much      All right  Mr Mayo, would you carry the discussion forward,  concentrating, as we are at this stage, on the two-month range      Thank you, Mr Mayo  Mr Coldwell now please      Thank you, Mr Coldwell  Mr Eastburn next      Thank you, Mr Eastburn  Mr Partee      Thank you, Mr Partee Mr Kimbrel now please      Thank you, Mr Kimbrel  Mr MacLaury now, please    All right, thank you, Mr MacLaury  Mr Black please      Thank you, Mr Black  Mr Balles please      Thank you, Mr Balles  Mr Morris please      Thank you, Mr Morris  Mr Wallich now please      Thank you, Mr Wallich  Mr Lilly please      Thank you, Mr Lilly  Who’s next?  Yes, Mr Jackson      Thank you, Mr Jackson  Who would like to speak next?  Mr  Baughman       10/19/76 - 42 -    All right, thank you, Mr Baughman  Who is next?  I’m going to  have to start calling on individuals  Mr Guffey, we haven’t heard from you  Mr Guffey and  then Mr Winn      Thank you, Mr Guffey  Mr Winn      Well, we’re going to come to that later  Mr Roos      Has everyone spoken?  Oh yes, Mr Gardner      Well, we don’t know  Well, gentlemen, we have to agree on the  language of the directive  I think the monetary aggregate directive using the innocuous language  of alternative B would be proper, in view of today’s discussion      Well, let’s have a show of hands  Let’s have a show of hands on  the language of the directive  How many would prefer a monetary aggregate directive this time?      Well, I think there is a clear majority  As to the [short-term]  specifications, the majority of the Committee favors a range of 5 to 9 for Ml; 9 to 13 for M2; and  4-1/2 to 5-1/4 for federal funds  In view of the discussion that we’ve had, and in view of the  minority which would seek a lower federal funds, I think it would appropriate to take the  midpoint--4-7/8--as the immediate target and to move symmetrically around that midpoint as we  normally do     So I would suggest that we vote on the following monetary aggregates directive as  described by the language of alternative B, the growth of Ml within the range of 5 to 9, the  growth rate for M2 of 9 to 13, a federal funds range of 4-1/2 to 5-1/4 with a move towards 4-7/8  within a week or 10 days  How would you like that worded Mr Sternlight?  Within a week?      Within about a week, all right  Let’s put it that way, within about  a week      Yes, within about a week you’re not going to have much  information  I think that is the meaning, that regardless of the behavior of the aggregates, you  move toward 4-7/8 and then you move up or down depending on incoming evidence on the  aggregates  And the move being restricted to 3/8 of 1 percent in each direction  Well, any  questions?  If not, would you be good enough to call the roll      [For] the longer-range targets--and recognizing that our discussion  is preliminary and the final decision will be made on November 8--in expressing our views we  can [unintelligible] preliminary discussion and we actually should ask ourselves the question, if  we were to announce longer-range targets two or three days from now, where would we want to  set them  That’s the best we can do in discussing the long-range targets in a preliminary way and  depending on incoming data and second thoughts, which may be better than original thoughts   We may want to depart from tentative decisions we have made today  All right, Mr Eastburn,  let’s start with you, please      May I just interrupt to say that--please feel free to proceed in your  own way  But I don’t think we can take up your suggestion today  I think the proper way to take  up your very interesting suggestion would be to have the staff analyze it, and let’s try to do that  rather promptly and have the staff comment and evaluate your suggestion then      But is that a correct statement?  He says what he meant--well,  now, wait, this is the correct statement for Ml, now there have been changes in the behavior of  income velocity, we have learned something about that  There’s been substitution of time and  savings deposits, demand deposits, there’s been other changes in financial technology that we  didn’t allow for right at the [unintelligible], knowing that these changes have occurred  Is there a  correction that needs to be made up?      Well, I don’t know  You see, this staff study that Mr Axilrod  referred to gave you some specific numbers, and it arrives at the conclusion that if the financial  technology had been constant, Ml growth would have been almost 2 percentage points higher in     10/19/76 - 45 -   the past year than it turned out to be  Now, so we have had some study devoted to that subject,  and you know perfectly well how wrong the economics profession has been in estimating the  demand for money over the past year, year and a half, or a bit longer than that      Thank you, Mr Eastburn  Mr Coldwell please      Just a factual point, the way figures have come out relative to our  projection--or plan, if you like--at Ml we’ve been toward the lower end; M3, we’ve been toward  the upper end; M2, we’ve been close to the midpoint, and therefore, taking the three Ms together,  I say we have been surprisingly close      Well, we’ve learned better, and now we look at Ml and M2 at  least, giving them approximately equal weight, as we had occasion to remind ourselves at this  meeting  Who would like to speak next?  Mr Partee and then Mr MacLaury      You say that in full recognition of the fact that, under my  suggested range, we could still ease over a total of 12 months considerably      Well, the commentary would be directed toward two sets of  specifications  The short-term specification, [which] will have eased, and the long-term, which  may be interpreted as having tightened but which need not be a tightening at all, for two reasons   First, we haven’t used the upper part of the range, and there’s ample room to move from the  present 5 as a low figure up to 6-1/2; and second, we are not slaves to the figures that we put  down  I’m not arguing, I simply wanted to clarify the--     Well, that’s a good question       10/19/76 - 47 -    Well, that’s a good question, whether they should remain secret  under the circumstances  Well, let’s not debate that now  I think that I have not thought about  that  You see, remember this, in the past, when we had to testify in the beginning of the year  before the Joint Economic Committee--instead of allowing the lag of 90 days, we permitted the  lag to fall below two months, even  In recognition of the fact that we had to testify before the  congressional committee, we’ve deviated from that road      Yes, yes that’s true, but on the other hand, yeah that’s true and that  would argue against specifying the short-term ranges  However, the market rate for federal  funds will be known, and what happens before the--     I realize that  I realize that  But the market rate will be known,  and it may well be lower because we’re giving it a head start in that direction and moving rather  promptly to 4-7/8  I see your point, and I am glad you made the point because it will help me to  think through a question that I hadn’t thought about before      That’s very understandable  Mr Volcker  Oh, I’m sorry, Mr  MacLaury and then Mr Volcker      Thank you, Mr MacLaury  Mr Volcker please      You’d have enormous difficulty if you had a business recession  reaching anything like the figure we have for M1      Thank you, Mr Volcker  Mr Mayo now, please      Thank you, Mr Mayo  Mr Wallich please      Thank you, Mr Wallich  Mr Kimbrel next, please      Thank you, Mr Kimbrel  Mr Morris now, please      Thank you, Mr Morris  Mr Jackson now, please       10/19/76 - 50 -    Thank you, Mr Jackson  Mr Balles please      Thank you, Mr Balles  Mr MacLaury you have another  observation on any of these things?      Thank you, Mr MacLaury      All right, Mr Black, we haven’t heard from you      Thank you, Mr Black  Mr Gardner      Thank you, Mr Gardner  Mr--I don’t have anyone left  Mr  Lilly       10/19/76 - 52 -    Thank you, Mr Lilly  Mr Guffey, Mr Roos, would you like to  comment?      Thank you, Mr Roos  Mr Guffey      The Committee is evenly divided on Ml as between 4-1/2 to 6-1/2  and staying where we are at 4-1/2 to 7  As for M2, there is a majority for 7-1/2 to 9-1/2, which is  where we are now  As for M3, there is a majority in favor of 9 to 11, which is where we are  now     Well, gentlemen, I don’t think we need to go beyond this  Let’s keep in mind the results of  this preliminary discussion  For M2 and M3, a clear majority of the Committee will prefer to  stay where we are  And on Ml, an equal number prefer 4-1/2 to 7, and [thus] staying where we  are, [as] prefer to go down a 1/2 point on the upper limit  I don’t think I want to argue the point  now     We will have another go at it 23 days from now, and I expect to be in a position to [present  altered long-run specifications to] this Committee if necessary  But as of today I’m entirely  satisfied with the expressions of opinion we have had  And I would be eternally grateful to that  member of this Committee who would be bold enough to suggest that we adjourn  Thank you  very much  What I said, 23 days, was wrong, it was 20 days     END OF MEETING         "
202,1976-11-08,"  Gentlemen, this is Arthur Burns speaking  I take it that all  members of the Committee or their duly appointed alternates are now assembled and we can  proceed to our discussion of the longer--    Well, let’s see what is happening here  Can you hear me now?     [Others reply “yes”]    Well, apparently all I have to do is to speak up; and I shall try   We held a preliminary discussion of our annual monetary growth range targets at the last  meeting of our Committee, and in the course of that discussion, approximately half of the  members expressed a preference for leaving the monetary growth rates for the year--starting in  the third quarter of 1976 and ending in the third quarter of 1977--unchanged  Approximately the  remaining one-half of the members of the Committee expressed a preference for lowering the  upper limit of the growth range for M1 from 7 percent to 6-1/2 percent but leaving other  specifications concerning monetary growth unchanged  Now, since these were the two  prevailing views, I think it would be best if we concentrated our discussion on a choice between  these two ways of specifying our monetary growth ranges for the coming year     At the FOMC meeting, I argued that it would be desirable to lower the upper limit of the  growth range of M1 from 7 percent to 6-1/2 percent  I have given a great deal of thought to this  matter since our meeting, as I’m sure all of us have  My own basic view remains pretty much  what it was  I think there is a good case for lowering the upper limit of M1 from 7 to 6-1/2  percent  And my basic reason is as follows  If a return to reasonable price stability in our  country is to be obtained over the next few years, we will need to reduce our monetary growth  rates quite substantially  Now, we have already done this during the past year, or year and a half,  on a modest scale at our preceding meetings  Today, by taking one more small step toward  reducing our annual growth range targets, we would clearly indicate to the outside world that we  are still pursuing a moderate, prudent, consistent policy of promoting economic expansion and  yet helping to unwind the inflation that is still plaguing our economy     This argument is reinforced by a second consideration in my mind  Namely, that our  average growth rate of M1 during the past year has been roughly 5 percent, that is, it has been at  the lower limit of the range for M1  We have not used the upper part of the range for M1, and  therefore a reduction of the upper limit of the range from 7 percent to 6-1/2 percent would not be  at all inconsistent with, actually, a substantial increase in the growth of M1 during the coming  year if the Committee so sought, and if events validated the Committee’s decisions     Nevertheless, I fully recognize that there is a significant objection that could be raised  against lowering the upper limit of M1 to 6-1/2 percent  The objection is, or might well be, that     11/8/76 - 2 -           such a move would be misinterpreted by many, that it would be regarded as a restrictive  monetary measure and that, at a time when the economy is pausing, so to speak, that such a time  is hardly opportune for restrictive measures or for measures that could be so interpreted  I tried  to weigh this objection, and my conclusion is as follows  First, we must do what we think is  basically right for the economy  Second, we should not be deterred from doing so by the danger  of misinterpretation  And third, we should be able to minimize misinterpretation by carefully  interpreting what we are striving to accomplish     So I thus find myself still recommending, as I did before, a reduction in the annual  monetary growth range, or more precisely, the upper limit of that range, from 7 percent to 6-1/2  percent  In making this recommendation, it is only proper that I add that I thoroughly respect  opposing arguments that can be, and--I’m sure before this meeting is concluded--will be made     Now I would like to say a word about procedure  A telephonic conversation is difficult for  all of us, and by maintaining a certain order we might facilitate our discussion  Now I am going  to call first of all on Mr Winn, and there’s a good and obvious reason for doing so  Mr Winn  left our [preceding] meeting of the FOMC before the longer-range targets were discussed   Starting, then, at the lower end of the alphabet I will move next to the upper end of the alphabet  and call on Mr Black  Then I shall move to the next lowest end of the alphabet and call on Mr  Wallich and then to the next highest name on the alphabetic range and call on Mr Coldwell, and  so on in sequence     And the order, therefore, in which I will call on members of the Committee is as follows   First, Mr Winn, then Mr Black, then Mr Wallich, then Mr Coldwell, then Mr Timlen, then  Gardner, then Partee, then Guffey, then Lilly, then Jackson, and then Kimbrel  Now as a result  of the alphabetical rule that I am following, you will notice that the south will have the last voice  and that perhaps is not altogether inappropriate at this season, and this will be the only  quasi-political note, I hope, that will be struck at this meeting  We are ready now for you, Mr  Winn  Good morning to you, and good morning to all members of the Committee    Let me say a word about that  I think the question you raised is  entirely appropriate, but I don’t believe that we can, particularly in a telephone meeting,  reconsider our procedure, and therefore I don’t think that we ought to make any attempt at this     11/8/76 - 3 -           time to do anything about the base  But I think this would be a fitting subject for discussion in  subsequent meetings  Now let me next call on Mr Black  Good morning, Mr Black    Thank you, Mr Black  I should have observed that members of  the Committee, in addition to stating their views on the two alternatives on which we’ll be  concentrating, should feel free if they so desire, at the time when they speak, to call on Mr  Gramley or Mr Axilrod to reply to any questions that they may have     With that understanding, let me turn next to Mr Wallich, please  I have the advantage  now--I can look into Mr Wallich’s eye  We all have a certain difficulty, you know, talking to  individuals whom we do not see face-to-face, but that’s the nature of the telephonic conversation   Perhaps we should be grateful that such a thing is possible in our advanced technological age     You’re not overlooking the October figure are you?    Well, thank you, Mr Wallich, and good morning, Phil    And we’re ready for you now    Thank you, Mr Coldwell  Let us hear now from Mr Timlen   Good morning, Mr Timlen    Thank you, Mr Timlen  Mr Gardner, let us hear from you now,  please    Thank you, Mr Gardner  And we are now ready for Mr Partee   Mr Partee, may we hear from you?    Thank you, Mr Partee  And now good morning, Mr Guffey, and  we’re ready to hear from you    Thank you, Mr Guffey  We’re now ready for you, Mr Lilly    Very good, would you be good enough to repeat your question,  Mr Partee, first to Mr Gramley    All right, Mr Gramley, may we have some brief comments from  you now, in reply to Mr Partee    This evidence is for what month?    Thank you, Mr Gramley  Now, Mr Partee, would you be good  enough to repeat your question to Mr Axilrod    Thank you, Mr Axilrod and Mr Gramley  And we’re now ready  to return to Mr Lilly, please    Can you just pause for a moment so that members of the  Committee, to the extent that they are physically equipped to do so, [unintelligible] and locate  their Bluebooks?    That would be helpful    Thank you very much, Mr Lilly  And now we’ll hear from Mr  Jackson    Thank you, Mr Jackson, we’re now ready for the final statement  that will be made at this stage of our discussion  Then Mr Kimbrel, good morning, Mr  Kimbrel    Now let me try to summarize the discussion that we’ve had thus  far  A clear majority of the Committee would favor reducing the upper limit of M1 to 6-1/2  percent  However, in the case of several members of the Committee, that feeling has been  accompanied by the thought that the upper limit of M2 and M3 might well be raised somewhat   I would now like to canvas the thinking of the Committee with regard to M2 and M3, not  concentrating so much on numbers as on the thought of whether or not it would be desirable at  this time to raise somewhat the upper limits of those two monetary magnitudes    Mr Jackson has suggested that before we turn to this discussion  concerning M2 and M3, that a question be put to Mr Axilrod, and Mr Jackson would you be  good enough to proceed    Mr Partee would like to make a comment    Mr Axilrod, please give a very brief reply since you’re going to  take a number out of the air     11/8/76 - 11 -            Thank you, Mr Axilrod, let us then turn to a discussion of the  upper limit of M2 and M3  Messrs Coldwell, Lilly, and Partee have already stated their views  very clearly that they would prefer to see an increase in the upper limit of those two monetary  magnitudes, and therefore I shall not call on them at this time  And I shall proceed to call on  other members of the Committee, this time in straight alphabetical order, all of which has an  element of justice in it since Mr Winn, having been first at the start, will now be the last speaker   And we’ll start now with Mr Black    Thank you, Mr Black  Mr Gardner, please    Thank you, Mr Gardner  Mr Guffey next, please    Thank you, Mr Guffey  Mr Jackson, please    Thank you, Mr Jackson  Mr Kimbrel, please     11/8/76 - 12 -            Thank you, Mr Kimbrel  Mr Timlen now    Thank you, Mr Timlen  Mr Wallich, please    Thank you, Mr Wallich  Let us hear from Mr Winn    As matters stand now five members of the Committee have  indicated a preference for raising the upper limits of M2 and M3, six members of the Committee  have indicated a preference for [keeping them] where they are, and for the moment, I’m not  going to express a view on that issue  We’re almost evenly divided     Now I should say this to the Committee  At the last meeting of the FOMC, we reached a  decision which I think was a proper decision, to take a formal vote on our longer-range targets   Before that, we had advice from our attorneys not to follow that procedure, but I think our  attorneys have relented  In any case the Committee clearly expressed its view at the last meeting  that a vote should be taken  Now that puts a heavy responsibility on each of us, and I think the  responsibility, without elaborating the point, is especially heavy at this time in Federal Reserve  history       11/8/76 - 13 -           In view of that, while I am somewhat fearful that raising the upper limit of M2 and M3 will  cause some confusion, I believe that the best chance of coming close to unanimity, if not actually  attaining it--I hope we can attain it at this meeting--would be to vote on the following  proposition  that the range for M1 be set at 4-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent for the coming year, and that  the range for M2 be set at 7-1/2 to 10 percent and the range for M3 to be set at 9 to 11-1/2  percent--the reason for raising the upper limit of M2 and M3 being along the lines expounded  most fully by Mr Partee in the earlier part of our discussion  I suggest that we vote on that  proposition  M1 at 4-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent, M2 at 7-1/2 to 10 percent, and M3 at 9 to 11-1/2  percent  But before taking an actual vote, does any member of the Committee wish to speak at  this time?  Mr Partee would like to speak    At this time, I think I must state my views on this subject  While I  have some sympathy with what Mr Partee has said, he, like the rest of us, is guessing about the  future  Moving up to the upper limit of M2 and M3 would indicate a direction of our thinking   We will have ample opportunity to modify our thinking, if that is desired, at subsequent  meetings     To move down the upper limit of M1 by 1/2 percentage point and to move up the upper  limit of M2 and M3 by a full percentage point I think would be profoundly confusing  We  would return, as far as M2 and M3 are concerned, to the upper limit that we set as early as April  1975  There would be a complete reversal, and I think it would be most unfortunate, and while I  regret differing with my colleague so sharply, I would strongly urge the Committee not to do  that, and I hope that Mr Partee would go along  Is there any other comment that any member of  the Committee would like to make at this time?     I think the differences between us now have become rather subtle and I hope that we can  be reasonably close to unanimity if not actually unanimous  Any other comments?  Mr Wallich  would like to make a comment    I think that’s a reasonable interpretation  We might not all agree  with it, but I think it’s a very reasonable interpretation  Is there any other comment at this time?   If not, I’ll ask our Secretary to call the roll    Well, I think this is a good outcome, and the ability of this  Committee to conciliate our differences, I think, is most encouraging, not only for today but for  the long future  And, actually, we’ve not been very far apart at any time  I have nothing to add,  except to express my thanks to members of the Committee  Would someone like to say anything  at this time?  I hear yes  Please    Well, I think that these issues are so complex that we ought not to  try to do that in a telephone conversation    But this is something that we must do  There are an accumulating  number of technical issues--and I would say, particularly, the method of operating in the short  run--that we need to examine with very great care, and I am waiting for the staff to give me a  signal when they are ready, and I am urging the staff to try to be ready as soon as possible     So I’ll be in touch with the Committee, or Mr Broida will be in touch  And I assure you,  Mr Winn, and I assure other members of the Committee, that these technical questions are not  being neglected  They will be considered very carefully, they must be, by our Committee   There’s nothing to add  Let me thank all of you   END OF MEETING         "
218,1976-11-16,"  [Two items] I thought it best to take up in executive session  One  is to discuss a little [unintelligible] the Mexican situation and what [unintelligible] the  subcommittee of this Committee has been up to  And the second item that I wish to discuss with  the [Committee] is Mr Reuss’s request for the minutes of Reserve Bank board meetings     Now let me say a little about the Mexican situation and then call on Mr Wallich to talk to  you about developments there and our own relation to those developments, and perhaps in detail   As you may recall, we have a swap facility for Mexico  Mexico can draw on us for up to $360  million; such a drawing was made earlier this year, and that amount was later repaid, or repaid  recently  The original loan to Mexico of $360 million was not made by us with due deliberation,  with due care  We acted, I think, a little mechanically  There was this arrangement, they asked  for the money, and we asked a few questions, grumbled a little, and just went along  The fact of  the matter is that we are very poorly informed about Mexico’s financial condition, and I’m not  proud of the way in which we have conducted ourselves  I’m not talking about the decisions   I’m talking about the degree of knowledge, the amount of information we had at the time we  made the decision     Since then, we have taken strong steps to familiarize ourselves not only with the situation  in Mexico on a current basis but to keep up-to-date records, as thorough as we can make them,  for each of the countries with which we have a swap arrangement  And we are far better  organized today to deal with a request for a loan or a swap drawing than we were previously     There was a time when swap drawings were virtually automatic  Our attitude has changed;  mine certainly has  When Britain came in earlier this year, the initial request was for $3 billion   Without going through the details, I agreed with the British on the sum of $2 billion and  indicated we would not go above that  And then I went to the Treasury and asked the Treasury  to become our partner, the reason being that Britain is no longer as creditworthy as it once was   And I’m afraid that is the kind of world we live in as far as foreign borrowing from us--much of  it--is concerned  We have not said anything about that publicly, and I don’t think we should   We would only add to anxiety and uncertainty  But I no longer regard the swap facility as being  quasi-automatic  I don’t think it should be     Now, I haven’t found anyone who anticipated a depreciation of the Mexican peso of 50  percent or more  The financial policies conducted by that country have been scandalous--we  were inadequately informed  Well, we now understand, I think, the situation in Mexico with  reasonable thoroughness  The Mexicans have now come in for a request for a new borrowing   That request was studied with the utmost care by your subcommittee  We had one meeting after  another on the issue, raised one question after another, one kind of conversation after another  with the Mexicans, one conversation after another with the Treasury  The long and short of it is  that Mexico may be very close to bankruptcy  I mean by that the enormous foreign debts  Mexico has contracted--it is by no means clear that Mexico will be able to service these debts,     11/16/76 - 2 -           and a moratorium may need to be declared, [with] the debts being rescheduled  Now that would  be a most unfortunate development because our banks are heavily involved in lending to Mexico   And of course it could set off moratoria elsewhere around the world     Taking things all and all, recognizing that Mexico is not a good borrower, recognizing that  any amount that we might loan to Mexico may not be repaid for some time, the subcommittee  still decided unanimously to make a loan of $150 million and not go above that  That is exactly  what the Treasury has made available to the Mexicans, so we’re being partners in that deal just  as we were on the British case  Now, you might wonder why would we make a loan in the case  of a country the prospects of which are so gloomy and the prospects of which in any event are so  highly uncertain?  The factor that led me finally to conclude that it was desirable, I believe--and  other members of the subcommittee were governed by similar thoughts--was that if Mexico were  to declare a moratorium in the near future, having received no help at all from this central bank,  then we would inevitably share a certain responsibility for the collapse and for the difficulties  that would be caused to our commercial banks     Now, if you ask me, am I at all sure that a loan of a $150 million by us would prevent such  a default, the answer is, oh, no, by no means  It’s really a drop in the bucket, considering  Mexico’s enormous need to borrow  But a new government will come into power, and that, of  course, influenced our thinking to a degree  And if a reflow of capital took place, Mexico could  straighten out its affairs; if a reflow doesn’t take place, then I am afraid Mexico will go down the  drain  Now I am going to call on Mr Wallich to add to my comments in any way he sees fit    You mean repay at the end of three months    Thank you very much  There is one additional word that I’d like  to say before exposing myself and Mr Wallich and other members of the subcommittee to  questioning  These conversations with Mexico were practically concluded by Sunday evening,  November 7  On the morning of November 8, we [the FOMC] had a telephone conference, at  which time we took up our longer-range monetary targets--the subject on which I had to testify  on the 11th  Therefore it would have been possible for me to take up this subject of the Mexican  loan on the morning of November 8 with members of the Committee     Now, I thought long and hard about that  It certainly would have been my intention, my  strong preference  But this is such a highly sensitive subject, and I’m told that our telephone  hookup is not absolutely secure  Therefore, I decided that if any leak occurred, it could cause  great convulsions that would cause waves all around the world, and I decided therefore not to do  it  Now your subcommittee met continuously, with the exception of Mr Volcker, who was out  of the country part of the time  Mr Volcker was fully informed, and the subcommittee was  entirely unanimous, but I did want you to know that this technically could have come before the  Committee at the meeting on the 8th and my reason for not bringing it up [then]    That’s right    No, no magic--hard bargaining  We started out being reluctant to  do anything, but afterward, you know, [in] our own discussions [with the Treasury]--the attitude  of the Treasury, taking into account repercussions on the world at large, on our own banks, the  position that we would be in if we ignored entirely the difficulty of another central bank--the  Treasury previously reached this agreement of 150 and indicated [to us] that they would be  receptive to--in view of the possible consequences--increasing their loan  We went along with a  150 and indicated to the Mexicans that we don’t have any intention of going beyond that  Mr  MacLaury     11/16/76 - 5 -            We have made no such condition this time    Well, I don’t have the figure in mind--$8 billion, I think    Well, you see, their borrowing needs as best we can judge are  about $250 [million] per month    Well, Henry and I had the initial conversations, and Henry carried  on a conversation later on  My understanding is that that’s what you communicated to the  Mexicans  Would you answer that question precisely?    There are plenty of sheep in this country   SPEAKER(?)  Is this $9 billion all government debt, I mean to the Mexican government?    Oh, no, their total debt, total known indebtedness is well over 20  billion  That is known indebtedness abroad   SPEAKER (?)  I’m thinking of the American banks    Let me call on Mr Gardner, Mr Gardner may want to comment,  and then, I know, [Mr] Volcker    Well, that’s uncertain    I must say I hope it’s interim, but if this turned out to be one of  these loans that stretches out uncomfortably, I would not to be too surprised, unfortunately,  under the circumstances    No, no; oh no  But, well, we thought long and hard about that, and  the last thing that we would have wanted to do or did do was to give Mexico a loan and have  Mexico use that as a basis for borrowing from the commercial banks and therefore be indirectly  responsible for drawing in the commercial banks  We did not fall into any such trap     Now, we could have gotten, for example, also an agreement out of the Mexicans--I think  this would have been easy--under which, getting 800 million or 800 million plus from the  commercial banks now, they would use some of that money to repay us  We talked about that,  but we didn’t have to spend much time debating that  That would have put us in an impossible  position, you see  Here the other banks come in and we get our money back out of funds that  they supplied  I don’t think a central bank can ever put itself in that position  So we could have  secured our loan, but we decided not to     One other point--possibly you covered that, Henry, I know I didn’t--we have reemphasized  repeatedly to the Mexicans that they must use the funds supplied very sparingly and in the  process of foreign exchange transactions, and they must not try to peg the peso, that they must  husband their resources  We have all kinds of assurances from the Mexicans that they will do  just that  These assurances were made initially voluntarily  They have repeated those assurances  as we raised the question, but having said that, I must go on to say that my confidence in these  assurances being respected is very limited  And my confidence in their central bank operations  is very limited      Yes    Now let me talk about that just a little in a more comprehensive or  rather a more general way  We could advise the banks strongly to cut back on their foreign  lending  If we did that, we run the risk [of] the very crisis in international finance that we are  seeking to prevent  I’m not talking about Mexico, I’m talking about all around, because our  banks have, in my judgment, been rather imprudent once again in lending abroad  That is my  judgment; I may be wrong about that, but that’s the way I feel  If we gave them strong advice to  that effect, we could bring on an international financial crisis  On the other hand, if they  continue lending on the scale that [they] have been doing, then I think it’s only a matter of time  before such a crisis will occur     Now, what I have done, really, well, let me go back  [IMF Managing Director] Mr  Witteveen issued a word of warning, and that was done after consultation with us  He issued his  word of warning in Manila, which you may have seen  [Treasury Secretary] Mr Simon did the  same, and that was done after careful consultation with us  In some meetings with private  bankers, I tried to deal with the question lightly and indicated this is an area that bankers must  consider carefully     I thought about taking stronger measures, but here is the difficulty  There are two  difficulties  The one that I just mentioned, namely that they might take that advice too strictly  and then bring on a crisis  But there is a second difficulty  If we start telling banks publicly just  to whom to lend, for what purpose to lend, we would be getting into the business of credit  allocation  And you may recall the difficulties we had with the Congress in connection with the  REITs  We did a little of that and all hell broke loose on Capitol Hill, the point being, well, now  you are in the credit allocation business now, and what’s wrong with the credit allocation bill  that has been submitted     So we have been quite cautious  I don’t know if that is--it’s as good a reply as I can make  to the question  I would not want to say, and I have never said to anyone, to answer your  question specifically, that banks should not lend to Mexico  I haven’t singled out Mexico  I  have talked generally about the LDCs, and honestly, in the world that we live in, the category of  LDCs badly needs redefinition, in my judgment  Great Britain and Italy in today’s world belong  in a category of LDCs for every practical financial purpose  Yes, Mr Eastburn    No, I rather think it is [undervalued]  But the way in which they  have been handling their wage problems also makes me wonder how long that condition will  continue    Any other questions?    I, I don’t know the general--    Mr Volcker, would you like to comment?    I would second that comment, that it’s a situation we can’t walk  away from  Now, I think you all know that the British have applied to the IMF, but the British  are putting on a very powerful political campaign to accomplish two things  First, no conditions  by the IMF--in effect, have the IMF bless British financial policy  Second, to work out some  arrangement whereby the sterling balances--which, in the aggregate, amount to about $10 billion,  but of which the sensitive part is held by central banks, and that part amounts to $4  billion--would [be] somehow taken care of by other countries     Now, this is a problem that has concerned me very deeply for some time  In response to a  direct question from the Bank of England, and in response to an emissary sent by other central  banks and to Mr Leaver, who is an emissary of the British government--Mr Galagan and Mr  Leaver are seeing the President today--I have taken a very hard position, saying that I, for one,  will not even talk about the sterling balances until the IMF arrangement has been concluded  But  while I have taken this very tough position in talking to the British--and a similar position,  fortunately, I think, is being taken by the Treasury, and I’ve talked to the President about this,     11/16/76 - 10 -           both before the election and since then, and to others, Mr Kissinger, etc--while I’ve taken as  tough a position as one could, internally some work is being done by our staff, and some of us  are considering various possibilities, but we’ve not indicated even one word that this is  happening     In a very uncertain world, it is difficult--well, worse than difficult, I think it’s unwise to  take a hard position and stick to it no matter what the probable or likely consequences may be  I  think that the New York City problem was in the end handled quite appropriately  The position  taken was, not one cent for New York  And that position was repeated so often that New York  City finally came to believe it  New York City, New York State started doing something by  themselves to solve their problem  In the end, some help was extended by the government, and I  played a certain part in making that possible  But there was no hint ever given that help was  going to be forthcoming, because we wanted New York to help itself as far as possible     And that, I think, is our problem with the British today  And there will be other problems  around the world, as Mr Volcker has indicated  It’s in the nature of planning really  You don’t  plan for success  Well, if success comes along you enjoy it  It’s in the nature of good planning  to try to think through how to prevent disaster; in other words, to make unfavorable assumptions  and try to think through at as early a stage as possible how to prevent disaster, how to prevent the  unfavorable event from occurring  And I want this Committee to know that very careful thought  is being given to the entire world scene     Let me say one final word  This meeting is an executive session  I wanted to share my  concerns with my colleagues, not only about the Mexican situation  We’ve been actively at  work and have been energizing this government to do something to prevent an increase in the  price of oil  What will come of it, I don’t know, but at last this government is awake  Now, my  advice to all of you, and I can’t put that too strongly, is to say as little as possible about any of  these problems because they are so extremely sensitive    Any other question or comment on--     My judgment is very simple  If you have reflows of capital, this  will all turn out very happily  If you don’t, I don’t see how a moratorium or rescheduling can be  prevented very long    There is one item that will come up at our regular meeting that I  think I should mention, and you correct if I’m wrong, Mr Pardee  I believe you will be  recommending to the [FOMC] that the present swap schedule be reaffirmed    I think we ought to reach that decision here, rather than in open,  that is, at our formal meeting  My own view is that we certainly ought to do that, but we ought  to do that with the understanding that the swap facility no longer has the automatic meaning that  it had previously  For us not to reaffirm the present swap schedule would cast doubt and  uncertainty and it could have very serious repercussions  I think we definitely ought to reaffirm,  but we ought to understand among ourselves that the swap facility no longer has quite the  meaning that it did  Now, actually, historically, it never was completely automatic, but it is  definitely less so now than before    Well, in operational terms, what it means is that when a request  comes along and we have doubts about the creditworthiness of the borrower, or we have doubts  about the purpose of the borrowing, as in the Austrian case recently--you know, what the  Austrians were doing, essentially, was really arbitraging on interest rates, and I don’t see why we  should lend money for that purpose  What it means operationally is that we’re far more cautious,  far more deliberate, as to country and as to purpose, than we used to be    Well, only--    That’s a nice term    Well, I think we will be more circumspect about any such requests  than we have been  I was not enthusiastic at all, in fact resisted for some time, the request of the  Mexicans to double the amount of the swap facility going up from $180 to $360  Well, we did it,  and that kind of resistance or that kind of question would be greater in the future, I assure you   This isn’t a happy picture, gentlemen, not the best way to start our deliberations, but I felt that  it’s only proper to advise the members of the Committee on what your subcommittee, and in  certain areas, I myself, have been doing       11/16/76 - 13 -           Any further questions?  If not let me turn to the second item for this executive session, and  that is the request that Mr Reuss made some time ago that we deliver to him by 5 pm, October  15, the minutes of all our Reserve Bank meetings for the past five years  Now just before I went  off on my foreign trip, I advised Mr Reuss that I was going abroad, that it would be impossible  to comply with the request by October 15, and that the matter is being explored with our Reserve  Banks, and that I would be in touch with him soon after my return  I had a meeting with Mr  Reuss and subsequently received a letter from him indicating his understanding of our  conversation  I would prefer not to go into detail on that and merely say that my understanding  is not the same as Mr Reuss’s understanding of that conversation  Now, I have before me a  letter that I haven’t yet sent, which I do intend to send today  I’ll read this letter to you and then  we can discuss that on whatever scale you wish     Dear Henry   In accordance with our conversation last Friday, I shall advise the Reserve Bank boards to send you the  minutes of their meetings   As you and I agreed at our meeting, the following highly sensitive items will be omitted  those pertaining  to borrowing or prospective borrowing by individually named banks at the discount window; those pertaining to  transactions with foreign central banks; and those pertaining to real estate plans or negotiations in process  Also,  items pertaining to individual personnel matters or to safety measures at the banks will be put in a separate file,  and you and I alone will sit down and go over them  Let me say once again that I am pleased that this matter has  been resolved and that I shall do what I can to expedite the delivery of the minutes for 1972, 1974, and 1975   Now I hope that this will end the matter, but I cannot be entirely sure    Well I omitted--I have three years here instead of five, you see  I  tried to persuade Mr Reuss--really, since his purpose is apparently to see what the Reserve  Banks do; it’s some kind of fishing expedition--that a one-year sample would probably serve his  purpose  If he finds that it doesn’t, well, he could come back and ask for another year  We  reached this compromise on three years instead of five, which will cut down the labor, since this  editing process will be not a small burden for the Reserve Banks     Now, I tried to persuade Mr Reuss to follow another course, namely that since his interest  originally was on the question of how much control do the Reserve Banks and the directors of  those Banks have over the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy--I thought that was his interest,  and earlier correspondence did indicate that that was his interest--I tried to persuade him that that  interest could be met quite adequately without turning to the Reserve Banks at all, and I  indicated to him that I would be pleased to make available to him every communication from  each of the Reserve Banks with respect to the discount rate; second, that I would make available  to him all petitions that we receive from time to time from the boards of directors of individual  Banks; and that I would be willing, further, to make available to him all letters that I had  received from individual members of our Bank boards  Mr Reuss indicated that would not meet  his need because his need was to determine what the Reserve Banks really do, and that he or his  committee was entitled to that information     And then we turned to the expurgated minutes--that was the next point that I took up, the  sensitive areas and how they’re to be dealt with  Now, if all of this is acceptable to Mr     11/16/76 - 14 -           Reuss--which I devoutly hope will be the case--then at the time when these minutes are  transmitted, I will express the hope that they will be treated confidentially by his committee  I  don’t want to do that in this letter  I don’t think this is the time to take up that question     I’d be glad to answer any questions about this at whatever length members of the  Committee may wish  I assure you that a great deal of thought and trouble has gone into this at  the [Federal Reserve] Board’s end and my personal end, as well as at the individual Banks  And  if this agreement stands, I do think that it is a very reasonable and a very good resolution of a  very difficult problem that unfortunately has arisen, which need not have arisen     Now, at some stage, I’m going to call on Mr O’Connell to talk about technical  arrangements with the Banks with regard to the understanding as described in the letter that I’ve  just read to you  But are there any questions first?  Yes, Mr Winn    I think the answer to that question is yes  That question was not  asked, and we’re not going to volunteer    These will be submitted, the letter will be addressed to “The  Honorable Henry S Reuss, Chairman”   SPEAKER(?)  Does he have the backing of his committee?  Do we know that, or is it an  individual request?    That has not been tested, and I thought that it would be far better  to work something out with Mr Reuss rather than subject this question to methodical testing,  which would have created the spectacle, at least, of a confrontation, which would have seriously  exacerbated feelings  Whether he would have the backing of his committee or not on this  question, I simply do not know  What I can be sure of is that, if we refuse and ask for an  expression by the entire committee, this would certainly be hotly debated, fought over, and no  matter how the matter was resolved by the committee, scars would be left    Well, I can assure [you], first, that your judgment about the future  is something I share--and your word of caution, I also share that feeling completely  Yes, Mr  Morris    Well, I think this is one of the technical matters that Mr  O’Connell will take up with the officers of your Banks, and Mr O’Connell will comment on that  presently  My own feeling is that the attachments should not be, or need not be, submitted  But  I would not be surprised if that question were asked  This question I deliberately omitted from  our discussion, and Mr Reuss did not raise the question  But as your question recognizes by its  very nature, this is a gray area  However, certainly in the case of certain attachments pertaining  to individual banks or their names, you see, well, that’s covered by the agreement  Any  attachment pertaining to relations with foreign central banks--now this may apply solely to the  New York Bank--any such attachment would be omitted    Well, there again, my own feeling is--I may be mistaken--that  these need not be submitted    But I would not be too surprised if that question were raised by  Mr Reuss in due course    Probably  Certainly possibly--I even think probably  I would  hope that, in due course, Mr Reuss will become interested in other questions of [unintelligible]   He’ll not pursue this [unintelligible]    Mr O’Connell will talk about the technical aspect  Well, let me  say a word about that as I visualize the matter at this stage  You have your minutes  Now there  are at least five categories, and you have technical procedures under which certain lines or  paragraphs can be omitted  That is, you have a Xerox, but certain parts are covered up  Now  just how that’s done, I don’t know, but we are engaged in this kind of business, unfortunately,  too often  Now then, the parts relating to these two categories, personnel items and [Bank  safety] items--those parts will be omitted in the first instance, you see, wiped out, but then  included in a separate folder  And that separate folder--the arrangement is that Mr Reuss and  I--this will not go to his staff--but Mr Reuss and I will go over that; what will happen at such a  meeting or will result from such a meeting, I’m not able to predict  My guess is that, after  looking it over, Mr Reuss will show no further interest   SPEAKER(?)  Do the boards of directors [know of] this?     11/16/76 - 16 -            The Reserve Bank directors have been informed about this  correspondence, and to what degree the Reserve Bank boards have considered it is something  that our colleagues can advise us  I don’t know, but let me indicate that my letter’s worded  carefully  It says  “In accordance with our conversation last Friday, I shall advise the Reserve  Bank boards to send you the minutes of their meetings,” and this is what I’m doing  I very much  hope, in view of this, that the advice will be taken by the Bank boards, but this is something that  the Bank boards will have to take up themselves, and I personally feel that this is as good a  resolution as we could have gotten  I only hope that it stands    Oh yes  But I do think, having said what I’m saying in this letter,  I shall do what I can to expedite the delivery  I do think that if the Bank boards are going to do  this, as I now hope they will, that this will get under way and that we’ll not delay unduly    I intend to send this today, and copies will be made available to all  of you, that is, the Bank Presidents, today, before you leave    Mr Mayo, please    Well, I was thinking of having Tom O’Connell do the monitoring,  in the process achieving a substantial uniformity among the Banks       11/16/76 - 17 -            Yes  You see, these five categories that I mentioned are the five  categories that turned up in the course of conversations of Mr O’Connell with officers of the  individual Banks  Now, I’m not at all sure that these five categories are comprehensive enough   But if they’re not, or if it appears that they’re not, that will turn up in the course of Mr  O’Connell’s work with the officers of the Banks, and then, with your consent, I will try to  resolve the matter  And the way in which I think I would resolve the matter would be that if, let  us say, there’s a sense that a sixth category [is needed]--you might handle that in the same way  that the personnel items and the security items are being handled  However, that, of course,  would become another subject for possible negotiation and possible confusion  I’m very hopeful  that Mr Reuss will become very busy as the weeks and months roll on  I certainly will be, but  that will not stop Mr Reuss  He must be busy  If he can discover ways of keeping busy on other  items--but I think he’s good over [unintelligible]  He has a staff that he--    Well, I’m going to leave that for Tom O’Connell to work out, you  see, and that may become a sixth category put into a special file  I would not want to treat any  sixth category that may arise the same way that the first three categories are being treated  It’s  because the last thing that I can ever do or will ever do is to go back on an explicit  understanding  But this is a possible gray area, and I think that my concept of a third file is  perhaps as good a way as any of handling that if that problem arises  Mr O’Connell, would you  like to comment now on technical issues    I should add one detail, that is, in getting Mr Reuss to cut back his  request from five years to these three selected years, I do have an understanding with him, that I  don’t refer to in this letter, but he does refer to in his letter, and that part of his letter is accurate   Namely, that if he should find that these three years do not satisfy his needs, he can come back  and ask for those two additional years  For that matter, he can come back if he wants to and ask  for, well--when was the Federal Reserve established?--1913, ’14; who knows     This is really an outrage, I think  You know, it’s a fishing expedition pure and simple   Because if he really were interested simply in assessing the influence that the Reserve Banks  have on policy--monetary policy--then my offer to him was, I think, very generous  Every  communication with regard to the discount rate--not just, you know, the actual communication as  it came and the telegram that you sent us or the letter--plus any petitions by individual Bank  boards, plus any correspondence from individual directors  I thought I was very generous  But  as I say, that did not satisfy his need as he expressed it, and the closest that [he] came to  expressing his need was to say, well, he’d like to know what the Reserve Banks do, and he feels  he’s entitled to it    You mean separate various attachments, appendices, and the like?    I would say at this stage that only full board meeting minutes be  covered by this request  At this stage, I think that’s a fair interpretation, but I would not be  surprised if further requests were made, unless Mr Reuss becomes busy with other problems    Let me just pause for a minute  Each Bank has a range of  committees--as I think about the matter now, I am not sure that omission of executive committee  minutes is really wise because, so often, discount rate questions, you know, will be taken up   You see, there’s Mr Roos’s problem that he mentioned, these minutes being so slender in his  Bank  And the chances are that that is true of a number of our Banks, possibly all of them  And  since discount rate applications are, or discount rate decisions by a Bank board will, frequently  be taken up at executive committee meetings, and other vital business handled by executive  committee--as I’m thinking out loud with you, in going back on earlier statements and in  questioning Mr O’Connell’s advice of this point--on second thought, I believe that probably  executive committee minutes should be included    That would [not apply] to special other committees  They are in a  very different category    Oh yes, absolutely     11/16/76 - 20 -            Well, I don’t know if there is any protection, and I would not be at  all surprised if a by-product of this fishing expedition turned out to be a strong recommendation  by Mr Reuss, possibly by his entire committee, possibly of a piece of legislation that he would  introduce as to the character of minutes  I would not be surprised in the future--first, a  condemnation, laying the basis, you see, for this request as to the future  Well, gentlemen, that’s  the kind of world we live in, and I don’t think that this environment in which we function, that  it’s going to change very quickly, nor am I ready to predict that it’s going to improve this year   Any question, comment, criticism of this procedure?  I haven’t sent this letter yet    Well, you see if a question were raised about attachments, later on,  then these understandings, if they hold--and I assure you that I’ll do everything in my power to  achieve that objective that would apply to the attachments  In other words, if, let’s say, Reuss  asks later on for the attachments, [then] these categories of exclusion and separate filings--these  attachments would be handled in exactly the same way as the body of the minutes  But let’s not  anticipate too much  There is still, I’ve said this three, four, five, times already, there’s still a  possibility Mr Reuss will acquire other interests in the course of the year  One of the difficulties  here, of course, is--you know, that’s part of the world we live in  Mr Reuss may well acquire  other interests  He has a very large staff  I think they’ve put in long hours thinking up ways, you  see, of harassing, etc    Oh yes    Well, let’s think very carefully about that  If you start including  some attachments, but not others, then, to the extent that Mr Reuss’s staff is less imaginative     11/16/76 - 21 -           than I hope they will be, you will ignite the imagination of one or another of his numerous  troublemakers    Well executive committee meetings are different, as I think that  Mr Volcker explained that better than I did, that the [unintelligible] are an executive committee  function for the board and at times, meetings of the executive committee are virtually  indistinguishable from full board meetings      Anything else, gentlemen?  On this we’ve had two unsavory  subjects for discussion, and if there is no further question or comment, let’s drink coffee and that  would fortify us perhaps for--   [Coffee break]   [End of executive session]   [GAP IN TRANSCRIPT AT OPENING OF REGULAR MEETING]    Thank you, Mr Mayo  Mr Baughman please    Thank you, Mr Baughman  Who would like to speak next?  Yes,  Mr Williams    Would you just pull up the microphone please    Now what about, are you referring to production or sales of  corrugated paper?    Orders they are receiving?  I see  That’s a very good point there   Well--yes, Mr Volcker    Thank you, Mr Volcker  Anyone else like to speak now?  Mr  MacLaury and then Mr Roos    Thank you, Mr MacLaury  Mr Roos    Thank you, Mr Roos  Mr Partee now, please    An interesting question  You say progressively larger  I don’t  quite understand  I understand that as an arithmetic thing, but what I want to get at is whether  this is mathematics, or data, or experience  I assume that this revision is based on one or two  new benchmark figures and that what happens in between is pure arithmetic    Unless there is--    This is still a cloudy--     Thank you, Mr Partee  Yes, Mr Wallich    May I ask you a question?  Has the staff explored with the Budget  Bureau people what they see in the figures they’re now compiling--what the level of federal  expenditures for fiscal 1978 might be?    Well, our current services budget, I have not really looked into this  myself, but I have the impression that shows an increase of some 8 percent  Is that correct?    And as of today it seems unlikely that the new budget that will be  presented by the incoming Administration will be lower than that  A reasonable guess as of  today will be that it would be higher, isn’t that true?    It may or may not, but that is certainly a real possibility  Who’d  like to speak now?  Yes, Mr Gardner    Well, you know, I’ll give you nice long phrase, which I hope you  never use  a “mid-expansion retardation”--what we used to call it at the National Bureau [of  Economic Research]    Well I might add a word at this stage  Any talk about a recession,  I think, is absolutely premature  With housing starts moving up rather sharply, with orders for  nondefense capital goods in real terms rising at a moderately good clip, with the formation of  new businesses moving steadily upward this year--I think talk about recession has very little  foundation at the present time     Of course, there’s a very big pause in the expansion of the economy  The question we’re  discussing or that should concern us is where we’re going, and in my judgment, unless some  very serious mistakes [in economic policy] and in the rhetoric of economic policy are made in  the near future--and I don’t [think] they will be made, I think they’ll go the other way--I think the  expansion will continue  Now, a new report on housing will be released sometime today  That  report will show that last month’s spectacular increase in housing starts has been revised upward,  and that there is some decline in the October figure--but that’s a small decline, whereas a rather  large decline has been largely anticipated     11/16/76 - 28 -            The multifamily figure has been revised down for September  I  don’t really remember what the October figure is; the strength appears in one [that is, single]  family  Mr Morris, please    I think you are entirely right  It’s so difficult for us  I don’t attach  very much importance ordinarily to rhetoric, but if there ever was a time when good rhetoric  would have an effect on business and consumer psychology and propel the economy upward, I  think this is the time  My own guess is that good rhetoric will be forthcoming  It is a guess, and  the good rhetoric will be accompanied, I think, in due course by rather constructive action  That,  too, is a guess     So it’s so difficult  You take our staff forecast--these poor fellows, they struggle to do  what they can  They know nothing about the budget, they know nothing about other policies   They are very honest in keeping score on themselves, and on the basis of data now available, I  think that our staff projection is a very respectable one  One that certainly deserves respect  I’m  more optimistic than the staff, but the uncertainties are peculiarly great right now  And if the  outlook were no better than in our staff projection, the future would look very, very grim to me   Mr Coldwell    You’re more pessimistic about sales than Mr Lilly    But, you know, our statistics on retail sales are scandalously poor   Exaggeration, Lyle?    Look what you get  You get weekly figures, and then you  get--what do you call it--the advance, and then you get something called preliminary, then  something called, very much in quotation marks, final, and they keep on jumping around  You  don’t quite know where you are, and by this time our government ought to have vastly better  statistics on retail sales  Would you agree with that, Chuck?    I think the hour has come for somebody to speak of, not shocks,  but of pleasant surprises  Can someone affect the gloom Mr Coldwell has passed over us, over  this meeting, at least over my own life in the past minute?  Mr Wallich, he has volunteered for  the purpose; make it good, now    In that connection, have you ever given a lot of thought to that,  and--well, maybe I live in a strange world, or my thoughts dwell in isolation, possibly--when I  hear of proposals concerning a tax rebate, I just scratch my head  What does it mean?  It means  that our government, which is heavily in debt, will now go out and borrow more--$10 billion,  $15 billion, figures like that are being thrown around--and then a check will be written to each  one of a certain category we’ve talked about, poor, or poorer, people, and how do you build?      11/16/76 - 30 -           And if this is the best that we can think of as a way of building the strength of our economy, then  I’m going to join the gloomy fellows, and I’ll become gloomier than Phil Coldwell, really     If you want to build the economic strength of our country, there are ways of doing it  Now  one of the very best ways of doing it, one that I think recognizes the need to avoid social conflict,  one that also recognizes the limitations of our economic knowledge, is the technique that was  used by President Kennedy and by the Congress  Kennedy proposed in 1962 some refinements  that became law in 1964, but what kind of tax reduction was it?  It was a tax reduction that  applied across the board for individuals and that applied to corporations as well as to individuals,  and therefore a tax reduction that met two basic criteria--there are others, but it met two   minimization of social conflict and, second, recognition that, well, we don’t quite know [what  would be best]--we have [only] theories, we have ideas, [about what] is the most advantageous  way of stimulating--and therefore, you see, the bets were being hedged with this across-the- board tax reduction, individuals and corporations  I thought that was a stroke of political genius  at the time, and there was a tax cut that proved--I think “proved” may be too strong a word--in  my judgment, it worked extremely well     A rebate, it’s like an aspirin pill to my mind [unintelligible], just a little bit, and what you  want through a tax bill, if this is conceived of as a measure to stimulate the economy, you want  to change peoples’ minds about themselves and about the future  And how you can do that with  a rebate, I don’t know--even if the rebate applied to everyone, you see, rather than being  concentrated at one end of the income scale  But maybe I have a 19th century mind and don’t  understand the world we live in  But I do think, really, that better counsel will prevail, and I’m  quite optimistic about that  Mr Winn    Anyone else like to speak?  Mr Guffey, please    No, no I wasn’t  I was a moment ago; now perhaps it’s time to  become a little more pessimistic    You know, if I may join Mr Coldwell in the interest of balance, I  feel as he does about an increase in the price of oil at the present time  The world has not yet  adjusted, not by a long shot, to the quadrupling in the price of oil that occurred toward the end of  1973 and the subsequent increase in 1975  I feel very strongly about that and had some quiet--I  don’t know how quiet--something to say about that in the recent testimony as one of the major  uncertainties facing our country [and], for that matter, the world economy, at the present time   And if that can be prevented--I think it can be prevented--I think all of us will have very good  cause to feel much more cheerful about the economy  And on the other hand, if it goes into  effect, then I think that the words of gloom that have been heard around this table might well be  intensified     Anyone else like to speak before we break for luncheon?  Very well, we’ll do that now,  and we’ll be back, let’s say--what is your preference, 215?  It’s 115 now, 215 or 230?  Let’s  have a show of hands for 230  A show of hands for 215  215 is agreeable   [Lunch recess]    Gentlemen, we should be resuming our deliberation, and let us  give the floor now to Mr Sternlight    Thank you, Mr Sternlight, any new questions?    All right, any other questions for Mr Sternlight?  Well, thank you  Mr Sternlight  We will now hear from Mr Axilrod, who also will be brief    Thank you, Mr Axilrod, any questions?  Well, you’ve been so  lucid, Mr Axilrod, there’s no need for questioning  We’re ready to turn now to our monetary  policy discussions  We hope that, as we go around the table, members of the Committee would  address themselves, among other things, to the question whether our economy is now short of  liquidity and what economic gain, if any, members of the Committee would or might expect  from some easing in credit conditions  I hope also that the Bank Presidents would express their  view on the desirability of a reduction in the discount rate     I would like to say just a few words, not about the discount rate but about what I think is  the basic question  Is our economy short of liquidity?  I don’t see it really  The banks are  hungry for customers, and savings banks, particularly savings and loan associations, have  enormous inflows of funds  I doubt, really, if the easing of the monetary conditions would have  any significant influence on the behavior of the economy at the present time  However, I do  think that, in view of the economic information that has come our way and that we expressed at  this table, some easing is presently indicated  But I also think that the easing should be slight   And I say that for several reasons     First of all, the very high rate of growth of the monetary aggregates in October has been  noticed, and while it appears that the November figures will show moderation, the exceptionally  high numbers in October are still in the minds of many people who watch statistics on the money  supply  [Also] I think that the easing, if any, should be slight in view of the very large increases  in price indexes that have recently been published--though the interpretation of these indexes  leaves something to be desired  [And] I think the easing should be slight in view of the  possibility that the discount rate may be adjusted downward  Finally, I feel that the easing  should be only slight because there is a widespread view around the country among  businesspeople, financial people, that the Federal Reserve more than ever is the main bulwark     11/16/76 - 33 -           against inflation and that the basic monetary policy received by the Federal Reserve has served  our country well and should be continued     Now as for specific numbers, to give you something to shoot at, I lean toward alternative B  with some modifications--some slight modifications  M1 range as designated; M2 shaded down  slightly to 9 to 13; and the federal funds rate at 4-1/2 to 5-1/4, the midpoint being 4-7/8--the  intention being to move down to the midpoint this week unless the figures that appear on  Thursday show extraordinary growth in monetary aggregates, which seems rather unlikely from  the preliminary indications that we have     Now as I say, these are suggestions for the Committee to shoot at, to oppose one way or  another or possibly to endorse  Who might speak first?  Mr Kimbrel, Mr Guffey, Mr Morris,  Mr Black, Mr Mayo, Mr MacLaury, Mr Wallich, Mr Partee, Mr Winn, Mr Coldwell, Mr  Jackson, Mr Williams, Mr Baughman, Mr Volcker, Mr Gardner  [Mr] Volcker will definitely  be last  Mr Gardner will speak whenever he wants to  Mr Kimbrel please    Thank you very much, Mr Kimbrel  Mr Guffey    Thank you, Mr Guffey  Mr Morris, may we hear from you?    Of course, you’ve had a secular trend there that complicates  interpretations    All that I mean to say is, that’s a very fair question, but you have  to interpret it, I think, in the light of the secular trend  Now, whether your statement will still be  correct, I don’t know  You’re probably right; I’m just not sure    You say that about the real rate of interest?    I not only agree with that, but I’m making a speech on Thursday,  and I’ll make a great deal of this very point    Thank you, Mr Morris  Mr Black now, please    Thank you, Mr Black  Mr Mayo next, please    That’s the nice thing about our country  We don’t all think alike   Everyone does his own thinking in his own way    Thank you, Mr Mayo  Mr MacLaury now    Thank you, Mr MacLaury  Mr Wallich now     11/16/76 - 37 -            Thank you, Mr Wallich  Mr Partee please    This is where they have been now for a while, but you mean it  would intensify them?    Thank you, Mr Partee  Mr Gardner now    Well, I found out, but the question as to blindness or good vision  still remain open  Mr Gramley, since--    Thank you, Mr Winn  Mr Coldwell please    Thank you, Mr Coldwell  Mr Jackson please    Thank you, Mr Jackson  Mr Williams now, please    Thank you, Mr Williams  Mr Baughman please    All right, thank you, Mr Baughman  Mr Lilly now, please    Thank you, Mr Lilly  Now, Mr Volcker has, well, he’s  preempted the last place    Mr Volcker has preempted the last place, and therefore that place  is reserved for him  And the question is, who else would like to speak now?  Mr Eastburn and  then Mr Roos and then anyone else who wants to speak again, because Mr Volcker definitely  speaks last  Mr Eastburn    Thank you, Mr Eastburn  Mr Roos, please    Thank you, Mr Roos  Does anyone want to speak before Mr  Volcker?  You won’t [have] another chance after Mr Volcker  A promise is a promise  I made  Mr Volcker a promise  There are a few things that I could ever do for Mr Volcker or, for that  matter, for anyone else  It’s within my power now to make him the last speaker  I’ve given him  that promise  I must deliver on it    Mr Partee    For the sake of symmetry only, if the staff projection is too low--     Sooner and on a larger scale; and/or on a larger scale    Gentlemen, we are ready for Mr Volcker   SPEAKER(?)  Do you wish to stand up?    Well, thank you, Mr Volcker  I think we’ve had a very  interesting discussion  The main conclusion I’ve developed from this discussion is that the  differences that have been expressed within and by members of this Committee are  preponderantly very small indeed, so there is a substantial degree of unanimity on the part of the  Committee  And all that we have to do now is refine these numbers slightly, recognizing that  very little sanctity attaches to any of these numbers     Now, the thinking of the Committee, as I read it, is as follows with regard to our numerical  specifications  There is a slight preference for a range of 3 to 7 for M1, over against 2-1/2 to  6-1/2; there’s more dispersion with regard to M2--very few would want to go above 13-1/2, and  some want to go below 13-1/2  I therefore, on balance, think 9-1/2 to 13-1/2 is perhaps fairly     11/16/76 - 46 -           representative [for M2]  With regard to the federal funds rate, there is a margin in favor of the  4-1/2 to 5-1/4 percent range as over against 4-1/4 to 5-1/4     Now that’s my reading of the views that have been expressed by the Committee  If any  members of the Committee have changed their minds because of what they’ve heard from their  colleagues, you might advise me of that at this time  In the absence of that, I think we should  vote on the following specification  the 3 to 7 percent for M1; 9-1/2 to 13-1/2 for M2; and 4-1/2  to 5-1/4 for the federal funds rate    Well, that is--we could discuss that--    Well, I would say yes, that is to say, the only thing to hold it up  would be--well we don’t want to move immediately after the meeting  Now, on Thursday our  figures will be in, and unless the figures are outside the range very high, I think the Desk  definitely would want to move toward 4-7/8 on Friday  Whether they actually get there or not, I  think that’s something we ought to leave to the Desk  If you don’t get there on Friday, you ought  get there next Monday    Let’s have a show of hands on that   SPEAKER(?)  That’s a 4-3/4 midpoint    Well, we’ll call it a midpoint  We put quotation marks around it  and we will have a show of hands on 4-3/4 versus 4-7/8  That is the midpoint--they’re in  quotation marks  Those who prefer 4-3/4 will kindly raise their hands    Well, that’s the way we’ll do it  That is to say, we still have to  vote on it  Let me repeat what we will be voting on    No, you would want to do it more gradually     11/16/76 - 47 -            Well, that isn’t very gradual  I think the way to do it gradually is  to do [the first] one within a week, and the other within two weeks  So if you do it by Friday,  let’s say by the following week--    Yes, you do  You know it’s low  The hour is late Paul    We have to live by rules or we have a communication, an  interchange, by telegram or otherwise, between meetings  If you’re saying that you would be  uncomfortable going down to 4-1/2, so would I  But I would think this is--the rule now, we  could now choose another limit, and--well, there are circumstances you know, with regard to the  economy that might clearly make it undesirable to go as low as 4-1/2 so promptly, if the figures  do come in low  That’s the rule we operate under, and this is not the time to change the rule     Should I specify what we’ll be voting on?  All right, M1, 3 to 7 percent range; M2, 9-1/2 to  13-1/2 percent; and the federal funds rate, 4-1/2 to 5-1/4, with the understanding that 4-3/4 will  be interpreted as the midpoint in quotation marks    Yes, we still have to decide that, and let’s have a show of hands   Those who would prefer a monetary aggregates directive will kindly raise their hands    Those who would prefer a money market directive?    Well, I will join the monetary aggregates group  Now, and the  language, well, the language, yes  The staff has given us no choice of language in the monetary  aggregates directive  Well, I think we’re ready to vote  Any further comment?    Well, no, we really ought not to  We’re not ready for that    Still, we’re not going to change any rules this meeting  However,  I assure you, we’ll change it at the next meeting, and I’ll have a word to say about that presently   Would you be good enough to call the roll    All right, now, item 7 on the agenda, we will not take up today   The date of the next meeting is Tuesday, but I think we need a little more time, and I would  suggest that we make personal plans for a late afternoon meeting on the Monday preceding the  Tuesday meeting  Then we’ll take up item 7 and a few other matters--a foreign currency  directive--and there’s much more we’ll be ready for at that time  Thank you very much for the  meeting, gentlemen  Have a good week   END OF MEETING         "
244,1976-12-20,"  We will be discussing legislative, administrative details  In case I  fall asleep, please do not join me  As I think all of you know, Mr MacLaury will be leaving us   He’ll still remain in this city, fortunately  We’ll have the opportunity to see a good deal of him,  but he will carry his loyalty and his love for the Federal Reserve with him, and he’ll be joining  the Brookings Institution  And we have a way of punishing people that do things like that   There will be a luncheon, and Mr MacLaury will have to make a few remarks on that occasion   That luncheon is scheduled for 100 tomorrow     The first item on the agenda is a report by Governor Partee’s Subcommittee on the  Domestic Policy Directive, and therefore Mr Partee, we’re ready for you and for other members  of your subcommittee  I suggest you proceed your own way    Before we do these comments, I want to make sure that we all  know, or at least that I know, where we’re going  I understand your report to mean simply that  we codify, so to speak, what we have been doing  Is that the objective?    Yes    What is your--     12/20-21/76 - 3 -         COLDWELL  Thus, it’s part--you register votes on the short range    No, we record votes on the directive, which includes all of the  specs    No, I want to correct your statement, Mr Partee  We don’t vote  on individual items  What we do is to test the sentiment of the Committee  We vote only on the  full set of specifications  We have one vote only    Mr Broida    Except that we put out, after 30 days have elapsed, a narrative  account of what happened at the meeting, we put down the specifications   SPEAKER(?)  [Unintelligible]     What’s that?    Mr Jackson?    Well, I must say you’ve raised a question in my mind, but I know  nothing about the law  But implicit in Mr Jackson’s question, I think, is the suggestion that we  do not deviate from the present practice unless there is a clearer reason than has yet been set  forth  That’s the way I interpreted Mr Jackson’s comment    I understand  Well, what do our attorneys--we better have a legal  ruling on that before we take this fatal step    This is an altogether new thought for me--I went along completely  with the suggestion, and I thought it was fine  Might it not be desirable, in view of the question  that Mr Jackson has raised, to defer acting on this recommendation until there has been a ruling  by the court  No--I want Mr O’Connell to comment    All right, now we turn to associate counsel, Mr Broida    Well, I might have said that  Your recollection is better than mine,  but I have found in the past that second thoughts at times are a little better than initial thoughts   Why do we want to make a move right now?  Mr Kimbrel    Gentlemen, we could debate this for a long period of time A new  question has been raised, and with possible difficulty [that] I, for one, didn’t foresee  We don’t  have to take this action today  I would suggest that our counsel study this matter and we come  back to it next month, [after] it’s been looked into and examined from a legal and administrative  viewpoint to the best ability of our counsel  Is that acceptable?     All right, I’m going to shift the order around a little  Let’s move to item 3 on the  agenda--the discussion of various foreign currency instruments  Governor Wallich, would you  be good enough to take us through the various steps that we ought to go through    All right, now, there are four items to be taken up, and we’ll take  them up one by one, act on the first, and move to the second  And will you confine yourself now  to the first title, Mr Wallich, the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations    All right, we’ll confine our discussion, then, to the document  entitled Revised Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations  Are there any comments or  questions?  Yes, Mr Kimbrel    What was that?  I don’t find it    I’m told by Mr Broida that the sentence which you’re referring to  has been taken out of the version that we now are supposed to be discussing  If that is correct,  you can’t have a problem    Well, I interpret that to mean that this is the outside limit  Because  you can have renewals up to a year but not beyond a year  Is that correct, Mr Wallich?    Yes, Mr Volcker     12/20-21/76 - 10 -          I think you’re absolutely right  In fact, the item will come up  tomorrow  The recent swap drawing on us by the British did not involve coordination with the  Bank of England    I think that would be wise and accurate  Any other question or  comment    I don’t see why    Yes, any other questions  Well, if not, can we all agree to this first  document on Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations?  Any dissent?  All right, it will be  so recorded     Let’s turn to the next item of the four that we will consider  The second item, this is on the  Foreign Currency Directive  Let me say one word about this  The Foreign Currency Directive is  a very brief document, but every noun and every verb and every proposition has been accorded  the most loving care over several months  As we examine this document, let us bear in mind the  history of its preparation    Would you be willing to enter into a swap arrangement with a  foreign central bank that the Treasury was opposed to?    Well, that’s the issue    Wait  This does not mean that the Treasury will be a partner of  ours in entering into swap arrangements?  It may mean that  More normally, it would mean that  if we draw on a foreign central bank or if a foreign central bank draws upon us, this will be done  with the full knowledge and assent of the US Treasury    Well, I can understand that  But I, for one, have taken the  position, and have so testified, that whereas our independence in the domestic area is complete,  as far as foreign operations are concerned, foreign policy is, under our Constitution, a  prerogative of the President  And if we engage in a foreign transaction, we therefore should do  so only if we have the assent of the Treasury     But in testifying, I’ve gone one point beyond that and indicated that if we ever  disagreed--most of the time, you know, in practice, as far as my experience over several years  goes, you’re in a gray area, and you talk things out, and you reach an agreement with the  Treasury  But I’ve testified to this effect, if it ever so happened that we disagreed with the  Treasury in the foreign transaction and that disagreement could not be ironed out--we stood on  our ground, the Treasury on its ground--then there would be only one proper thing to do, or two  proper things to do  First, to accept the Treasury judgment that day  Second, to go to the  Congress the next day and ask for a legal solution to a conflict that has arisen as far as the future  is concerned  Now that’s the position I’ve taken    Well, I can see that, but, now look, the Treasury is the President’s  representative in the foreign economic area  And for us to take an action that runs counter to the  foreign policy of this government, to me it’s a position that we could not maintain  Congress  would never stand for it  I don’t think we ought to put ourselves in the position of advancing a  kind of independence that simply will not be supported  But this is something for the Committee  to decide    Yes, but I think consultation is not the right term  But I think  collaboration is the right term, in view of the practice that has existed, and I think in view of the  Constitution of this country as I understand it  But let’s hear from others  Mr Bruce MacLaury    Mr Volcker has whispered a word which might possibly be more  satisfactory  that’s “cooperation” instead of “consultation”  Henry, would “cooperation”--is  rather close    We can cooperate with more than one  We are very cooperative    Let’s not go in for elegant variations    Oh no, oh no  You may go through this cycle once again  Let’s  not wait a month    We are really debating a legal point when there is no problem in  practice  The Treasury is not going to make a move without consulting us and working things  out with us  We, to the best of my knowledge, have never made a move without consulting and  working things out with the Treasury  We don’t always agree on the first instant, but as we  talk--this always being an area surrounded by uncertainty--you know, the thing is worked out  I  don’t see any problem arising    Well the only difficulty is, “collaboration” is a more precise term  than “consultation” suggested by Phil    Work together--yeah, that’s what collaborate means--work  together  Mr Wallich, you were asked a question about an earlier--whether this term appears--    Well, I certainly agree with that  I don’t think anyone has fought  harder than I have for the Federal Reserve’s independence  But that does not extend to the  foreign area  The foreign area--I don’t think we could ever sustain that position  Though I have  a great deal of sympathy with Mr Coldwell’s suggestion, I still think it is impractical, really,  particularly in view of the tortured history that underlies this simple word     12/20-21/76 - 14 -          Well, we could do this  We could instruct Henry to go back--and  advise him not to spend too much time on it--and persuade Mr Yeo that “cooperation” would be  just as good from Mr Yeo’s viewpoint but would make us here a little more happy--we would  substitute “cooperation” for “collaboration”  But in the event that he doesn’t persuade Mr Yeo,  the word “collaboration” should, I think, be accepted by this Committee   SPEAKER(?)  So moved    Any objection  Any other question about this currency directive   Yes, Mr Eastburn    The word generally gives you all the elbow room that you may  need or want    Any other questions?    It certainly does not resolve that   I think, in this last statement, you’ve gotten into a controversial  zone, which is not necessary at this point  I would argue with your last statement--I don’t know  that I want clean floating everywhere at all times  But let’s not debate that issue     Thank god, philosophy and practice sometimes, as in this instance,  diverge  We’re not going to be discussing history or philosophy, we’re discussing a 300-word  document hammered out with pain and love and extraordinary care  Any other comment on  that?    Well, I hear no objections to this  So, therefore, I assume that the  Committee has approved the Foreign Currency Directive and that we are ready for their  document on procedures  Mr Wallich    Yes, Mr Baughman?    Let’s take this point first    That has never arisen    I think the Committee has to be in a position to act, and it may  have to act on the basis of an emergency where you have just a few minutes to act    Yes, yes, it could happen  Yes it could  [Unintelligible] to act on  the British loan the other day  And it was possible to reach three members of the subcommittee  before a decision could be reached  And it might have been impossible to reach any member of  the subcommittee    Well, if you know all the circumstances of this particular instance,  I don’t think you have any doubt, and in all this, one has to have confidence in someone  Ideally     12/20-21/76 - 20 -         the Committee could pass on all these transactions, but, you know, I have worked on a good  many of these problems  There’s one thing now, another thing an hour later, still another an  hour later or a day later  And they’re just constant negotiations; they go on  When you have  time, and when you don’t have time, well you’ve got to make a very quick decision     Now, fortunately from my viewpoint, on this recent British swap drawing, I got hold of  Henry, Henry got hold of Mr Gardner, he tried to get hold of Mr Volcker, but he didn’t  succeed  A condition could arise where you couldn’t reach these men  And therefore we ought  to have the provision to deal with the problem should it arise  As to probability, well no problem  such as this has arisen in the seven years I have been here  It could arise tomorrow     This particular swap was not only done in collaboration with the  Treasury, in the sense that we talked matters out, but the total swap was for $500 [million]; the  Treasury took half of it, and we took the other half    Any further discussions?  Yes, Mr Mayo    I can see what’s bothering you  What you would like, I think, is to  see this paragraph you elaborated upon so that it would have more meaning for you and for the  rest of us    I think that’s a perfectly valid comment, but I don’t really see how  we can do it in this context in view of the history of the Foreign Currency Directive, but I think  it’s a very proper question to put to Mr Wallich and to me and to our staff, and a brief document  response to your question, I think, should be worked out    Well, if I understand the spirit in which you make your comment,  you would like to understand better why we are engaged in this business at all  And to answer  that question, we ought to go back to history  How we got into this activity, and why we are still  in it, what we are seeking to accomplish, and also whether or not we ought to continue in this  action  This wouldn’t be a paper that we need even show to the Treasury, [but] that we ought to  discuss among ourselves and not look for precision in wording but to clarify the basic ideas  I  think to set aside an hour for that in the not-too-distant future would be salutary    That is what you are getting at, am I correct?  Let’s do that    Any other comment or question?  Can we assume that this  procedural document is acceptable to the Committee?    Would you want to be recorded as dissenting?    All right, that would be so recorded in the minutes    And in connection with your dissent, it might be helpful, you  know, for any use [to which] others may put the minutes, if you would indicate your alternative   We don’t want to take time to do that now  All right now, we have the fourth and final item   And this item is recorded in attachment B, written out on six lines, which means it’s worth just  60 seconds, 10 seconds per line  Let’s see if can’t finish this in a minute    Motion made  It has even been seconded  No  discussion--therefore, universal assent  We’re finished, gentlemen  Now, I described this  meeting at the outset  We [had] a third item on the agenda, and then we [would] return to Mr  Partee, who will present a report of his Subcommittee on the Directive [regarding nonborrowed  reserves]    Well, I think that we ought to reach a decision  However, if  members of the Committee would prefer to delay consideration of this item, and I take it that is  your wish, then we ought to do so    You see any difficulty, Mr Partee, in delaying this?    Who has difficulty in taking up this argument today in addition to  Mr Eastburn  Well, in view of that, I think we better go ahead, and you have ample opportunity  to register any further thoughts  Mr Partee, would you proceed, please?    Gentlemen, coffee is available in the corner of the room, so please  feel free to refresh yourselves as you see fit     Inaccurate or incomplete--any comments, Mr Paulus?     All right, thank you  Mr Sternlight, do you have any comments?     Our Subcommittee on the Directive has carried through an  experiment, and, on the basis conducted, it has not yielded positive results  That’s not too  surprising  The members of the subcommittee have not reached unanimity, and that’s not too  surprising considering the difficulty of the subject     You know, we use terms such as “control the money supply,” and that is becoming an  increasingly ambiguous statement  We live in a world in which financial technology has been  exploding and which former relations between narrowly defined money and the dollar value of  the nation’s output no longer seem to hold, and we’ll continue to live in such a world  And I  think that monetary policy has to be judged increasingly by the results that we get rather than on  whether we are hitting a certain target figure that we have set for ourselves     I’d say that monetary policy by and large has performed admirably during the past, year  and half, or two  The economy has continued to expand, though at a rate that many of us have  found less than satisfactory during recent months  In particular, we’ve had a very substantial  decline of interest rates and therefore have been able to demonstrate that normal experience     12/20-21/76 - 32 -         during a business cycle expansion is not something that need apply to the present or the future   With interest rates behaving as they have, one could hardly argue that the economy has been  starved for money  We continue to look at M1, the magnitude that I believe is progressively  losing all significance  I think that M2 and M3 are indicating far more accurately what is  happening to the state of liquidity     In any event, these are very complex questions, and the fact that members of our  subcommittee have not reached complete unanimity should not surprise us  Now the  subcommittee has recommended further work, and--except for one item, namely, exploration of  the possible changes in concepts of money--I think the several tasks that the subcommittee has  defined are worth pursuing  We have to be critical  We have to continue the process of self- examination in which we’ve been engaged     Now, exploration of possible changes in the concepts of money--our staff has been  working on that, and we’ve had a special outside committee that worked on that subject for over  two years or longer  That study is now being carefully evaluated by our staff, and  recommendations on redefinition of money are in process  Let’s see what our staff comes up  with and not make this assignment to any subcommittee of this Committee     But the other four subjects, I think, fully deserve exploration  One question in my mind is  whether this burden ought to be placed on the present subcommittee or on a new subcommittee   I reviewed the history recently and have found that three such subcommittees have been at work   The present Subcommittee on the Directive was established in July 1973  There have been one  or two changes in the composition of the subcommittee  Perhaps the members of this  subcommittee, who worked so hard and for so long, ought to be relieved, and a new group ought  to get into the act  The important thing, I believe, is that the subjects recommended by Mr  Partee’s subcommittee for further study ought to be actively pursued with periodic reports to this  Committee because many of us feel uneasy about our procedures, perhaps most of us do  We’d  like to improve on them  We don’t quite know as yet how to do it     Now, I have stated the point to which we have gotten, and if there is no objection on the  part of the Committee, I will give some thought to the appointment of another subcommittee to  go to work on these four questions and perhaps others  And extend thanks to Mr Partee and his  group for doing what they’ve done  You haven’t reached the ideal path, but you’ve helped to  clarify your own thinking and the thinking of the rest of us  And we’ll make more than one  negative experiment before we’re through, I’m sure  There should be a better way than the one  we’re pursuing     But we haven’t done too badly in my judgment  By paying attention both to interest rates  and to monetary aggregates, I think we’re not only capturing the thinking of most members of  this Committee, but I think we are also attending as reasonably, responsibly--perhaps as well as  we can at the present time--to the basic task of the Federal Reserve System  And if we move  either exclusively to monetary aggregate targets and ignore interest rates, or the other way  around, I think we would soon work ourselves into all kinds of difficulties and perhaps create  difficulties in the economy that would not be easy to correct  And by keeping the balance  between these two sets of objectives, by and large, I think we’ve done reasonably well, and  served the economy reasonably well  That’s my opinion      12/20-21/76 - 33 -          How…?    Well, I think that that is a question that is best left to the  Committee as a whole or perhaps another subcommittee  I think that monthly meetings are by  and large satisfactory  The main difficulty with monthly meetings that I see is that, since we get  here once a month, and since some of us travel a considerable distance, there is a natural human  impulse to do something, even when common sense might indicate that doing nothing for the  time being might be the wiser course     However, reviewing the economy once a month--and bearing in mind that we need not  really take an action every meeting, that now and then it’s best to stand still, catch your breath  and see the economy adjust to what we’ve already done--may be the wiser course  That’s the  only question I have about monthly meetings  I, for one, would still vote for monthly meetings   What is the sentiment of the group? We used to meet quarterly     Well, I think that is a very fair question  We used to meet at  quarterly intervals, that was well before my day     Mr Black     Well, that’s worth thinking through seriously  Yes, Mr Winn,  please      12/20-21/76 - 34 -          Yes, that’s the second of the studies recommended by your  subcommittee     Any other?  Yes--    That would be very interesting, to see the results of your study  Is  it pretty well along?     Mr Baughman     Yes     Well, let’s just have a show of hands  Mr Baughman has  expressed a sentiment  We’re not voting for anything  But how many of you see some rough  good sense in Mr Baughman’s comment  Any of you?  Well, we all like to travel once a  month--all but you, Mr Baughman     I would assume that those two recommendations would be entirely  congenial to the entire Committee  Am I wrong on that?  I would doubt whether there would be  any difference of opinion within this Committee on those two recommendations  Yes, Mr  Eastburn     Well, if I understood Governor Wallich’s comments and your  comment, John, you want simply that the federal funds rate range should not be excessively  narrow     Or to put it differently, it should be fairly wide     Yes he did  And Governor Partee did not necessarily--     This is a question that members of this Committee have debated  time and again; we [have] disagreed on [it] from time to time; and we’ve had wide ranges and  we’ve had very narrow ranges  We voted unanimously for wider ranges; we voted unanimously,  or almost that, for narrow ranges  And philosophically, I don’t think the Committee as a  Committee has reached a conclusion  I don’t think we ought to rush a conclusion     Well, I’m not sure that’s the answer  The answer would be to--    --the answer would be to stop publishing any federal funds rate  range that’s [unintelligible]  And with the Desk being instructed to rely on the behavior of  reserves, on the behavior of the federal funds rate, and to seek to the best of its ability to  approximate these ranges  I don’t know, I don’t know what we’re going to do in--     12/20-21/76 - 37 -          Well, I think in view of the legal problems that we’ve recently  had, we may face a problem such as this before too long, and doing a little thinking in advance as  to how we might react to that is probably wise     Gentlemen, it’s 600 and the normal time for adjournment  We’re  two to three minutes beyond 600  Well you’re    great, eager to continue this meeting--    I thought that the two recommendations of the Committee were  adopted without taking a formal vote    Thank you very much, Mr Gramley  I think we’re ready now for  general discussion on the condition of the economy and the outlook  I think, as is our custom, it  would be most useful if members of the Committee would emphasize points of disagreement as  well as points of agreement, elaborating on the first but not on the second  Who would like to be  first  Mr Black, please    All right, thank you, Mr Black; and Mr Eastburn, may we hear  from you now     12/20-21/76 - 39 -          All right, thank you, Mr Eastburn  Mr Mayo    You know, the question of fiscal stimulus is being appraised rather  differently today than it was ten years, five years, even two years ago  The preponderant opinion  still runs in a Keynesian direction  There are voices of dissent  Let me read one  And I’ll  identify the author after I read the statement     We used to think that you could just spend your way out of a recession and increase employment by  cutting taxes and boosting government spending  I tell you in all candor that that option no longer exists, and  insofar as it ever did exist, it worked by injecting inflation into the economy, and each time that happened, the  average level of unemployment has risen  Higher inflation followed by higher unemployment, that is the history  of the last 20 years     This statement was made on September 28, 1976, by Mr Callaghan, the prime minister of  Great Britain  We’ll go on now to Mr Kimbrel, please    Thank you, Mr Kimbrel  Mr Morris now, please    Well, I can confirm what you learned from Mr Barr  Mr Ullman  is definitely opposed, as of today, to a tax cut  The same is true of the ranking Republican on the  Committee, Mr Conable  In the Senate, Mr Humphrey is definitely opposed, [unintelligible],  but I have not heard Mr Senator Long’s views on this subject  But I’ll tell you, let me just take  another word--I think this will take longer than is commonly supposed, I think you are right on  that  My guess, however, is that, unless economic news improves dramatically in the near  future, we will get tax legislation from Congress     If I read the political scene correctly, there is a widespread demand for fiscal stimulation;  some want an increase in spending, and I think the members of the House Ways and Means  Committee would be inclined in that direction, including Mr Ullman  Some want a tax  reduction of some kind, and this is being urged by liberals, it’s being urged by conservatives, it is  being urged by labor leaders, it’s being urged by businessmen    My own guess is that unless we get a very sizable improvement in news concerning the  economy, that the Congress will pass a bill of the usual type  It will contain an increase in  spending of some $3 billion to $5 billion  It will contain a tax rebate--and a rebate even means  sending out Treasury checks to people who never paid income tax--and it will include a  permanent tax cut, the aggregate amounting to perhaps $20 billion  If I were making a bet as of  today, that would be my bet  And I must say it worries me--the near unanimity of opinion that  so-called fiscal stimulation is needed, I find [it] very worrisome  So I can confirm very largely     12/20-21/76 - 42 -         the report that you got from Mr Barr  I can agree with your judgment; it will take longer for the  Congress to act than many people are assuming  I perhaps differ a little on the judgment as to  what the Congress will finally do    Well, pure guess of course--my guess would be that 80 percent of  the dollar aggregate would go to individuals and perhaps 20 percent to corporations    Largely--    What Lyle is saying is absolutely right, but you know we have to  keep in mind, Lyle, what percentage of the price figures, in terms of weighting, enter into the  consumer price index in the month for which the index is recorded    No, I don’t think you’re right  I think it is less than half    In any case, the figure for the month, it is a figure reported for the  month, but it doesn’t apply to the month  It applies partially to that month and partially to the  month before and the month before that  And they have a reform program under way, and by  spending a substantial sum of money, they will reduce the backward reference  But even so, it  will be something like a three-month figure but with heavier weighting in any given month    Well, I don’t know, that is, you may recall a study we made at the  National Bureau [of Economic Research]--George Stigler--something that I’ve been interested in  for very many years--I got that study [published]  We urged the Bureau of Labor Statistics     12/20-21/76 - 43 -         [BLS] authorities to work on the problem, substituting transactions prices for list prices  When I  looked at the matter last, some time ago, very little progress in that direction had been made  Do  you know, Lyle?    It’s very difficult, very costly, to get that kind of information  Mr  Baughman, please    We have an enormous amount of overbuilding of office structures,  and to me it’s a bit surprising that there is a partial comeback in office building construction  So  the lag that he is reporting is not a surprise     12/20-21/76 - 44 -          You know, perhaps at this point it might be useful, without  arguing the case one way or another as far as interest rates are concerned, to put some fiscal facts  before you  First, in fiscal 1976, the year that ended in June, the federal budget deficit was $656  billion  Now, there were off-budget outlays of $80 billion, and if you add those in, you will  have a deficit of  $736 billion  Government-sponsored agencies had a deficit of $54 billion,  and if you add that in, you have a figure of $790 billion   Now let me turn, on a corresponding basis, to fiscal ’77, that is, the year ending not in June  but on September 30, 1977  The budget estimated by the Congressional Budget Office was  $506 billion  And more recently, Alice Rivlin, in congressional testimony, indicated that this     12/20-21/76 - 46 -         figure is based on revenue that was overestimated by $5 billion to $10 billion  If you take the  midpoint [of that range]--$75 billion--you have an estimated budget deficit for fiscal ’77 of  $581 billion     Now, if you take estimates that I got yesterday from Mr Wendel of our staff on the off- budget outlays, they come to $10 billion; that raised the figure to $681 billion  And if you add  the deficit of government-sponsored corporations, which comes to $92 billion, you get a  comprehensive figure of  $773 billion, which is very close to the figure of $790 billion for  fiscal ’76, and this is before any new fiscal measures, the sort that are now being discussed  around the country and in the Congress    No, I added it    The revenue [was] underestimated  I was simply quoting and  without comment, so if you take the unified budget figures at $655 billion for fiscal ’76, and if  you take Alice Rivlin’s figures, its $556 to 606 billion, and I took the midpoint of $581 billion    Shortfall in revenue--total revenue is around $350 billion, well it’s  1-1/2 to 3 percent  Well, these are interesting figures  But we will move on  Mr Balles, please    Well, I don’t how Mr Carter himself would answer it  Mr Lance  has addressed the issue in some public pronouncements, and he has indicated that, in his  judgment, it will be difficult to reach these target figures  And therefore I would interpret Mr  Lance to mean that these are hopes, these are goals, but practically speaking they are not quite  likely to be attained     How Mr Carter would describe the figure, or these figures, I don’t know  As for our staff,  Lyle will comment on that, and I hope that you would broaden your question to think not only of  fiscal measures or monetary measures, but I think more importantly, structural measures   Measures that could reduce unemployment and increase the rate of growth of real output without  releasing new waves of inflation     12/20-21/76 - 47 -          Well, the impression I have is that the President-elect himself is  being very cautious, and [I am] venturing an interpretation that these are hopes--and he will  present programs working in that direction--but that he has not determined that these are goals to  be achieved whatever the cost may be  That’s my present interpretation; I don’t know if I’m  correct on that  But Mr Carter is, I think, proceeding very cautiously, and this, I believe, is  widely recognized and has proved reassuring to the country    I wonder [if] there isn’t a possible inconsistency--your initial  comment, if the amounts needed fiscally are so large as to scare the business community, will  you get the kind of expansion that the arithmetical exercise is designed to achieve?    No, you’re looking--    Lyle, didn’t I hear a member of the staff recite larger figures  yesterday?    Well, these have not been reviewed by the staff    All right  Mr Wallich, please    You know, we go through our arithmetical exercises--[they] are  highly appropriate, they are a check on our thinking, and they are very helpful  Yet I can’t help  but feel, [in] that pronouncement that the President-elect made recently on stand-by price and  wage controls, on his reluctance ever to impose mandatory controls except in a national  emergency, my own guess is, I have no way of proving it, that [it] will contribute more for real  GNP than the kind of so-called fiscal stimuli that we are debating     12/20-21/76 - 49 -          Mr Coldwell, please    From November to November, it’s practically 3 million, as I  recall    Well, that would be less; November to November was around 3  million, I think    Well, before you leave that, you know, this is a very troublesome  question  We may be in the midst of a social revolution, and if so, with very large additions to  the labor force--with women becoming more and more interested in jobs, they are being accepted  in increasing numbers, they see their neighbors doing it, and inflation itself is a definite spur to  such activity  So if this trend we have this year continues, we are going to have high  unemployment    With labor force participation increasing on the part of teens    Well, there’s been some increase in labor force participation in the  younger age group; not nearly as dramatic as in the case of women    Lyle, just as an arithmetical exercise, if the labor force were to  increase by 3 million in calendar 1977, then your unemployment figure of 72 percent for the  fourth quarter would be well above 8 percent    83 percent or a little higher    Of course, if this is the kind of world we are going to be living in,  then, I think, in the first place, we will have to follow Geoffrey Moore and begin emphasizing  the employment ratio more and pay a little less attention to the unemployment rate  And then we  need wide-scale readjustments in industry because you take many of the women who want part- time jobs, and industry in time will adapt  And some highly specific measures of government  designed to deal with the sectoral problems of unemployment may be far more effective than  broad monetary and fiscal stimuli  So we might be entering--I say entering, we may [already] be  in that kind of world now  I wonder, is this phenomenon occurring in other countries?  Does  anybody know?  Mr Reynolds    Well, but you see, this [unintelligible] might be able by survey  techniques and determine [to] what extent inflation is the driving force; it obviously is not the  only force    Well, in other words, we can generalize, as a pressure on  income--whether coming from inflation or taxes--it’s the desire to maintain or improve the  standard of living of the family  Mr Coldwell, do you have any questions?  All right, Mr  Partee, please    Thank you, Mr Partee  Mr Winn    Well, as I remember our studies at the National Bureau--my  memory goes back some distance--we found that in something like three out of four instances,  the economy in the course of a business cycle expansion would experience a pause or a  retardation and then a reacceleration    I cannot really answer that on the basis of any recollection of our  work; my recollection is not that good  But analytically, on the basis of general knowledge, I  think the answer must be different because the initial impulse is very strong from the side of  inventories  And the later reacceleration, yes, you may get an impulse from the side of inventory  as well, but it will be far less strong  And I think the main influence has to come from business  capital expenditures  That is--    Thank you, Mr Winn  Mr Lilly now, please    Thank you, Mr Lilly  Mr MacLaury, please    Thank you, Mr MacLaury  Would anyone else like to--yes, Mr  Guffey    They started to move up?  That’s a new fact  Has that come to our  attention?  Lyle    Mr Guffey has indicated that in the rural areas in his region,  interest rates have begun to move up    Are these rural banks--I’m not aware that they’re coming to the  Federal Reserve for assistance    But it is not too early to make judgments about the vacations  [business]    Rather unusual, isn’t it?  We’ve had extremely cold weather but  very little snow  Isn’t that unusual?    The hour for coffee has arrived   [Coffee break]   [Secretaries note The raw transcript for this session begins at this point]    Thank you very much, Mr Sternlight  Are there any questions?   Yes, Mr Eastburn    It’s difficult to hear you, Mr Baughman    You had some decline during the month in some interest  rates--short-term interest rates--of as much as 70 basis points     12/20-21/76 - 56 -          Yes, CDs--six-month CDs and one-year CDs  Yes, Mr Black,  you had a question, I think, or a comment    Yes, John    Any other questions  Very well, thank you for your report, Mr  Sternlight  Now a motion to confirm the transactions of the Desk will be proper  Motion has  been made and seconded  No objection is heard  Let us now turn to Mr Axilrod, who, as  always, will be very brief   AXILROD  [Secretary's note This statement was not found in Committee records]    Thank you, Mr Axilrod  Mr Coldwell    Yes, Mr Morris    All right, Mr Jackson, please    This December?  At this present month?    All right, Mr Partee    Thank you, Mr Partee  Mr Volcker now, please    Any other questions?  Yes, Mr Wallich    All right, any other question?  Well, if not, we’re ready for a  discussion of what our domestic policy directive to the New York Bank Desk might best be for  the coming month  I might say just a few words, and my own view on different Committee  targets [unintelligible] or seek another and wiser target perhaps     It seems to me that alternative B is probably, details aside, as good a decision as we can  make today  I say this, first, because the economic outlook has improved  We’ve had a very  substantial decline of interest rates in recent weeks  The prospect is that new fiscal stimuli will  be voted by the Congress and an enormous budget deficit is in the making--in fact, larger even  than we had in fiscal 1976  Inflation is still with us  The recent report, the one that Lyle referred     12/20-21/76 - 61 -         to on consumer prices, is somewhat encouraging  On the other hand, the report that we’ve had  on industrial prices and the wholesale market for the past five or six months--the increase has  been averaging around 10 percent  The dollar has weakened recently in foreign exchange  markets  The System has acted in an easing direction to lower the discount rate, the reserve  requirements     We certainly don’t want to convey the feeling to the general public that we are worried or  anxious about the economic situation  I think the time has come for a pause  And that, I think, is  essentially what alternative B conveys  I think this is the time to look around, to stand still, stop  pushing interest rates down; we guide it a little in one direction or another depending on how the  monetary aggregates come in  And [then we will] come back next month with more evidence  before us, a refreshed outlook, and decide to move one way or another  That’s my judgment as  to what we might best do today     I’m going to call on Mr MacLaury for a very special reason--    Well, now and then, as Chairman, I do something right  I’m going  to give you the opportunity to have the last word as well today, so that if you want to go ahead  and store up some remarks, please go ahead and do so    Thank you, Mr Guffey  We will hear from Mr Gardner now    Thank you, Mr Gardner  Mr Eastburn, please   Thank you, Mr Eastburn  Mr Baughman, may we hear from you  now    Thank you, Mr Baughman  Mr Black, may we hear from you    Thank you, Mr Black  Mr Partee now, please    Thank you, Mr Partee  Mr Mayo now, please    Thank you, Mr Mayo  Mr Balles now, please   MRBALLES  Mr Chairman, first as to your general observations on the state of the  economy, I can certainly share those  I would interpret, however, your prescription for a pause a  little bit differently  One of the ways I would interpret it is to take actions such as Governor  Coldwell and three or four others have talked about that would preclude any backup in the  market in short-term rates  Therefore I come out in favor of the federal funds range that he and  others have tried to--    May I say a word about that  You see, whenever we  stabilize--today or next month or three or six months--whenever you stabilize, you should expect  a small backup in rates because the market will tend to be ahead  Just a footnote    Thank you, Mr Balles  And now Mr Wallich    Move to specify the short term    All right, thank you, Mr Wallich  Mr Jackson     12/20-21/76 - 68 -          No, wait, we were all going to be happy  Now you continue, but  just keep us on a happy note    Well, I don’t think we are going to find a dissent around this place   Thank you, Mr Jackson  Well, it’s very appropriate we return to the south, no, we stay south,  where the center of the world is  Mr Kimbrel, please    Thank you, Mr Kimbrel  Mr Morris now    Several members of our Committee have not yet spoken    Thank you, Mr Winn  Mr Lilly, please    Mr MacLaury    Thank you, Mr MacLaury  Anyone else like to speak?  There is  virtual unanimity among the members of the Committee on M2, all of which means that we  don’t really care so much about M2 and that our love still goes out to M1 and to the federal  funds rate  As far as M1 is concerned, there is the range under alternative B--2-1/2 to 6-1/2 has  the edge in the expression of views around the table     As far as the federal funds rate is concerned, six members of the Committee favor a range  of 4-1/4 to 5, another six members of the Committee favor a range of 4 to 5  One member of the  Committee who is in favor of a range of 4 to 5 expressed a certain preference for an  asymmetrical midpoint, that midpoint being 4-5/8, and therefore by the faintest margin there is a  preference for 4-1/4 to 5  I doubt whether additional debate would resolve the question  The  differences are very small  We might have more of a difference on the directive  Now, I think  myself that a money market directive at this particular time is the wiser course  Let’s have a  show of hands on those who favor a money market directive    Well, the differences are very, very fragile, tiny  No difference at  all, really, on M2  Two members of the Committee did not express any numerical wishes   Everyone in favor of 9 to 13    Well, we could  But do we want to, really?  I think this  Committee is in danger of excessive fine tuning  Why not leave it to the Desk?    Well, he has a little range  The range would be--well, we’ll vote a  range for him     12/20-21/76 - 71 -          Well, I think we ought to give him a little more room than an  eighth    No, I don’t think that’s realistic or fair to the Desk  Why do we  want a Manager?  We’ll get a clerk and tell him this is his business  The Desk must have some  discretion  Although you know we’ve heard a lot about the desirability--well, one member of  the Committee--and I can’t name him because I don’t know who he is, and if I did, I wouldn’t  say--a note arrived at my desk and reads as follows  “All these fellows who argue about federal  funds rate flexibility are suddenly worried about a little market backup”  Well, we’re all very  human     Gentlemen, I’m going to put the following to a vote  a money market directive and the  specifications under alternative B    All right, what else do we have?    Oh yes, the release of the 1971 Memoranda of Discussion  Would  you be good enough to comment on that    Any question or objection?  I hear none, and therefore the  recommendation is accepted  There is a memorandum from Mr O’Connell; would you be good  enough to comment?    Any discussion?  I take it, in view of the silence, that the  recommendation of the general counsel is accepted   [GAP IN TRANSCRIPT  Setting date of next meeting and adjournment]   [END OF TRANSCRIPT]         "
273,1977-01-17,"  Gentlemen, this meeting will now come to order, please  There  are several items that I thought would be best taken up in executive session  And one of them is  the agreement concluded by the central bankers in Basel concerning the establishment of a  facility for handling official sterling balances  The agreement has been distributed to the  members of the Committee  I hope you’ve all had an opportunity to review it  I’ll call on  Governor Wallich to summarize the essentials of this agreement in a few sentences  And then  we will discuss it, and at the end of our discussion, I hope that someone will be good enough to  move ratification of the agreement  Mr Wallich, please    No, not at this point  We want to deal solely with the agreement  drawn up at Basel by the central banks  Thank you, Mr Wallich  Mr Holmes, you worked hard  on this--would you like to add any comment?    Thank you, Mr Holmes  The only additional comment that I  would make is that the present expectation--and it’s an eminently reasonable expectation--is that  the BIS will be able to meet any funds that the British may wish to acquire because of a rundown  in the sterling balances  All the BIS has to do is enter the market and bid for deposits and make  those funds available to the Bank of England  And therefore, the chances are that we at no point  over the next two years will have to put up one penny  But, of course, it’s a contingent liability,  and we must be entirely clear on that  But the present expectation is that the BIS will be able to  meet whatever credit needs Britain may have under this agreement, and the BIS will not find it  necessary to call on us or on the other central banks that are parties to this undertaking  All  right, are there any questions?    In case we’re called upon, well, Henry would you answer that?    Which means, in effect, we’d be lending to the Bank of England    The rate may vary over time, depending on three-month--    Well, the other countries don’t enter into the picture until the BIS  has to draw on other countries  And as I said, that is really not at all likely to occur  The BIS  will enter the market and will borrow funds, or attract deposits at a certain rate of interest  And  the BIS will charge the Bank of England the rate of interest that it has to pay plus a certain  commission, which may be 1/4 of 1 percent, maybe a little higher    Any other questions?  Well, if there is no other question, would  someone be good enough to move ratification of this agreement   SPEAKER(?)  So moved    Motion has been made  Any objection  I hear none, and let us  pass now to an internal agreement, that is, a separate agreement that we at the Federal Reserve  have with the US Treasury  And that agreement is written out in a letter from Secretary Simon  to me, dated January 14, 1977, along with my reply to the Secretary as of the same date  And  this agreement is very simple, really  It’s unequivocal  If the BIS draws on us, we could extend  credit for up to a period of one year  And if the loan has to be extended, then the Treasury will  take us out and assume that loan at the end of one year  Henry would you want to add to that  description?    In this regard, you may recall the provision that we had for a take- out under an agreement with the Treasury--back in 1968, was it?  Well, there was an obligation  assumed by the Treasury in that year  And that undertaking by the Treasury has been subject to     1/17-18/77 - 4 -           interpretation and misinterpretation; there were elements of ambiguity  [This] is an  unconditional arrangement  Mr Volcker    Well, I think that’s true, but let’s be clear about the risk  The risk  is the Bank of England declares itself bankrupt, and I think that risk is a minimal risk    No exchange rate risk whatever    There would be a loss on this loan only if the Bank of England  goes bankrupt    Or repudiates its debt without going bankrupt  After all, that’s  been done by Communist countries    The Treasury wanted this paragraph since the agreement otherwise  was entirely unconditional  And since I regarded the risk as minimal--and if the Bank of  England repudiates its debt, then I think we’ll be living in a very different world from any that  you or I have known--I saw no reason to quarrel with the Treasury, since I had other quarrels on  more important matters that were already resolved satisfactorily     1/17-18/77 - 5 -            Well, I’m very glad that you’ve become--that you’ve thrown off  your old Treasury garments completely, since you no longer even remember that no matter how  this last paragraph is written, if there is a loss, well that’s going to come out of the US Treasury    Are there any questions about this side agreement with the US  Treasury    A motion has been made to ratify the agreement with the Treasury   Are there any questions or expressions of dissent?  I hear none     And now I want to turn to the third item, which is a proposal for a warehousing agreement   And this is described in a letter from the Secretary of the Treasury, dated January 14, and a  proposed reply under my signature dated January 17, which is today  And what the Treasury is  suggesting is a warehousing arrangement for the Exchange Stabilization Fund of $1-1/2 billion,  half of which would be available for a period of up to six months and the other half for a period  of up to one year     Now I don’t know if members of the Committee have received a document prepared by  Mr Morton of our staff, which gives the history of our warehousing of foreign currencies in the  US Treasury  It was first authorized by this Committee in November 1963, and in September  1968, the warehousing authorization was fixed at $1 billion for, I believe, a period of up to one  year  The present requested or recommended authorization is larger, up to $1-1/2 billion   However, the period on the average is shorter, half of it for a period of six months, and half for a  period of 12 months     Now, in discussion of this suggestion with Governor Lilly at the luncheon table, Governor  Lilly raised the question about the period of agreement  And then, in the course of the  discussion, it became clear that this Committee reviews its foreign currency directive, among  others, annually in March, I believe  Therefore, any year in March, if there is some question  about this warehousing arrangement, its extension into the future, any modification of it--that  would be the time [for this Committee] to take it up, and that could then be negotiated with the  Treasury in accordance with the wishes of the Committee  Would you like to add anything by  way of explanation, Governor Wallich?    Mr Holmes, I hope you have followed the discussion  Would you  like to add--    --would you wish to comment on it?    Well, as the first sentence in Mr Morton’s memorandum  indicates, System warehousing of foreign currency involves simultaneous spot purchases and  forward sales of foreign currency by the System with the US Treasury    Always at identical rates    Why not?    Forget entirely the--    This is not linked as such with the Basel agreement  The Treasury  may find that the Exchange Stabilization Fund [ESF] is short of money for a great period    It may arise out of the new Basel agreement or any other purpose   And then the Treasury will turn to the Federal Reserve as its banker for short-term financing  I  say “would”--may turn to us    Of course    To come under the law, it has to be a swap transaction, according  to our lawyers  And as Mr Broida points out to me in the projected letter that I would send to  the Treasury, that projected letter says, “the Federal Reserve will be prepared, if requested by the  Treasury, to warehouse eligible foreign--”    Any questions about this warehousing arrangement?     1/17-18/77 - 8 -            This has been considered  We reviewed the 1968 undertaking,  and that was disclosed fully to the public  That would be our intention now, subject only to  some conversations with the Treasury  If the Treasury has cogent reasons for not disclosing it,  we would have to take them into account  Now, I believe, Governor Wallich, you have  discussed this question with Mr Yeo of the Treasury    Well, I think that’s clearly appropriate because the members of the  Congress like to know about these things before they read about it in the newspapers  And that  presents no difficulty from our viewpoint because--Mr Broida, am I right in thinking--it has 30  days?    We could do that if the Treasury’s made its clearing with the  congressional--?    Any other question about this arrangements?    Well, I think we ought to be careful about one thing  I spoke  about the March date, but if we enter into an agreement today, I think that this agreement ought  to be good until March 1978  I don’t think we could very well go back to the Treasury--not this  March    It should be written-in that, in the normal course of events, as we  consider our various directives, we’ll take this up, among others  That should be reported to  files    Yes    A motion has been made that this agreement be entered into  Is  there an objection?  I hear none, and therefore, I’m going to sign it now and dispatch it to the  Treasury since they’re very nervous over there  I hope they’ve got somebody in the mail room    The only way I’ve ever understood the whole swap network is in  the language of loans    My apologies to you  My attention was diverted; it seems Mr  Wallich set a precedent  Would you be good enough to repeat your question?      Well now, look, they have the IMF loan [at] 39 [percent]; they  have a commitment from us and the Treasury amounting in the aggregate to $500 [million], they  can draw on that  They have a supplementary commitment for $300 million by the Bundesbank   They now have this standby sterling balance facility of $3 billion  What does all this mean?   Well, it means that their ability to borrow is enormous  How the markets will respond, I don’t  know  Now, there’s been no great upsurge in the value of the pound sterling in the foreign  exchange market  However, the sterling has strengthened, and the British have taken in recent  weeks some $800 million     What are the prospects for Britain?  If the figures that I have seen concerning revenues to  be derived as a result of North Sea oil, [then] the balance of payments position of Britain starting  next year should improve dramatically  Does that mean that the pound sterling will strengthen?  It doesn’t mean that at all because if Britain continues to inflate at a rate which exceeds the  inflation rate of the rest of the world, the pound sterling will continue to depreciate in the foreign  exchange markets       1/17-18/77 - 10 -           Now, the British along with most of the rest of mankind see borrowing more as a solution  to their problem  That is a solution that our politicians and our economists and even our  businesspeople these days turn to when we consider our own domestic affairs, and the same is  true around the world  In my judgment, Britain will not be able to restore its economy until its  budget is brought under control, until the present confiscatory taxation is drastically modified,  and until all the nonsense about nationalizing industry comes to an end  These changes, I don’t  believe, will take place in Britain, and therefore, I can’t be very sanguine about the prospects of  the British pound, which is very sad, and I hope I’m wrong    Well, if there are no further questions about these foreign items,  we have to return to consideration of the Government in the Sunshine [bill]  A question has  arisen whether the FOMC is or is not covered by the Government in the Sunshine legislation  As  of today, I’m not prepared to make any recommendation to the Committee because certain  conversations that are under way with members of the Congress interested in this legislation are  as yet uncompleted  And I will not be able to make a recommendation until I’ve gone further in  consulting with members of the Congress who are following  the Government in the Sunshine  Act closely     Now, Mr O’Connell will set forth the pros and cons as he now sees them  I hope the  members of the Committee will listen very closely, and I shall want to get into the act at a certain  stage, but I am not ready to make any recommendation because these conversations with  congressmen, which bear critically on a decision, as I said, have not yet been conclusive  Mr  O’Connell, would you be good enough to proceed?    Thank you very much  I have unavoidably become involved in the  study of this problem in extensive conversations concerning it  And I don’t have a single reason  to question anything Mr O’Connell has stated  But I do think we have a congressional problem,  one that I’m trying to test  I’m not using the word resolve, because I don’t think the question is  of a sort that can be resolved--but it can be tested, and it can serve as a guide to a rational  decision by us     What is the congressional problem?  Well, it so happens that there are some members of  the Congress, and particularly staff members, who are following the Sunshine legislation--what  is being done under it--very closely, and who are concerned about any decision that we may  make concerning the FOMC  Now if the conclusion were reached, by this or that influential  congressman concerned with this legislation, that we’re engaged in the circumvention of law, or  that we’re following the law strictly but that the law contains a loophole, then this or that  interested congressman might propose an amendment to the Sunshine Act  And if that     1/17-18/77 - 13 -           amendment is on the floor, an amendment designed simply to encompass the FOMC in the  course of debate--as things happen in the Congress, we stand a chance of losing the two  exemptions that we won last year and which make it really possible, at least as I see it, for the  Federal Reserve System to function     And therefore, I have begun a series of conversations with key members of the Congress  I  saw Congressman Fascell, who is the author of this legislation, or if not quite that, the chief  intellectual exponent of it, in the House of Representatives  He’s friendly, and he has no desire  as such to present an amendment  But I now have to see Senator Chiles, Senator Ribicoff,  Congressman Brooks, and, on the Republican side of the House of Representatives, Mr Horton   I don’t anticipate any difficulty, except perhaps with Senator Chiles  Senator Chiles, I hope I’m  being fair to him, was the author of this legislation on the Senate side  He felt very unhappy  about the amendments that we achieved in the Congress last year  He felt very strongly about  the legislation as it was passed by the Senate originally  He might be described, perhaps  unfairly, as being the theologian on this issue     If I succeed in persuading him that without coming formally under the Sunshine legislation  we are not only adhering in full to the principles of the legislation, but going beyond it--I’ll  explain that in a moment--if I succeed in that mission, which I’ve set for myself with Senator  Chiles, then I think Tom’s recommendation is clearly the right one  If I fail, I’m not sure of a  conclusion, but that is where my problems begin in making a recommendation to this  Committee, and I’m not at [that] point     Now, in this Committee we are living strictly, I think, within the spirit of the Sunshine  legislation  The exemption under the Sunshine law, I think, would make it possible for us to  close every meeting  The law as written requires that a verbatim transcript of every meeting be  kept or that carefully prepared minutes be written out  Well, certainly our secretarial staff is  discharging the latter function--preparation of minutes--in exemplary fashion  Not only that, but  the law does not require publication of the minutes, and we do publish the minutes  Not only do  we publish them, but we publish them as promptly as is technically feasible  That is, within a  period of something like 30 days  Therefore, we not only are living within the spirit of the  Sunshine law but going beyond it     Now if a little speech like that will warm Senator Chiles’s heart, and it’s a factual  statement, then I believe that we need not fear an amendment to the Sunshine law being  proposed in the Congress  And we can adopt Mr O’Connell’s recommendation very  comfortably  But as I stated, if Senator Chiles feels that here is a loophole in the legislation that  must be closed, that he is going to propose an amendment--that raises a difficult political  problem for us, a problem I’ve already stated  Namely, once an amendment comes to the floor,  other amendments might be added; we might lose one or the other or both of the exemptions that  we won last year after a most arduous battle in which all of you participated  And who knows,  other burdensome amendments might be added  There is an element of hazard there  That’s all I  can say on the subject as of today    Yes     1/17-18/77 - 14 -            The suit might still be brought    Which means that, if the decision of the Committee should be to  come under the legislation, that we might be a little late in doing so, and this possibility was  discussed with Congressman Fascell, who saw no difficulty    No, no, the exemption is written into the Sunshine law  The basic  exemption, that is, exemptions under which you can close meetings    I would like to think that it would be entirely, rather than almost  entirely, even if we decide that we come under this act    They are the legal questions, or possibly legal difficulties, that  Tom will refer to, but I think we better go with that [assumption]    Let Tom address them now, and then we’ll return to your question    Gentlemen, let me just interrupt  I don’t know why I was favored  with this cup of coffee, but I was so favored, and therefore, if any of the rest of you would like  coffee, you will not be so favored, but the coffee is right there  And let’s take perhaps a short  break, coffee break, if you so wish     [Coffee break]   Gentlemen, the coffee break is at an end  We’ll defer the question of the appeal until  we’ve taken up on the Sunshine legislation, and then return to that  Well, I’m sorry, first, [about  having] to bring Sunshine legislation back to the Committee; and second, [about] not being  prepared to make a recommendation  I think we need to know more before we act  But any  advice that you may have, any thoughts that you may have, would be very helpful at this time    No, that’s a very good question, and I’ve issued instructions to the  staff, and the instruction has been--draw up a set of rules and procedures  And work with it  hard--the procedures should be such that Sunshine will be neither audible nor visible at the  Board table  Or it’ll be audible and visible only to the absolute minimum  Now and then,  members of the staff have reported their progress, and I’ve expressed dissatisfaction in  [unintelligible] way because they were drawing up rules of a kind that I thought would involve  the Board in too much discussion, too many rules  And the rule of being inaudible and invisible  was not being [observed] scrupulously or meticulously enough     Apart from these warnings that I’ve made repeatedly when I’ve heard about these rules, I  don’t know where they are now  Whether I, for one, am satisfied with them or not, I don’t know   However, Tom O’Connell has worked on these rules, and perhaps you can indicate where they  stand  This may or may not give me an opportunity to say that they are insufficiently inaudible     1/17-18/77 - 17 -            But we have to live within the law  But, you know, there are ways  of turning this into a grand ceremony or [instead] dealing with it in a way that satisfies the law  [while] not obstructing Board business, in taking Board time, on minutiae of procedures    You might indicate what kinds of meetings will be open to the  public    I think the Bank Presidents would be especially interested in the  question of whether matters that come before Mr Coldwell’s committee [the Federal Reserve  Board’s Committee on Federal Reserve Bank Activities, or BAC] involving Federal Reserve  Banks in general [and] Reserve Bank budgets in particular would be handled in open or in closed  session--could you address this range of thinking?    Let me indicate this, too  If Federal Reserve Bank budgets were to  be handled in an open meeting, then our public image, if nothing else, would require that we  devote a good full day to consideration of those budgets  Otherwise, we’re simply rubber  stamping what a committee had done, and we’re not doing our job    Now, I hope you would do more research on that question,  because the Board does not have that much time  It’s largely the [Bank Activities] Committee’s  job  The Board traditionally has not spent a day on the budget  Now maybe we should, but we  don’t have too much time  You know that this is a very hard-working Board    Well, then, maybe the [Bank Activities] Committee ought to be a  smaller committee?    Suppose that we have a recommendation such as we had from the  New York Bank, the Kansas City Bank, concerning new computers--now, would that have to  come before the Board in open session?    What about the question of the general level of salary increases or  a guideline for salary increases within our Federal Reserve Banks?    Except in consumer areas    Mr Coldwell, have you given any attention to these rules that the  staff is working on?    Have you been involved?    I hope you will find ways of dealing with Federal Reserve Bank  problems so that as few of them as possible need to be handled in open session    You think you’ve already done that    You see, this question about Federal Reserve budgets disturbed  me because these budgets are worked out very extensively by our staff  They’re worked on very  extensively by Mr Coldwell’s committee  I work on it to some degree with Mr Coldwell  outside the Board Room  The amount of time that has been spent by the Board as a whole on  Federal Reserve Bank budgets hasn’t been large because of all of these preparatory steps  All  right, now you have an open meeting, and there may be some newspaper fellows there, and Mr  Gardner’s Common Cause, and--what’s this?--Ralph Nader’s crowd, and what not     Here, let us say, we take up a budget coming to $600 million plus, and we do that within  an hour, and, well, we’d look very bad  Therefore, if that were the case I would consider it my  duty to just stretch it out over a day  Well, that’s terrible  Then we’d look good or reasonably  good in Mr Nader’s eyes, but we’d destroy or reduce our effectiveness  Now, there must be an  answer to that  Well, we have enough ingenuity in this room, I think, to find the answer, but I  don’t think we have found it yet     SPEAKER(?)  In the process, too, Mr Chairman, you end up publishing the budgets of  the individual Federal Reserve Banks, which has never been done    Well--    Well, if it’s an open session?    We consider the budgets--well, of course, they’re before us  Well,  gentlemen, Sunshine brings us blessings, it also brings us problems, and the problems do not all  lie with the legislation  We’ve got several weeks, but this may still prove to be a very heavy  burden on us  I hope that the staff will continue to be resourceful and that Messrs Gardner and  Coldwell and the rest of us will continue working on the problem, and I will try to dig in myself     Well, let’s come back to the FOMC problem as far as Sunshine is concerned  Any  thoughts the members may have that we ought to bear in mind?  Now, we may have a telephone  conference on this issue because of the calendrical constraint--that is March 12, is it?    Well, we may be unable to reach that deadline, but we don’t want  to be too late--     1/17-18/77 - 22 -           [Secretary’s Note The raw transcript for the January 17 session ends at this point  It  seems that the meeting recessed here, but there may have been additional discussion]   January 18, 1977    Gentlemen, our meeting will get under way now, please  We need  to act on the minutes of the December meeting  Is there a motion to approve?  Motion has been  made and seconded  Any questions?  Let’s move on, then, to the report by Mr Holmes on  market operations    Thank you, Mr Holmes  Any questions?    Anything else?    Any more?  If not, a motion to confirm the transactions carried out  by the Desk--the motion has been made and seconded  Any objections?  There are none  Mr  Holmes, do you have any recommendation with respect to the operations of the Desk?     1/17-18/77 - 23 -            Do we have any advice from the Bank of Mexico on the subject?    All right, a recommendation by Mr Holmes is before the  Committee    Any objection to the recommendation?  I hear none  Thank you  very much, Mr Holmes     We will turn now to Mr Gramley for his report on the economic outlook    Thank you very much, Mr Gramley  Your reports are always  good technically, professionally, but today’s report was not only excellent professionally but it  also brought a little cheer to some of our hearts  We are ready now for Committee discussion   Who would like to be first?  Mr Lilly, please    Thank you, Mr Lilly  Mr Black, please    48 percent  Is that the highest for any quarter of this past year?    All right, thank you, Mr Black  Mr Baughman, please    All right, thank you, Mr Baughman  Mr Winn, please    You know, on that point, I wish I had the document before me, but  perhaps Mr Mayo can help me  I was reading last night a report of the Chicago  businessmen--that is an excellent group, Bob  One of the men commented that the rather flat  trend in retail sales that we had between March or April and September was due in part to faulty  seasonal adjustment  Remember that, Bob?    You know, some retailers [are] like the rest of us--we have our  own feelings and attitudes, we look at some statistics, which may be faulty, and the statistics  have an effect on our views and our judgments    Well, this is true of the retailer  I would like to think that their  economists do both  I know, in one of the very large retail sales chains--    Federated   SPEAKER(?)  Yes    That’s the one I was thinking of  This may merely mean that we  know so little about what economists in other retailing firms do  Lyle, would you be good  enough to get ahold of this economist--he’ll be easy to locate--and find out what he thinks he  knows?  He may have some valuable insights in statistical practices    Well, the pattern fits qualitatively, not necessarily quantitatively    All right, thank you very much  Mr Eastburn, please    Thank you, Mr Eastburn  Mr Partee, please     1/17-18/77 - 27 -            What is the second part?    For what period, again?    Full employment deficit will not have any psychological impact    A psychological effect will come from the actual or prospective  deficit, over time    I would agree with Mr Partee  I would also point out that what  happened in the market for long-term interest rates last week, partly as a response to the new  fiscal package announced by the incoming Administration, is a warning of what may be ahead     While I’m speaking, let me add one fact  At 200 or 230 there will be an announcement  on housing starts, and I don’t feel free to disclose the figure, but I can say it’s quite an optimistic  report     Thank you, Mr Partee  Mr Wallich now, please    Is that true of skilled labor--    How good has the model been in predicting inflation?    How good was it in 1972, 1973, the first half of 1974?    No, that wasn’t my question    How good was it in 1970?    Are you satisfied, Mr Wallich?  Okay, Mr Kimbrel now, please    When was the Department of Commerce survey taken, the results  of which were recently announced?    All right, thank you  Mr Coldwell now, please    Thank you, Mr Coldwell  Mr Morris now, please    You know, Mr Partee commented on psychological reaction to  one or another kind of deficit  I think that once the business community becomes aware of what  is an emerging fact, namely, that the deficit this fiscal year will be substantially larger than  during the preceding record-breaking year--once the business community becomes aware of the  emerging fact that large fiscal deficits are ahead for several years, this may well have a profound  effect on inflationary expectations  Mr Mayo, please    When are we getting new seasonals?    I’ve already heard about a slight adjustment--that is, the 79 will  be 78 for December on the basis of new seasonals  Do you know about that?    Lyle, yours is good classical analysis  But it leaves out of account  a new factor that has been disturbing our judgments and our forecast, and that is what may  happen with the labor force    I would only question the word “erratic”  It might be a systematic  factor in changing habits and new pressures arising from inflation, as the factors impinge on  families, women joining the labor force--well, because people like to live better, and they  certainly don’t want to see their standard of living coming down  And one of the illusions  generated by statistical reporting is that wages go up for everyone  They go [up] on the average,     1/17-18/77 - 35 -           [but] tens of millions do not experience a wage increase in any six-month period, a year   Farmers’ incomes may decline--they have declined during the past year; incomes of proprietors  and so on  This may well be a systematic factor--partly [one of] changing cultural trends and  partly the pressures on families arising from inflation, all of which causes an increase in labor  force participation by women and, to some degree, by teenagers  Thank you very much, Mr  Gardner, Mr Gramley  Mr Balles now, please    Thank you, Mr Balles  Mr Black, please    I would not anticipate much response in that direction  I would  anticipate protective measures by businessman  raising prices to the extent that they can--more  than they would want to--    Not really, because businessmen very rarely speculate on  inventories, and the mood has not been in that direction  The only recent year when we’ve had  significant inventory speculations was, I think, 1974 [and] to some degree 1973  Normally,  speculation on inventory--I don’t think [it] is a part of business practice    Shorter run  I’m thinking of 1977    And I would expect that the inflationary expectations I spoke of  are being reflected in prices, making their own forecast, to some degree, come true  And I would  expect it in interest rates  The effects on capital spending, if any would come later, might come  toward the end of ’77, and my feeling is that it will come in ’78  Mr Jackson, please    That would depend on rate movements    You and I are on the same track    Well, I don’t think Mr Partee intended to suggest that the second  decimal had any significance; he might even question the first    As a matter of potential output, I wrote a paper in 1935 in which I  attempted to demonstrate by impeccable logic that potential output cannot be measured  I have  lived during periods when this has become a habit  Well, I don’t think I’ve changed my mind   Mr Partee you were going to make a point?     1/17-18/77 - 38 -            Well, at this point I would join, to an attenuated degree, Mr  Coldwell’s comment on erratic movement  We may well get an erratic movement of inventory  change in the next year  Sharp buildup, slowdown    That would be my guess    For the year as whole, that’s another matter    Well, if you apply standard seasonals, you may find that activity  shows a decline when the seasonals which you ought to be applying are of a different character,  because we are having an unusual winter--an unusual January  And that will certainly have to be  watched very carefully  I would use a standard seasonal, and then I would try to use a seasonal  adjustment for weather factors  Now a good deal of research was done on that years ago, and I  haven’t kept up with it  Whether we know how to do it now or not, I don’t know, but I’m sure  we can do it roughly, you know, as a guide to the interpretation of the statistics  Well, we’ve had  a good discussion of the economy  Yes, Mr Mayo    What is the percentage ratio, Lyle, of total employment to the total  population of age 16 and over?    I mean, is it at a record level?    I thought so--at a record level  That, perhaps, is a more significant  figure, Bob    Less gross, less subject to some questioning or criticism one might  make because the base there is the potential working population     1/17-18/77 - 40 -            Very good  Any other questions?  Yes, Mr Winn    Would you also comment on natural gas?    That’s been predicted for Ohio for a long time    I think that’s entirely valid, but I would have liked your comments  better if you had not based it on the model  The St Louis model does not get high marks for its  predictive power  In fact, it gets very low marks in the economics profession  Am I right on  that?     1/17-18/77 - 41 -            Well, gentlemen, any other comments on the economy?  Well,  let’s take a brief coffee break now   [Coffee break]    Gentlemen, we want to turn now to the discussion of our longer- term targets, and we will first turn to the monetary aggregates  I think members of the  Committee know that the House Banking Committee will be holding a hearing on February 3  under the House Concurrent Resolution  I will be testifying on that subject on that day  And  therefore, this Committee must today decide once again on our monetary objectives for the year  ahead, that is, for the interval running from the fourth quarter of 1976 to the fourth quarter of  1977     Now, in setting these monetary targets for the year ahead, we need to consider apparent  conditions of the economy  We’ve done that  We need to consider economic prospects for the  year ahead and their dependence on the monetary policy that we lay down, and we’ve done that   We know less about monetary policy, on our overall judgment, than about economic prospects   And finally, we need to consider the degree to which, if any, our monetary policy should  contribute to unwinding the inflation from which our economy has been suffering since the mid- 1960s     Of these several considerations, the last, I believe, is peculiarly important for us at the  Federal Reserve  I say this because no other branch of government, certainly not the executive,  certainly not the Congress, has anything approaching an articulate policy for bringing down the  rate of inflation  Now, if we at the Federal Reserve should fail to persevere in bringing down our  monetary growth rates, which are far too high from the viewpoint of ever returning to price  stability, there would be no chance whatever for reestablishing a foundation for economic  stability in the future  Recognizing this basic principle, this Committee during the past 21  months has moved very gradually, but rather consistently, toward lower monetary growth rates   Our moves may have been much too gradual, but they at least have been in a salutary direction     In approaching the problem of setting monetary growth rates for the year ahead, I start  with the basic thought that, if at all feasible, we should once again make a small move in the  direction of monetary growth rates that are tolerably consistent with eventual restoration of a  stable price level  Now, in my own mind, this basic thought is clouded by other considerations,  namely, unemployment is still unduly high  We have a new Administration; the new  Administration has proposed a fiscal plan for reducing unemployment, and any lowering of  monetary growth rates at this time would, I’m quite sure, be very widely interpreted--and not  only in the political arena--as an attempt on the part of the Federal Reserve to frustrate the efforts  of a newly elected President and newly elected Congress to get our economy, to use a popular  phrase, “moving once again”  I’ve tried--it obviously isn’t easy--to bring these two sets of  thoughts into some sort of harmony       1/17-18/77 - 42 -           And accordingly, my recommendations to the Committee are as follows  First, that we  leave the projected growth range for M1 as is--4-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent--for the coming year   Second, that we modify the growth ranges for M2 and M3--specifically, that the growth range of  M2 be set at 7 to 10 percent instead of 7-1/2 to 10 percent, and the growth range of M3 be set at  8-1/2 to 11-1/2 percent instead of 9 to 11-1/2     The proposal to leave M1 unchanged has at least this advantage  You would avoid any  charge that the Federal Reserve is indifferent to unemployment or, and this is more serious, it  would avoid the charge that we are seeking to frustrate the efforts of the new Administration   The proposal to lower the lower limits of M2 and M3 by 1/2 percentage point has, I think, the  following advantages  First, it recognizes the recent tendency of various banks and thrift  institutions around the country to reduce the interest rates paid to savers, and this tendency may  well result in a lower growth rate of M2 and M3 in the immediately succeeding months  Later  on in the year, higher market rates of interest may well slow down the inflow of funds to thrift  institutions  And finally, the slight lowering of the lower limit of M2 and M3 would once again  provide some evidence that the Federal Reserve is sticking to its repeatedly stated objective of  gradually bringing down the monetary growth rates in the interest of restoring--not immediately,  but over a period years--general price stability     Now, I realize that the lowering of the lower limit of M2 and M3 might evoke some  criticism  But on this point I would say the following  First, no matter what we do, there will be  some criticism, and this is an inevitable accompaniment of central bank action  Secondly, I  would say that, as we all know, far less attention is paid by the general public, by the Congress,  even by economists, to M2 or M3 than to M1  M1 is still the magnitude that is widely followed  and respected  And I would say, finally, that even after lowering the lower limit of M2 and M3,  the midpoint of the range for M2 and the midpoint of the range for M3 would still be precisely  what it was six months ago  Therefore, no lowering from where it was six months ago, and this  would be duly noted in our statement to the Congress     These are my best thoughts on a very difficult subject  Let us now have a general  discussion and try to determine where we should come out  Who would like to speak first?  Mr  Eastburn and then Mr Black    Coming quarter or coming year?    It has been both criticized and applauded, with more of the latter  than the former    Thank you, Mr Eastburn  Mr Black, please    Well, there’s a lot to be said for that  I struggled with that issue,  and I’m not at all sure that I came out correctly  The effect on the midpoint is the same    And in that sense, the two are interchangeable  By leaving the  upper value where it is, we would be less likely--that was my reason--to attract, or to encourage,  or to excite criticism Now, the troublesome figure is the high point, you see, the high value   And it’s that high value that is outside the range of historical experience, and that would be a  more direct way of approaching the point  I didn’t, for the reasons that I’ve stated  The  midpoint, which is the effective value, is identical; and by lowering the lower limit, we’re less  likely to incite criticism  I don’t consider that a decisive argument, and I’ve great respect for  your suggestion    No, but in our shorter-term targets we’ve been operating under the  general rule for some months now of giving approximately equal weight to M1 and M2  And  since there is some relationship between the short-term and the long-term, even though it’s a  somewhat tenuous relationship, there is some carry-over--but only to a very mild degree, you  see--of this Committee’s short-term weighting  Mr Kimbrel, please    Thank you, Mr Kimbrel  Mr Jackson, please    Thank you, Mr Jackson  Mr Balles now, please    Thank you, Mr Balles  Mr Partee, please    They’re very much high    The average rate of growth of M3 for the period 1966 to 1975 was  88 [percent]  The average for the period 1971 to 1975 was 108  The average for 1976 was  124  The corresponding figures for M2 are 83, 95, and 109    That’s correct  Last year’s result was very much out of the ball  park    Thank you, Mr Partee  Mr Baughman now, please    Thank you, Mr Baughman  Mr Morris, please     1/17-18/77 - 48 -            I would only make one comment  There’s never a good time  I’ve  learned that from very long and hard experience  Secondly, the next time we turn to this subject  will be in April, and the Congress may just have passed the fiscal bills recommended by the  President, or be on the point of passing  That isn’t going to be an easy time for us, either, in  terms of what Mr Baughman euphemistically described as the environment    Proceeding as we have, Henry, I’ve made some calculations--it  will take us ten years  Ten years if we’re lucky, if we don’t have any recession, and if we just  persist in doing pretty much what we’ve been doing    Thank you, Mr Wallich  Mr Winn, please    Thank you, Mr Winn  Mr Coldwell now, please    That comment touches one of my nerves  I have made that  comment repeatedly with regard to our two-month targets  I’ve never made it with regard to the  long run    Thank you, Mr Coldwell  Mr Mayo now, please    All right, thank you, Mr Mayo  Mr Gardner now    Starting around 1961  If you carry it back just a few years, it all  collapses    Thank you, Mr Gardner  Mr Guffey now, please    All right, just one point  Leaving the upper limit of M3  unchanged should, I think, protect us against that criticism, assuming that criticism is going to be  rational, which it sometimes is, and often is not    You know, they’ve been flooded with money  If they have a  problem, they can easily solve it through 1978    Thank you, Mr Guffey  Mr Volcker, may we hear from you now    Thank you, Mr Volcker  Would anyone else like to be heard?   Yes, Mr Van Nice, please, and welcome to our meeting, Mr Van Nice    Thank you, Mr Van Nice  Would anyone else like to speak?  If  not, I do think that we have a rough consensus as to numbers  There is a consensus in another  respect, and this goes--I have only one quarrel with your comment, Paul--at one point, you refer  to being quite happy  I don’t think anybody is quite happy with this exercise; there is a  consensus also of not being enthusiastic  It’s very hard to be enthusiastic, and I share that light  enthusiasm     But in view of the rough consensus that has emerged, I would like to put to a vote now the  following targets for the 12-month period from the fourth quarter of ’76 to the fourth quarter of  ’77  4-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent for M1, 7 to 10 percent for M2, 8-1/2 to 11-1/2 [percent] for M3  As  for the credit proxy, I suggest that we follow the practice that we have in recent meetings and     1/17-18/77 - 55 -           leave that to our staff  Any number determined by our staff as being rational will be accepted by  the Committee     Now, so we’d be voting on M1, M2, and M3 as I stated  Are there any questions before  we begin the voting?  Would you be good enough to call the roll?    Yes, Mr Winn    Any other questions?     1/17-18/77 - 56 -            Mr Black, please    Thank you, Mr Black  Mr Eastburn    Thank you, Mr Eastburn  Mr Wallich, please    Thank you, Mr Wallich  Mr Partee, please    Thank you, Mr Axilrod  We have to make a decision as to the  procedure  It’s 5 minutes to 100  And we could continue this meeting and perhaps reach a  resolution as to our short-range targets quickly, or we could break for lunch and come back at  200  What is the pleasure of the Committee?    The suggestion has been made that we break for lunch; I hear no  protest   [Lunch break]    Now we are ready for item 4  Let me give you the housing figure   Here is the way they have been running, to give you a frame of reference   August--1,537,000;  September--1,840,000;  October--1,814,000;  November--1,716,000;     1/17-18/77 - 58 -           December--1,940,000    Increase in both  Let me give you the multifamily    August--366;  September--560;  remember there was a sudden increase associated with special activity by  HUD;  October--477;  November--479;  December--617     On the other hand, building permits figures show somewhat different results    July 1,215;  August 1,296;  September 1,504;  November 1,590;  December 1,513     So there is a small decline in permits, a large increase in housing starts with a trend in  both-- a favorable one, a rather strong one     Gentlemen, we now have to turn to the decision on the domestic policy directive for the  coming months  What I find particularly difficult is the specification for the federal funds rate  this coming month  Now, in alternative B, I find myself really wrestling [with a choice between]  the federal funds rate specified under alternative B, and a still-smaller range that is 4-1/2 to 5  percent     Now, you know, these ranges have to be realistic  I thought for a time of a range of 4-1/4  to 5-1/4, and I asked myself a question  What would happen to the world we live in if the federal  funds rate were to rise from 4-5/8 to 5-1/4?  I would say that, for the coming month, it would be  an unacceptable increase  So I brought it down to 5, and then I asked myself a question  What  about the rate going down to 4-1/4?  Well that’s possible; 4-1/2 is perhaps better  I could live  with one or the other  I think I would like 4-1/2 to 5 a little better  As for the growth rates, those  under alternative B look all right to me; perhaps it might be shaded by a 1/2 point    That’s right  Well, that’s the way I see matters for the month  ahead  Who’d like to speak on the subject  Let’s see if we can’t go round the table and do it  with reasonable speed  It’s now 230, and there is a lot that all of us still have to accomplish  before this day is over  Mr Coldwell    All right, thank you, Mr Coldwell  Mr Volcker, please    All right, thank you  Mr Partee, please    Yes, I was going to ask that    All right    No--    No, no, wait, wait--we have been through all of that  For a time,  we would fix on a range and then we would say, oh no, let the effective range be smaller  That  got us into difficulties  The range that we decide on, we’ve found through experience, is the  range that ought to be available to the Desk to use in full  Now, circumstances may arise  between meetings when the Chairman may seek the advice of the Committee on going beyond  the range or not going up to the limits of the specified range  But if we decide on 4-1/4 to 5-1/4  today, that should be our decision and that should mean that the Desk is free, assuming there are  no further instructions to the Desk, to use that full range, depending on the behavior of the  monetary aggregates    Oh yes, oh yes    Well, “to” or “through”--     1/17-18/77 - 61 -            We’ll move on now  Mr Kimbrel now, please    Thank you, Mr Kimbrel  Who’d like to speak now  Mr Mayo,  then Mr Black    Thank you, Mr Mayo  Mr Black, please    Thank you, Mr Black  Mr Balles, please    Thank you, Mr Balles  Who would like to speak now, please   Mr Wallich    Thank you, Mr Wallich  Mr Lilly, please    Thank you, Mr Lilly  Who would like to speak next, please   Governor Jackson now    Thank you, Mr Jackson  Who’s ready to speak now  Mr  Eastburn    Thank you, Mr Eastburn  Mr Gardner, please    Thank you, Mr Gardner  Who would like to speak now    Yes, Mr Baughman    All right, thank you Mr Baughman  Mr Winn, may we hear from  you    You say you’re not sure    It’s as logical as anything around this table   SPEAKER(?)  That’s a new consideration!      Yes, Mr Guffey    That would be the judgment the Committee would have to reach   Normally, we move gradually; there have been times when the Committee wanted to move  rather rapidly  Anyone else want to speak?  Mr Morris, yes, please    All right, thank you, Mr Morris  Anyone else?  If not, there is a  narrow preference for the ranges of 3 to 7 and 7 to 11 for M1 and M2 respectively  There’s more  diversity with regard to the federal funds rate, but the divergences are quite small  I think a  reasonable balancing of the opinions expressed would be a range of 4-1/4 to 5  I would suggest  that to the Committee     Or, I think if the Committee finds that suggestion agreeable, then I would suggest that we  still consider the question of whether the midpoint be treated in symmetrical fashion or not   Symmetrically the midpoint would be 4-5/8, although the Committee might prefer a midpoint of  4-3/4, and that would accommodate the thinking of the plurality who wanted a range of 4-1/4 to  5-1/4     Let me make this suggestion to the Committee, and then we will discuss this  that we vote  on a range of 3 to 7 for M1, 7 to 11 for M2, and 4-1/4 to 5 for the federal funds rate but that the  midpoint be treated asymmetrically--that is at 4-3/4 rather than 4-5/8  Does that shock anyone?    All right, let’s turn to Mr Sternlight, and then we have Mr  Holmes    Aren’t you just about there now?    Well, wait a minute now  Haven’t you been closer than that  recently?  Weren’t you closer than that yesterday?    I didn’t ask you what you were aiming at, I asked you where you  were    Yesterday you were [at] 480, and if you move within a range of  4-5/8 to 4-3/4, the market might be relieved, instead of exploding with 10 to 12 basis points   You know, I’m not a market man, but I do follow figures  I don’t know--    All right  Mr Holmes    Well, I don’t think there is any sentiment within the Committee  that you do anything aggressive  You know what we have been talking about are such minute  differences, and therefore, aggressive behavior is hardly being contemplated by the Committee    Now, I can’t speak for the Committee, but let me still try, and the  Committee will tell me if I’m off track  Suppose that the instruction to you were not to be  aggressive in any of the senses of the word that you have distinguished in our behalf    Well, would you, in that case, cause trouble?    Gentlemen, let me try--I have to try something else  I have heard  no dissent from my suggestion on the M1 and M2  Suppose we have a 4-1/4 to 5 percent federal  funds rate and that the midpoint not be regarded as 4-5/8 and it not be regarded as 4-3/4 but that  it be regarded as the range between 4-5/8 and 4-3/4     1/17-18/77 - 67 -            Yes, but I’m having more trouble today    No, no, this is a definition of the midpoint    Not a definition of the federal funds rate range    I’ve broadened the definition of the midpoint    The midpoint is no longer a point; the midpoint has itself become  a subrange  If my motion is unsatisfactory, we will entertain any other and put it to a vote    That is to say, conventional procedure--4-1/4 to 5 conventional  procedures  All right is there a--    What’s that?    4-1/4 to 5 is the range  All right, but the midpoint could be 4-5/8,  or an asymmetrically determined midpoint of 4-3/4  Those members of the Committee who  prefer 4-5/8, would they kindly raise their hands    Those who prefer 4-3/4    Well, we can’t--we weren’t voting  The wise men haven’t voted, I  think  Gentlemen, I will put this to a vote now, quite arbitrarily  3 to 7 for M1, 7 to 11 for M2,  4-1/4 to 5 percent for the federal funds rate range, and the midpoint to be interpreted by the Desk  in the light of our very illuminating discussion and the monetary aggregates directive    Well, Mr Holmes, you’re on the spot    Any quarrels with Mr Holmes?    I think that the [proposal would be for a] range of 4-1/4 to 5, with  the Desk to interpret the discussion that has taken place in this room, the Desk being managed by  men of high intelligence and great integrity  I don’t think we ought to go beyond that--give them  just the illusion of a little flexibility and a little authority  We are ready for the vote  Would you  be good enough to call the roll    Well, I think we’ve done all that we can   END OF MEETING         "
299,1977-02-15,"  Good morning gentlemen  I was just about to apologize for being  late, and I am sorry, but I had a breakfast meeting and I couldn’t get away on time  But a  colleague of ours suggested that this might be a 10-minute meeting, and in view of his wise  pronouncement, I am not going to apologize  But I am sorry to be late     As you all know, we have planned a luncheon to honor one of our colleagues, Lyle  Gramley, who has left the Federal Reserve but has not left this city     We will begin this meeting in executive session with a report by Mr O’Connell, who will  recommend to the Committee that the FOMC agree that the meetings of the FOMC are not  covered by the [Government in the] Sunshine Act     Now, just a word of introduction  This is the finding by Mr O’Connell, and he has done  very extensive research on the subject  His conclusion is firm  I have been keenly aware of the  fact that this conclusion, if adopted by the Committee, could cause us some difficulty on Capitol  Hill because some members of the Congress interested in the Sunshine law apparently have been  under the impression that the FOMC is covered  And I’ve been a little concerned about the  finding by our counsel on the ground that some members of the Congress interested in this  subject might propose an amendment to the Sunshine law under which we might lose the two  amendments we want  We fought hard to win and we finally did win at the last session of the  Congress     And therefore I have discussed this subject with considerable care with Senator Ribicoff,  Senator Percy, Senator Chiles, Congressman Brooks, and Congressman Fascell, and I have also  talked this over at length with John Gardner of Common Cause  And as you may know, John  Gardner and his group played a very important role in getting this legislation enacted  I wanted  to make sure that this finding by our counsel is not interpreted, first, as a circumvention of law,  and second, that there will be or may not be a move in the Congress to amend the Sunshine Act   These conversations with the members of the Congress have gone well, and they understand the  position that Mr O’Connell has reached, which I am recommending that the Committee adopt   We don’t have any actual assurance that there will not be congressional action, but as of today I  have no reason to expect it  That’s all by way of introduction, and the floor is yours, Tom    Let me make an introductory comment and then turn the legal  question over to Mr O’Connell  All that we intend to release to the public is the statement of  policy described as attachment B rather than the lengthy legal opinion that has been developed  by Tom O’Connell  I think the legal opinion is a document to this Committee, and there is no  intention to release that  Tom would you be good enough to--    Yes, Mr Black    There is an additional comment  We’ve been advised by two of  the men whom I mentioned--very influential, greatly involved in this legislation--to put out such  a statement of policy    There are two supplementary observations that I would make   One is that the point that Tom has just made was made--Tom accompanied me to the  meetings--with the legislators, and Tom developed this legal point in great detail, and the  members of the Congress with whom we met were very much impressed by it  That is point  number one     Point number two, if the mood should develop within the Congress to amend the Sunshine  law on the grounds that here is a loophole, and the loophole ought to be closed--if a serious  move along these lines developed, then I might very well come before the Committee and  suggest that we take the step of declaring ourselves as coming under the law in spite of the legal  difficulties that Tom has mentioned  And that is simply something that may develop  As of  today, I don’t think that will develop in the Congress, but it may    Any other questions?  Well, if not, the recommendation by our  counsel is before the Committee, and I think we need to vote on it formally  Is there a motion to  approve?  The motion has been made and seconded  Is there any objection?   SPEAKER(?)  I would like to comment  I think it has been very thoughtfully researched,  and I think all of us recognize that  And I guess, even with that, in reading [the memorandum], I  was not overly impressed with taking that move  But I think your visits with the other people  have convinced me that maybe this is well and wise    Well, I have not been either, and I kept on pressing Tom  O’Connell on the point  Well, why not say that we are covered, since actually we are observing,  we can live under, the Sunshine [law]?  We’ve gone beyond the Sunshine law because the  Sunshine law would be satisfied if we merely kept detailed minutes  We not only keep detailed  minutes, we make them public  We make them public fairly promptly     I kept pushing Tom on that, and I reviewed this question in some detail, that is, through  Tom largely and with members of the Congress  And Tom’s legal reasons, I must say, carry  more weight with members of the Congress than they did with me, probably because they are  lawyers and I am not  I think the position recommended is probably the best position we can  take at this time     Any dissent from Mr O’Connell’s recommendation?  All right, the Committee will be  recorded as being unanimous on the point     While we are on these legal questions, let’s get through with item 3 on the agenda, the  Committee’s information rules--some technical points you want to call the Committee’s attention  to?    Are there any questions?  Does this require us to [unintelligible]  the Committee’s actions?   SPEAKER(?)  I move that we adopt the proposal   SPEAKER(?)  Seconded    Any questions?  All right, we will consider Mr O’Connell’s  interpretation and recommendation [to be] adopted     [End of executive session]   We now need to act on the minutes of the January meeting  Is there a motion to approve?  A motion has been made and probably very most inaudibly seconded  I hear no objections, and  therefore we move on to the report by Mr Holmes on foreign currency operations during the past  month    Thank you, Mr Holmes  Are there any questions?    Well, we haven’t made a commitment to that effect, have we?    Any other questions?  All right, a motion to confirm the  transactions of the foreign desk is now in order  Motion is made and seconded  Any dissents?   Very well, do you have any recommendations, Mr Holmes?    Well, no one will object to that  We will now ask for  consideration of the economic outlook  Mr Zeisel, will you be good enough to report to the  Committee    Thank you, Mr Zeisel, for your report, and we’d now like to hear  from members of the Committee I think it would be particularly helpful to have any views on  the economic outlook that diverge from the staff opinion expressed by Mr Zeisel    What was that?    I would add only this comment  I would expect that, before this  year is over, we’ll run through an inventory cycle, induced in part by weather developments,  induced in part by the Administration’s fiscal package with its emphasis on the so-called rebate   And therefore I believe that all of us should pay far closer attention to final sales as the year  unfolds rather than to a couple of GNP figures  Mr Baughman, please    That’s what I always hear from bankers--they won’t make  mistakes in the future    Well, I was thinking of commercial bankers  I have no difficulty  with your generalization     2/15/77 - 10 -            Thank you, Mr Baughman  Mr Kimbrel now, please    I am surprised by your reference to construction     2/15/77 - 11 -            Where wages of some construction workers are or have been  below the present minimum of $230?    That is interesting  I didn’t realize that    Even so, it isn’t--any facts that you may be able to present on that,  I for one would like very much to see [them]  That surprises me     Any other questions, Mr Kimbrel?  Thank you  Mr Winn now, please    We didn’t get much of a multiplier effect last time    All right  Mr Morris, please     2/15/77 - 12 -            Mr Zeisel, am I right in thinking that the staff, in considering the  longer-run trend of the economy, is now thinking of a rate of growth, over the long term, of 3-1/2  percent for real GNP for a year, in contrast to the figure that has become standard in the  literature--4 percent?    Recognizing the flattening out of the trend of productivity--    --so, without being able to specify the details, a 6 percent rate of  growth this year, let us say, merging into a 3-1/2 percent figure over the longer run, assuming a  reasonable development of the economy  Is that the correct statement?    --to accomplish that--well, that is to say, 6 percent growth or  something higher than 3-1/2 percent    Any further questions along these lines?    I would agree with that  The overall figure, I think, has always  been historically deceptive because of variations among industries in rate of utilization and  variations among firms within individual industries  And an overall figure of even 85 percent is  consistent with developments as they have been historically, and I see no reason a priori to  assume anything very different this time  An overall figure of 85 percent has been consistent  with bottlenecks scattered through the system--individual firms and industries  Mr Eastburn  now, please    I hope you’re right, Mr Zeisel  Mr Wallich    You know, they’re also old dimensions  One is, raw materials  prices have been advancing; they started rising at the very beginning of 1975 once again  And  historically, wholesale prices have moved upward starting at the very beginning of an economic  recovery--a few months before, at the time, [and] one or two or three months later  And this  historical pattern by now is being superimposed by a long-run inflationary trend of our economy   And therefore I hope our staff is right in this projection as to prices, but my own [projection] is  less optimistic  Mr Balles now, please    Thank you, Mr Balles  Mr Partee, please    I agree in substance with what our staff has indicated and [with]  Mr Partee’s pronouncement on the general outlook of the economy  I think the outlook is good,  but I think I should report to the Committee that my own conversations with businessmen and  business economists recently [have] suggested to me that there is a somewhat uneasy mood  within the business community, as I sense it  There is an uneasiness about the possibility of  price controls  There is uneasiness about the Administration’s fiscal policy and where it may be  going  There is uneasiness about the energy outlook  There is uneasiness about inflation, and  that is interfering with judgments about capital expansion  And there is uneasiness also about  foreign developments  And this mood of uneasiness, if I read it correctly, is a little stronger than  it was a month or two ago  Mr Coldwell, please    Thank you, Mr Coldwell  Mr Winn now, please    Yes  And partly as an expression of their uneasiness, and partly as  a cause of it     Any other question or comment?    Mr Balles, please    I think it’s a little hard--as far as I’m concerned, I don’t know  what I will do, period    Any other questions or comments on the economic outlook?    Please do, Mr Gardner    Yes, Mr Mayo, please    Any other question or comment?  Well, if not, let us move quickly  to Mr Sternlight’s report on operations at the domestic Desk    Thank you, Mr Sternlight  Any questions or comments?  Yes,  Mr Wallich    I think Mr Wallich’s question does raise a question for the  Treasury as to debt management policy in the months ahead, and this is something that our  financial staff should pay very careful attention to    Thank you, Mr Eastburn  Any other questions or comments?   Yes, Mr Black    I think Mr Black was directing his question to the assets, is that  correct?    About mortgage interest rates, is that what you had in mind?    Any other question or comments?  Very well, we’ll break for  coffee now and we will be back in about 15 minutes   [Coffee break]    Mr Wallich, please    You know, I think we have to be very cautious in approaching this  question on the basis of historical perspective  I think it’s fair to ask how did velocity behave in  the past in the third year of a business cycle expansion  And that is the question that is being  discussed and answered around the table  But I think that one ought to take into account the fact  that we had a lull in the economy, a pause, a reacceleration--and from a certain point of view, a  new expansion, you see, is getting under way, and one can therefore, from that point of view,  regard it as being more nearly comparable to the first year of expansion  I think the truth is  somewhere in between  And one has to look at it from both points of view in order to get a fair  reading of what history can tell us    No, this would be an average of 6 percent for the year, which is  not high for the first year of business cycle expansion on the average  Now, next, one has to take  into account the changes in financial technology  I’ll tell you how I read this table  I didn’t go  back to any historical records at all, I didn’t have the time, and I start with a 3 percent secular  rate of growth  I make an allowance for a high rate of growth during a normal business cycle  expansion  That gives me, say, another 1 percent, so I’m up to 4  I make some allowance for  this being a reacceleration, that gets me up to 4-1/2 or 5  I make some allowance for changes in  financial technology and I get to 6, and therefore, I’m not too unhappy with this figure     2/15/77 - 26 -            More unusual if you go back to 1960 and stop there  If you go  further back, it’s a different picture    I have not done any    Mr Kimbrel, please    Yes, Mr Volcker, please    There’s only one way to do this  Since you don’t know what  people will do, and since ’75 experience may or may not be repeated--history has a way of  springing surprises on all of us--I would submit to this Committee a series of estimates based on  varying assumptions  And my advice to the Committee at that time will be to allow for a very  significant margin of error in any of these estimates as [we give] our directions to the Desk at  that time    We don’t want that  The point I’m trying to stress is, don’t give us  a single estimate    --give us a series of estimates    All right any other questions?   Let’s turn to our discussion of monetary policy, and at the end of that discussion we will  consider Governor Partee’s memorandum     I find myself in a tranquil mood today  Alternative B--considering the state of the  economy, the state of markets--that seems entirely satisfactory to me  I commented earlier on  elements of uneasiness within the business community that I believe I have detected during the  past month or two  The sources of the uneasiness, one can guess about; there’s very little we can  do about that, I believe, but there’s one contribution we can make and that is to recognize the  nervousness that has existed in financial markets  And I see no reason for departing from the  federal funds rate objective that we’ve pursued with very little change here in the past few  months  And that is my suggestion to the Committee  And now let’s hear from members of the  Committee  Who would like to speak first?  Mr Volcker, please     That’s where we are now; 4-5/8 to [4-3/4]     You know, under our rules, if that should happen, then the Desk  would communicate with the Chairman promptly, and he in turn would get in touch with the  Committee and take actions that are appropriate     All right, thank you, Mr Volcker  Mr Black now, please     Thank you, Mr Black  Mr Coldwell now, please     Thank you, Mr Coldwell  Mr Kimbrel now, please     Thank you, Mr Kimbrel  Mr Partee now, please     Thank you, Mr Partee  Mr Mayo now, please     Thank you Mr Mayo  Mr Jackson now, please     Thank you, Mr Jackson  Mr Lilly     Thank you, Mr Lilly  Mr Wallich      2/15/77 - 33 -            Thank you, Mr Wallich  Mr Eastburn now, please     Thank you, Mr Eastburn  Who would like to speak next please?   Yes, Mr Van Nice     Thank you, Mr Van Nice  Mr Guffey now     Thank you, Mr Guffey  Mr Balles now     Thank you, Mr Balles  And who would want to speak now?  Mr  Gardner, please     Thank you, Mr Gardner  Mr Winn now, please     Thank you, Mr Winn  Yes, Mr Morris     Thank you, Mr Morris  Mr Baughman     Mr Roos, you have the opportunity to pronounce the benediction     Thank you  You know, without going through the expressed  opinion meticulously, but having listened very carefully to the views expressed around this table,  I would like to make the following proposal  that we vote on a monetary aggregates directive;  that we specify a range of 3 to 7 for Ml; a range of 6-1/2 to 10-1/2 for M2; and a range of 4-1/4  to 5 per cent for the federal funds rate  Is there any unhappiness around the table if I put this set  of suggestions to a vote?      Where it is now, yes  It’s off-centered toward the higher end   Well, I don’t hear any shriek of horror, and therefore would you be good enough to call the roll     All right, let’s turn to item 7 on the agenda, the memorandum from  Governor Partee reporting on the thinking of [his sub]committee as to the precise form of our  domestic policy directive     This was put before the Committee, oh, two months ago, and a question was raised at that  time by Governor Jackson, and I thought that that question ought to be explored by our general  counsel before we proceeded to vote on it  Our general counsel has not found any difficulty   Since that time, there have been some very minor changes made by Governor Partee and  members of this Committee  And as far as I could see, the recommendation is one that I, for one,  can support  Mr Partee, would you like to comment on this?     May I make this suggestion  that we consider first of all the main  thrust of the memorandum by Mr Partee and then discuss further to the extent that we may wish  to do so the verbal changes that Governor Wallich has suggested?     Is there any difficulty with the main recommendation , that is, spelling out these ranges of  ours in the policy record?  Any difficulty with the main recommendation?     But actually, all of these numbers now--     --now appear in the monthly policy record     Well, what is the thinking of other members of the Committee?     Well, Mr Morris, at this particular point you’ve stepped outside of  your own realm of expertise  You had better listen to our counsel as to what--     --as to what a court would or would not permit us  Mr O’Connell     All right, thank you, Mr O’Connell  Mr Jackson     Well, you see, these specifications are now reported in the policy  record, and what we’re really talking about is the inclusion of these specifications in the  directive to the New York Reserve Bank as well  Which means, as far as the monthly policy  record is concerned, these numbers would be reported twice instead of just once, as is the case  now  But if you take the instruction to the New York Desk--and I think this was the main point  that the [sub]committee worked on--it’s a fuller statement and more honest statement as to what  the New York Desk is instructed to carry out  Is that correct?     Yes, but we don’t specify the numbers     Mr Lilly     No     That is exactly what we would release     Yes      2/15/77 - 40 -            Yes it is  I just checked that  It was reported in the last policy  record     It’s at 4-5/8 to 4-3/4     Well, at least I’ve been very precise that we shouldn’t  This was  released February 10     Oh, I’m sorry Yes, but this has been approved by the Committee    Well, I honestly don’t see that, because the policy record contains  the numerical specifications now, and that particular sheet is a piece of a working paper for the  Committee  I don’t think we’re vulnerable     The advantage I see is that when you segregate and look solely at the instructions to the  New York Desk at the present time, those instructions are incomplete  And the substance of the  Partee [sub]committee recommendation is that the instruction to the New York Desk as we  publish them be made complete  And that requires specification of the numbers  These numbers  are reported now in the policy record, released after approximately one month     I don’t see--I considered that very carefully, and at a certain time I  was a little opposed and seeing some possible difficulty  And my next objection was that it was  simply repetition--why do we have to say the same thing twice?  But I finally--my present  position is that there is a slight advantage in saying it twice, in [the] sense that [our] instruction  to the New York Desk, looked at separately, is more complete     To the extent that that is a difficulty, we lived with that difficulty  for some time thus far without trouble or embarrassment, you see, because that is contained in  the policy record now, and has been for some time     Any further discussion desired?  Let’s have just a show of hands   Members of the Committee in favor of the Partee [sub]committee recommendation, would they  kindly raise their hands  Those opposed  The majority is clearly in favor  We don’t need a  formal vote on this     I think we should     We still have an opportunity--one that we’ve delayed time and again--to act on the report  of our [sub]committee which has considered [public] agency [securities]     Sorry, I overlooked that  Now, as for the changes in language  which Mr Wallich has recommended, I share the sentiments expressed by Governor Partee  I  have resisted the word “target”  I never use it because it can lead to misinterpretation  And your  main point, Mr Wallich, namely the need to accent the attention that we give to the monetary  aggregates, I don’t think that you would advance that any by using the word “target”     You take the testimony that we have given before the Banking Committees  We’ve  accented the monetary ranges, our objectives with regard to the growth of various monetary  aggregates  That has been the main thrust of that testimony  And I don’t really think that it   would be advanced any by having the word “target” as a modifier of range     But what is the sentiment of the Committee?  Those in favor of having the word “target,”  kindly raise their hands  Well, there is no strong sentiment at the present time, but with your  usual eloquence, Henry, in time you may possibly persuade the members of the Committee       2/15/77 - 42 -           Let’s turn to the report of our subcommittee on [public] agency [securities]  Mr Volcker  served as the chairman of that group  Mr Volcker, would you be good enough to report     I have one concern about this rule  I would love to see the Metro  Washington issue now in our portfolio, I’d like to see us get rid of that, and for a very obvious  reason  [The presence of] this [asset in our portfolio] is dug up by individual Congressmen, and  they come forward with the argument  “Now you have supported and rendered financial  assistance to the City of Washington  You bought their securities  Why don’t you buy the  securities of New York City, and why are you discriminating against New York?”  How much  do you hold, Alan?     Sell these to the Federal Financing Bank?     Why not do the unusual thing--get them to buy it?     Give it to them  Sell it to them at a market price     I must say my main interest in the work of your subcommittee was  in getting rid of the DC issues     That will have very little influence, I think, on congressional  opinion, but maybe municipal finances from this point on will be handled so wisely, so prudently  around the country that this problem will not arise     Well, then, are we ready to thank Mr Volcker and his  [sub]committee?  Is there anyone among us who is unwilling to thank Mr Volcker?     Let’s think about further instructions to the [sub]committee  I’d  like to have that before me, and we will think about that later  For the present, I think this is a  good report, and is there any feeling on the part of the Committee that the recommendation not  be carried out?  Well, I’m instructed by the Committee to thank you for--     Any questions?  Gentlemen we are three minutes late   END OF MEETING         "
326,1977-03-15,"  Gentlemen, we are ready to start our meeting  As you probably  recall, we hold an organization meeting in March of every year, and there is a slate of officers  which somehow has emerged, and I’ll ask Mr Broida to read the names of individuals on that  slate  And after the names have been read, we will be ready for a revolution if one member of  this Committee is in the mood to start it  Mr Broida    Now you have heard the names of the officers as read by Mr  Broida  These are suggestions for the Committee, and any other suggestions or set of  suggestions will be entertained by the Chair at this moment  And Mr Lilly is going to start the  revolution    The motion has been made and it has been seconded  And now  ready for discussion  Any other nominations, any dissents?  All in favor will kindly say aye   ALL  Aye    Any opposed?  Next, we need to designate one of our Federal  Reserve Banks to handle the System Open Market Account  And there is another opportunity to  start a revolution  Now, the suggestion has been that the New York Bank might continue to  perform this function  Is there a motion to that effect?   SPEAKER(?)  So moved    Motion has been made and inaudibly seconded  Any dissent?     Very well, now that we know who will handle the System Open Market Account, or which  [Reserve] Bank will handle it, we have to decide on the individuals who will perform the  necessary functions  And we need to select a Manager of the System Open Market Account, a  function presently performed by Mr Holmes  We need to select a Deputy Manager for     3/15/77 - 2 -           Domestic Operations, and the present incumbent is Mr Sternlight  And we finally need to  appoint a Deputy Manager for Foreign Operations, and this function is handled by Mr Pardee   And revolution so far has not taken place; here is your final opportunity to start a revolution   Any suggestion for a change in the officialdom?    SPEAKER(?)  [Unintelligible]    SPEAKER(?)  Seconded    Motion has been made very audibly that Messrs Holmes,  Sternlight, and Pardee be reappointed    We have no such indication known, but we can proceed and make  our decision, and then the individuals involved can make theirs  And if there is any dissent?  I  hear none     And now we need to act on the minutes on the February meeting  Is there a motion to  approve?   SPEAKER(?)  So moved    Motion has been made and probably seconded  And not hearing  any objections, we will turn to Mr Holmes’s report on the foreign currency outlook    Thank you  I am a little puzzled by the attitude of the Swiss  National Bank  Why did they intervene?  Why didn’t they let the Swiss franc decline?  They  have been worried for some time      What’s wrong with that?    I’m still puzzled    Well, I have been wondering about that     3/15/77 - 3 -            Any other questions about Mr Holmes’s report?  If not, is there a  motion to approve transactions of the Desk?    I take it the motion has been made, seconded; I hear no dissent   Do you have any recommendations, Mr Holmes?     3/15/77 - 4 -            All right, we’ll turn now to the domestic economy  Mr Zeisel    Thank you very much, Mr Zeisel  We will hear now from  members of the Committee  Mr Black, please    Are you sure of that?    I’d like to see the full evidence    I thought it was running around 7    Well, you know, none of this as far as I know has been planned  even remotely, but it does put the Administration in an ideal political position  As far as the  expansionists are concerned, the Administration could point to its fiscal package, and here is a  policy for stimulating our economy by manipulating the budget  As far as the conservatives are  concerned, who believe that the spending is much too high and the budget deficit is much too  large--then one could point to the shortfall  Here the planned expenditure is not being realized,  and all kinds of economies one way or another are accumulating  I’d hate to argue the  Administration’s position in the Congress, in view of the shortfall at the present time, but people  I’ve talked to just don’t know why [it’s] happening     Now last year, Mr Ford was blamed on the ground that he was seeking to curb  expenditures  Well, Mr Ford isn’t around to be blamed any longer  And now the finger of  blame is pointing to a multiplicity of agencies, which one way or another are not doing their job- -their job being to spend and keep on spending     3/15/77 - 6 -            I think it is    Yes, Mr Balles, please    Yes, Mr Roos    All right  Mr Baughman, may we hear from you now     3/15/77 - 8 -            Well, it’s clear that Texas is doing well  [Does] any member of  our group differ at all basically from Mr Zeisel’s exposition?    Well, currently the two staffs diverge, and my own thinking is  very close to the thinking of our staff, but as far as the fiscal package is concerned, I don’t think  it is going to make any difference one way or another as far as the real economy goes  But  whatever positive influence comes from a little larger spending will be offset by higher interest  rates and inflation fears  So there are differences between our staffs, and I am not sure to what     3/15/77 - 9 -           degree they are attributable to differences in estimates of what the fiscal package is going to do   And my reason for making this statement is that I think it’s a little dangerous to assume that the  fiscal package will necessarily prove beneficial to any degree  In any case, there is a contrary  view, and I have just voiced it  Any other opinions?  Yes, Mr Volcker    Thank you, Mr Volcker  Mr Lilly now, please    Well, next  Mr Eastburn, please    Because prices would be rising?    I have a note before me from a member of our staff which reads  “many chemical prices are scheduled to be raised in the second quarter”  What the basis for that  report is, I don’t know    Well, I thank you, Mr Eastburn  Mr Partee, please     3/15/77 - 11 -            You say you do not?    I would like to amplify Governor Partee’s comments on prices  In  the past four months, the price of cocoa has risen 40 percent, the price of coffee 82 percent, the  price of orange juice 66 percent, soybeans 27 percent  An average for metals prices is up 17  percent, hides and rubber prices average up 17-1/2 percent, lumber and plywood prices up 11 to  12 percent, fuel oil and gasoline up 8-1/2 percent  The increases have been rather large and  spreading    To what degree are businessmen concerned or somewhat nervous  about the prospect of governmental controls over prices?  Do you hear much about that?     Mr Winn, we are ready to hear from you now, please    You mean total outlay on buildings?    Are you talking about the residential?    Well, I have been getting a good deal of mail from apparently  lower-income people who are only semiliterate but who know that the substantial increase in  congressional salaries has recently occurred, and they are quite bitter about that  More bitter  mail like that than I have seen in quite a long time    Oh, there have been many, oh yes, though some blame the Federal  Reserve Board for not stopping the increase in congressional salaries  Governor Wallich, please    Well, I do want to say a word about the macro side  For the past  twelve months, M2 has risen by 10-1/2 percent and M3 by 12-1/2 percent  These figures hardly  suggest a policy of strong monetary restraint  On the fiscal side, we are continuing to run large  deficits, and the prospect is that these deficits will increase  And that undoubtedly is not only [a]  situation [of] so much more money being put into the pockets of people than is being withdrawn  from the pockets of people, but [it] is having [a] large psychological effect on our people across  the land  Yes,  Mr Partee    Mr Morris, please    Steve, to what extent are your flow of funds projections integrated  with your overall economic projections?    Well, does that mean that your flow of funds projections are  revised every month?    I don’t see them    Well, yes, I certainly want to see them  I was under the  impression that you do that once a year and then you stop    Let me start with them    [Unintelligible] our excellent staff has a way of hoarding  treasures    And these flow of funds projections have been revised, but about  the same time when the GNP, etcetera, projections were revised?    You can say, using National Bureau [of Economic Research]  chronology, that we will soon be entering the third year of a business cycle expansion  But you  can also say that a new expansion started in the month of October  Now, I think business cycle  analysis has to be flexible, and while the National Bureau scheme has great virtue--I couldn’t say  anything else--in our own thinking about developments in the economy, we have to use that  along with other judgments or other ways of looking at the economy    All right  Mr Guffey, please    Mr Roos    Thank you, Mr Roos  Mr Mayo, please    Well, I haven’t said a word about velocity  But I believe members  of the Committee know my basic thinking  Interest rates play a role  But the predominant factor  in changes in velocity is not the rate of interest but the state of confidence  And if those of us  who believe that confidence is improving turn out to be right, it’s a pretty good prospect that  velocity will rise, will be at a quite high level  Mr Partee    Any other comment on the overall economic situation and  prospects?  I think it would be helpful to have a show of hands on the part of members of the  Committee on your judgments about the economic prospect  If you feel that our staff projection  is more or less in the ballpark, as far as the real economy is concerned, will the members of the  Committee be good enough to raise their hands?    Thank you very much  I asked for that show of hands for a very  definite reason  We now have a monthly detailed report of Committee deliberations, which is  made public  And our staff has to [write it] on the basis of what is said at this table, and not  enough has been said about the general economic outlook  And to aid our staff on that very  critical point, I asked for a show of hands    Well, you’ve made that comment before, and I supported you, but  I was thinking really of the--    --pattern, not the average for the year rather than the pattern  All  right now, would anyone else like to speak?  If not, this is as good a time as any to break for  coffee   [Coffee break]    Mr Black?  Please    Well, I think our staff estimate will satisfy everyone because it  will not present a single point estimate, it will present several estimates  I was just talking to Mr  Axilrod, and I think he had in mind presenting three sets of estimates; each set of estimates will  cover several months, and I suggested that he might not stop at three [but] go beyond that  So  that the range of uncertainty will be fully reflected and all that will be before the Board in due  course    Now, that is very good, as I understand  It really means that  we’ve been so wise in not becoming the dominant factor of market increase  If we had been,  you’d see some market reaction    I hear no other question or comment  Now the time has come for  a motion to confirm transactions of the Desk  Is there such a motion?   SPEAKER(?)  So moved    Motion has been made and seconded  I hear no dissent    All right, any other questions?  Mr Wallich, please    Slow growth in inventories in the second quarter?    Yes, I understand the first, not the second    You’re reporting the thinking of an economist    Any other questions or comments?  If not, we are ready for the  discussion on monetary policy  Gentlemen, I am inclined to think that we don’t have a very  difficult job today  Having said that, I will say no more, for a while anyway  Who would like to  speak first, at somewhat greater length but not excessively?    Thank you, Mr Volcker  I would pretty much endorse what Mr  Volcker has stated  And it might possibly focus our discussion a little better if I suggested some  numerical specifications for the Committee to shoot at one way or another     I would suggest that we adopt a range of 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 for M1, 7 to 11 for M2, and stay  where we are for the federal funds rate range and also [for] the slightly fuzzy midpoint between  4-5/8 and 4-3/4  Mr Coldwell, may we hear from you next    Thank you, Mr Coldwell  Mr Black, please    All right, thank you, Mr Black  Mr Eastburn, please    Your first number you meant 4-5/8 to 4-3/4, and the second you  meant 4-5/8 to 4-7/8?    Thank you, Mr Eastburn  Mr Kimbrel now, please    Thank you, Mr Kimbrel  Mr Mayo, we will hear from you    Thank you, Mr Mayo  Mr Guffey    Thank you, Mr Guffey  Mr Baughman now, please    Thank you, Mr Baughman  Mr Partee next, please    Thank you, Mr Partee  Mr Wallich now, please    Thank you, Mr Wallich  Mr Jackson now, please    Thank you, Mr Jackson  Mr Winn is after you    Well, as far as the bump in the money supply is concerned, I think  we will have to make our estimates  They could be wrong, and we should accommodate the  bump that we estimate  Then if it turns out that the rate of growth greatly exceeds our estimate,  we will have to recognize that and counter it, but if it’s within the range of our estimate, we  ought to leave it alone  And we can always make mistakes  Now take our figure for M1 for the  month of February, we started out with an estimate of--how much, Steve?    All right, 6-1/2--we’re down to 8/10 of 1 percent  Well, we made  a mistake in 1975  I think we should be a little more careful this time than we were in 1975 and  not take our staff projections quite as literally as we tended to at that time  But apart from that, if  the figures come in very much above our estimate, we’ll have to deal with it and recognize it  I  don’t see what else we can do     I do think that, in view of the uncertainties--and I think Mr Eastburn expressed that very  well--we ought to be very cautious about any anticipatory movement that we make  And we’re  capable of responding--and responding quite promptly--without anticipating these very short-run  adjustments     Well, there’s one other point that I have not mentioned before, but I think it’s something  on the side of strategy that is of importance to my mind  We’ve had a period of virtual stability  in the federal funds rate for some three months  We didn’t plan it that way  And we were ready  to move one way or another depending on how the aggregates came in  But in view of the     3/15/77 - 31 -           behavior of the aggregates, the Desk did not move at all appreciably  Now I think this three- month experience has proved most instructive, and it has helped me enormously in dealing with  members of the Congress and others  Now there’s only one interest rate over which we have a  high degree of influence, and that is the federal funds rate  That rate for some three months has  been virtually constant  In the meantime, our other interest rates, short-term rates, market rates,  and, more particularly, longer-term interest rates, have moved up, and moved up very  appreciably  Well, now, the Federal Reserve has not played any role, except in so far as the  market may have expected us to continue moving down, as we were for a time, and we stopped  doing so  And the response of market rates has been greatest in the particular maturities where  the Treasury has concentrated its borrowing, and that has spread out over the medium-term and  long-term market     And the very fact that the one interest rate that we virtually control has stood still for three  months, while other market interest rates have shown very considerable movement, has served a  very important educational purpose in my dealing with members of Congress who think that we  control interest rates  The New York Times thinks that; many people think that; but we don’t     So this is a consideration in my own mind--there ought to be a clear reason for moving,  and if there isn’t, since what we’re talking about are minute changes, really, I’d be inclined to  stay with pretty much where we are on the federal funds rate  And we still have a range to move  down or move up [in], depending on the behavior of the aggregates  We’ll, I’ve talked too long   Mr Balles, please    The next time around will be next week  And the Senate Budget  Committee wants to go into these very questions, very closely  And the testimony I think will  deal with that--that is, the prepared statement, quite apart from the oral questioning, which is  going to be intensive in this area  And it may be a good thing    Thank you, Mr Balles  As far as public psychology is concerned,  I just want to add one more observation  There was a feeling, rather widespread within the  Congress, at least, that we deliberately set out to frustrate the will of the Congress in connection  with the tax rebates in 1975  And I think that this is a question that I will have to address very  specifically before that committee  Mr Morris now, please    Thank you, Mr Morris  Mr Lilly now, please    Thank you, Mr Lilly  And we haven’t heard from several  members of our family  Who would like to speak next?  Yes, Mr Van Nice, please    Thank you, Mr Van Nice  And we’ll hear from Mr Gardner next     3/15/77 - 33 -            Thank you, Mr Gardner  Mr Roos, would you like to speak now?    Thank you, Mr Roos  Well, then, I think that on the basis of the  opinions that have been conveyed by members of the [Committee], I’m quite ready to make a  recommendation to the Committee for a vote, which I think will express the consensus pretty  closely  Such differences as exist among us are very minor  And very few members of the  Committee have expressed a view on the language of the directive, but I would assume we are  not going to depart at all appreciably from our decision last month that the monetary aggregates  directive should be retained     And therefore, I suggest that we vote on the following  monetary aggregates directive; an  M1 rate of growth of 4-1/2 to 8-1/2; an M2 range of 7 to 11 percent; a federal funds range of  4-1/4 to 5-1/4 percent, but with a midpoint of 4-5/8 to 4-3/4, where we happen to be at the  present time  Now if there is no dissent or no comment, and I hear none, I’ll ask the Secretary to  call the roll    All right  Then we have a few matters of business that we need to  take up, and let us turn to item 9 on the agenda, which deals with the authority of the Desk to  lend securities from our account  Mr Sternlight, would you good enough to comment on--    Any comment?  Any dissent from the recommendation?    All right, any other comment?  Any objection to permitting the  Desk to function as it has been functioning in this area?  I hear none     Let’s turn to item 11 on the agenda, the Authorization for [Domestic Open Market]  Operations  No changes are being proposed by the staff  Do members of the Committee wish to  propose any change?  Apparently not     Let us proceed then to item 12, and there we need to review, once again, certain  authorizations  First, the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations; next, the Foreign     3/15/77 - 35 -           Currency Directive; and next, the Procedural Instructions  And I hope that is clear  And finally,  a special authorization which I hope is superlatively clear     Now, the first question, do members of the Committee seek clarification of these  categories to just what is involved?  I hear no such requests  No changes proposed by the staff   Do members of the Committee wish to propose a change or raise any questions?  The members  of the Committee are singularly acquiescent on these matters, which must mean that we’re doing  things just right     And we have finally an item that I was hoping we would never get to, but the hour permits  it  But if we can’t solve this problem in the next ten minutes, I suggest that we postpone further  deliberations on it  And that’s the report of the Subcommittee on Bankers’ Acceptances  That  report has been made available  And Governor Gardner is prepared to advise us    Well, thank you very much for your report and for the work that  you’ve done in connection with it  Does the Committee want to discuss?  There are several  recommendations, Mr Kimbrel you have a--     Mr Mayo, please, and then Mr Coldwell    Mr Coldwell, please    I have no difficulty with the report of the [sub]committee, but I do  have a question on one point, and that is, let me read paragraph [unintelligible] on page 8 of the  [sub]committee’s report  “The FOMC also may want to consider the term prime as applied to  acceptances described in the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations  In the view  of the account management, with which we would concur, the Desk should be guided by prudent  investment principles and credit standards”  So far, so good; I have no question     But then I do have a question about what follows  “but should not feel obliged to  automatically refuse to execute a repurchase agreement against the bank’s acceptance because it  received some information which may raise a question about the financial stature of the  accepting bank”  And then it goes on, “the word prime should be used to describe acceptances  of banks which are known to have confidence in the field of acceptance financing and  acceptances which have established a reputation for freely trading in the market”  I think that  there’s a touch of ambiguity here  I may be visualizing a difficulty that doesn’t exist  I think the  Desk ought to accept the judgment of the market    Well, it’s not the way I interpreted Mr Gardner’s--Mr Gardner  left an opening for the Desk to use its judgment    But at that point the Desk--here is my warning--the Desk should  not act on its authority    If there is a question that the Desk has about a particular bank,  then before it takes any action which deviates from market judgment, it should consult promptly  with the Committee  Unless that is done--unless there is such consultation, the possibility of real  trouble--    I know  I think that’s good    Any other question or comment?  Yes, Mr Volcker    Well, I sense an attitude of acceptance of the subcommittee’s  report  Am I interpreting the Committee’s thinking correctly?  Well, we can take a formal vote   Any dissent?  There is none  Then the Committee’s unanimous  And we haven’t done badly   It’s only 5 minutes after one   END OF MEETING         "
350,1977-04-19,"  Good morning, gentlemen, we will get our meeting under way  President Balles is home and unable to attend--he’s ill, but mildly  And his first vice president, a  similar situation, so that San Francisco, one part of our country, is eliminated for this meeting, I  am sorry to say  However, we are very glad to welcome you, Mr Willes, to this meeting   You’ve been a member of our family for a long time, and we are very glad to have you seated  and have you participate in our meeting  The fact is that we all wish you well in your new  position     Now, Tom O’Connell is going to report to us on two of the lawsuits that we are involved  in     The significant thing about all that is the date--that means that this  is still alive I was hoping it had died by now    Oh yes  Let’s be more specific  If any one of you [receives such a  request], or if a request goes to any of our Reserve Banks, please advise Mr O’Connell  promptly     Any other questions or comments pertaining to the lawsuits?  All  right, thank you, Mr O’Connell, and we now proceed       4/19/77 - 3 -           A motion to approve, if we so desire, the minutes of the March meeting--such a motion  would be in order    SPEAKER(?)  So moved   SPEAKER(?)  Seconded    The motion is before you to approve the minutes; the motion has  been seconded  I hear no dissent  Let’s turn to Mr Pardee     By what points has the yen appreciated over the past months     Any questions or comments on Mr Pardee’s report?  Well, thank  you, Mr Pardee  A motion to approve all the good deeds of the foreign Desk?   SPEAKER(?)  So moved    Motion has been made   SPEAKER(?)  Seconded     Motion has been made, and I think it’s been seconded  Do you  have any recommendation?  Thank you very much    We are ready now for your report, Mr Kichline    Well, thank you very much, Messrs Kichline and Zeisel  We are  ready now for the discussion of the economic and financial outlook  And I think that we  probably will need to spend more time on this subject today than we have in previous meetings   There’s a new development in the governmental sphere, as well as in the private economy   There is a change in the federal government’s fiscal policy; there is a new anti-inflation policy  announced by our President; and there is, perhaps most important of all, a new energy policy that  will be explicated by the President on Wednesday--there has been a good deal of comment on  this subject already in the press, and apparently much of what has been published in the Wall  Street Journal and elsewhere is approximately accurate  Who would like to speak first on the  economic outlook?  Mr Black, please    It is hard for me to believe that the original investment tax credit  proposal would make an appreciable influence in the market for capital equipment--the  difference of going from 10 percent to 12 percent, meaning a 2 percent difference in the price of  equipment in a world in which prices are advancing 68 percent annually  If I were making a  forecast myself, that would be one of the factors I would ignore because I would consider it so  very, very small relative to--    The major effect, one way or another, is the effect upon  confidence    Well, it would be too early to tell    Well, I find it easy to sort out    Mr Kimbrel, please    All right, thank you, Mr Kimbrel  Mr Eastburn, please    All right  Mr Mayo, please     4/19/77 - 6 -            Were you surprised by the housing report yesterday?    The reason for my question is that, if that figure had been  available, the staff might have raised slightly the estimates for residential construction    Thank you, Mr Mayo, for your questions  Mr Coldwell, please    All right, thank you, Mr Coldwell  Mr Jackson now, please    Do you expect to get it this year?    Which still seems to mean that lower sales may be expected next  year    All right, thanks Mr Jackson  Mr Baughman, please    I think the Administration spokesmen are no longer speaking quite  the same way      What was it before the revision?    This is all strikingly new to me, and I don’t know about these  revisions  At least I haven’t been informed, or if I have been, it may be one more paper lying on  my desk that I haven’t gotten to    Now the figures that Mr Baughman is referring to, are they  figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics?    I think it would be very helpful to have a full report on these  revisions  Well, this is all new to me  I interrupted you, Mr Baughman  Would you continue,  please?    No, I don’t think that’s the case, and when you are through,  Governor Gardner will comment on farm credit    Thank you, Mr Baughman  Would you, Mr Zeisel, want to  comment further on what Mr Baughman’s had to say about the farm figures and the like?    I think that would be a report that would be of great interest to all  members of the Committee, because regional variation would be brought out in such a report    Mr Gardner, you might want to comment on the farm credit  problem that has been brought to our attention, now that you’ve done some intensive work  recently    This applies to what state?    This applies to what state?    I take it that we’ve made it clear in the agricultural area, through  our regional [Reserve] Banks, that seasonal credits at the discount window are available, and that  we’re encouraging--that is, that’s my impression, that--    Have we liberalized sufficiently on seasonal credits?  Any view on  that?    Well, that raises the question about the validity of those criteria    Well, I think, Governor Gardner, you’ve been looking into this  problem  I think that you might well want to take steps to reexamine the seasonal borrowing  privilege and see if it cannot be usefully liberalized--this five-year formula obviously cannot  cope with the kind of situation that appears to be developing in some of the grain-growing states    Well, but this may possibly call for a conference of the discount  officers, particularly in the farm areas  There may not be sufficient sensitivity to our    regulations--     Maybe a question of attitude on the part of the discount officers    Well, I get the impression that this is something that ought to be  looked into, reexamined rather promptly  Well, I think this has been helpful  Let’s move to Mr  Partee now, please     4/19/77 - 17 -            When you say the flow of funds estimates are consistent with the  GNP estimates, you certainly cannot mean that, assuming the GNP projections, there’s one and  only one set of flow of funds estimates that is consistent with that, and that we have it on this  table  But you didn’t mean that  If you do, that’s a strange kind of--     All right, thank you  Mr Wallich    But you’re overlooking the very sharp turnaround that has  occurred in our foreign trade balance  And this is a drag on our economy  We not only have a  deficiency in business capital investment but also in our net foreign trade  And the outlook, at  least for this year, is for some further deterioration in this regard  So there are these two major  imbalances, if you take past cyclical expansions as a yard stick    I don’t know  Mr Reynolds, would you comment on that?    But from last year    All right, now, Mr Kichline for the second    I think your answer is very helpful, but it doesn’t deal sharply with  the question that Mr Wallich has put to you    Let me just elaborate for a minute  I want to make a suggestion   You were referring to the so-called Eickhoff phenomenon, and that is a very interesting piece of  analysis  And it calls for, I think, empirical study, and has the staff done that?    I think it would be extremely worthwhile to look into that with  very great care    I know, but I’m talking specifically about the so-called Eickhoff  phenomenon     4/19/77 - 21 -            I think it would be very instructive, as a part of that study, but as  an isolated part, to start with that theory and try to determine to what degree there is a good  empirical basis for it, to support the theory     Thank you, Mr Wallich  Mr Roos now, please    I’d like to comment on that a little  I don’t have much to say, but I  am troubled  If this meeting had been held a week ago, I would have made a very bullish  statement about the economy, and I have, fairly consistently for some time, with perhaps  renewed emphasis  The President’s renunciation of the rebates strengthened my judgment in that  regard  The anti-inflationary message went a little further in the same direction, even though the  strongest part of the anti-inflation message was not mentioned, the strongest part being the  dropping of the rebate itself  The very fact that the Administration has shifted its emphasis is, I  think, of very considerable significance  I would have said so [last week] and argued that point     But now we have the energy message coming along, and my impressions of that are poorly  formed, but I am deeply concerned about this energy message  It’s extremely complicated, and  therefore I think it will be very difficult to grasp what the proposals [will] come to,  intellectually--extremely difficult  Now, it will be difficult for members of the Congress, it  would be difficult for economists  And even if you assume that what the President proposes, that  Congress will accept--and that’s quite an assumption--I think we’ll be in the dark for some time   The economists will go to work, and some already have in the Council of Economic Advisers,  and they will make calculations, and they will tell you what the effect may be on real GNP and     4/19/77 - 22 -           on the price level  But I think they will also tell you that they’re very uncertain about the  validity, significance, degree of accuracy of all these calculations  I think that we’ll be going  through a period of very considerable confusion  A legislative proposal that consists of several  dozen different items, each of which raises numerous questions--I think it will be so difficult to  comprehend, that Congress will be at this for months  And there’s no way of telling where or  how the Congress will end up     Now there’s one thing that I know, or I think I know, about the legislative process  If you  come forward with something that is difficult, comprehensive, covers very many fronts-- members of the Congress are confused, and they don’t know what it comes to, just as the rest of  the population, including professional economists, will be confused  But secondly, when you  have such a comprehensive legislative proposal as this is going to be, different interest groups  will find something that is of great importance to them, which they will object to  And then you  may well have a coalition, an accidental coalition, in opposition to the proposal, and what may  come of all of this, I find no way of knowing  My present impression is that the great element of  uncertainty will be the immediate result of the Presidential message on energy and that this will  be a negative influence on economic activity  I, for one, cannot as of today make the bullish  pronouncement that I would have made a week ago, or a few days ago     I was briefed yesterday on the message in very general terms, and what I learned raised  dozens of questions in my own mind  Now, in saying all this, I don’t mean to be critical of the  President, the Administration, the energy message  The purpose, I think, is profoundly right, that  this country has a very serious problem, and I think the President is courageous in attending to it   Whether he’s going at it in the right way or not I think is a fair question  And all that I can add is  that when you try to bring up the oil price to the world level in a series of steps, [unintelligible]  one will be effective upon passage  When you have numerous provisions designed to speed the  conversion of industrial facilities and public utility operations to conversion from oil and natural  gas to coal, when you impose a new gasoline tax, when you impose a tax on automobile guzzlers  along with some rebate scheme on purchase of small cars, and when you do a dozen other things  of lesser significance, you’re releasing forces--I’m repeating myself   Our staff will get busy to analyze this, and after our staff is through, I can predict that our  staff will say what economic staffs generally say about all these things--there will be a small  effect on real GNP and a small effect on the price level, and I won’t believe a word of it  And  that’s where I am as of today  Confused  Gladdened because the President is speaking out on  the subject  Confused by the economic effects that may be invoked    I’m told that the article that appears in the Wall Street Journal is  more or less right, but of course, some changes have taken place, and other changes may take  place within the next two days  Well, the President will be addressing the Congress, I believe,  tomorrow evening, and then the legislation will be sent up a week later, when further changes  will take place  But the shape is more or less determined     4/19/77 - 23 -            If I were to make a judgment at this time, and it’s obviously  premature, it would be that the effect on economic activity would be negative; and the effect on  prices will be negative in the sense of prices moving higher  But I’m not ready to make a  judgment    No it doesn’t    Well, I would not describe that as working through the price  mechanism; I certainly would not  I would say “work through the price mechanism” if you leave  things pretty much to the market and leave taxes and rebates pretty much alone    That I’m not sure of, by that I’m not implying any criticism  I was  just getting the terminology here    I--   SPEAKER(?)  It’s a manipulation of prices    Well, that’s exactly what happened  You have a coalition  defeating the Financial Institutions Act  And the coalition consisted of commercial banks, to  some degree the S&Ls, the homebuilders, the AFL-CIO, the Federal Reserve--    SPEAKER(?)  Strange bedfellows    And I think it was very similar because nobody really understood  the Financial Institutions Act    But, individual interest groups, not excluding the Federal Reserve,  understood specific parts of it, or they thought they did    I think that’s a valid comment, yes, but I personally would say that  with less emphasis with respect to the Financial Institutions Act  My own reaction to the Hunt  Commission Report was, I couldn’t understand it because it had so many recommendations  I  could grasp 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, but when you have 100 recommendations, it is beyond my intellectual  grasp    Any other comments on the economy?  Well, it’s almost 11, and  therefore it’s time for a coffee break   [Coffee break]    Gentlemen, as I think you know, we will have to testify on our 12- month monetary ranges on May 3, 1977, and therefore we need to deliberate today on setting the  ranges for the next 12 months  In view of the uncertainty connected with the energy problem,  there is a chance that we may possibly want to reconsider before the testimony is given, in which  event we will have a telephone conference on the subject  I have no way of judging the  probability of that, but we must keep ourselves in a flexible position     Now I have asked Mr Broida to distribute the memorandum that he prepared  That  memorandum should have been distributed earlier  I had given Mr Broida a very simple  assignment, and that assignment was designed for my own instruction, and I didn’t have the  opportunity to read it before this weekend  And after reading it, I found that Mr Broida had  gone beyond my initial instructions, very wisely  And I thought it was such an instructive  document that it would be helpful to all members of the Committee  It’s too bad it reached you  so late, but the fault there is mine     Now, let me say a few words, and I don’t want to repeat what is in Mr Broida’s  memorandum  But let me say only that we embarked on our 12-month--let me use the term  “target,” though I try to avoid that in public utterances, and it’s perhaps a little easier to say  targets now and then instead of ranges  We embarked on this new approach just two years ago   And during that period, we have lowered the midpoint of M1 from 6-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent, and  the midpoint of M2 from 9-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent, and the midpoint of M3 from 11 to 10 percent   During that period, the actual growth rates have not diminished, and as we examine M1 alone for  the past 12 months, the growth rate is higher than for any other 12-month period, starting with     4/19/77 - 25 -           April 1975  For M2 and M3, we’re almost at the peak as well  Now I don’t consider that a  failure on the part of the Committee  We set ranges very deliberately, and we wanted flexibility,  and I would draw the following conclusion, only--that those critics of ours who feel that we’ve  not been liberal enough, the record hardly justifies that  And perhaps, on the other hand, the  praise that we’ve gotten from many on the kind of monetary policy we’ve pursued--we deserve  neither the criticism nor the praise that we’ve gotten  That’s my own appraisal     Mr Broida points out, and I have said this previously, that at the pace that we’ve been  going, it will take something like 10 years to get the monetary growth rates down to a level that  is, or appears to be, reasonably consistent with general price stability  And it would be  excessively optimistic to believe that we will necessarily keep to anything like this pace, because  over the next 10 years we will surely have moments of hesitation when we’ll not make any  adjustments  And there may be periods of recession  It would be surprising if we didn’t have  one or more recessions over the next 10 years, and during such a period, we are not likely to  lower our monetary growth ranges  The good thing about our procedure is that we at least have  a goal  We’ve set a goal for ourselves  We’ve moved in the direction of that goal, though  perhaps we’ve moved rather slowly, and that is argued     Now, before I learned about the energy message that would be forthcoming, and this was  late in the afternoon yesterday, I was still struggling between two choices that I was going to put  before the Committee, or rather I was still struggling between two choices and hadn’t yet made  up my mind firmly, and I expected to do that before this morning  And the two routes I was  struggling with were as follows  first, to lower the lower limit of the growth range of M1 by 1/2  percentage point, and second, to lower the upper limit of the growth range of M2 and M3 by a  full percentage point  I am sorry--no, the second was to lower both the upper limits and the  lower limits of M2 and M3 by 1/2 percentage point  Now in view of what I have learned about  the energy message and the uncertainty that that introduces to my own mind, I am inclined to  make a much milder recommendation to the Committee  I think that we should make another  small move toward reducing our monetary growth ranges today  But I think the move should be  small indeed, and of the kind that would arouse a minimum of controversy [that would add] to  the uncertainty that is likely to prevail     And therefore my recommendation to the Committee, without arguing the case at the  moment, would be to lower the upper limit of M2 and M3 by 1/2 percentage point [and] leave  M1 unchanged--do nothing about the lower limit of M2 and M3, but simply lower the upper  limit by a half percentage point  That is a minimum adjustment  We would still be working  most gradually toward the objective of bringing the monetary growth rates down so that in time  they will be consistent with general price stability  Now, one argument that I would make in this  direction for making some small move, is that it is entirely consistent with what the President has  stated, [unintelligible] bringing the inflation rate down by something like 2 percentage points by  the end of 1979     Well, that’s all I want to say at this time, and the question before us, these decisions, are  never easy  There is never a good time to lower the monetary growth ranges, yet unless we work  at it, at least just a little, I don’t see much future for straightening out our economy and for     4/19/77 - 26 -           helping to set a standard for much of the rest of the world, which is continuing to suffer from the  ravages of inflation     Who would like to be first?  Mr Mayo, please    Thank you, Mr Mayo  Yes, Mr Roos    Yes, please    Thank you, Mr Roos  Mr Partee, please    Thank you, Mr Partee  Mr Volcker, please    Well, the one good thing about that message--there are two good  things about that  First, that there was such a message concerned with the inflation problem,  never mind this specific program  The second good thing about it is that the President indicated  that it would be the objective of the Administration to reduce the inflation rate and bring it down  to 4 percent by 1979 or the end of 1979  Now, these two things are of some significance  The  specific program, well, the less said about that, perhaps the better    Fortunately, the decision, whatever decision we take, will not be  announced until May 3rd, and both the business and political community has a way of  remembering only what happened yesterday or during the preceding week  So there will be a  little distance between the two    Well, I think that’s a good a way of describing it  Thank you, Mr  Volcker  Mr Coldwell, please    Thank you, Mr Coldwell  Mr Guffey now, please    That’s the very recent past; that’s not the long-range record, I  believe  Mr Axilrod, what are the facts?    M2 and M3 recently have exploded    Well, but M3 and M2, there are indications of their slowing down    That is, the rise in market rates would tend to bring M3 and M2  down    But that’s already under way--under way not so much because of  the rise in interest rates but because of a feeling on the part of thrift institutions and, to some  degree, commercial banks that they are flooded with money and they are no longer advertising as  they had for their certificates of deposit  Some are no longer issuing the longer-term certificates,  the passbook rate here and there has been lowered, they have been moving like that--am I right?    Without arguing the point, I just want to be clear about my own  suggestion to the Committee  I had struggled and struggled with the idea of bringing the lower  limit of M1 down and might well have made that suggestion to the Committee  But learning  about the energy message, my present suggestion to the Committee is to leave M1 alone     Thank you, Mr Guffey  Mr Lilly now, please    I would say, in view of the Committee’s recent practice of  assigning approximately equal weight to M1 and M2, that lowering the one or the other, either at  the lower end or the upper end, we are making a move in that direction  Now, whether the  magnitude is sufficient or not, or more than sufficient, is another question  But it would be a  move in the direction of the President’s goal    Thank you, Mr Lilly  Mr Kimbrel, please    Thank you, Mr Kimbrel  Mr Jackson now, please    Thank you, Mr Jackson  Mr Willes now, please    Thank you, Mr Willes  Mr Wallich now, please    Thank you, Mr Wallich  We’ll hear next from Mr Black    Thank you, Mr Black  Mr Morris now, please    Thank you very much, Mr Morris  Mr Eastburn, please    Thank you, Mr Eastburn  Mr Baughman, please    Thank you, Mr Baughman  Mr Winn now, please    Thank you, Mr Winn  Mr Gardner now, please    Well, all members of the Committee in attendance have now  expressed their views about the lower range in targets, and before I jump to summarize and make  a suggestion to the Committee, would any member of the Committee perhaps want to say an  additional word at this time?  Mr Volcker     4/19/77 - 37 -            Well, it’s really too early for me to speak on the subject  My  guess is that the energy message will tend to slow down business capital investments  Or more  accurately that, as a result of the message, some projects that are now being discussed within the  business community, and where business managers, boards of directors, are on the margin and  might well have [gone] forward, [they] will continue to hesitate  And possibly some who have  crossed the margin, [but] not by much, may reconsider     As for prices, the longer-range effect I think will unquestionably tend to raise prices  And  I see no escape from that, but I don’t think that will happen for this calendar year  But these are  impressions  They’re not judgments at all, they are intuitive opinions and don’t deserve any  significant weight on the part of the Committee  Would anyone else like to speak?    Any other opinion or comment?  If not, one conclusion is very  clear, and that is that the Committee is nearly unanimous in believing that some reduction  somewhere in our monetary growth ranges is indicated to be proper, appropriate at this time   The Committee is nearly unanimous on that, the consensus is quite clear  Now, otherwise, a  range of views have been expressed, and a clear majority of the Committee is in favor of leaving  M1 alone at this time, a thin majority is in favor of lowering the upper limit of M2 by 1/2  percentage point, and as far as M3 is concerned, one-half of our membership is in favor of  lowering the upper limit of M3 by 1/2 percentage point, and the other half are at opposite ends,  wanting to lower it more, or both ends, or leaving it unchanged     And in view of the opinions or judgments that have been expressed, I think I’m justified in  putting the following to a vote at the present time  namely that the M1 range be retained at 4-1/2  to 6-1/2 percent; the M2 range be lowered at the upper end by 1/2 percentage point, namely 7 to     4/19/77 - 38 -           9-1/2; and the upper end of the range for M3 be likewise lowered by 1/2 percentage point  And  unless there are questions or comments, I will now call on the Secretary for a vote    Well, we still have time to do a little more formal business, and I  shall now call on Mr Sternlight to report on operations of the Desk    Thank you, Mr Sternlight  Any questions for Mr Sternlight?    Any other question or comment?  If not, a motion to ratify action  that the Desk [has taken would be] appropriate   SPEAKER(?)  I so move it    The motion has been made and seconded; I hear no objection   We’re ready for you, Mr Axilrod    I see    Thank you, Mr Axilrod  Any questions for Mr Axilrod?    Yes, Mr Morris    Any other questions?    Why doesn’t that make sense to you?    Any other question or comment?     Gentlemen, we still have to make our decision with regard to our two-month ranges and  the domestic policy directive  The clock is not supposed to be accurate  What is the time?   Well, at 6 minutes to 1 there is a chance that if we stayed until 130 we could finish this meeting   Now what is the sentiment of the Committee?  Is it to break now or try to finish our  deliberations, and we may or may not succeed?     4/19/77 - 41 -           SPEAKER(?)  Let’s go ahead and finish    Let’s go ahead  Is that the sentiment?  Well, let’s try  In the  interest of preventing pangs of hunger on the part of members of the Committee--that would be a  short-run misfortune, but still a misfortune--in the interest of preventing that, let me make a  suggestion to the Committee  By and large, I find alternative B attractive  I would recommend  only a somewhat narrower federal funds range--namely 4-1/2 to 5-1/4, with an asymmetrical  midpoint, namely 4-3/4--for the time being, and then the Desk to move as it normally does  according to our procedure  Who would like to speak first?  Mr Coldwell    The difference between us is very small really  In view of my  suggestion of an asymmetrical midpoint, the 4-1/4 strikes me as unrealistic  That is, we’re not  going to get down to 4-1/4--that played some role in my own thinking  Well, let me not  elaborate, but move on  Mr Partee    Well, we function under a rule which requires that  We might  want to modify it, but that is the rule    That came toward the very end of the intermeeting period  Mr  Jackson     4/19/77 - 42 -            Well, it’s arithmetically possible  Mr Volcker    I don’t know what May looks like    All right  Mr Eastburn, please    Thank you, Mr Eastburn  Mr Mayo, please    Thank you, Mr Mayo  Mr Black, please    I’m lost    Page 3 How would you have that read?    These are really very, very subtle nuances    Well, we’ll come back to the language later on  Thank you, Mr  Black  Now Mr Kimbrel, please    Thank you, Mr Kimbrel  Who would like to speak next?  Mr  Guffey    Thank you, Mr Guffey  Mr Wallich now, please    Thank you, Mr Wallich  Who would like to speak now?    Thank you, Mr Gardner  Yes, Mr Morris    Thank you, Mr Morris  Mr Willes, please    The hour is conducive to that sentiment    You’re casting aspersions on the air of Philadelphia, and I don’t  think it’s being fair    All right  Who would like to speak now?  Yes, Mr Baughman    Thank you, Mr Baughman  Mr Roos, please    Thank you, Mr Roos  Mr Lilly, please    Thank you, Mr Lilly    Well, I think that there was a rough consensus within the  Committee in favor of a range of 6 to 10 for M1, 8 to 12 for M2, and 4-1/2 to 5-1/4 for the  federal funds rate  A rough consensus further for an asymmetrical midpoint of the federal funds  rate, that is at 4-3/4  I believe also that not everyone has expressed himself on the directive  I  believe that those who have expressed themselves are in favor of a monetary aggregates  directive  There is a question of language that Mr Black suggested previously, and if you’d be  good enough to repeat once again your suggestion, Mr Black, with regard to lines 46 and 47    Would you accept the language “approaching or moving beyond  the limits”?    Well, let’s have first a show of hands on the language as it stands,  on lines 46 and 47, by members of the Committee    Now let’s have a show of hands on Mr Black’s suggested  language, paying no attention at this point to my suggested modification of the suggested  language  Let’s have a show of hands    Let’s have a show of hands on Mr Black’s suggested language   Now let’s have a show of hands on my modification of that, and that doesn’t mean I’m endorsing  it  I’m simply trying to determine the Committee’s thinking  Then it would read “if it appears  the growth rates over the two-month period are approaching or moving beyond the limits of the  indicated ranges”  Let’s have a show of hands on that    If it adds to confusion, yes    It narrows --     Gentlemen, I think we’re ready for a vote to employ the monetary  aggregate directive, to leave the language as the staff has worded it, to have a range for M1 of 6  to 10, for M2 of 8 to 12, and for the federal funds rate 4-1/2 to 5-1/4, with an asymmetrical  midpoint at 4-3/4     4/19/77 - 48 -            I hope the Manager will not be surprised by it  We do have  difficulties at times    The standard language is something you’ve lived with for a long  time, and therefore you have--    I think we’re ready for a vote, unless members of the Committee  want to discuss the matter further  Apparently not  Would you be good enough to call the roll?    Well, the final item on the agenda is the date of the next meeting,  and I take it we’re confirming it, and therefore we’ve beaten our own time and we’re ready to  adjourn   END OF MEETING        "
379,1977-05-17,"  A motion to approve the minutes of the April 19 meeting will now  be in order   SPEAKER(?)  So moved    Any objection to that?  We pass now to Mr Holmes’s report on  foreign currency operations    Thank you, Mr Holmes  Are there any questions?  I hear none  A  motion to approve the transactions on foreign currencies would now be in order   SPEAKER(?)  So moved   SPEAKER(?)  Second    Do you have any recommendations, Mr Holmes?    All right, then we will turn to Mr Kichline now  May we have  your report, Mr Kichline    Thank you, Mr Kichline  Now, we are ready for such views as  members of the Committee may have on the state of the economy or such questions as they may  wish  Mr Mayo, please      Thank you, Mr Mayo  Mr Winn, please    All right  Thank you, Mr Winn  Mr Willes, please    All right  Mr Baughman now, please    Thank you, Mr Baughman  Would you--yes, Mr Balles    These are very disturbing comments  I am not too aware of the  speculation and things going on in California  Which banks are involved in the second  mortgages?    Does our staff know anything about this?    I think I would want to see the figures to see whether it is or isn’t   I think we need to gather evidence, and I think our staff should look into this very promptly     Why aren’t these mortgages refinanced?  Why a second mortgage  at 12 percent instead of a first mortgage at 8-3/4 or 9?     Well, I continue to think that this is a disturbing development   When you can pick up a piece of real estate at one price today and sell it at a profit the next day  or the next week, you’ve got a real estate boom that can’t last  And the world has had a great  deal of experience with that, and I’ve lived through more than one real estate cycle like that    Well, the last two years have been characterized, by and large, by  remarkable [unintelligible] from excesses and speculation  This is the first significant sign that I  have heard of and I’d like to see this watched very carefully  And I think that [in any] study that  our staff may be undertaking, it would be very useful to comment on this phenomenon in the real  estate market, urban and rural, that we have just been discussing, to comment on that in the  Redbook  And who’s responsible for the Redbook, Mr Kichline?    Will you make sure that whoever is responsible gets on top of it  promptly, and next month we will get reports through the Redbook on this alleged phenomenon    Mr Black, may we hear from you now?    When I read that table, I was disturbed by exactly the same point   Then I consulted the table on page 12, which seemed to contain a reassuring answer--that is, you  find that, according to the latest McGraw-Hill survey, expenditures--plant and equipment  expenditures [for] electric utilities are scheduled, if these figures can be trusted, to go up by 21  percent, and for gas utilities by 34 percent, and you find a sharp increase in the estimates  prepared in February for those occurring two months later  So it looks like an aberration     I think this is something that should be looked into  There are  margins of uncertainty throughout    All right  Mr Partee now, please    All right, we will hear from Mr Wallich now, please     5/17/77 - 11 -            An old one with new life    As I remember that period, you had a decline in automobile  production, and that was accompanied by a decline in homebuilding, and those economists who  look upon those two industries as dominating the economy were crying, “We must have a  depression, it’s coming immediately”  Eventually they were right, but we had a considerable  period of expansion with these two factors of the economy moving down and other factors  compensating for that decline     I wonder if it’s inventories  I wonder if inventories are the  reconciling factor or the expenditures on services      You and I are not on the same track  Go on, just elucidate your  thought    Well, Mr Eastburn    You sound like a very discouraging lot  We seem to be looking  for trouble  Speculating about possible sources of trouble  Why don’t we look for possible  sources of price stability, possible sources of encouraging, balanced economic growth?  Mr  Kimbrel, perhaps you’ll supply that function      Thank you, Mr Kimbrel  Mr Volcker, please    Let me just say a word about the staff Chances are that members  of the staff have thought of many of the uncertainties that have been mentioned around the table,  but they don’t know how to translate that into numbers over time, so they have a smooth--    If I may say--add another word--I have the feeling that this is true  of much of mankind--it’s certainly true of this Committee today--we do a constant amount of  worrying  We don’t have real problems to worry about, but we’ll still worry, and we will create  problems    Perhaps the only word that I can add to this discussion is that, we  are having, I think, a very normal expansion  That’s all that I see, with all the  uncertainties--prices accelerating, and there will continue to be surprises--but I see nothing  abnormal about the expansion so far       5/17/77 - 16 -           The one disturbing thing that I’ve heard was what Mr Balles developed, the facts that he  presented, and then Mr Mayo, Mr Roos, about farm real estate values  That’s something that  doesn’t develop on a significant scale in every business cycle expansion  And when it does, yes,  it will go for a while, but it carries the seeds of trouble, and therefore, we will have to watch that  carefully  Who else would like to speak now on the state of the economy?    Well, I hate to join the questioners and doubters, but I have to at  this point  Not so long ago the Administration made a proposal to its Congress, namely that  business firms be granted a tax credit in the amount of 4 percent of their payments on account of     5/17/77 - 17 -           the Social Security tax, and this measure was described as an employment stimulating measure   This was a minuscule reduction of taxes for business firms, and that minuscule reduction was  designed to increase employment  And now we have a massive increase in taxes on employers  proposed by the Administration, and not a word is said about the effect that that may have on  employment    That hardly improves the thinking process that is going on in this  area    You know, if I were a businessman today, I think I would be  bewildered  Here you have something called an energy policy, and this energy policy contains  the most massive tax bill ever presented to Congress  With taxes running up, money being taken  out of one set of pocketbooks in the amount of perhaps $70 billion per year by 1985, and the  money going elsewhere--it isn’t at all clear into which pocketbooks that money would go  And  also the Social Security tax and the rebate one day and down the next day     I think I’d be a little confused, and as a businessman, I think what I want--and Dave, I’m  looking at you to refute or confirm what I’m saying--I think I could live with a tax gain within  broad limits, aggressive, encouraging, mild--but I need stability  I’m not getting much stability  in the area or I’m thinking about the tax area and I think I would find that very disturbing if I  were a practicing businessman  Am I making sense?    All right, thank you  Mr Guffey, you will now speak    Gentlemen, I think this is a very good time to stop our discussion  on the state of the economy  Mr Sternlight, would you like to report on operations of the Desk?    We’ll continue our deliberations and go along with Mr Axilrod’s  statement  Mr Axilrod    Thank you, Mr Axilrod  We are ready now to discuss the reports  by Mr Sternlight and by Mr Axilrod  Mr Coldwell?    All right  Mr Partee next, please    All right  Mr Black, please    All right  Mr Eastburn now, please    All right  Mr Jackson now, please     5/17/77 - 22 -            All right  Mr Balles next, please    Any other question or comment?  Well, if not we still need to act  on the activities carried out at the Domestic Desk  Is there a motion to approve the transactions  of the Desk   SPEAKER(?)  So moved    The motion has been made and, I take it, approved  We’re ready  now to turn to monetary policy and our domestic policy directive  I think in some ways our task  today is an easy one, and in other ways it’s somewhat puzzling  I think our decision last month  was certainly in the right direction, and I think it’s been carried out well at the Desk  And we’re  in a stronger position than we were a month ago     But when I look at the several alternatives for M1 on page 5 of the Bluebook, I’m a little  puzzled  Take for example, the figures under alternative B  Well, now, suppose that the rate of  growth for the May-June interval of M1 was as low as 1 percent  Then, to be consistent with  that, as indicated in this tabular construction, the federal funds rate would need to be 4-3/4  percent  I think it would be a great mistake to move down from the present level--which is, I  think, a little closer to 5-3/8 than it is to 5-1/4--back to 4-3/4, if we had 1 percent [growth of  M1]  I’d say the same if we had a figure of zero  I’d say the same if we had a figure of minus 1  or minus 2  At some point, I would stop saying this, but you see what I’m getting at  We ought  to be willing to tolerate an extremely low rate of growth over this two-month interval without  having the federal funds rate decline at all appreciably     Now, that leads me to feel that the lower limit of the federal funds rate ought to be 5  percent, or preferably 5-1/4 percent  And that we might have a narrow range for the federal  funds rate, say 5-1/4 to 5-3/4 percent--the Desk staying at the present level, and then moving to  one direction or another within that narrow range, depending on how the rate of growth of the  monetary aggregates develops     Now as for the rate of growth of the monetary aggregates, I think I would prefer the figures  under alternative C more than the figures under alternative B  Actually, the figures that I would  suggest that the Committee consider are as follows  zero to 4 percent for M1, 3 to 7 percent for  M2, and perhaps 5-1/4 to 5-3/4 percent for the federal funds rate  There may well be  inconsistencies that we would need to consider, either through a special telegram from the     5/17/77 - 24 -           Chairman or through a telephone conference  Well, let’s hear from members of the Committee   Mr Coldwell, please    For purposes of clarification, I made some introductory comments  first and then suggested some numerical specifications  Taking my numerical specifications, you  see--zero to 4 for M1, for example--if a negative figure for M1 developed, and assuming that  there was no counterindication arising from M2, then an inconsistency would emerge that would  call for special action by the Committee  All right, let’s hear from Mr Willes first now, please      Well, that must have been [a matter] of financial stringency--we  don’t have more money to give you  Now, to the extent that business firms are in the same  position, they can hold out also against large wage demands, but you need a little adversity to  produce that result    No, if--let’s take, just for purposes of illustration, a range of  growth of M1 of zero to 4 And let’s ignore the fact, for purposes of this illustration, that the  Desk gives equal weight to M1 and M2  Then, as 4 was approached, the Desk would be moving  the federal funds rate toward the upper limit of 5-3/4    All right, Mr Willes  Mr Eastburn now, please    Well, you say it would imply a significant decline for June  If  May, I think our staff in that event would be revising the figure for June Isn’t that correct?    I expressed a personal attitude, and that personal attitude was not  translated into a numerical specification that I suggested to the Committee    All right, thank you, Mr Eastburn  Mr Partee now, please    What harm did we do?    Do you think we did much harm, significant harm, in ’75 or ’76?   You know, we reversed rather quickly    Oh, in other words, you prefer not to make a mistake    Sure is      Well, I would certainly join you in considering pretty carefully   Mr Jackson, please, now    Thank you, Mr Jackson  Mr Black now, please    Thank you, Mr Black  Mr Morris now, please    No, I would use the federal funds rate range in the normal fashion,  and the federal funds rate now is closer to 5-3/8 than it is to 5-1/4--that’s my understanding  And  I would leave it where it is for a week or so, and then depending on how our estimates of the  monetary aggregates come in, move within the indicated range  But the [center point of the]  indicated range that I suggested is asymmetrical    I would go even further to say that the fact that we moved that  early in 1975 gave reassurance to the business and financial community    Thank you, Mr Morris  Mr Balles now, please    Thank you, Mr Balles  Mr Winn now, please    Thank you, Mr Winn  Mr Kimbrel now, please    Thank you, Mr Kimbrel  Mr Wallich now, please     5/17/77 - 31 -            That is, ahead according to Otto Eckstein    Thank you, Mr Wallich  Mr Gardner now, please    Thank you, Mr Gardner  Mr Lilly now, please    All right, thank you, Mr Lilly  Mr Mayo now, please     Thank you, Mr Mayo  Mr Volcker now, please    Thank you, Mr Volcker    I am having a little difficulty hearing you, Mr Baughman     Thank you, Mr Baughman  Mr Guffey, we haven’t heard from  you yet    Thank you, Mr Guffey  And we will hear from you, Mr Roos    I’d like to pick up where you left off and say a word about  cemeteries  I think cemeteries should be used more extensively than they are  They could serve  a novel purpose, namely to bury economic forecasts  Now where we were about three months  ago or so, and the Administration came forward with a fiscal package, the Administration made     5/17/77 - 35 -           its forecast for the economy  Well, since then, the President has withdrawn his recommendation  for a rebate, and federal expenditures are $10 billion lower than had been estimated, and the  economy is now just about where the estimators thought it might be at the end of the year     Now all this proves that we’ve put so much emphasis on changes in fiscal and monetary  policies, and we tend still to ignore the great momentum that our private economy is capable of  carrying through on its own  And I think this has a bearing on today’s discussion  I still have to  review the sentiments and the views expressed by members of the Committee, but as I listened to  members of the Committee, I thought we were all saying pretty much the same thing  But I  guess there were differences  The differences were all over the lot  But the differences were  within an extremely narrow range and a range that is of no significance at all relative to the  errors that we keep on making and that we don’t know how to improve upon  And now, if you  will just forgive me, I want to study these minutiae and give my best report on it     Gentlemen, I could take a great deal of your time and my time  summarizing these figures, and, if you will permit me, I will not do that but simply make a  suggestion to the Committee that I think comes close to summarizing the central tendency of the  Committee’s thinking  I would suggest we vote on the following  A monetary aggregates  directive on an M1 range of zero to 4, on an M2 range of 3-1/2 to 7-1/2, on a federal funds rate  range of 5-1/4 to 5-3/4 with the midpoint of 5-3/8, a figure that is to be approached within the  next few days--the Desk is very close to it     That is my suggestion to the Committee  I think it expresses the tendency of the narrow  ranges within the Committee’s thinking during this 3-1/2 hour meeting  Are there any questions  or comments?   SPEAKER(?)  Could we take a vote on money market versus aggregates?    Yes, let’s do that  Let’s have a show of hands on monetary   Those that prefer a monetary aggregates directive, raise their hands, please    Do you mean to say we can’t even count hands?    Good  Any other questions or comments?  If not, will the  Secretary be good enough to call the roll    Anything else we have to do today?    Well, I think the date is set  We will go to lunch punctually, and  we will have three members of the staff with us  We are going to discuss the legislation with  regard to NOW accounts and paying interest on reserve requirements  I hope all of you can  come, because this is a matter of great importance to the System    END OF MEETING         "
400,1977-05-27,"  Good morning, gentlemen  This is Arthur Burns speaking  Can  you all hear me?     5/27/77 - 2 -      SEVERAL  Yes, indeed    Good  A technical problem has arisen from the ruling handed  down by the IRS  It relates to certain types of transactions conducted by our New York [Federal  Reserve] Bank  The matter is rather technical; it’s been gone into rather carefully by President  Volcker, by [Federal Reserve Board] Vice Chairman Gardner, and by Tom O’Connell, as well as  by other members of our staff here in Washington     The essential issue, I take it, can be stated rather simply by Mr Volcker, and I think it  would be well if we got this meeting under way with a statement by Mr Volcker  I’ll not be  present at this entire meeting  I think I know the kind of issue this is and the suggestion that will  be made by Mr Volcker  I don’t profess to understand the technicalities of this problem and  can’t be at all helpful to the group on it  But I will be here for the opening part     And now, if this is satisfactory to all those who are participating in this conference call,  let’s proceed with your statement, Paul, if you are ready      May I, at this point, suggest that Governor Wallich, who has an  urgent appointment, might speak at this time and indicate his views  But just before I turn the  microphone over to Governor Wallich, let me ask the participants of this conference a question   Have you all received a letter from Senator Proxmire with regard to income velocity?   SEVERAL  Yes, I have    What’s that?    Well, such a letter has been sent out  Let me merely say that the  chances are that, one way or another, we will communicate with the Bank Presidents on that  issue sometime next week  At this point let me turn the microphone over to Governor Wallich   "
415,1977-06-21,"  Gentlemen, we are starting a bit earlier, and the reason is that I  will have to leave this meeting at about 1215  I would hope that we could get through with the  monetary policy directive by that time; and without interrupting members of the Committee or  interfering with the flow of thought, I hope that we can accomplish that  In the interest of trying  to accomplish that, I am going to defer the discussion of foreign currency operations until later  on in the meeting, and also the special problem that has arisen in connection with foreign  accounts, repurchase agreements  These two matters could be taken up readily in my absence     Also, I’m scheduling an informal meeting--meeting is hardly the word, really--Tom  O’Connell will have the right word for it  You know, [in] these days of the [Government in the]  Sunshine Act, I’m at a loss for vocabulary--a new lexicon will have to be devised to fit Sunshine   In any case an informal discussion--or [an] informal something--is scheduled for 215 this  afternoon, and I hope as many of you as can do so will be present  Some recent correspondence  with members of the Congress will be discussed at that time, and also some legislative matters  on Capitol Hill that are of interest to the [Reserve] Bank Presidents will be discussed at that time   The meeting is of special significance for the Bank Presidents, but I hope that Board members  will also attend, because we belong to one family, and these are matters of a mutual concern   One or two matters, actually, I have not yet had an opportunity to discuss with my colleagues on  the [Federal Reserve] Board  So I hope the members of the Board could be there as well     Now, when I leave, Mr Volcker, the Vice Chairman of this Committee, will of course  preside     We need to act first of all on the minutes of the May meeting  Is there a motion to  approve?   SPEAKER(?)  Seconded    The motion has been made and seconded, and I take it there is no  objection  And we will pass now to the report on the state of the economy  Mr Zeisel, would  you be good enough to address the Committee?    Thank you, Mr Zeisel  The increase in rentals  I haven’t  followed those figures recently  What has the rise, and the average rise, in rentals been?    Of how much?    I somehow have the impression that the rise in rentals has been  below the rise in the consumer price index     Does anybody know?  We are all homeowners, and we don’t have  rental--    All right, any question or comment?  Yes, Mr Black?    All right  Mr Eastburn, please    Do you want to elaborate on that--the grounds for pessimism as  voiced at the meeting?    Now, wait now  When the retailer says that, I would interpret it to  mean that the increase between the first half of 1976 and the first half of 1977 is of a certain  magnitude and that he expects that the increase from the second half of 1976 to the second half  of 1977 will be of the same magnitude, which is that’s the way retailers tend to talk or tend to  think  Well, that is not necessarily a pessimistic statement--it doesn’t necessarily mean at all that  retail sales will be flat in the second half of this year    Can’t hear you    All right, thank you  Mr Balles now, please    All right, thank you, Mr Balles  Mr Partee now, please    Wholesale price of coffee has been coming down  But the retail  price has been below the wholesale    Therefore that can rise    Are going to limit or possibly prevent--    Yes, in that one factor    I don’t know what this debate is about  I’d like to have the  question clarified  Looking at the projections by our staff, the second quarter estimate on prices  is a 71 percent annual rate, and then the figure falls in the next two quarters to 58 percent      6/21/77 - 7 -          He was simply anticipating Mr Eastburn’s comment    I would join Mr Partee  I’m impressed by the decline that has  occurred in wholesale prices of food stuffs and industrial raw materials since mid-April--I wish I  understood it better--and that is a favorable development on the price front    Well, you say they haven’t yet  The figures that I have in mind on  wages that I try to follow relate not to average hourly earnings but to compensation per man- hour in the private nonfarm sector  The quarter-to-quarter fluctuations--these quarterly figures  are unreliable  I follow [the compensation data] on the basis of a moving 12-month period, and  what that shows is a steady acceleration over the past five quarters  Gradual, but without a  break  So the wage curve including fringe benefits, which the average hourly earnings figure  omits, does show acceleration      Yes, that may well be  The jump is largest in that quarter, Chuck,  and therefore, allowing for that, perhaps you still have the acceleration, though I’m not sure      Well, I don’t know whether it’s only fair or only necessary    I’d like to say a word about that  There are businessmen  complaining  And businessmen are complaining about the atmosphere of uncertainty in which  they live; and they don’t know what will happen to taxes, and don’t know what will happen to  our antipollution legislation, and don’t know what kind of energy bill Congress is going to write  eventually, and this undoubtedly is retarding business capital investment     At the same time, while businessmen are complaining all over the lot, their overt  actions--as expressed in orders for capital equipment, as expressed in appropriations for capital  expenditures, as expressed in plans for actual expenditures, as expressed in plans for actual  expenditures, the successive survey reports--do indicate increasing spending  And I would  interpret that to mean that optimism fundamentally is gradually gaining ground  There is a  return of optimism, but it’s much slower than one had any right to expect at this stage of the  business cycle, and particularly in view of the rate of utilization of capacity  According to our  index, we are up to 833 percent, and the peak was only 88 percent     Businessmen are complaining  They are paid good salaries--one of their functions is to  complain  They’re justifying the salaries that they earn partly by complaining  They have  reason to complain--I don’t question that  But I would not take that as an index of the  underlying attitude  Yes, I want to listen to them, and I do, plenty  I have taught myself to do  that  But I also watch what they actually do  And there I see, increasing slowly, a slow return of  confidence  That’s my reading    That’s interesting    What about New England?    I don’t know what goes into that equation, but I would have said,  and I still say, that objective factors, putting aside uncertainty about legislation, point to  increased capital investment      Well, maybe you do  Everyone has to speak for himself  I have  managed to get to my present age without paying much attention to what these equations have to  say  And I haven’t done too badly in judging the business situation  I see no reason for learning  these things at the present time  However, if our staff can teach me what they know or think they  know in an hour or so, I would be very glad to listen to them      Well, you talk to--    --yes, you talk to a lot of businessmen  You have been devoting a  good part of your energy [to that]  What is your sense of the thinking of the business  community?     6/21/77 - 10 -          Let me just interrupt for a second  The consumer price index has  just been released, and it shows an increase in the seasonally adjusted figure for May, of the  overall index, of 6 tenths of 1 percent  Yes    Well, that’s a very important observation [unintelligible], that the  high rate of inflation means a deterioration in business profits  And partly because of the  behavior of wages and raw materials prices, and partly because of our tax laws and our  accounting practices, businessmen in periods of inflation have to pay income taxes on phantom  profits  And they have learned that  And accounting is one of the most backward of our  professions  You know, there was a time when businessmen looked forward to a time of  inflation because they saw wages lagging, prices soaring, profit margins rising, the stock market  roaring, but things don’t work that way any longer  Businessmen now know it  And I think  that’s why they speak and think as they do on the subject of inflation  Mr Wallich, we want to  hear from you now     You know, I have not studied these figures on profits, but I am  surprised  Figures that I’ve seen indicate that, during the first and second quarters, the  improvement in profits has been negligible    And that surprises me, and I haven’t tried to analyze it  You have  these very sharp increases in physical volume of business activity, accompanied by virtually  stable profits      Well, the figures I’ve seen for the second quarter look remarkably  low    I think that an interpretation of these profits figures is very  important  That may help to explain the phenomenon that Mr Eastburn described in his area   The acceleration in inflation that you commented on may possibly be reflected in these profits  figures  And your estimates for profits later on in the year look remarkably high      Oh, yes    You have a very sharp increase in ’76, you know    All right, thank you, Mr Wallich  Mr Black now    All right, thank you, Mr Black  Mr Baughman now, please    To move what?    Lack of interest in expanding their operations?      What kind of construction projects?  Commercial--    What about large industrial construction?  Any of that?    Thank you, Mr Baughman  Mr Partee now, please     Also foreign trade       6/21/77 - 16 -          Thank you, Mr Partee  Mr Guffey now    Thank you, Mr Guffey  Mr Morris now    How do you interpret that, Frank?    You think this behavior of long-term interest rates reflects, in part,  confidence in the Federal Reserve’s policies?    Well, that’s been my own judgment, but it’s a hard thing to be sure  of    A little louder, please    You know, I think it would be a good idea for the staff to keep in  touch with John Dunlop and one of our own [Reserve Bank] directors, Arnie Weber  They are  probably the most astute students of the labor market that we have  And in judging wage trends,  I think it would be a good idea for you to talk to each of these two men once every few weeks     Thank you, Mr Morris  Mr Fossum, please      Thank you  Mr Coldwell now, please    All right, thank you, Mr Coldwell  Mr Lilly now    What is the status of that legislation?    Expected soon?      Who’s holding it up?  Do you know?  I haven’t been told    It might be a good idea to extend the thing    All right, thank you, Mr Lilly  Mr Winn now, please    Thank you for a very interesting report  Any questions of Mr  Meek?    Any other questions?  Well, thank you  And Mr Kichline, could  you introduce us to the Bluebook at present?    Thank you  I overlooked an action that is required on the  operations at the Domestic Desk that we need to approve if we are so inclined--what the Desk  has done during the past month    SPEAKER(?)  So moved    Motion has been made and actually seconded    I hear no questions or objections  All right, any question to Mr  Kichline?    All right, thank you, Mr Coldwell and Mr Kichline  Mr Morris  please    You have me as a supporter, at least tentatively  What is the  answer to Mr Morris?    Suppose you didn’t call it a seasonal?  Suppose you called it an  identifiable special factor that you are correcting for?      What’s that?  Well, not the amount, no      Isn’t this analogous to the kinds of adjustments our statisticians  have learned how to make in retail trade because of the shifting date of Easter?      I have sympathy for what Mr Morris has suggested, having  worked on problems of that sort, not recently, but over many years in the past  What I could say  in defense of the staff is that what they are allowing for, this exceptional factor, is not very large   And when you make your seasonal correction, the elements of uncertainty are parallel--[it] is  much larger than the allowance which they make; therefore, practically, I don’t know that it  makes too much difference      58 without this special Social Security factor  What is it with that  factor?    Gentlemen, I think you’ve heard me say time and again at this  table that 4 equals 8, and now we have 6 equaling 8  And I still would go with Mr Morris, I  think, but it’s not a factor of much consequence, really, practically, because of uncertainty in  measurements that surrounds our entire operation here     Well, but it’s spread out  The average effect on the month    And therefore the rate of change is--    All right, thank you  Mr Mayo    Let’s be careful; we are not talking about the explosion, we are  talking about--    We are talking about a difference between 58 and 82, and that is  well within the normal margin of error of the seasonal calculation    Well, that’s true, for the first week it will be very much bigger    The difference there is that it’s been done for years, and therefore  it’s a respectable procedure by now      I think we have to be very careful about that  A campaign is being  waged against the Federal Reserve now by some economic and statistical quacks  And for us to  discontinue the seasonal calculations would, I think, be a concession on our part, which I am not  ready to make at all--that the quacks who make a living out of quackery have suddenly become  prophets and valid interpreters of statistical procedures  I don’t think we ought to do that  I  think we ought to follow Mr Morris’s suggestion, or do what the staff is now doing, or  something in between  After all, there is some leeway here     If we follow staff procedures, some explanation of the numbers ought to be indicated in the  news release I would not suspend the seasonal calculation  What we ought to take up--and this  is not the day to do it--is the question of publication of these weekly figures  I will finally argue,  I think, that we ought to discontinue  These are sheer noise  We would have to take some heat  from the journalists and congressional people, but there has been enough discussion of that--the  unreliability over those figures--to justify our doing that  [But] let me not debate that issue  today      This is discontinuance permanently  I thought you were  suggesting for the one week    Well, no, I would--     6/21/77 - 28 -          I don’t see why you can’t  After all, we don’t publish daily  figures, thank God  We could do it, we’ve got them    Look, whether we win or lose a court test, you do the right thing in  this shop  But let’s not debate that issue today  Mr Balles, you had a question on the Bluebook     All right, thank you  Mr Willes, please    All right, we will hear from Mr Jackson and then break for coffee    Very good  We’ll take a break now, a brief break   [Coffee break]    Gentlemen, we have to resume our deliberations, and we want to  turn now to the policy directive, and let me just say a word about that--give my own views  We  embarked on some tightening; what we sought to achieve, I think we have achieved  There has  been a marked slowing down in the monetary aggregates  Also, while short-term interest rates  have risen, the long-term interest rates not only have not increased, they have actually declined      To a degree, I think, we have been lucky  To a degree, however, I think our action has  been very reassuring to the business and financial community  We have indicated that we do  have a firm policy for dealing with inflation and that we at least are discharging that  responsibility  And we are not going to let the monetary aggregates explode, and we’ll do our  job  And I think this has been comforting to the market and is perhaps partly responsible, to say  the least, for the behavior of long-term interest rates during the past three weeks       6/21/77 - 30 -         I would recommend to the Committee that we stand still  And alternative B looks good to  me  As far as the federal funds rate is concerned, I think I’d stay where we are, with a range of  5-1/4 to 5-3/4, and with an asymmetrical midpoint at 5-3/8  Now, I’ve had a discussion with the  staff about the Social Security factor  As I think you all know, the New York Bank holds a  weekly [press] conference on the meaning of the figures they put out  And this time, at the New  York Bank’s press conference, the point will be made quite sharply and very clearly that the  weekly figure is affected by the Social Security factor, and therefore we will not be misleading  the market     As far as the figures are concerned, under alternative B, if, let us say, we did follow Mr  Morris’s suggestion, instead of having 3 to 7 for M1, the figures would be 2 to 6, you see  And  it’s a difference almost without much meaning  While I lean in favor, logically, to Mr Morris’s  suggestion, I think that it would be a mistake to dictate to the staff on a matter of this sort, and  Mr Kichline has indicated to me that, in addition to the Social Security factor, there are other  factors, technical factors, at play that have not been properly evaluated  And, therefore, I would  stay with the staff adjustment as it stands and not interfere with it but make a full explanation of  the uncertainty and the special character of the figure at the New York Bank press meeting     Well, to repeat, my best suggestion to the Committee is to adopt alternative B as far as the  monetary aggregates are concerned and to stay with the present federal funds rate range  I see no  good reason for changing     Well, logic is a stern master, and if one respected it, really, one  would have to use a money market directive--but I have found it desirable at times to throw logic  to the winds, and I see some advantage in the monetary aggregates directive because, basically,  that is what we ought to be doing  Who would like to speak first?  Mr Volcker, please      All right, thank you, Mr Volcker  Mr Roos now, please    Let me make this observation  It’s not that I want to be  argumentative  I’m trying to be factual  If the economy should turn down, you can rest assured  that the monetary aggregates will come in at a very subdued rate no matter what our target’s  going to be  And therefore, the monetary aggregates will slow down even if we left them  unchanged, no matter what we do, pretty nearly  That certainly has been the experience over  many, many years  Mr Mayo now, please    Mr Black now, please    Okay, Mr Black  Mr Coldwell, please     6/21/77 - 32 -          Thank you, Mr Coldwell  Mr Balles, please    Thank you, Mr Balles  Mr Eastburn now    Thank you, Mr Eastburn  Mr Willes, please    Thank you, Mr Willes  Mr Partee now, please    Thank you, Mr Partee  Mr Morris now, please    Who would like to speak next?  Yes, Mr Jackson    Thank you, Mr Jackson  Mr Wallich, please    Thank you, Mr Wallich  Who’d like to speak next?  Yes, Mr  Guffey    All right, thank you, Mr Guffey  Now, Mr Baughman    All right, thank you, Mr Baughman  Mr Winn, please    Thank you, Mr Winn  Who would like to speak now?  We have a  few silent members of the Committee still  Mr Gardner, please       6/21/77 - 35 -          I’d like to second that, that’s my view  Thank you, Mr Gardner  Mr Lilly now, please     All right, thank you  Anyone else would like to speak?    Thank you, Mr Fossum  Mr Winn, are you in a mood to speak?    Oh, yes, of course you did  Are you in the mood to speak again?    I think we have heard now from every member of the Committee   As far as the language of the directive goes--I haven’t kept a record--I am a little uncertain what  the rest of the Committee’s thinking is  I have the impression that as many are in favor of the  monetary aggregates directive as the money market directive  Let’s have a show of hands on the  part of the Committee, those who favor a monetary aggregates directive     6/21/77 - 36 -          Now we’ll just check that--those who favor a money market  directive   SPEAKER(?)  I was going to vote for the majority    All right, I will vote with the money market directive  Let me just  take a--well, my Secretary has given me somewhat incomplete information, I am sorry to say,  and I don’t trust my memory  There is, as I read the record, a majority in favor of 3 to 7 for M1;  there is a majority in favor of a federal funds rate of 5-1/4 to 5-3/4    I’m uncertain about the attitude of the Committee toward the range for M2  Let’s have a  show of hands on the range indicated in alternative B, 6 to 10  Those who find it more or less  acceptable will kindly raise their hands      Well, gentlemen, any further indication of the Committee’s  thinking?     I see no difficulty in having the range 2-1/2 to 6-1/2  Let’s have a  show of hands on preference  We’re going to be comparing 3 to 7 for M1 over against 2-1/2 to  6-1/2  Those who prefer 3 to 7 will raise their hands    All right, those who prefer 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 will raise their hands   Very well, that’s helpful  Any other comment?  Well, I hear none; therefore, I think we ought to  vote now on a money market directive and an M1 range of 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent, an M2 range  of 6 to 10--I don’t want to push logic--and a federal funds rate range of 5-1/4 to 5-3/4 with an  asymmetrical midpoint that is 5-3/8  Are we ready for the vote?    Well, I respect that  There is a very clear majority favoring the  lower limit of 5-1/4  I don’t think the difference is really very large  If and when we get to  5-1/4, depending on how events in the economy, and the money market, and the financial  markets more broadly are developing, we can take another look at it, if we are not rigidly bound     6/21/77 - 37 -         by the decision reached  We can communicate with one another between meetings  I think we  ought to have the vote now    All right, thank you  Now, we concluded what I wanted to  conclude a little sooner than I thought, I am glad to say, but if the Committee consents to my  doing so, I’d like to leave now and turn the meeting over to Mr Volcker     The subjects to consider are, first, the foreign currency activities that we have been  engaged in, and second, the special problem with regard to repurchase agreements on accounts  of foreign institutions  And, of course, we have to confirm the date for the next meeting  And  any other subjects the Committee considers appropriate, Mr Volcker will deal with     We’ll reconvene, Mr O’Connell, at 215, and we are not subject to any Sunshine  limitations, considering what we intend to talk about  And you know the subject    Well, you’ll be there as our moral as well as our legal conscience     No  We are reconvening as a--  "
441,1977-07-19,"  Why do you say it’s overdone in terms of fundamentals?    No, nothing has happened since June, yes, but what about what  happened before then, and the market was quiescent in absorbing it?    Well, my own feeling is that the markets are behaving quite  rationally in view of the magnitude of our trade deficit--it’s enormous  In view of the  prospect--these things get around--that no improvement in that trade deficit or in our current  account deficit, for that matter, is in sight  In view of some acceleration in the inflation rate in  our country, I think the markets are behaving quite rationally  And now the implication of that  for operations of the Desk are not entirely clear  When you speak of disorderly markets, it’s one  thing; when you comment on fundamentals, well, you may be right, but that’s not my present  interpretation of what is going on    Well, I think some pronouncements by the Treasury have been  unfortunate, and I think it’s always an unhappy day when the major financial officer of the  government conveys the thought that his country does not care about the value of its currency in  a foreign exchange market  And something approaching that apparently has occurred  I still  think that markets by large are behaving rationally  And to go in on any large scale--I don’t  think we can stem the basic tide, and I see no point in inviting large financial losses, if my  interpretation of the trend is anywhere near the mark    What about the US economy?     7/19/77 - 4 -      I am not sure you’re right about that  I think that operating on the  scale on which Alan has been doing isn’t going to make much difference one way or the other in  the present mood of the market    That’s what I’m addressing myself to    I don’t agree with that  I think Treasury ought to keep quiet for  awhile  That’s the best contribution they can make now  In fact, I advised them that way this  morning at a breakfast     Well, this isn’t easy, gentlemen  You know, we all would like to see the world stand  still--let’s not kid ourselves, that is a bias that everyone has  And the world will not  accommodate us  We’re paying a price now in exchange markets for the policies we have been  pursuing  The rate of inflation has intensified; people read the newspapers, they know what has  happened to our balance of trade; they read about the minimum wage and labor legislation and  the way it’s moving on Capitol Hill; they know that the budget deficit next fiscal year will,  according to present projections and plans, be higher than this year     Now markets, I think, are behaving quite rationally  We wish they didn’t behave that way,   just as the Germans would, sure  But my guess is that, to influence the market at all perceptibly,  we would have to move on a very large scale  The time for that may come, [but] I don’t think it  has come yet  And massive intervention may be necessary later on, but not as of today    Well, needless to say, I’ve thought about that  I don’t know what  else we can do here, really  What is your recommendation, Alan?  Do you have any?  Or do you  want us to just sit here and shed tears along with you?    Well, that’s the way traders think--what happened yesterday  But  the underlying forces do catch up with them  Well, look, we’re talking to the Treasury, you keep  on talking, that will go on--     7/19/77 - 6 -      Well, now, you refer to a flow of OPEC money into foreign  currencies  Is this a rumor, or is this a fact?  Do you know?    Well, would you try to ferret out precise facts for me, please?    Any further comment?  Is there a motion to approve transactions  at the foreign Desk?   SPEAKER(?)  So moved   SPEAKER(?)  Seconded    A motion has been made and, I take it, approved  Do you have  any recommendations, Mr Holmes?    How are you getting your Swiss francs now, Alan?    Not in the market?    Well, for a while, I’d stay out of the market    We could have gotten off the gold standard faster    Gentlemen, let’s look to the future  And we will do that presently   Mr Kichline, may we have your views on the economic outlook?    Mr Kichline and Mr Zeisel, I think you have provided this  Committee with a very illuminating set of charts and interpretations  We’re all very grateful to  you  Any questions or comments?  Mr Wallich, please    If they did give support to the economy, it wouldn’t last    All right, thank you  Mr Mayo, please    The 33rd dissertation will have the definitive answer    90-what percent?    Well, I think we should move on  Mr Balles, please     7/19/77 - 13 -      All right    I think that we must leave some elbow room for the staff  Unless  there is a request of this kind from the entire Committee or a sizable number of Committee  members, I think we should rely on the judgment of our staff  However, any member of the  Committee who wants the calculation that Mr Kichline has described, and which he has  indicated the staff makes regularly and which he could supply very easily to any member of the  Committee--I think all you have to do is ask for it and you will receive it    Whether it should be done as a regular presentation, I think that  should depend partly on the thinking of our staff and partly on the wishes of the Committee  I  don’t think we can load up these meetings in response to individual requests  I think individual  requests of Committee members should always be respected  But it is one thing to respect a  request by an individual Committee member and quite another thing to expose the whole  Committee to it formally    In the last analysis, what are we talking about?  We’re talking  about being guided by judgment or being guided by a mechanical model  And some of us may  wish to be guided by the latter  May God bless the efforts of those who proceed in either way   Let us move on    That’s what the model tells us  And then if we take two years, it  increases; take three years, it increases more  And that answer is given once and for all, as Mr  Partee and Mr Volcker have indicated  We know what the model is going to tell us  If we  don’t, we haven’t been listening     However, look, I have no objection whatever to having the staff provide any member of  the Committee who wishes it  Each month  Why not?  You want it, you are entitled to it  In  fact, let’s make it mechanical--if you want to, send it to everyone  Some will memorize what is  on the chart, others will not even look at the chart     7/19/77 - 16 -      It’s a free society, and each of us thinks for himself, thank God    No  We’ve talked too much about this  Let’s move on to Mr  Baughman    I thought that there was a bias like that in those statistics    The kind of bias that Mr Baughman is suggesting    Now that the rise in price is clearly reflected in the sales figures  and less so in the inventory figures    All this is terribly complicated  I don’t know where we are going  to get  The one simple thought to put to the statistical people is, in gathering their inventory  figures, could they not get inventory figures for LIFO firms and then for other firms and examine  these two bodies of data separately?  Then you can get at these problems  In the absence of  information like that, everybody is going to be guessing  And I should think that all you’d have  to do would be to ask a question  Are your inventory figures on the LIFO basis or not?  Or you  can make that question a little more detailed     7/19/77 - 18 -      Of course, there may be a distinction between accounts kept for  tax purposes, which is the point that you’re referring to    For reporting to stockholders, you cannot  What about your own  internal--    Meaning by that there were--    I’m lost  New orders refer to what?    For what?    Retail goods of a kind sold by retailers?    Well, if they think that their inventories are top-heavy, why are  they ordering at a high rate?    Well, I think if that’s their problem, they better tighten up their  management techniques  I don’t follow it    As I have read the statistics over the past year and a half, I think  that we have had more prompt adjustments of inventories than previously  I think that’s in  process at the present time  And I think it’s a very healthy thing     7/19/77 - 20 -      Well, we had a very minor inventory cycle  I think we’re having  one now  These minor inventory cycles prevent the major ones  Or that, I think, is at least a  powerful tendency  Mr Kimbrel, may we hear from you now?    Somehow, the more we compute, the less we get  And what  happens in the economy--we find it makes no difference    But look, when you raise the minimum wage, what you are doing  is applying a lever to the entire wage structure  And every trade [union] leader knows that  And  that’s why he wants it  Now did you take that into account in your calculations?    Lifting the entire wage structure as a result of the lifting of the  minimum wage?    Well, I was getting at the numerical figure  The more I see the  numbers, the less I want to see them    Now we are getting something  My confidence in numbers is  rising  Let’s move on to Mr Jackson, please    But just the other way for existing houses    Yes, but let the existing house sales increase, and the others will  catch up a month, or two, or three later    What is the differential?  I’m sorry, I missed the point    Yes, but the two are not comparable  You are talking about  different kinds of housing  If you took existing houses of the same quality, I don’t think you  would get any such differential     7/19/77 - 22 -      As far as consumer purchasing power goes, what difference does it  make whether he buys a new house or an existing house?    Or buying a different kind of house    All right, Mr Eastburn now, please    Well, what is the answer to your own question in terms of the  operation of your shop?  How good are the model projections, how good have they been?    Well, have you gotten good predictions from your model, taking it  as itself--     7/19/77 - 24 -      All right  Mr Winn, please    I didn’t know that any questions were answered today  Mr Black,  please    Thank you  Mr Coldwell, please    That is what?     7/19/77 - 25 -      Any other questions or comment  I find myself in a listless mood  today  I have not helped this discussion any  I have no clear impression of what we have done  or what we have accomplished, if anything, in this morning’s discussion  The staff has presented  a pretty optimistic picture of the state of the economy and where we seem to be going in the  months immediately ahead, and I think the basic question that we ought to be clear about is  whether we as a Committee subscribe to that economic projection or do not     Now, is there a significant departure from that line of thinking by anyone?  If so, we ought  to hear from members of the Committee  On the other hand, we ought to have an endorsement  of the staff’s basic view, if that is the thinking  I’m concerned not only about the latter part of  our discussion but also what our Secretary is going to report, you see, concerning the thinking of  the Committee  On the basis of what I have heard so far, our staff would be in great difficulty   So members of the Committee ought to express themselves on the general economic outlook   Mr Volcker    I think we have been for about 2 to 2-1/2 months    Yes, but look at the adjustment that has taken place in prices, and  it has been taking place in production and employment [in] nondurable goods  You had a run-up  in inventories  Retail trade leveled off at a very high level, so the trend is still very strongly  upward  The prompt adjustment on the part of the business community [was] reflected partly in  prices, reflected partly in production and employment in the nondurable goods sector    What was this--    You had the response, I think, or you are having a response in the  sphere of production and employment    All right, thank you, Mr Volcker  Mr Wallich now, please    All right, thank you, Mr Wallich  Mr Coldwell next, please    Thank you, Mr Coldwell  Mr Partee now    Thank you, Mr Partee  Mr Mayo    Thanks, Mr Mayo  Yes, Mr Roos    Well, I can’t say you are off base  But I should say that I think of  the world rather differently  Now I have been at this for a good many years, and I have found  that I can make pretty fair judgments about the direction of the economy and even recognize  turns  But as far as magnitudes are concerned, I don’t know how to do it  And I have yet to be  convinced that anybody in the economics profession knows how to do it  A lot of people are  doing it  Generating numbers  But to do it reliably        I think one of our problems is we meet too often  Now it’s nice to meet socially, but we  meet and then we start worrying  We’re like a bunch of hypochondriacs  That’s our society  now, the world we live in  We follow these little wrinkles in the economic curves  We worry,  we get excited, we interpret, and we overinterpret, and we don’t learn from our own mistakes     Now what I find most constructive is that, first, the private-enterprise economy has put out  a remarkable performance here in the past two years or a little longer  Since March of 1975 we  have added 6-1/2 million jobs in our economy  These jobs have not been created by  government; they have been created by private enterprise  It’s an extraordinary performance in  terms of the past  Or, viewed currently, since October we’ve generated something like three  million jobs  The trend has been superlatively good     We are in the midst of a social revolution in our country, with women and, to a lesser  degree, teenagers finding their way into the labor force  The inflation that we have been having  is intensifying the changing role of women in our society, and therefore the unemployment rate  remains high  Private enterprise is adapting  And part-time jobs of various kinds are being  generated by our business firms but not at a rate that as yet matches at all satisfactorily the rate at  which women and teenagers have been entering the work force     Now businessmen have plenty to complain about  They are paid to complain, they are  highly paid men  But watch their actions  Look at this chart--you see, the business capital     7/19/77 - 30 -    expenditure which has been lagging is taking hold  Look at what is happening to commercial  and industrial construction this year  It’s moved to a higher level  The formation of new  business is not shown on this chart  A strong upward trend  You know, if we put the little  wrinkles aside and look at the major trend, I feel good about the economy     Where are the imbalances?  There is, yes, in the housing field, too much speculation in  residential properties  An imbalance in inventory, very small, in process of correction  The one  thing to watch is, the cost of business enterprise has been rising of late faster than prices and  profit margins are in the process of narrowing  Now, that can go on for a couple of years before  you get a turn in the economy  We only have the beginning of that, so I think we have an  expansion going  And how fast the economy will expand, I don’t know, our staff doesn’t know,  no one knows, but we are doing pretty well  I’m quite optimistic about the future     But I share Chuck Partee’s concern about Europe and Japan  There are trends abroad in  the economy and politically that I find very troublesome; and what to do about it, and what we  can do, if anything--it’s almost a hopeless situation  And what about our own economy?  We are  doing quite well  Now, I am not satisfied with what the Congress is doing--the recent trend with  regard to the minimum wage     There is a protectionist wave in our country  Now, let’s not fool ourselves  We talk a lot  about free trade  You know, there’s a quota system--voluntary, we call it--for shoes and now TV  sets  Incidentally, Mr Truman, I would like to have a full report on the trade restrictions that we  put into effect in the last five years, which are still in effect  I think the list is disturbingly large     The government announced an anti-inflation policy  What’s happening to it  Where is it?   Where is it going?  The only agency in government, I believe, that has been doing anything  about inflation is the Federal Reserve  And in my judgment, we haven’t done enough, though I  must say, in the environment that we live in, perhaps we have done as much as we reasonably  could, but that’s certainly a debatable point  Well, that is my little speech for the day  Who else  would like to speak now?    What I really meant about that is--look, I certainly didn’t mean to  suggest that we change our practice, and I spoke cryptically  I meant the economy doesn’t  change that much over the period of a month  I think it is more a matter of the character of our  discussion than the frequency of our meetings  I think we pay too much attention to the last little     7/19/77 - 31 -    wrinkle in economic curves, which contain a fair margin of error  And one is tempted into that  kind of discourse through frequent meetings unless--you see, I think I ought to do my job better  and raise certain general questions for discussion so that we get at underlying trends a little more  thoroughly, and spend less time in interpreting the latest wiggle of our curves, and working  ourselves into either a state of euphoria or a state of depression  No, we ought not to meet less  frequently    Mr Lilly, please    That’s the 50 percent  What is it, 50 percent of half--    Does it, beyond 50?  What it is now, around 46 or 47?    Oh boy  Well, with the minimum wage, if you leave it alone in an  inflationary environment, its bite, you see, will be progressively reduced  But under this kind of  legislation, there will be no let-up  There will be cumulative force asserted on the wage  structure    You know, I remember very vividly, one day I got off the plane in  New York and--oh, this was some 20 years ago  [David] Dubinsky, who was then head of the  [International] Ladies’ Garment Workers’ [Union]     “Arthur, can I give you a ride?”     “Oh sure, into the city”  So I stepped into Dubinsky’s Cadillac, and we had a nice  conversation       7/19/77 - 32 -     And he said, “You know, you’re a professor, you don’t really understand the minimum  wage”     I said, “Well, I probably don’t, you know  I’d like to listen to you”     He said, “You might think that we’re just interested in the low-income workers”  He said,  “Yes, we’re socially minded  Fundamentally, we’re practical people, we’re concerned about  ourselves, our own employees  Raise the middle and the whole wage structure gets lifted”     I’ve heard that from dozens of them since then  That’s what they are after  And, you  know, all this is explained to the public in moralistic terms    See, we defend them against competition from the young, we  defend them against competition from abroad    Well, gentlemen, I think we’ll take our coffee break now, and then  when we get back, we’ll start on long-term targets   [Coffee break]    We will return to our deliberations  We want to turn now to the  discussion of the longer-term ranges for our monetary aggregates  I will have to testify on that  subject next week  The date was originally set for July 26, but there’s been a change, and the  testimony will be given on July 29  On July 26, the Committee [on Banking, Finance, and Urban  Affairs] will hear testimony from us on the Federal Reserve Reform Act introduced by  [committee] chairman [Henry] Reuss     Now let me make a few remarks by way of introduction  The formal exercise of looking  one year ahead was started in March 1975  We’ve met every three months to discuss our longer- range targets  We’ve enunciated a policy and repeated it on every occasion, namely, that we will  gradually move our longer-range targets down so that, several years from now, the monetary  basis for general price stability may be restored  We’ve been proceeding slowly, perhaps too  slowly, but that is a debatable point  If we proceed no faster than we have been going,  [unintelligible] in the future, it would take us perhaps 10 years to return the [growth rate of the]  monetary aggregates to a [pace] that is reasonably consistent with general price stability     Now, the performance under these targets has not matched the targets at all closely  While  the targets have moved down, [but] in the case of M1, the actual growth rate, if we take the  moving 12-month period, has gone up  In the initial 12-month period running from March 1975     7/19/77 - 33 -    to March 1976, the growth was 49 percent  For the 12-month period just ended, that is, between  the second quarter of 1976 and the second quarter of 1977, the rate of growth was 6 percent  A  somewhat similar development has occurred in the case of M2  A gradual increase over  successive moving 12-month intervals  In the case of M3, on the other hand, we’ve had virtual  stability; no trend has developed  In the case of M4, the trend once again has been upward   Likewise in the case of M5  M4, you may recall, is simply M2 plus the large-denomination CDs,  and M5 is simply M3 plus the CDs  In the case of M6 and M7, which are still broader monetary  aggregates, there has been virtual stability     So the record is somewhat uneven, and if you attach primary significance to M1 and M2,  which has been the Committee’s practice, we have gradually permitted the growth rates to rise  even though our monetary targets have been successively, very gradually, unevenly lowered   Now that’s the record to date     And our question is, what to do today, and my recommendation to the Committee is that  we make another very small move toward lowering our monetary growth ranges  I think we  need to do that to maintain credibility in the Committee’s intention to help restore general price  stability in our country, proceeding very gradually, but still having definite goals  Now, in  addition to that basic reason, we’ve had a significant overshoot in the second quarter, and we  should take that into account, and that would argue for some reduction in the targets for M1   The inflation rate has been intensifying, and income velocity has been very rapid of late  And I  don’t think we ought to be deterred from making a modest move by the hesitation that we find in  retail trade--actually, even that is uncertain now because, for the last four weeks, if the  preliminary figures are right, there’s been a significant increase in retail trade once again  That’s  a very preliminary figure     I would make the move very modest and simply lower the lower limit of M1 from 4-1/2 to  4 percent  Leave the upper limit where it is so that we have ample elbow room to move toward  even a higher rate of growth than we’ve recently experienced if, in the judgment of the  Committee, such a higher rate of growth is desirable  I think that M2 is moving naturally, of  itself, in the right direction, and I would do nothing about that  We’ve made larger reductions in  our target figures for M2 than for M1 in the past  An argument could be advanced for lowering  the target for M3  But since that has hardly any operational significance, I would be inclined to  leave that alone and do nothing about that     And my recommendation or suggestion to the Committee is very simple  to lower the  lower limit of the M1 growth range by 1/2 percentage point  It’s a very modest move  We’ll be  criticized, of course, but that is our fate, and we have to do our duty  No matter what we do,  we’re going to be criticized     Who would like to speak first?  Mr Coldwell, then Mr Wallich, Mr Black, Mr Jackson,  Mr Mayo, Mr Balles, Mr Eastburn, Mr Kimbrel, Mr Roos, Mr Partee, Mr Volcker, Mr  Guffey    Mr Winn  I don’t see anyone else     7/19/77 - 34 -      Oh no  You can speak at any time  Just nudge me hard    Mr Coldwell, please    Thank you, Mr Coldwell  Mr Wallich, please    Thank you, Mr Wallich  Mr Black, please    Let’s be clear about that last sentence of yours  As far as our  doing something, we do what we think is right  Now, there are no political factors that make it  hard to reason  To the extent that there are political factors, I think they’re of another kind  We  have very troublesome legislation in the Congress, and what we do and the way our testimony  goes on the 29th, when these targets will be announced, may have some effect on the course of  the legislation in the Congress  I think to the extent that there is a political factor here, it’s really  legislative--legislation involving or affecting the Federal Reserve    I beg your pardon?    Thank you, Mr Black  Mr Jackson now, please    Thank you, Mr Jackson  Mr Mayo, please    Thank you, Mr Mayo  Mr Balles next, please    Thank you, Mr Balles  Mr Eastburn    Thank you, Mr Eastburn  Mr Kimbrel now, please    Thank you, Mr Kimbrel  Mr Roos, please    Thank you, Mr Roos  Mr Partee next, please    Thank you, Mr Partee  Mr Volcker next, please    All right, thank you, Mr Volcker  Mr Guffey now, please    Thank you, Mr Guffey  Mr Winn, please    Thank you, Mr Winn  Mr Willes, please    Thank you, Mr Willes  Mr Gardner now, please    Thank you, Mr Gardner  Mr Morris, we haven’t heard from you    Thank you, Mr Morris  Mr Lilly now    Thank you, Mr Lilly  Mr Baughman would say something now    Now wait, now wait  Your views are out of step and therefore I  want to be sure--I want to hear every word  Would you speak a little more loudly please?    Close to alternative?     7/19/77 - 42 -      Well, thank you, Mr Baughman     Gentlemen, we’re faced with a very hard decision  Speaking personally for a moment, I  wish I could join my colleagues who were inclined to move toward somewhat lower growth  rates  I wish I could--temperamentally, yes; that’s what I would prefer to do  But I do have an  obligation to this Committee and to the System as well as to the country  I’ll have to testify  before the Committee, I will have to defend whatever this Committee decides     You take a range of 4 to 6, which is preferred on this first go-round by four members of the  Committee; eight members prefer 4 to 6-1/2  I find it difficult to defend 4 to 6  Let me show  you why  4 to 6 reduces the midpoint to 5 percent  The staff projection for nominal GNP is  approximately 12 percent  That implies a velocity figure of roughly 7 percent  I would find it  very difficult to justify a 7 percent velocity figure  We may get it, particularly at a time when  some people will be arguing, “Well, the economy has leveled off, and at such a time velocity  tends to fall off”  Suppose the velocity figure is lower than 7 percent  If I could argue with  conviction that that would put significant downward pressure on the price level, you see, yes, I  would be in good shape  But I can’t  I can’t argue that  It may put some downward pressure on  prices, it may put some downward pressure on activity  Over the longer run, yes  I could argue  with respect to the effects on the price level     Moving the lower limit down to 4 percent will subject us to attacks  I don’t mind being  attacked, but I want to be in a position, really, to answer the attacks in an effective manner  And  I find it very difficult to do that at the present time because of the hesitation that some people are  going to read into the economic events  I interpret the economy differently  Well, that will  influence the thinking of some, and I am concerned about the legislation that we have before the  Congress     A clear majority of the Committee, in any event, favors a range of 4 to 6-1/2 percent for  M1, 7 to 9-1/2 percent for M2, and 8-1/2 to 11 for M3  As for bank credit, you have the  recommendation by the staff that we do away with the proxy; that change is long overdue  And  as to a figure, I think we ought to proceed as we have in our recent meetings and leave it to the  staff to supply the numbers that are reasonably consistent for bank credit--consistent with the  monetary magnitudes that we decide upon    Well, I would really prefer to leave that to the staff    What’s that?     7/19/77 - 43 -      Oh, I think it’s quite important to have a credit figure as well as  the money figure because we don’t want to go completely monetarist at this Committee    Well, I think that’s a--    Well, I think sometimes, I think they are symbolic  Much of life is  based on symbolism  It serves a function  Much of history is based on symbolism  I wouldn’t  want to ignore it  Well, I don’t see any way of compromising readily here, and I think we have  to take a straight vote  And I hope we will not be too far apart in the voting    Oh no, I don’t think we ought to vote on the bank credit  Leave  that to our staff  But to vote on the--    Well, let me repeat what I think we’ll be voting on    Well, let me indicate what I think we ought to vote on, and then  we’ll discuss that to the extent that there is a difference of opinion  What I’m putting to the  Committee for a vote is as follows  an M1 growth range for the year ahead of 4 to 6-1/2 percent;  the growth range of M2 of 7 to 9-1/2 percent; a growth range for M3, 8-1/2 to 11 percent; and a  figure on bank credit, as distinguished from the bank credit proxy, to be appropriately filled in by  the staff  Yes, Mr Black    What’s that?    Well, I thought of that, but we have avoided fourths, and I’m a  little afraid that we may get to--actually, the difference between 4 to 6 and 4 to 6-1/2 is a small  difference    What’s that?    Meaningful one, in the sense that a good deal of meaning may be  read into that    Well, we could do that  But I think that--you know, it’d be an  exercise in fine tuning that I don’t fancy, but if this is what the Committee wanted to do--    I beg your pardon?    I think the compromise more practically ought to be along another  line, namely, let’s bear in mind that several members of the Committee think that the upper limit  of 6-1/2 is too high, and, in looking at our short-term ranges, let’s keep that in mind as policy  unfolds in the months ahead  Mr Roos, please    It’s all a matter of interpretation  You see, the actual growth rates  have diverged from the targeted growth rates significantly  And I think that the objective that  you seek can be better attained by watching the short-run policy objectives and trying to prevent  further upward drifting and try to get, you see, some downward drift  I think that’s the  operational essence of what we do     Now, to announce to the world that we are continuing the policy of moving our targets  gradually downward is, I believe, a healthy thing  To announce to the world that we’re moving  our targets down very appreciably when in fact we permit, through our short-run decisions, the  growth rate to creep up means that we are inviting trouble for ourselves and [that we] don’t do  for the economy what we are seeking to achieve  My own inclination, therefore, would be to  stay with the more modest reduction but to pay perhaps more attention than we have to the short- run targets  That’s the way in which I would seek a compromise of the views that now exist  within the Committee    I don’t know  Well, you know, I look upon the upper limit as an  insurance policy  I look upon it also as something that can help us through a difficult legislative  period  I can assure you that the statement before the [congressional] committee will stress, even  more than preceding statements have, the need to bring the monetary growth rates down  As  some evidence of that intention, there is this further modest reduction  Well, you can argue this  one, I think, one way and argue it another way  As far as the business and financial community  is concerned, I’m not aware of any great dissatisfaction with the monetary policy pursued by the  Federal Reserve System  The indications to me are that, by and large, the policy is approved   On the other hand, we do have many critics in the Congress and, for that matter, in a section of  the American public    Gentlemen, I wish we were closer together  Unless there is a  further comment or a further suggestion--    Well, you know, as far as the range is concerned, let’s not forget  the original reason for wanting a range rather than a single figure--namely, our inability to hit the  targets, number one; also, the uncertainty of our knowledge as to the relationship between the  given magnitude on the monetary side and an economic activity measure one way or another   The relationship is quite loose  Now these were the two reasons we adopted a range rather than  a single figure, which assumes, you see, more knowledge than we have and a greater ability to  control or to reach our objective than we have    Well, that’s something that Mr Balles in particular has reminded  us of repeatedly  Well, gentlemen, I think that we are probably ready for a vote now    All right now, we want to turn--but I wonder about the hour, how  much we can--how do you feel, would you like to continue, or take a break and go to lunch?  I’ll  tell you, let’s do this  We’ll have Mr Sternlight’s report and perhaps also Mr Axilrod’s, and  then we’ll break for lunch  Mr Sternlight, we’re ready for you    Thank you for your report, Mr Sternlight  Any questions to Mr  Sternlight?    Mr Black, please    Mr Wallich    My guess would be that the federal funds rate would be a little  higher now    Any other question?  Mr Axilrod, how many hours do you need  for your report?    All right  You’ll be timed precisely; please proceed    Well, thank you, Mr Axilrod  I think it’s a very helpful statement   Mr Wallich    Any other questions to Mr Axilrod?  Yes, Mr Jackson    How much do you have outstanding in the wild card?    Yes, Mr Balles    Well, you better get started on that because my own guess is that if  we get nationwide NOW accounts, we would want either to shift entirely to M2 or give it a  significantly larger weight  That’s my guess    And also its implications for our monetary procedures  Because,  you know, we’ve been able to live with our present definition; well, we’ve made an adjustment,  giving as much weight to M2 as we do, or approximately the same way as we do, to M1  But  with nationwide NOW accounts, I doubt if we could retain the present procedure     Gentlemen, it’s time to break for lunch, and we’ll be back at--what would you prefer, 215  or 230?  Let me have a show of hands for 215     7/19/77 - 50 -     [Lunch recess]    Gentlemen, we are late in gathering once again, but there were  some legislative problems that a number of us had to talk over at lunch  And we want to turn our  [attention] to the directive to the Desk and our decision with regard to monetary policy in the  weeks immediately ahead     I think no matter what we do today, under that head we ought to have a monetary  aggregates directive, in view of the decision that we reached earlier in this meeting  My own  inclination, which I will put forward to the Committee as a target to accept or reject, is to have a  monetary aggregates directive, to accept the figures under alternative C for M1 and M2 on page  6 [of the Bluebook], and to accept the federal funds rate range under alternative B  Mr Mayo    Well, I thank you, Mr Mayo  Who would like to speak next?  Mr  Coldwell    All right  Thank you  Mr Black, please    Thank you, Mr Black  Mr Eastburn    Thank you  Mr--    Thank you  Mr Guffey    Gentlemen, I don’t think we want to change our rule, you see  We  are changing the rules of operation, Mr Mayo  And I think we will work ourselves into trouble  if we change our rules from meeting to meeting  We ought to stay with a given rule until we  decide that some other rule is better  Stay with that for a while    Well, you know, our rule is that, when we have a monetary  aggregates directive, we use the full range  The full range first  That’s rule one--full range is  available for use  Rule two is that there is a zone of indifference  And that zone of indifference,  instead of being equal to 4 percentage points, is equal to something like 2-1/2 or a little more  than that  That’s our second rule  And rule three, of course, is, if we start hitting against the  boundary lines, we then have the special intervention by the Manager and the Committee  Chairman  Those are our basic rules    Well, we’re at 5-3/8    The midpoint is 5-1/2, yes, but I don’t think there ought to be an  arbitrary move to 5-1/2  There ought to be a move based on some evidence concerning the  aggregates  But the full range being available for us in contrast to the money market directive    Yes    Well, then our discussion has been helpful  That is, the meaning  that you sought to convey, which I didn’t get in the first instance, has now been clarified  That’s  helpful  All right, then, Mr Jackson, please     7/19/77 - 52 -      Who would like to speak next?  Mr Gardner    Thank you, Mr Gardner  Yes, Mr Kimbrel?    I don’t know what the financing schedule is, precisely    How much will the Treasury be--    And that means that the only new information that we’ll have will  be Wednesday and Thursday of this week    When will those doubts be resolved?    Wait, now the final data, are you referring to the preliminary data  that you normally get on the Thursday?    Well, the data are always a bit cloudy--    This time they will be somewhat more cloudy?    We’ll get to this point a little later--that is, we’ll have to clear that  up  Yes, Mr Kimbrel; no, you have spoken, that’s right  Mr Volcker    I think that that would be the normal procedure, but starting from  an asymmetrical midpoint there is a special question as to how fast we move  And the  suggestion that I made was that we move on the basis of new information rather than move  mechanically    Thank you, Mr Lilly  Who is--yes, Mr Winn    Thank you, Mr Winn  Mr Partee     7/19/77 - 54 -      Well, then, why would you want the federal funds rate to move  down to 5?    But a move of the federal funds rate [down] 3/8 would be regarded  as a very significant easing move by the Federal Reserve    All right, thank you, Mr Partee  Mr Morris hasn’t spoken yet    Thank you, Mr Morris  Mr Roos, we haven’t heard from you    Thank you, Mr Roos  Mr Wallich, we haven’t heard from you  yet    All right, anyone else like to speak?    Yes, Mr Balles, and then Mr Baughman    Thank you, Mr Balles  Mr Baughman    Thank you, Mr Baughman  Anyone else?  One thing is perfectly  clear  the Committee is inclined to accept a monetary aggregates directive  And a clear majority  favors a growth range for M1 of 3-1/2 to 7-1/2 and a growth range for M2 of 6-1/2 to 10-1/2  As  for the federal funds rate, there is a distribution, a wider distribution  Six members of the  Committee favor a range of 5-1/4 to 5-3/4, and--oh, something wrong  Our secretary never  makes a mistake, but today he’s made a mistake, and I don’t know what it is  Mr Guffey, we  don’t have you recorded--    Well, that makes for the majority, just what I’ve been waiting for   Any further discussion?    You mean the prompt move to the--    Well, all right, let me put the question as it was worded by Mr  Coldwell, and each member of the Committee will interpret that for himself  Members of the  Committee who seek a reasonably prompt move from 5-3/8 to 5-1/2 will indicate that by raising  their hands    Well, every member of the Committee will interpret that for  himself    Well, then, I would say that the move ought to be made on the  basis of new information  But we don’t sit on new information, we use it  That is [what] the  monetary aggregates directive always means     Well, unless there is further question, let us vote on the following  A monetary aggregates  directive; an M1 range of 3-1/2 to 7-1/2; an M2 range of 6-1/2 to 10-1/2; a federal funds range of  5-1/4 to 5-3/4, with the understanding that the range is to be used depending on how the  information comes in; and that a move be made to the midpoint of 5-1/2 when and as new  information points in that direction     Now, some special attention will have to be given to the Treasury financing problem, and I  don’t quite know what should we say about that, if anything, at the present point  Mr Holmes    Well, I think the Committee does understand that  Well, if we are  ready for the vote, let’s proceed    What else do we have to do, Mr Secretary?    Yes, Mr Baughman?     7/19/77 - 57 -      Mr Baughman, I’m sorry, I haven’t been attentive, but has your  question been properly handled by Mr Axilrod?    All right, good   SPEAKER(?)  Mr Chairman, can I ask the Presidents to remain?   END OF MEETING         "
467,1977-08-16,"  The agenda indicates an executive session, but that session will be  postponed until we have concluded our monetary policy meeting  Is there, gentlemen, a move to  approve the minutes [of the July 19, 1977, meeting], if that be the inclination of the Committee?     SPEAKER(?)  So moved   SPEAKER(?)  Seconded    The motion has been made and seconded  No objections heard  I  take it the minutes are approved  We will now hear from Mr Pardee on foreign currency  operations    Thank you very much  I take it [that], while foreign exchange  markets start boiling, our rhetoric also becomes more interesting, more exciting    Any questions or comments?  Yes, Mr Wallich    Any other questions or comments?  Very well, a motion to  approve the transactions conducted by the foreign Desk would now be in order   SPEAKER(?)  So moved   SPEAKER(?)  Seconded    The motion has been made and presumably seconded  I hear no  objection, and therefore we pass to your recommendations, if any, Mr Pardee    Well, it’s a good day  All right, let’s pass quickly before  recommendations emerge  Mr Kichline, we’re ready for your economic report    I wonder how many of you may have read this morning’s editorial  in the Wall Street Journal  Well, we can’t very well discuss that   SPEAKER(?)  Unless you want to read it to us    Mr Kichline has reviewed very competently the recent run of  economic statistics, and these are summarized in the Greenbook and in the Supplement  I think  it would be especially valuable if members of the Committee who have contacts with  businessmen, and bankers, and citizens generally, in their own area, would comment on  businessmen’s current attitudes with regard to the economy  What are their concerns, are they  experiencing improving profits, are they anticipating a continuance of the economic expansion,  are they uncertain about the trend of economic events?  I think a discussion or anything that  members of the Committee may contribute along those lines--I, for one, would find it especially  valuable  I think I have in the back of my head the statistics pretty well summed up, and not  much is to be gained by going through those again  Yes, Governor Lilly    But the steel companies had a poor second quarter    Earningswise, exactly    Well, what good is volume if you don’t make a profit?    Mr Kichline, you didn’t comment--or I perhaps wasn’t listening  carefully enough--on the trend of corporate profits    Both    Thank you  Yes, Mr Jackson    Thank you  Mr Mayo, please    Thank you, Mr Mayo  Mr Rankin, please    Thank you, Mr Rankin  Mr Balles, please    Thank you, Mr Balles    Mr Wallich now, please    In other words, we need a little more inflation?    Thank you, Mr Wallich  Mr Morris now, please    All right, thank you, Mr Morris  Mr Baughman, please    All right, thank you, Mr Baughman  Mr Kimbrel now, please    Thank you, Mr Kimbrel  Mr Partee, please    Thank you, Mr Partee  Mr Roos now, please    I don’t think anyone has expressed such a view    Thank you, Mr Roos  Mr Coldwell now, please    Thank you, Mr Coldwell  Mr Volcker now, please    Thank you, Mr Volcker  Mr Eastburn now, please    Well, thank you, Mr Eastburn  Anyone else like to speak or  speak once again?  Well, if not, just to break the monotony, I’d like to say a few words  There’s  little doubt in my own mind that the expansion that we’ve been experiencing will continue for  some time  I share Mr Volcker’s doubts as to whether the slowdown that is likely to occur in  the second half of this year will or will not be followed by a re-acceleration of the economy  I  think it would be premature to express a judgment on that with any confidence     I think that this economic expansion has been well balanced from the viewpoint of  inventory control; inventory adjustments have been prompt  We’ve been going through such an  adjustment now in the nondurable goods area  I do see some signs of potential trouble ahead   This year, unit costs of production have crept up on selling prices, and profit margins have  narrowed  And if that trend were to continue, while the expansion that we are having would still  have some life in it, the forces would be building up that would bring the expansion to a close   And that is something that we ought to be watching with very great care  We don’t pay nearly  enough attention here within the Board and possibly within the Banks to the behavior of profits   And historically, when unit costs of production begin creeping up on selling prices, within a year     8/16/77 - 15 -           or two a downturn has occurred  And therefore, the distribution of income, something we don’t  like to talk about, is a matter to watch closely     Secondly, here I have a quarrel with our staff, and it’s a long-standing quarrel that I must  try to resolve  I can’t agree with Mr Kichline’s judgment that the debt capacity of consumers  remains favorable  I don’t think that is true  That’s not the evidence as I read it, but I have to sit  down with Mr Kichline and members of his staff and go through the evidence  I hope to  convince them that they are wrong, but they’re not easily convinced, nor should they be  I think  that there are some signs of speculation in real estate, farm real estate, and in home buying  generated by an effort of individuals to somehow protect themselves against inflation in the  future  I think if this continues, it may become very troublesome  On the other hand, I do see  business capital investment expanding, and early investment indicators, I think, point rather  unanimously to a continuation of an upward trend--and I think a strengthening in the upward  trend--of business capital investment  And therefore, I have considerable confidence that the  expansion will continue for some time     But I’m not ready to speak about any long run, and I would very much hesitate to make a  projection through the year 1978  Our staff estimates it because we require it  I don’t have to  make it, and I’m not going to, and I’m not going to because my vision is much too cloudy  And  that is a counsel that I would urge on my colleagues  Now I do attach significance to the  behavior of the stock market  It’s been in the doldrums much too long  And I think the behavior  of profits is one factor in the indifferent or declining behavior of the stock market  I think that  there is at least, as I sense it, very great uncertainty about economic policy in the business and  financial community  Now that has not been commented on at this table to any extent, and I may  be getting an eccentric sampling of opinion  But that is what I hear from businessmen and  financial executives repeatedly, and I must say in all honesty I share that opinion  Well, that’s  all that I can contribute at this point  Mr Winn    What does that mean, precisely?    Thank you  Mr Jackson, please    Any advice you may be able to give us on that point--    Does an answer exist to the question?    Oh my heavens--    I don’t think we can even answer that question reliably for the  United States  And the Wharton index is worthless for the purpose of answering either for the  United States or foreign countries  And we just have to make up our minds  There’s a great deal  that we would like to know and that, in view of our responsibilities, we probably ought to know,  but we simply don’t know  And we travel in darkness much of the time, and that’s the way the  world has been, and it will remain that way for some time  And this is a statistical no man’s  land, really    It’s interesting    Well, gentlemen, unless there is a desire to continue the economic  discussion--you know, our staff has to write a report, and I think, let’s have a show of hands,     8/16/77 - 21 -           simply to help the staff write its report  It’s a function that we, I think, should keep in mind   The staff might have difficulty, on the basis of the discussion so far, in writing a report that  would be sufficiently illuminating  Let’s have a show of hands of members of the Committee  who expect the expansion to continue through 1977    At any rate--okay, let’s have a show of hands of those who expect  the expansion in the second half of this year to be significantly lower than in the first half of the  year    Significantly lower    Well, now--    You’re not going to put these numbers in the report--    After all, adjectives serve a function  Now, let’s have a show of  hands of all those who are reasonably confident that the expansion will continue through 1978    Okay, let’s have a show of hands of all those who expect business  capital investment to rise at a faster rate than it has hitherto during the next 12 months or so    At a faster rate than the past--    Well--    You see, I wanted to supplement what has gone on in  conversation, and I could just see the reports each month--which I read word-for-word, more  than once--and I could see the initial report before you see it  And in the absence of the  questions that I’ve just put to the Committee, I think we would convey to the general public a  very distorted picture of the underlying thinking of members of this Committee  Don’t fear that  there’ll be a lack of balance; and if there should be, after all of the purifying and sanitizing that  goes on, you’ll have an ample opportunity to set Mr Altmann and his staff straight  Any further  protest on my procedure?  Let’s move on to Mr Sternlight’s report on domestic open market  operations    Didn’t the federal funds rate go above 6 yesterday?    All right, any other question or comment?  Yes, Mr Winn     8/16/77 - 24 -            Mr Eastburn    Any other questions?    Well, the motion has been made to ratify the actions of the Desk,  and I take it there’s no objection  We might as well break for coffee now   [Coffee break]    Well, let’s move on to your comments, Mr Axilrod    A rather incisive set of comments  Any questions?  Yes, Mr  Coldwell    Any other questions?  Yes, Mr Wallich    Mr Guffey, please    Yes, Mr Mayo    Don’t underestimate us    You are indeed suggesting a revolution  I don’t think we want a  substitution, but I do think we want and need at least a partial addition  I find it very  disconcerting--when, at times, I ask one or another member of our economic staff [about] the  recent behavior of unadjusted figures, that seems to shock the individual to whom I put the  question  He no longer knows the world of unadjusted figures  He knows the world in terms of  seasonally adjusted figures  I think we have all gotten into the habit of living with seasonally  adjusted figures, and we are overdoing it  I would like to see, well, at least now or then,  unadjusted figures and try to arrive at some rough judgment as to the quality of the seasonal  correction, its stability, its degree of fragility  I have a great deal of sympathy for your  suggestion except for the--I don’t know whether you meant it seriously--the substitute    Well, I think Mr Mayo’s comment on seasonal adjustments is  very useful, and at the risk of complicating life, let me point out another, perhaps even more  serious, difficulty  And this time I will be using seasonally adjusted figures, and this difficulty  will extend equally well, I’m sure, to figures that have not been adjusted for seasonal variations     I’ve had the staff recompute M1, that is, make computations on the rate of growth of M1  using a modified, and yet I think reasonable, definition of M1  And the modification of our  standard definition was as follows  First, we included the NOW account  Second, we included  the demand deposits of mutual savings banks  Third, we excluded demand deposits due to  foreign commercial banks and foreign official institutions  Fourth, we included business savings  deposits  And fifth, we’ve included governmental savings deposits     Now, in my judgment, M1 redefined in this fashion is a better measure of transactions  balances than the one that we have been relying on thus far  But whether or not you accept that  judgment, I think it is somewhat startling to compare the figures given by the M1 that we rely  upon and the redefined M1 which I have just described  For example, in the first quarter of  1976, our standard M1 rate of growth was 29 percent--Steve, is this based on quarterly averages  or end-of-quarter figures?    No, ’76--29, and the redefined M1 is 92  You are living in a  different world  Now let me take the first quarter of 1977  The current M1 is 42, and the  redefined M1 is 89  Again, a very different world  Now, for the second quarter this year, the     8/16/77 - 31 -           difference is very much smaller  84 for the current M1, and 87 for the redefined M1  But very  large differences appear in other quarters, and the differences for individual months are really  enormous     Now this is not too surprising  I had the calculation made because I was quite sure the  differences would be large  What it does mean is that the knowledge we at times assume we  have concerning the growth of the money supply, or the relation between the money supply and  economic activity, or the relation between the growth of the money supply and the inflation rate  is very precarious, very fragile  And I’m not quite sure what the implication of all this is  One  implication may be that we ought not to be apologetic about paying a little more attention to  interest rates than we do  That is not a necessary inference from anything that I have said; it’s  one possible implication    Well, I don’t have these calculations, but the velocity figures  would be cut back very sharply    Oh, no question about it    That’s exactly--    Well, whatever you do in this area I think will have an arbitrary  element  Take demand deposits  Demand deposits can be active or stagnant, and sometimes  they’ll be the one, sometimes the other  And these are difficulties that are inherent in the kind of  complex monetary system that we have and human behavior being what it is     Well, Mr Mayo’s comments and perhaps also the comments that I’ve just made ought to  make us feel very humble as we go about our task    That was a nasty question     8/16/77 - 32 -            Well, gentlemen, any other general observations?  If not, we’d  better turn to our monetary policy discussion, looking toward a new domestic policy directive to  the New York Desk  I think that it would be useful if--this remark is addressed totally to the  Bank Presidents at the table and their alternates--it would be useful if our Bank Presidents would  comment on the desirability as they see it--speaking for themselves rather than for their  directors--of an increase in the discount rate  Whether such an increase would be desirable, and  if so, would it be desirable immediately or possibly two or three weeks down the road, when  certain adjustments in interest rates as yet uncompleted in the marketplace would have taken  place  Your views on that subject would be helpful to the [Federal Reserve] Board     Now, as far as the Bluebook is concerned, I look rather favorably on alternative B in the  Bluebook, on page 6, except, you see, the lower limit of M1 is 2  Well, why should it be 2?   Why shouldn’t it be 0 or even negative 2?  And likewise, the lower limit of M2 could be  lowered  This may be a time when, in view of what has just happened to M1, we should be  willing to lower the lower limit of M1 very substantially  Well, that is one suggestion the  members of the Committee may want to consider  Who wants to speak first?  Mr Coldwell    Well, I haven’t destroyed it  I haven’t destroyed your thesis    I’ve reinforced your thesis, reading your mind as I am capable of  doing--    Let me just stop you there to ask a question  I would not want to  publish a negative figure  I would welcome a negative figure if it just developed naturally    Well, that’s what I wanted to clarify    May I just say I don’t think that that recommendation is consistent  with your recommendation on lowering the limits for M1  The reason for lowering the lower  limit [on money] is not to tap lower interest rates very quickly  But if you permit the lower limit  [of the federal funds rate] to go down to 5-1/2, you may be forced to do that--    I think you are weakening your recommendation with regard to  M1  Now going the other way, widening, I don’t see any inconsistency there, but I think I see an  inconsistency--    Where are you?    Why do you think that is unsatisfactory?  The retail sales which  rose somewhat are retail sales expressed in nominal dollars, I believe  Is that correct?    Well, then, I’m not ready to say that when you have retail sales in  July going up five-tenths, to 1 percent, and therefore [up at a] 6 percent annual rate, I’m not  ready to say the total [real] retail sales rose at all    Well, I think that this is something our staff ought to watch a little  more  Now one of the great difficulties with a period of inflation is that it confuses everyone   Confuses businessmen with regard to their profits, confuses economists with regard to their  readings of the economy  It confuses the general public because we keep on shifting back and  forth  One minute we are talking about changes in dollar figures and another minute we are  talking about changes in physical magnitudes  And we all do that  I know I do, but we ought to  mend our ways    Right  I think it’s a useful correction    Well, I--    I think that members of this Committee should feel prepared at all  times to comment on whatever is on their mind  But I do want to point out that we are engaged  in a congressional enterprise at present and that sensitive legislation involving reserve  requirements is now being considered on Capitol Hill  Therefore, let us keep that dimension in  mind as we consider desirable changes in reserve requirements    Thank you, Mr Coldwell  Mr Eastburn now, please    Do you have any observation on the timing?    You would do it immediately    Rather than wait a week, or two, or three    All right, thank you  Mr Morris    That’s correct  Yes, there was no reaction to the move we made in  late April, and there’s been virtually no reaction to the move we’ve made during the past month   Why should we take pleasure in that?  I do, myself, but I sometimes get very uncomfortable with  myself, because what’s the purpose of an increase in interest rates?  What is this exercise all  about, you see  When we release forces tending to make for an increase in interest rates, why  should we take pleasure when these forces do not extend to the long-term market    Well, I say that all the time, and I believe it, and yet I feel a little  uneasy because the purpose is to slow down the rate of growth of the money supply  And do you  succeed in slowing down the rate of growth of the money supply if long-term rates do not rise?   So, I feel a little uncomfortable with myself and with my own rhetoric, and therefore, with your  rhetoric, which is so similar to mine    Any views on the discount rate?     8/16/77 - 37 -            Well, the purpose of the discount window is not to enable a bank  to arbitrage    I don’t think Mr Morris was saying that  I think all that Mr  Morris meant to say was that if bankers are tempted to, as some of them will be, to borrow at the  discount window because the discount rate is low relative to this or that market rate, this is  something that Mr Morris’s Bank will be aware of, will watch, and this is something that in  every period when such a discrepancy arises, the Federal Reserve Banks around the country do  more or less well and more or less systematically  I think that’s what Mr Morris meant to say--    But I didn’t interpret Mr Morris to say that the standard would  change--    Well, all right  Now we pass to you, Mr Kimbrel    Yes    By reasonably early--    We’ll now hear from you, Mr Baughman    Thank you, Mr Baughman  Gentlemen, I really have been  listening very attentively to what each of you has been saying, but at the same time, I’ve been  engaging in some arithmetical calculations that are of some interest, I think  I commented on the  difference earlier between the rates of growth of M1 as we now compute M1 and the rate of  growth based on a revised concept of M1  Now, with very minor exceptions, for some 15  months the revised M1, month by month, showed a higher rate of growth than the standard M1   In April, the two were identical, and in the last three months, the revised M1 shows a lower rate  of growth than the standard M1   Assuming the arithmetic here is right, this would suggest to me that money has moved out  of temporary savings balances into transactions balances, either to carry out payments on  transactions that have already been made or to provide checking deposit money for transactions  to be made in the near future  In any event, the figures are much lower  Let me just read the  figures for May, June, July  The first figure is the standard [M1], and the second figure is the  revised M1  07 for May and then 04; 45, l8; 183, 122  Well, that’s my interruption for you  to use or not use and interpret as you see fit     Mr Rankin, please  Mr Rankin, we’re very glad to welcome you to this table today    Any view on the discount rate?    Thank you, Mr Rankin  Mr Partee now, please    Thank you, Mr Partee  I’m going to interrupt the flow of thought  once again by reporting on what I can extract from these figures  You’re going to get very  strong support, Mr Mayo  The table I have before me starts in 1976  Let’s go back to April  1976; the rate of monetary growth in April was higher than in the preceding month and the  following month  Now next we go to July 1976; the rate of growth in July was higher than the  preceding month or in the following month  Next we go to October; the rate of growth in  October was higher than in the preceding month or in the following month     Next we go to January 1977, and the rate of growth in the preceding month was higher, not  lower; the rate of growth in the following month was lower  So this pattern is only partially  repeated  Next we go to April 1977, and the rate of growth in the preceding month was lower;  the rate of growth in the following month was also lower  Next we go to July, and the rate of  growth in the preceding month was lower, and presumably our staff will testify to the rate of  growth in August being lower     So you have here something approaching a repetitive movement, a quarterly seasonal  pattern, except for one partial deviation  In six observations, 5-1/2 [observations] were  consistent with the hypothesis of a seasonal in these seasonally adjusted figures, and half an  observation was inconsistent with that interpretation  Well, I’m making life no easier for any of  us--yes, Mr Wallich    Exactly right    All right, thank you, Mr Wallich  Mr Volcker now, please    That last I don’t see  If the economy slowed down and we became  concerned about the degree of retardation of the expansion that was occurring, then presumably  market rates would be moving down    Not only a fine judgment, but it’s a [unintelligible] very, very  difficult to, given specific facts, very difficult to--    That’s not the rule under which we function    Well, I thank you, Mr Volcker  Mr Winn now, please    All right, thank you, Mr Winn  Mr Guffey now, please    Thank you, Mr Guffey  Mr Balles, please, now    Very good  Thank you, Mr Balles  Mr Roos now, please    Thank you, Mr Roos  Mr Jackson now, please    Thank you, Mr Jackson  Mr Gardner now, please    Thank you, Mr Gardner  We still haven’t heard from Mr Mayo    Thank you, Mr Mayo  Mr Lilly now, please    Thank you very much  Mr Van Nice, please    Well, I appreciate, really, what you say about the discount rate, but  let me remind you that the discount rate went to 8 percent in 1974 at a time when the prime rate  was 12, and the commercial paper rate 12-1/2, and the federal funds rate a little higher than 13   Let me remind you that the 8 percent discount rate was the highest in our nation’s history  Let  me remind you that the next highest, if my memory is correct, occurred in 1920, when Governor  Harding was the head of the Federal Reserve System  Let me remind you, finally, that he lost his  head soon after the rate moved to 7 percent  Now this is just a recital of some more or less  connected historical facts    Well, the discount rate is a headache  Some central banks have  tried to get rid of that headache by adjusting the discount rate mechanically to market interest  rates  We debated that, and we have felt on balance that we would be giving up an instrument of  policy that is useful at certain times     Gentlemen, we have to reach a decision  The discussion that we have had today ought to  make all of us feel humble with regard to the task before us  There are differences among us   They are not really very large  No one of us can justly claim that he’s glimpsed more than a part  of the truth  And no one of us can claim that he’s glimpsed more than a part of the future  There  is a considerable sentiment for a 0 to 5 or 0 to 6 percent rate of growth for M1  There is a  preponderance of sentiment in favor of a 3 to 8 range, I think, for M2  As for the federal funds  rate, there is an equal division within the Committee between a range of 5-3/4 and 6-1/4 and  5-3/4 and 6-1/2  I would advise the [Committee] that we not go above 6-1/4 at this time, and if  the rate of growth of the money supply comes in at the high end, I think you have found that I’m  not tardy in advising the Committee by telegram as to further action     We have made a significant move, as Governor Lilly summed up quite accurately and  succinctly  The economy is not so obviously strong that a further move of 1/2 percent[age point]  should be lightly contemplated or readily contemplated  I would advise that we stay with 5-3/4  to 6-1/4, bearing in mind that, if the rate of growth reaches the limits of our monetary aggregates     8/16/77 - 53 -           target ranges, we can confer once again and decide if  the sentiment of the Committee is to go  higher    It is consistent  Well, let me suggest, then, a 0 to 5 range for M1  and a 3 to 8 range for M2, and a 5-3/4 to 6-1/4 range for the federal funds rate  Now as to the  directive, I think there is a narrow range [for federal funds, which] logically would suggest a  money market directive  On the other hand, if we are willing to use that range, and I think that is  the sentiment of the Committee, a monetary aggregates directive--in spite of the smallness of the  range--would be indicated  And I sense, having listened to all of you, that that is probably the  sentiment of majority of this Committee  Yes, Mr Guffey    You see, the difference between the two is that you move much  more slowly to utilize the full range with a money market directive than with a monetary  aggregates directive  Is that a correct explanation, Mr Sternlight?    I would think so    Why not take the symmetrical midpoints?     8/16/77 - 54 -            Gentlemen, let’s have a show of hands  Those who would prefer a  money market directive    Those who would prefer a monetary aggregates directive    Well, gentlemen, if I may, I would suggest we vote on the  following  a monetary aggregates directive; an M1 growth range of 0 to 5; an M2 growth range  of 3 to 8; and a federal funds rate range of 5-3/4 to 6-1/4, with the understanding that if we get  into a high growth rate area, that the Chairman, as I believe he has done consistently, will  continue to do his duty  Any--    Well, I don’t want to be that precise, because the figures are never  that precise, you see, but I don’t think I have been tardy with any frequency at either end  And I  don’t want to be tied down any more rigidly, or have the Desk tied down to the tenth of a  decimal    Well let me, let me  I don’t think really we ought to be getting  into the habit of dissenting on minutiae  I don’t think it serves a constructive purpose  Let me  have a show of hands, that is to say, I thought that the adjustment from 0 to 5 [for M1] was  designed to accomplish what 5-3/4 to 6-1/2 [for the federal funds rate] would accomplish  I’m  willing to continue this discussion, but I would counsel my colleagues to dissent only on matters  of principle and not on minutiae  I don’t think it helps    Would you want me to test sentiment any further, or--apparently  not, so let’s call the roll    Well now, we will finally break for luncheon, and then we have  an--yes, we have to decide--let me find out about members of the Committee  Any of you have  to get away very early?  Would 230 leave us enough room for luncheon, or would you prefer  245?    We will reassemble at 230 then   [Lunch recess]   [Executive session]    Gentlemen, this is a meeting of the Committee in executive  session  And we have a Freedom of Information [Act] [FOIA] item which Mr O’Connell will  describe to the Committee  Actually, he has prepared a memorandum which sets forth the facts,  I think, quite fully  But I will call on Mr O’Connell to summarize the question that is before us  and give us his own best thought on the subject from a legal point of view, certainly  And any  policy guidance that Mr O’Connell may wish to give us would also be proper  Do you want to  proceed Tom?    Thank you, Mr O’Connell  I think before we start discussing the  question, I want to make a few general comments  First of all, you may be interested in knowing  that during the markup of the recent Federal Reserve Reform Act by the House Banking  Committee, a suggestion was made by Congressman Hannaford to the effect that we return to the  Memorandum of Discussion, which we had abandoned, and that a statute be adopted by the  Congress which would protect this Committee from access to such a document or such  Memoranda under the Freedom of Information Act  In other words, the statute or statutes would  require that we return to the Memorandum of Discussion, that we release it after an interval of  five years, and that this power be ours, all other statutes to the contrary notwithstanding     Now, I wasn’t present at the time of the markup  This was a new proposal  It had not been  discussed previously among members of the [House] committee or with us, and the committee  decided to postpone deliberations of it until members of the committee had had an opportunity to  learn the Federal Reserve’s view and crystallize their own thinking  I thought you ought to  know about that, and I do not mean to suggest that we discuss this now  It isn’t necessary to  discuss it now  On the contrary, my suggestion is that we definitely not discuss it now  But I do  [think] that it is [an] interesting proposal  If we had had the feeling of protection that we could  go along as we had, we would not have, as a Committee, abandoned the Memorandum of  Discussion  We did it only as a reaction to the judicial proceeding that has been started  So I  think, before too long, we ought to discuss the Hannaford proposal     My second suggestion to the Committee would be that we deal exclusively today with the  New York Times proposal and not get into the question [of] whether there should be a release of  Committee deliberations in years other than 1972; that we confine our discussion to the year  1972  In making that suggestion, I realize perfectly well that what we decide to do with regard     8/16/77 - 58 -           to 1972 may have some implications to some degree with regard to later years  But I’m trying to  be practical, and that is, I think that if we try to discuss not only the release of 1972 Memoranda,  but also the Memoranda for later years, I think we’ll have a very long and drawn-out discussion,  and perhaps we want to do a little more deliberating  And we could return to that a month from  now if the Committee so desires  But my suggestion would be that we confine ourselves to the  request of the New York Times which relates solely to 1972   Now I want to make two additional comments with regard to the request of the New York  Times  I think we should recognize very explicitly that the five-year rule which the Committee  adopted was not adopted in a moment of whim  It was not adopted capriciously  The rule may  or may not be a good rule  It may or may not have been a good rule at the time it was adopted   It may or may not be a good rule today  But it was a rule adopted after thorough deliberation on  the part of this Committee  That’s point one, to keep carefully in mind     Second, the rules adopted by this Committee are not adopted for all time  These rules are  subject to change  But in considering a change in the rule, I think we ought to recognize very  explicitly that a political dimension attaches to the request by the New York Times  And unless  we recognize that and try to think clearly about that, we may not reach the sort of decision to  which we always aspire, namely, a decision that is impartial, that is objective, that is not subject  to political use or political abuse  That’s all I want to say on the subject at this time  And I  probably will have more to say later on  But now, perhaps, before we turn to a discussion, it  might be desirable to put questions to Mr O’Connell or possibly to me in so far as I’m capable  of dealing with them  Mr Kimbrel, you had a question, I believe    Well, there is very little uncertainty about that  The request came  originally--Joe, do you want to recite the history of that request, and then what the New York  Times fellow did?    I don’t know the answer    Well, we don’t need to find out  I mean it’s been adopted some  years ago    I would have guessed that it was done before 1970    It would be exactly five by then    To the best of my knowledge, we’ve done it on a strictly uniform  basis    To the best of my knowledge    The rule is not merely the language of the rule, but how the rule  has been observed in practice for a good many years now  I think that’s a fair interpretation    I think that Mr Coldwell’s letter must be followed up by another  letter which will indicate this Committee’s decision on the request    I think that Mr O’Connell’s legal opinion is perfect  I think it’s a  wise pronouncement, and I think we ought to strive for a consensus rather than engage in formal  voting on this issue    As I understand Mr O’Connell, he’s indicated that if we do deny  the request by the New York Times and if the New York Times should proceed to take judicial  action, something that is quite uncertain at the present time, then at such a time we could  reconsider  In other words, we might deny today  The New York Times might or might not go  forward with a lawsuit  The informal indications are that there will be no lawsuit, but that may  turn out to be a--    No, no we haven’t changed the five-year rule    I know, but the Hannaford amendment provides us with an  opportunity to return to the Memorandum of Discussion if we so wished    Well that is the purpose, and it’s a purpose that this Committee in  the past regarded very favorably    Well, now, Mr Hannaford has ideas in addition to the  Memorandum  He not only has an idea with regard to the Memorandum of Discussion, he has  all sorts of ideas, and undoubtedly, if we wanted to go forward with Mr Hannaford’s suggestion  with regard to the Memorandum of Discussion, I think we might--I’d be surprised if we would  not succeed in having him confine himself to that one suggestion  But that might or might not be  the case  The fact that he has more than one idea merely means he’s like the rest of us  He’s got  all kinds of ideas in his head    I don’t think there’s much of a mystery about this New York Times  request  And the political dimension to me is perfectly obvious  The fact that you raised the  question means that it’s not obvious to you, and the same may be true of other members of the  Committee, and perhaps, therefore, I ought to say a word about that to make at least my own  meaning clear     I believe that every now and then each of us reads one or another newspaper or listens to  discussions over TV  And our journalists, our news commentators, finding a need to write or  finding a need to talk, and there not being sufficient news on hand, have chosen to devote some  of their energy to the question of whether the present Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board  will or will not be reappointed by President Carter  So this question now and then is discussed  by members of the press  That’s point number one     Point number two, there has been some speculation on the part of some journalists, some  members of the Congress, some members of our general citizenry to the effect that in 1972, the  Federal Open Market Committee, having as its Chairman a certain individual, was inclined to do  what it could to promote the reelection of a certain gentlemen [named] Richard M Nixon as  President  So the political dimension here is, I think quite obvious--to get hold of the  Memorandum of Discussion, to go through it and see whether that Memorandum of Discussion  validates or repudiates that speculation  That is a political dimension  That was made quite clear  in the article that, what’s the fellow’s name, Hershey--    --[that] this New York Times fellow wrote for the New York Times   The article proved to be a completed dud  But it might not have been  But the political  dimension goes further  Let me speak in a purely personal vein, since the political dimension  happens to apply to the Committee as a whole, but primarily to me personally     As far as I’m concerned personally, my cast of mind being what it is, I don’t like to live  with problems, I like to solve them, and to the extent that this is troublesome to anybody of  suspicious--get the thing out, and there’s nothing in that record that would concern me for one  moment  Now, obviously any record can be interpreted one way or interpreted another way   Well, that’s life, and that’s the way books are read and articles are read     But, you see, continuing in a personal vein, if the Committee decided to release these 1972  minutes, [let me say] why, quite apart from other reasons, I think it shouldn’t be done  This     8/16/77 - 66 -           could be interpreted as an effort on the part of the Chairman of that Committee to have that  document in the open so that Mr Carter and his henchmen in the White House will see that the  Chairman’s record in 1972 was an honorable record  I don’t have to prove my personal honor   Now, whether I’m interested in what Mr Carter wants to do about the Chairmanship, and what  the Chairman himself wants to see happen, are things that no one in this room knows anything  about  And no one is going to know until the time comes  But I would hate to see personally  any such actions by the Committee interpreted as an attempt by the Chairman to throw this  document into the public arena so that everyone would see that he has honorable credentials   I’m not looking for that and I don’t think it’s a good thing for this Committee to lend itself to  what is so obviously, at least to me, a half-hearted political effort on the part of this or that  individual in the New York Times  Well, that’s the political dimension as I see it    Well, this is something the Committee may or may not want to do   I think it’s something we ought to deliberate on very closely  I would hate to see this Committee  really change its rules in the kind of political environment that exists  Now, let’s assume for the  moment that the present Chairman seeks reappointment  That’s an assumption  Let’s make that  assumption  Let’s assume, next, that President Carter is concerned about the record in 1972   That’s quite an assumption  There is not one ounce of evidence to indicate that  President  Carter, if he wanted access to the Memoranda for 1972, if such a request came, I’d say we ought  to telephone members of the Committee immediately with my recommendation that the  President of the United States should have access, of course he should     Now next, as far as the appointment of the next Chairman of the Federal Reserve is  concerned, that is something that the President can do today, and that is something he may not  do by February 1st  After all, he hasn’t yet appointed the new director of the Federal Bureau of  Investigation  And therefore, if the 1972 document were of interest to the President, let us say,  and for the regular performance of his duties, he could have it immediately  Oh, and he’ll  certainly have it on January 1st    But it was a decision not reached capriciously, and if that rule is  going to be changed, the next question is whether we have the right political environment for  changing that decision right now  And as for your decision, you made your decision, you turned  it down, which was within your power, and you referred it to this Committee--or rather, I  referred it to the Committee, not you, following your suggestion, which I thought was a very  proper one    Yes, but that five months applies to the other way too Why can’t  they have patience for another five months  Why?  But they are going to get it by January, why  can’t they be patient?  Why should we deviate from a rule that we’ve established, in a political  environment that could lead to mischief as far as interpretation of this [Committee’s] action is  concerned    Well, now, but your statement is inaccurate    Under the Freedom of Information Act, we’ve had one court  decision, and according to that court decision, what the New York Times is entitled to is a  fragmented document    Well, I have not heard that legal opinion    Well, I thought the Department’s position was a matter of policy  rather than a matter of law    Well, that I can’t say  My own recollection may easily be  imperfect  I believe that the five-year rule was in effect at the time I joined the System  The  Memorandum of Discussion was discussed from time to time informally within the System; the  only formal discussion that I can recall on the part of this Committee of the Memorandum of  Discussion in [regard to] the five-year rule arose out of the lawsuit that came from this outfit in  Georgetown    Now, I think there can only be one answer to your question--of  course that could happen  But I think that this comment of yours [should] be placed in context   We have outstanding three requests from Mr Reuss, which as yet have not been granted  One  request is that the 28 items that were deleted from the--28 out of some 500 or 600 deletions--28  items that Mr Reuss, out of some 900, wanted us to disclose  And that request has not yet been  granted     Number two, Mr Reuss has made a request that the minutes of District Bank boards for  three additional years be made available to him  That request has not yet been granted  Number  three, Mr Reuss has requested that [Federal Reserve] Board minutes for the past six years or  thereabouts be made available to him, and that request has not yet been granted  Not only that,  but a letter will go to Mr Reuss indicating that these are matters that cause great difficulty and  that I want to go over these problems with him once again     Now my point is that we’ve not acceded very lightly, at least as far as I’m  concerned--protecting the System to the best of my ability and drawing on the advice of my  colleagues constantly; and we’re not going to accede quickly or easily  In other words, if we  acceded to such a congressional request--pure fishing expedition--the next thing may be a  request for all interoffice memoranda, the next would be for all incoming and outgoing  correspondence with regard to the Board, with regard to the Banks, and therefore, Mr Reuss  who has abused the documents that were sent him, the minutes for the first three years, is not  going to get additional documents quickly or easily  I wanted to bring out these facts in relation  to your specific comment  Well, gentlemen, any additional view on this?    Well, we have to seek the consensus    I will answer that, the other interpretation could be put on it, but as  far as that other interpretation is concerned, that other interpretation involves two individuals  primarily, the President and myself  And I’ve already covered the President’s part  I’m not  going to cover my own  Now, as far as my feelings are concerned, from a purely personal  viewpoint, I would want to get this out of the way and let’s stop the nonsense  But I think for us  to permit ourselves to be driven by the winds of political controversy, for us to depart from a rule  simply because of a whim on the part of this or that newspaperman, for us to change a rule in the  kind of political setting that exists would be extremely unwise    Well, I think we ought to consider that, but I do think that there is  some great force in Governor Gardner’s observation  And we ought not to abandon a long  standing rule lightly just because there happens to be an environment right now for disclosure of  this, disclosure of that  The present environment, I think, is going to change  Because some  damage is being done by the kind of suspicion that is being generated, so that people no longer  trust one another the way they used to  And I think we’ve reached a point in our political society  where there’ll be a revulsion of feeling against excessive disclosure  And after all, you know, as  far as we’re concerned, we disclose all of our doings, but with certain lags that we think serve  the purpose of uninhibited discussion and that do not affect markets to the disadvantage of this or  that group in the economy  Well, gentlemen, this is your decision and--    Well, let’s not make pronouncements about anybody accusing us  or not accusing us  We live in a political world where anything at all might happen in the way of  accusations    Well, there is first the uncertainty about being sued  Second, if we  were to turn this down, there is the possibility of changing our view after legal proceedings are  started, and that is something that is done all the time in the practical world  There is, third, the  possibility of fighting this in a court of law  And the real question before us is what we decide to  do today  We’re not going to act on the Hannaford amendment  I think that’s clear  I think it     8/16/77 - 72 -           would be unwise to act on minutes or Memoranda of Discussion for years other than 1972  I  think we have been focusing primarily, and I think correctly, on the request for the 1972  Memoranda  Now let’s have a show of hands now whether we want to grant the New York  Times request or not    We have to follow up the letter that Mr Coldwell sent, and we  have to indicate whether this Committee--you see, Mr Coldwell’s letter referred to the request  being submitted to this Committee for action  And therefore we have to inform the New York  Times whether this Committee is granting the request for the 1972 Memoranda or is denying it   In other words, whether it is confirming Mr Coldwell’s decision or is granting the request    Well, that’s up to the Committee    Well, I hope we don’t vote  I think we ought to arrive at a  consensus    Well, he could be advised more specifically  It will be available  January 1, so that they can spend New Year’s Day--we might give it to them New Year’s Eve,  let them celebrate New Year’s Eve    Well, I don’t really know whether they want to use it for political  mischief or not  All that I know is that this fellow Hershey, who did want to use it for what I  interpret--and I think that Joe will join me in that interpretation--has mischief of some sort,  political or otherwise    Well, but, I think--    Well, it’s a possible course of action, but I doubt that we ought to,  at this late hour, reach any such decision without the most careful deliberation and without  taking into account and appraising the Hannaford possibility  Now this may well be a decision  that, after we spend a morning or a day on this whole question, a month from now perhaps, we     8/16/77 - 74 -           may want to reach that decision  I, for one, I don’t feel ready to reach the decision to release all  of those and to throw away--I wouldn’t want to throw away so quickly the Hannaford possibility     If that Hannaford possibility had been open to us at the time when we were debating the  desirability of continuing or dropping the Memorandum of Discussion, I have little doubt as to  how the Committee would have acted at that time  Some of us were--I remember you, Mr  Baughman, were very eloquent on the desirability of getting rid of it  But I didn’t gauge the  sentiment of the Committee as a whole being that at the time, and I think certainly the majority  of the Committee would have voted for the retention of the Memorandum of Discussion if we  had the Hannaford protection at that time    Well, I think that’s fair    Some kind of what?    Well, will someone make a motion, whatever it may be, and  we’ll--    Well, without voting formally, can we have a show of hands  indicating whether or not such a consensus exists    Members of the Committee only, yes    Well, I think I have to interpret that as a clear majority  I have to  interpret that as the closest consensus that we could get out of this meeting  Let me just check;  those who are opposed to Mr Gardner’s motion will raise their hands    Three, well--     8/16/77 - 75 -            Well, I think I should write that letter  Anything else to come up?  "
496,1977-09-20,"  Well, the first item on the agenda is perennial--the minutes of the  last meeting  Any motion to approve?   SPEAKER(?)  So move   SPEAKER(?)  Seconded    All right, we’ve had a motion to approve the minutes; no objection  has been registered  We will proceed with the foreign currency operations  Yes, Alan, please  proceed    What is the total now, Alan?    All right, thank you  Any questions?  Yes, Mr Wallich    Any other question at this time?  Very well, a motion to approve  the transactions of the foreign Desk is now in order   SPEAKER(?)  So moved    A motion has been made    And seconded [unintelligible] approved  Do you have any  recommendations, Mr Holmes?    Very well  Mr Kichline, please, we are ready for your report on  the economy    Thank you, Mr Kichline  Well, we’re ready for the dialogue on  the state of the economy  Who would like to speak first?  Good, Mr Baughman, please    Are you speaking of exploratory activity or production?    Thank you, Mr Baughman  Mr Black, may we hear from you?    Any other comments, Mr Black?    Thank you  Mr Coldwell, please    Have you read Herbert Stein’s recent article in the Wall Street  Journal?    He argues we’re in full employment now  What’s wrong with that  argument, if anything?    Well, you don’t have to hear it; read that article    Let me ask--if you pay attention to the wealth factor, do you  include in wealth the value of dwellings?    And doesn’t that more than offset what has been happening in the  stock market?     9/20/77 - 7 -    Well, I was really thinking of a formal point only  Namely your  econometric model  You did include the value of dwellings    Do you include the value of farm property?    All right, thank you, Mr Coldwell  Mr Eastburn, may we hear  from you?    Perhaps I might comment at this time on the cloud that seems to  surround our numbers  You may recall [that] last year we looked at successive quarterly figures  of real GNP  The increases showed progressive diminution, and there was great concern toward  the end of the year about the slowing of the economy and about the possible onset of a recession   And that of course gave rise to the expansionist program developed by the new Administration   Now what analysts at that time overlooked was the inventory adjustment that was under way in  the economy  And real final sales showed continued strength  In other words, the basic  movement of the economy did not show any deterioration     And apparently a similar development is under way this year  If we look at the real GNP  figures for successive quarters--the first quarter, an increase at an annual rate of 75 percent;  second quarter, 62 percent; third quarter 50 percent estimated by the Commerce Department  and 44 percent estimated by our staff  So you have a progressive diminution of rates of  increase  But once again, if you look at final sales, again in real terms, you find an opposite  picture  In the first quarter, rate of increase of 38 percent; in the second quarter, 51 percent; in  the third quarter, 53 percent according to Commerce and 54 percent according to our staff     And you know, one of the reasons for a dialogue such as we have is that we see the world  differently  Each has his own pair of lenses; we look at different statistics  When I want to  judge the underlying trend, I like to take inventory movement out of the picture  Now, of course,  I don’t forget about it       9/20/77 - 9 -   There is one other statistical exercise that I had the staff engage in [over] the last few days   We see the world through seasonally adjusted figures, and the art of seasonal adjustment is  highly imperfect  And I’ve been somewhat uneasy about the seasonal adjustment factors that  have been applied to our unemployment series  I asked the staff to undertake some experiments   The seasonal adjustment factor seems to be distorted by very sharp cyclical movements that we  had in 1974 and ’75  And if you use the seasonal that was applied in 1973, the picture on  unemployment, whether you looked at insured unemployment or total unemployment as reported  by the Census Bureau, changes dramatically  And the deterioration that you see in the published  figures vanishes  And I haven’t had a chance to follow this up sufficiently, but the member of  the staff who made this calculation told me that, using another seasonal calculation--a constant  seasonal that covers the past 11 years--you get precisely the same results, as I understood it, that  he obtained by using the 1973 seasonal     Gentlemen, I’m not reporting the truth, I’m merely recording another way of looking at the  facts in a search for truth  We’ll move on to Mr Wallich, please    All right  Mr Morris next, please     9/20/77 - 10 -    I’d like to comment, if I may, on what Mr Morris has just said   First, one point where I basically agree--I think consumer credit is in a dangerous area, and I  don’t agree with Mr Kichline one bit  I read the evidence quite differently  Secondly, the  contrast between stock exchange securities and dwellings  There, I differ with both Mr Kichline  and--well, I think they’re right, but I think they’re exaggerating the difference  Dwellings have  become a major source of liquidity for consumers; refinancing of mortgages is taking place on a  very extensive scale  Second mortgages at high interest rates are being entered into extensively,  and those who’ve engaged in this refinancing activity or getting the second mortgage, they talk  to others, so that what used to be an illiquid item of wealth is increasingly taking on a liquidity  dimension  And I think we ought to keep that in mind    Well, favorable from one point of view, very unfavorable from  another  But I wasn’t commenting on that; I was merely commenting that it has taken on  liquidity dimensions    Mr Gardner, please    Federal government--     9/20/77 - 13 -    All right, we will move on now to Mr Partee  We will hear from  you    Except that I quarreled only with one point, his comment on  consumer credit    Thank you, Mr Partee  Mr Winn, please    Thank you, Mr Winn  Mr Willes, please    Yes, I will be glad to    Well, you know, on a global basis, the successive surveys have  been showing increases in the expected rate of increase in business capital spending  Now, the   progression has had a modest upward slope, but it definitely has had the uniform upward slope   But what you say about Minnesota sounds as if Texas is going to take second place    Mr Guffey    Clarifying--this discussion has also served to clarify the distinction  between the capital and the income  In terms of capital, many farmers have become millionaires  recently  On the other hand, as far as income is concerned, income has been on the low side and  declining  I think Mr Guffey is right that scissors move  That inequality can’t last forever  At  one point, either income will rise to justify the capital value or capital values will go down  But  it may take a long time before that happens    That’s right, but honestly, I don’t know what is wrong with  people  Why don’t they enjoy it now?  Mr Balles, may we hear from you on your views on the  economy, or any questions you may want to put to the staff    Incidentally, the point is now being made about the so-called $50  rebate  If that had gone through, the inventory adjustment would have been all the sharper    To start thinking; not about that    I’m going to make an extreme comment  I think these fellows  ought to be ashamed of themselves, because they don’t have a shred of fact to support any of  this  And they are just playing a con game  I think it’s a disgrace    That’s just what I firmly believe    You know--I don’t know, I don’t know  I sometimes get  discouraged  When are we going to learn that we don’t know how to attach numbers to future  events?    No    We can supplement an adjective with an adverb  Well, thank you,  Mr Balles  We will hear from Mr Kimbrel, and we will break for lunch  I mean coffee--it  might not be a bad idea    Well, gentlemen, we’ll break for coffee   [Coffee break]    Mr Black, would you be good enough to lead off the second  installment of our discussion of the national economy?    All right, thank you, Mr Black  Mr Volcker     9/20/77 - 22 -    I’d like to comment on the question  I think the immediate  prospect has been well described by Paul and by others, but what I see happening around the  world is a basic improvement  It may not express itself quickly, but a financial foundation for  improvement in real economic activity, a financial foundation, has been laid  Now that’s clearly  true of Great Britain, it’s true of France, it’s true of Italy, it’s true of Mexico, it may or may not  be true of other countries, which I haven’t been following closely  The rate of wage increase is  coming down  The rate of inflation is coming down, the rate of increase in the money supply is  coming down  The foreign trade balance improving, the exchange rate position improving  So I  don’t feel unhappy about the sluggishness of the outside economy, because I think the basis for  later improvement is in the process of being laid    Well, it’s true of the UK clearly  It’s true to a lesser degree of  Italy, but it is true of Italy, it’s true to a lesser degree of France  I went over the French record  very carefully the other day  I think it’s true of Mexico, though the evidence there is less clear  I  think we ought to keep that in mind    I have not followed developments there  I think I’d like to  have--Mr Truman here?    I’d like to have the outside economy reviewed from the viewpoint  I’ve just presented  What the staff has a habit of doing is looking at the real economy, that’s  good  But I think that the financial foundation of real economic activity--never mind whether  your interpretation is the same as mine, you see--whether these countries around the world are or  are not in process of straightening out their financial position  Would you be good enough to  undertake a survey like that?  Cover not only the obvious countries but some of the lesser?    Well, we’ve got to stop somewhere  I’ll leave that to the  discretion of our staff    That’s true  But I don’t think the world is going to change  because of what happens in Turkey  It may change because of what happens in Italy or France   Thank you Mr Volcker for your comments  And now Mr Lilly    Well, I agree with that, except we have done it in the past, you  know, by making recommendations  I’m not suggesting that we do that    We consider recommending  If and when we do reach that point,  and I hope we don’t reach it in any near future, but if and when we do, then the recommendation  would be useless unless it becomes specific  The fellows over there, you know, they’re  struggling with that question, you see  And they don’t know how to develop an incomes policy,  a specific incomes policy  They’d like to do it--a specific incomes policy that would be  workable and that could have fairly wide support  This is the [unintelligible]    At this time    Well, the incomes policy has so many facets  I see nothing wrong  with continuing to fight the mad minimum wage proposals and some of us die-hard  conservatives--they still exist--almost won a victory in the House of Representatives  The  sentiment is changing  People are beginning to learn  In fact, we had a Secretary of Labor for  the very first time declare publicly that an increase in the minimum wage will cause  unemployment  Of course, since this is a scientific or pseudoscientific age, he had a precise  number--90,000 will lose their jobs  Now the rest of his prescription is something else again   Well, I’m praising Secretary Marshall  I do that very rarely, and I’ll stop at this point    Beg your pardon?    I did  I did  And in fairness to the truth, Mr Marshall went on to  say, the fact that the increase in the minimum wage will cause unemployment is no reason for  not doing it  On the contrary, justice requires that we do it  And we being a government all  powerful, having created unemployment, can set about methodically to offset the unemployment  that we ourselves have caused by spending several billion dollars on the Youth Corps and  whatnot  Well, I’ve told the whole story now    Mr Guffey, please    By “enjoy” do you mean they really believe it--    --or do you mean more than that?    How did the loss of lives occur?    And that--were people drowned?    All right, any other comment on the economy?  Well, we’ve ended  our economic discussion on a note of sadness, but I think this is one of the most interesting  economic discussions we’ve had in recent months  Well, we’ll move on with Mr Sternlight’s  statement    Thank you, Mr Sternlight  Mr Black, please    All right, thank you  Mr Wallich now, please    All right  Mr Coldwell, please    Any other questions or comments?  Yes, Mr Black    You’ve got to watch time--    Mr Roos, please    Well, there is also the question of what has been happening to the  monetary aggregates  If you look at M1, which I think is what you did tacitly, Mr Roos, the  story is very disconcerting from the point of many of us, certainly mine  But if you look at M2,  we can take a little comfort  Let’s not take too much comfort, but look at the evolution  On page  4 of the Bluebook, you have a useful summary  Look at M1 during ’75 and ’76; the rate of  growth was 52 percent  For the past 12 months, 71 percent; past 6 months, 91; past 3 months,  95  It’s a very uncomfortable record  Well, now, look at M2 at 1975 and ’76, 104  For the past  12 months, 109; past 6 months, 99; past 3 months, 105  There you have a record of remarkable  stability    Well, without accepting the “alarmingly”--I don’t get alarmed  easily--it’s disconcerting, but I attach more importance to monetary aggregates than I do to the  monetary base  Now I may be mistaken about this, but that is the way I have become  accustomed to using monetary statistics    Well, there are no further questions to Mr Sternlight--    Motion to ratify what Mr Sternlight has told us we’re doing   SPEAKER(?)  So moved    That motion’s approved  Then let’s listen to you, Mr Axilrod    All right, thank you, Mr Axilrod  Any questions?    Let me rephrase your question, and I may run the risk of  misrepresenting your thoughts, but do stop me if I do that  We set, let us say, a certain goal for  ourselves for the rate of growth in M1  And if we were determined to achieve that rate of growth  without regard to other factors or consequences, I think we could come very close to that  I  don’t have much doubt about that  Now let me turn to Mr Axilrod  Would you dispute what  I’ve said?     9/20/77 - 33 -    I think that’s a useful qualification  I think we could do it  But I  don’t think that we have that degree of determination with regard to a given targeted figure And  I would question whether we should  Our job is not to worship at the shrine of a specific number  that we agree upon at a given time  To the extent that we are going to worship at any shrine, our  shrine is the performance of the economy  And we’re doing our very best, you see, by tolerating  some excesses, tolerating shortcomings, using our best judgment, which may be mistaken    I’d say it is, but there is a question as to how much dislocation  you’d be willing to cause, and at what time    Mr Wallich    Now I have to stop you  What does that mean?    No, no I still have to stop you  What does that mean?    Well, Henry, I still don’t know the question  You don’t know  which it is at any given time with any certainty--whether it’s a random movement or the  beginning of a new trend or a continuation of an existing trend    But what I’m saying is, if you could identify these movements as  random or otherwise, our problem would be very simple  Our problem is so difficult precisely  because we don’t quite know how to do that    Yes, but then I don’t know what your question is  I thought your  question assumed that we’re able to distinguish and identify properly    If you know that they are random  But if you don’t know that,  that’s where you have your problem    Mr Axilrod, the baby is yours    I don’t know that I would accept that  The people may change  their habits once again and in the process of building up too much money, that money will do its  work later on without raising [unintelligible]    You mean a permanent change    I know, but the trouble is, in the real world these changes are short  lived and we have oscillation    And that evidence is short lived?    Evidence for six months?    Well, did you say preoccupation of keeping interest rates down?   I’m not aware of any such preoccupation on the part of this Committee    We could make a choice  When you speak of a choice, one  certainly can avoid either extreme  There is some middle ground one may want to choose  And     9/20/77 - 38 -   it may be the better part of wisdom  Before we’re through this morning, I’m going to urge just  that    Well, neither has Mr Wallich, if I understood him correctly  It  was an “if” proposition    And you put even that in “if” terms    We talk about money, we talk about monetary growth, and  implicit in all of this is acceptance of M1, whereas this Committee decided some time ago to  attach equal weight to M1 and M2, which means we’ve moved away from M1  And there is     9/20/77 - 39 -   some thinking in this Committee, which I share, that we may perhaps want to move further in the  direction of M2  So let’s not implicitly wed ourselves to M1 in view of the fact that we’ve  abandoned exclusive reliance on M1    Mr Black?    Well, I’ve got that here, and I’ll look it up  In the meantime, let’s  have Governor Jackson’s comments    Mr Black raised the question about the rate of growth of a  modified M1, the one that I referred to at the last meeting, for the month of August  Now the  modified M1 concept is as follows  You start with our conventional M1 magnitude, then you  add to it deposits of state and local government, and then you add to it business savings deposits,  and then you add NOW accounts  These three items are added and then you exclude two items--  demand deposits due to foreign commercial banks and demand deposits due to foreign official  institutions  That is the definition of a modified M1, or one of the modified M1s that I referred  to at the last meeting     Now you may recall that the present M1 [growth] figure for June was 45 percent, and the  modified M1 figure was 18  For July, our M1 figure was 183, and the modified M1 figure was  119  For August, the relationship, or the direction of the differential, is reversed  Our M1  figure is 55, and the modified M1 is 68     Gentlemen, it’s approximately one o’clock  And I think it would be best to postpone our  discussion of current monetary policy, what it should be  And if that is agreeable, unless there  are further questions to Mr Axilrod, let us break for lunch now  And we should reconvene  at--not too late  Is two o’clock realistic or is 215 more realistic?    Let’s say at two o’clock, and we’ll start promptly at 215   [Lunch recess]    Gentlemen, no matter what that clock might say, it’s 215, and  now we’re ready to start our monetary policy discussion  Let me say a few words by way of  getting our discussion going  The Federal Reserve is passing through a difficult time in regard to  policy, and I think the country is passing through a difficult time  We’re urged by the monetarist  school to stick to some predetermined rate of growth of something called the money supply and     9/20/77 - 41 -   to forget entirely about interest rates  At the other extreme, we’re urged by the Keynesian school  to freeze interest rates or keep them low or not permit them to rise significantly--the Keynesians  make great assumptions about our power with regard to interest rates--and let the money supply  do what it may  I don’t think that we can follow one theological school’s advice any more than  the other school’s advice  Our concern is the economy; we have to pay attention to its behavior,  to our ongoing institution, and we can’t become victims of any particular theology     I indicated earlier that, without arguing the case, I’m moderately optimistic about the  economy  But if I were to argue the case, I would have to indicate that there are uncertainties,  there are points of weakness that we should not ignore  And I would have to argue further that  interest rates do matter, and that any substantial rise of interest rates, whether originating in  causes independent of the Federal Reserve or originating in their own actions, should be of  concern to us  I also would have to argue that the increase in the rate of growth of M1 is  concerning, very troublesome--those I pointed out in the morning session  The rate of growth of  M2 has been remarkably stable, and the like is true of the rate of growth of M3  Nevertheless,  both M2 and M3, while their rate of growth has been stable, have been growing, I think, too  rapidly     Now I think the best that we can do in the present circumstances is to find some middle  ground, and that is my own thinking  I would suggest that, in working on instructions to the  New York Desk, we might proceed as follows  As far as M1 is concerned, the rate of growth  might be 2 to 7 percent, or 3 to 7 percent for the September-October period  We might aim at  that  M2, perhaps 4 to 8 percent, and the federal funds rate might be 5-3/4 to 6-1/2 or 6 to 6-1/2   I think it would be wiser to do the latter  The federal funds rate now is 6-1/8  In view of the  rapid increase in the money supply that we’ve had, it would probably be unwise to let it slip back  to 5-3/4 even if the rate of growth of the monetary aggregates were very low in the next few  weeks  I think we could live very comfortably with extremely low rates of growth in the money  supply over the next few weeks  Well, that’s my best thinking, [so] let’s turn to the Committee   Mr Jackson, please    All right  I’m a little troubled, not by your prescription, but by the  route that you get there  That is, I’m a little troubled by your reasoning  Let’s say that the rate  of growth--let’s just look at M1--is 7 percent, which was my suggested upper limit  Then  presumably Alan and Peter at that time would be 6-3/8, 6-1/2 perhaps, well--    Well, 6-1/4, they’d have to move on the federal funds rate  immediately, which my suggestion would not involve, and that goes contrary to your own  reasoning  You don’t want to disturb the federal funds rate too much    Well, I don’t think any of us would quarrel with that  Mr Partee    4 to 8    Yes, I had that in mind    All right, thank you  And Mr Mayo now, please    All right, thank you, Mr Mayo  Mr Coldwell, please    Thank you, Mr Coldwell  Mr Kimbrel now, please    Thank you, Mr Kimbrel  Mr Eastburn next, please     9/20/77 - 45 -    I would accept the last comment  Thank you, Mr Eastburn  Mr  Volcker now, please    Well, that is something that I don’t think we ought to try to do at  this time  I have great sympathy with that suggestion  But I think that’s something that your  [sub]committee, Mr Partee, should bring a recommendation on very, very soon     9/20/77 - 46 -    Yes  Aren’t you chairman of it?    Well, as the Chairman of the Committee--in view of my  responsibilities, prerogatives--I speak in behalf of the entire Committee when I counsel you to  get busy on that promptly    Well, I don’t think we can afford to change our procedure  We  can change our goals from meeting to meeting, [but] I think we need some stability with regard  to procedure  We’d be lost if we don’t  As to the outcome, I’m leaning increasingly in the  direction of giving more weight to M2  But I want that to be weighed by our staff, I want this to  be weighed by our [sub]committee  I want the decision to be reached, and then we live with that  decision for some time before changing again  Well, the Committee will do what it chooses to  do  I have expressed my view  Anything else?    Thank you very much  Mr Morris next, please    To maintain our credibility, what does that mean?  First, we want  the market and the country at large to take seriously our protestation, since we believe in it  seriously, as we are determined to do what we can to help unwind the inflation  All right, that’s  essential to maintain credibility  [It] is equally essential to be alive to what is happening in the  real economy; to the extent that you have elements of weakness in the economy, if we ignore  those, there will be no gain in credibility for the System     Responsible people across the country will scratch their heads and say, Don’t these people  know what is happening in the real economy?  Don’t they care?  So it’s not a one-way street   Credibility requires that we work on both dimensions and achieve as wise a compromise, if that  be the right term, take into account both factors, as we just have  I think each of us is trying to  do that in his own way  But I just wanted to define the two dimensions of credibility     Thank you, Mr Morris  Mr Black now, please    I would like to say something about the Chairman’s role in  advising the Committee between meetings  Let’s make the assumption that I will continue to  think the way I feel now  And if we were at 2 or 3 [percent on M1], and let’s say that the federal  funds rate at that time was 6 [percent]  I would certainly advise the Committee not to go below 6  even though, you see, you’ve got a zero monetary growth rate or small minus    And therefore, what I think is important is the point Mr Volcker  made and one other member of the Committee--presentation [of a zero value], I think, would be     9/20/77 - 48 -   unwise, since our decision on ranges are all public  To have a figure of zero or minus--we can  take care of that    We can take care of that through the communications between  meetings if it so happens we’re at that point  I hope we are at that point    Thank you, Mr Black  Mr Balles next, please    Thank you, Mr Balles  We will hear next from Mr Wallich    Thank you, Mr Wallich  Mr Lilly next, please    Thank you, Mr Lilly  Mr Roos next, please    Thank you, Mr Roos  We will hear from Mr Gardner now,  please    Thank you, Mr Gardner  Mr Winn now, please    Thank you, Mr Winn  Mr Willes now, please    Thank you, Mr Willes  Mr Guffey now, please    Thank you, Mr Guffey    You started this meeting, and now you are in a unique position  also of ending it, or ending the formal go-round, and now we are ready for your benediction    Thank you, Mr Baughman  Well, gentlemen, we’ve expressed a  range of views, but the differences among us, with one or two exceptions, are quite small  The  range of 2 to 7 or 3 to 7 for M1 would be acceptable, I think, to the majority of the Committee,  and a range of 4 to 8 [for M2] would be accepted as well by most of us     The range of 6 to 6-1/2 percent [for the federal funds rate] seems to be favored, though  there’s also significant sentiment for the range of 6 to 6-3/4  I think the main difference is with  regard to the midpoint of the federal funds rate  Assuming that it were to be 6 to 6-1/2--let’s just  make that assumption--how many would prefer a symmetrical midpoint at 6-1/4 as over against  an asymmetrical midpoint, namely 6-1/8?  Let me repeat that  We will assume that the federal  funds rate range is 6 to 6-1/2, making that assumption  Those who prefer the arithmetically true  midpoint of 6-1/4 as over against the asymmetrical 6-1/8 will kindly raise their hands    Now there was no clear indication as to preference by members of  the Committee with regard to the language of the directive  Mr Wallich commented on that, and  he made an unusual announcement  Mr Wallich generally is in favor of monetary aggregates  directives, but he seemed to favor a money market directive this time  Let’s have a show of  hands, assuming a 6 to 6-1/2 federal funds rate for the moment--we will come back to that--how     9/20/77 - 54 -   many would prefer a money market directive?  I’m going to turn this around  Assuming a  federal funds rate of 6 to 6-1/2, how many would prefer a monetary aggregates directive?    Now how many would prefer a money market directive?    Well, it will be a monetary aggregates directive  Are there any  comments that the members of the Committee would like to make at this time?    I don’t know anything about the odds, and I marvel at your  knowledge, but--    That’s a little softer  Gentlemen, I think the time for argument has  passed; we need a decision  Let’s have a show of hands now because we’ve had an opportunity  to rethink our positions  As I indicated, there was some preference for a federal funds rate range  of 6 to 6-1/2 as voiced by members of the Committee, and possibly there’s been some  rethinking  Those who would prefer, we’ve got to contrast 6 to 6-1/2 as over against 6 to 6-3/4   Those who would prefer a range of 6 to 6-1/2 will kindly raise your hands    Well, I’ll have to make that seven  Any other questions to come  up?     9/20/77 - 55 -    I think we have    Please    Well, I think what Mr Holmes is saying is that he would be  following a standard procedure    Well, let’s have a show of hands on this  How many prefer 2 to 7  for M1 as over against 3 to 7?    How many prefer 3 to 7 as over against 2 to 7 for M1?    Well, our arithmetic being what it is, we’ll put 2 to 7 to a vote if  there are no further questions or comments  Are there any further questions?  Let’s vote on the  following  a monetary aggregates directive, a rate of growth of M1 of 2 to 7 [percent], a range of  4 to 8 for M2, a range of 6 to 6-1/2 for the federal funds rate, a true midpoint arithmetically of  6-1/4 for the federal funds rate range  That is what we will be moving on, and I hear no desire  for further deliberation, so would you be good enough to call the roll    Well, let’s stop and deliberate it  I think that would be a very  unfortunate vote  To me, the Committee is split badly  It would mean that this would excite a  great deal of discussion that would not bring honor or credit to the Committee, and therefore I  think we must seek to accommodate one another  I didn’t think our differences were that large   Let’s try again  Does anyone have a proposal to make, one of the dissenters  Yes, Mr Partee    All right, was that--    Gentlemen we can’t--these differences are minor  Let us practice  a little humility and accommodate one another and not be all over the lot because of minute  differences  I’m perfectly willing to put Mr Partee’s suggestion to a vote  I will accept Mr  Partee’s suggestion changing the limits, the ranges of M1 and M2 and the other specifications  being what I previously described, that is, the M1 being 2 to 8 and M2 being 4 to 9  Let’s have  another vote    Well, I think that patience is an indispensable commodity all of us  are in possession of, that abundant commodity, so therefore I will entertain another suggestion    All right, I’m going to put that to a vote, Mr Coldwell’s  specification  2 to 8 for M1, 4 to 9 for M2, 6 to 6-1/2 for the federal funds rate, the midpoint to  be 6-1/8, an asymmetrical midpoint, but of course depending on the evolution of the monetary  aggregates figures as to when we move away from that midpoint  Would you put that to a vote  please    Gentlemen, the original vote stands  The first vote  We’re  divided  I think it’s unfortunate, I think it’s undesirable, and I don’t know what has gotten into     9/20/77 - 58 -   this group  But if that’s the kind of life you want to lead, you have my blessing  You’re a good  group, but you’ve gone haywire today  Now, I’ve shown a willingness  I have convictions in  these matters  I have gone along with each alternative suggestion  Is there any other proposal?    Mr Roos    You have been in the habit of bringing people together  Do you  have a suggestion to make today?    Let me try the original vote once again, that is to say, the original  suggestion I made--we haven’t improved matters much  And let’s try and really show a little  more humility than we have at this meeting  I suggest an M1 range of 2 to 7, an M2 range of 4  to 8, a federal funds rate range of 6 to 6-1/2 with a midpoint of 6-1/4, and a monetary aggregates  directive    Well, I don’t think it’s sufficiently different, you see  That is,  [votes of] seven to five, eight to four  Seven to five--that expressed, I thought, more clearly the  information that I had about a broad sentiment as reported by Mr Broida  Let’s vote on that    Let’s try the voting once again    Yes  Shall I repeat the proposal?  It’s apparently understood   Would you be good enough to call the roll    Well, does anyone else have a suggestion?    Your suggestion, Mr Holmes    I thought we already voted on that    That is, that M1 would remain 2 to 7  We will make another vote  now  M1, 2 to 7; M2, 4 to 8; federal funds rate range 6 to 6-1/2, with the midpoint of the federal  funds rate range to be asymmetrical to 6-1/8  Differing from the vote we have just taken in the  specification of the midpoint  Is that clear?  All right, let’s vote on it    Well, any other suggestions?   SPEAKER(?)  Let’s stick with the original vote    Well, the original vote has been modified     9/20/77 - 61 -    All right, I want to be sure now, in view of all the voting that  we’ve done, that we know how we have come out  Now, the vote to be recorded is as follows   this is voting on 2 to 7 for M1; 4 to 8 for M2; 6 to 6-1/2 for the federal funds rate range,  midpoint to be 6-1/4; and a monetary aggregates directive  Those dissenting from that are  Governor Lilly, [Presidents] Morris [and] Roos, and [Governor] Wallich,  the vote being 8 to 4   Okay  Gentlemen, thank you very much  We have made an honest effort to reduce our  differences, and after a long struggle, we did reduce [them] just a little   END OF MEETING         "
522,1977-10-17,"  Mr Gardner is absent today  As far as possible, I would like to  have the full Federal Reserve family present at a meeting where quasi-final decisions with regard  to monetary policy are made  And in view of that, we can get through as much business as we  can this afternoon and stop short of trying to reach any decision of monetary policy; and we have  a great deal of work to do  We’ll start as we always do, with the minutes of the last meeting, and  I take it there is no problem    And that’s been accomplished  We will turn at once to a review of  the condition of our economy, and we need to examine the condition of our economy with  special care at this meeting, not only because this meeting precedes one of our quarterly hearings  before the Congress but also because the state of the economy is less clear to many of us,  certainly to many observers on the outside, than it was six months ago or perhaps three months  ago  Mr Kichline, would you be good enough to proceed in your own way    [Interrupting]  May I just ask a question?  I’m puzzled by that first  chart  The black line is below the red line with a few exceptions  What does that first chart  mean?    That’s the way it used to be done    I think another thing we can do is to move on     10/17-18/77 - 2 -          Do we have figures on the first third?    Thank you very much Mr Kichline and Mr Zeisel and Mr  Truman  We are ready now for a Committee discussion of the state of the economy and the  outlook for the months and quarters immediately ahead, and I think we ought to take as much  time as is needed to express our views individually and to educate one another to the best of our  ability  Mr Coldwell    Well, let there be a touch of optimism today    And you’ve also assumed that we will not have a repetition, as far  as countries other than Japan are concerned, of what happened in Japan this year when real GNP  rose but real imports diminished    No, according to the latest report from your staff, it’s been an  actual diminution  I think that’s reasonable  Any other questions in this area?    I think what Mr Volcker is saying is that, if your comments were  based on the price behavior of items that enter foreign trade, you might reach the same  conclusion or a different conclusion    I don’t understand  $1 billion refers to what?    May I ask a question of our New York Bank representative, Mr  Pardee?  What is the opinion of the New York Bank’s staff about the prospective value of the  dollar in foreign exchange markets?    Well, I’m talking to you now     10/17-18/77 - 5 -          Well, I’m talking about the value of the dollar, not the value of our  foreign trade    All right, any other questions or comments about our foreign trade  or the prospective value of the dollar in foreign exchange markets?    Well, to the extent that the recovery here languishes, our imports  could also grow less rapidly, and therefore the outcome as far as our trade balance is concerned  is quite uncertain--the trade deficit may diminish instead of increasing    You’ve got the trade balance, you’ve got the interest rate  differentials, and you have the broad economic prospects for the country  You would think that  the US, a country in which it’s desirable to invest because the prospects of profits look good  and improving--even with low interest rates, money will flow here    Well, all right, we’ve come close to a catalog of the possibilities   Now we move on to--    All right  Mr Mayo, may we hear from you?    Well, this would not necessarily slow down starts  If they slowed  down completions--[increased] the length of the period under construction--thereby running up  costs, and negative effects on starts stemming from that source--actually, I would not be  surprised if, in the multifamily sector, experience were a little better than our staff projection   Mr Jackson, do you have any view on that?    The strong supplies of funds, and I hear stirrings on the demand  side that I didn’t hear a few months ago    Relating to what subject?    Well, let’s pause for a moment  Is there any other observation on  the housing market?    That’s just within the past--     Thank you  Mr Roos    All right, Mr Partee    Money and what?    Why do you say money--not much has happened to mortgage  interest rates    I see  Well, now wait, are you projecting significantly higher  mortgage interest rates?    I’m a little puzzled  I would have said that, in view of the  liquidity of the thrift institutions and their enormous borrowing potential from the Home Loan  Banks, etcetera, I would not expect a shortage of funds, say, over the next 12 months, even if you  have a significant reduction in the inflow of funds to thrift institutions      Mr Kimbrel, please    Single-family mortgages?    Well, the large life insurance companies are not doing that   SPEAKER(?)  Mr Chairman--     10/17-18/77 - 11 -          Well, I asked the head of Prudential whether he had any interest,  he said absolutely not  Just the other day    How are they doing it?  How do they assemble the mortgages?    Are their field offices doing it or do mortgage bankers?    Mr Winn, please    Mr Baughman, please    All right, thank you very much  We will return to you, now, Mr  Mayo, and you were going to comment on the agricultural area    A decline over what period?    What is that--through forced selling or what?    You’re saying that the price of land is finally reflecting farm  income?    Any other comment on agriculture?  Mr Guffey    Any other comment on agriculture?    All right, Mr Black is next    Well, we’re ready to shift to another subject     10/17-18/77 - 14 -          Any other question, Mr Black?    All right  Mr Winn    Any observation on the consumer market more broadly?  Yes, Mr  Baughman    Yes, but I think there is another factor, purely statistical  Your  retail sales figures run currently through September; your real personal consumption expenditure  chart appears to run through the second quarter only, and the rest is sheer projection  I don’t  know why you don’t have a third-quarter figure plotted    Yes, that’s it; does the third quarter show an acceleration?    This chart shows the retardation through the second quarter, and  then some acceleration starting with the third quarter    Yes, that’s what I would think    Union of what?    Any broad observations on the prospects for retail trade and  consumer markets?  All right, then let’s move on, then  Mr Winn, do you have anything else?    All right    These expenditures that are being projected now, are they large?    All right  Mr Morris now, please    Well, if I may interrupt, I heard Phil Jackson say the other day that  we’ve never had a net outflow; that all that we ever have is changes in the degree of  intermediation, and we’ve never had any disintermediation  And I asked you, Mr Axilrod, to  look into that for me    Checking up on my colleague, Mr Jackson    Well, it’s very rare then, on a seasonally adjusted  Is it--well, now  wait, before seasonal adjustment--    Don’t be sure; you’ve got to take a look    There is disintermediation for individual institutions and regions,  yes, but for the country as a whole, apparently it’s an extremely rare and minuscule  phenomenon  And the right term ought to be, not disintermediation, but reduction in the degree  of intermediation    Gentlemen, I think the time has come to state what views we have  with respect to the outlook for the overall economy  And I think it’s particularly important that  members of the Committee indicate whether they agree substantially with the broad projections  made by the staff, putting details aside, or whether there are sharp, significant differences  And  it’s these that we want to articulate  And who would like to comment at this time?  Mr Willes    I think we’d like to hear you argue the case for greater optimism    Yes, but are you commenting on the economy of your own region  or on the national economy?    My guess would be, or my judgment--we will not have any  significant protectionist measures in this country over the next year  Do you have a different  view, Mr Truman?    Well, I’d like to pursue your comment  Mr Willes has indicated  that he feels that, if anything, the staff forecast understates prospects of the economy  Are there  others within the Committee who take a similar view--who feel more optimistic than the staff  apparently does?  Mr Roos, first, and then Mr Winn     10/17-18/77 - 22 -          All right, thank you  Mr Winn and then Mr Kimbrel    Okay  Mr Kimbrel    All right, in the interest of orderly discussion, before I call on  other members of the Committee, I would like to have a show of hands on the part of those  members of our family who believe that the outlook for the general economy is less favorable  than our staff has suggested    Well, define that as you may  All right, then, we’ll hear from  some members of that--    Well, no, I wasn’t ready to count  I wanted the individuals rather  than a count of the numbers  Mr Partee, let’s hear from you now    Thank you, Mr Partee  Mr Volcker now, please    Mr Balles now, please    Thank you Mr [Balles]  Mr Wallich, please    And assumes great wisdom    Gentlemen, I scheduled this meeting for a two-hour period, and  the two-hour period is at an end  I wish we could carry on; I hate to interrupt the flow of     10/17-18/77 - 26 -         thought  But I’ve got to go to another meeting, and I believe the Bank Presidents have scheduled  a meeting to start at 500  So we will resume our discussion of the economy tomorrow morning,  and those that haven’t yet spoken will be afforded the time; and I will want to make a statement  or two regarding the condition of the economy and our economic prospects as I see them    We had, I think, a reasonably thorough discussion of the economy,  the way in which we do it, individually, but several members of the Board did not express their  views  And we decided at the end of yesterday’s meeting to continue our economic  discussion--at least for a little while  We’ll start with Mr Coldwell, and then I’ll call on Mr  Lilly, and then on Mr Jackson, and on any others who want to speak  Mr Coldwell, please    All right, thank you  Mr Lilly now, please    All right, thank you, Mr Lilly  Mr Jackson now, please    All right, thank you, Mr Jackson  Anyone else?    Yes    Well, the staff projection is based on that assumption of the 5-1/4  percent rate of growth  I think it would be fair to say that many economists who have arrived at  similar projections of the economy have done so without taking that restrictive or that explicit  monetary assumption  In other words, while the staff believes they have arrived at their     10/17-18/77 - 28 -         projection by using that assumption, I am not ready to say that that projection necessarily rests  on that assumption  So much for the staff; as for members of the Committee, each one would  have to speak for themselves  Is that a fair answer, Mr Kichline?    He said with a little sigh  Any further comments?  Well, if not, let  me say just a few words about the condition of the economy as I see it, and I’m not going to take  much time because we want to move on, and I will have more than a little to say about monetary  policy later on  I think the staff projection is reasonable, but I think that a larger margin of error  attaches to the staff’s projection today than it did to the staff’s projection three months ago or six  months ago  Would you agree with that, Mr Kichline?    As I see it, we have a depression in some major branches of our  national agriculture  We have a significant recession in the metal-producing industries  On the  other hand, we have considerable strength--we had a long discussion of that yesterday, and I  diverged a little from the thinking that was expressed around the table--I think we have  considerable vigor in the housing sector  I think we are having something of a revival in large- scale industrial and commercial construction that started only recently in the first quarter  I think  that machinery trades continue to be strong     But certainly retail trade in the past few months has followed a horizontal trend, even in  dollar terms, and a somewhat declining tendency in physical units  There is a very considerable  uneasiness in the business and financial community, and I think it’s reflected in the stock market   I found businessmen in a very uneasy mind during the recent meeting of the Business Council  which I attended  I think that the economy could have a marvelous recovery or reacceleration if  economic policy made by the Administration, particularly the new tax proposals, were sensible,  realistic, well designed to foster capital investment in our country  I think that there is great  vitality in the private economic sector  The fact that we’ve added nearly 7 million jobs in our  country since the spring of 1975 attests to the dynamism of private enterprise in our land  New  business are being formed at a rapidly increasing rate     But I think that a series of actions and inactions of the governmental sector and the rather  indifferent performance of profits is gradually sapping [the] vigor of optimism, [and] I think [that  condition] has come to characterize businessmen around the country  Now, if I felt confident  that the Administration would come forward with a sensible, practical set of tax proposals, I  would say to you that I look forward to a rapid and sustained increase for economic activity  But  I don’t have that optimism at the present time  And on the basis of what I know about  Administration plans--they’re still in process of being shaped up and not yet final--I cannot be  very optimistic  And I think that puts a burden on us and a certain responsibility on us, to which  all of us are sensitive     Well, I take it, unless someone else would like to speak about the economy, its general  conditions and prospects, I think we’re ready to move on  And we haven’t yet heard from Mr  Pardee on foreign currency operations  I hope you bring good news today, Mr Pardee  The     10/17-18/77 - 29 -         markets didn’t behave too badly today  Why don’t you express the good news while it lasts for  an hour or two    [Interrupting] Did Secretary Blumenthal make the latter  statement?    Did he say the latter?  Are you sure?    I didn’t see that    And on the basis of what little I knew, I thought it was  misinterpreted    [Interrupting] Would you tell us about the good news that has been  ignored by the market?    Thank you  Mr Black    Any other comments?  Mr Wallich, please    Well, when you have intervention on such a scale, that means to  me that a number of countries in the world are conducting their affairs in a way suggesting that  they believe they are or should be in the fixed-rate system  And of course, they’re doing it in the  interest of protecting their foreign trade, and that’s why Scott is not having many complaints  from the countries that have been intervening on such a great scale  They’re appreciative of the  minor intervention that we make because we’re helping them to protect their foreign trade   That’s the way they look at it  Scott is wondering whether I’m right    Well, had you asked the central banks and the leading OPEC  countries what they may be doing?    That’s not what they tell me  What they tell me is that the dollar  becomes weak and that will put great pressure on the price of oil, and they accent that  development rather than going out of dollars into other currencies     10/17-18/77 - 33 -          Yes, Mr Black    Yes, please    Where “we” means what?    I would endorse the comment made by Mr Pardee  I think that if  Secretary Blumenthal had not said one word, the market would behave in much the same way   Of course it is  And I don’t think that we can correct that to any appreciable degree by raising     10/17-18/77 - 35 -         interest rates in this country  After all, take a look at where interest rates were in Britain, where  they were in Italy and various Latin American countries, and what happened to their foreign  exchange rate     I do think that there are certain actions that can be taken, that I hope will be taken, outside  the Federal Reserve, action of a constructive kind that would improve matters at least for a few  months  And if in the meantime the outside economy began moving up, that would certainly  release forces that would help to bring down our foreign trade deficit  And if we also got an  energy policy that meant something, well, that would have not only a large psychological  influence on the part of the exchange markets, but it would improve the underlying situation  significantly     Gentlemen, I think we’re ready to move on the transactions that have been made by the  Desk during the past month  Is there a motion to approve these foreign transactions?    The motion has been made and seconded  I hear no objections   Do you have any recommendations to the Committee, Mr Pardee?    All right, thank you  I think we’re ready to move on  Mr  Sternlight, may we have your report now on the domestic Desk?    All right, thank you, Mr Sternlight  Any questions?  Any  comments?  Yes, Mr Wallich    Yes, Mr Roos    I didn’t hear the question    The Chairman, let me say, is really not asleep  And I think that  the Committee, the entire Committee, should take very seriously Mr Sternlight’s very accurate  description  There is a constant consultation and communication between my office and Mr  Sternlight  And therefore there’s no need to press any panic button, because we are pretty much  on the same wavelength as the period unfolds and as the aggregates march toward us or away  from us  And very clearly, the aggregates were at or a little above the maxima  That became  pretty clear last Thursday but didn’t seem worthwhile in my judgment--didn’t seem worthwhile   If the excess had been very large, I might have communicated with the Committee even on     10/17-18/77 - 37 -         Thursday  But that was not the case, and since the Committee was to meet on the following  Tuesday, there seemed to be no point, really, in any such communication  Mr Baughman    Yes, Mr Balles    Well, the answer can and will be very short     10/17-18/77 - 38 -          Any other questions?  Very well  Is there a motion now to  approve the operations of the Desk during the past month?    The motion has been made and seconded; I hear no objection   Let’s turn very briefly to the lending authority under which we function, the lending authority to  the Treasury  Mr Broida, would you be good enough to say a few words on this subject?    I’d like to add just one word  The reason for that reference for the  particular recommendation is that I hope it can be adopted without discussion  There’s no great  logic attaching to it, and I could go with $3 billion and I could go with $5 billion, but if I open up  the question, we might have an extended discussion  We could function quite well under the  present rule, and therefore my recommendation is that we stay with the present rule   SPEAKER(?)  So moved     SPEAKER(?)  Seconded    And there’s no logic to support it    And when they do, we can change the rules    The motion has been made and seconded, and we stay with the  present illogical rule  Very well now, I think we’ll move to the consideration of the longer-term  ranges for the monetary aggregates and then have a few words by Governor Partee, who will tell  us something about [unintelligible] the [Sub]committee on the Directive  And then we’ll hear     10/17-18/77 - 39 -         very briefly from Mr Axilrod, and finally we’ll make our decisions on short-term monetary  policy  That’s our agenda     Now I’d like to introduce the subject of long-term ranges  We will be testifying on our  longer-range targets on November 9  And we’ll strive to arrive at a certain decision  There is a  possibility, in view of the lapse of time, that we may want to reconsider the judgment we reach  today  We did that once before when a long interval elapsed between Committee consideration  and the date of formal testimony, and we may or may not want to do that again  I think that  option should be held open     Now let me make some introductory remarks to the difficult question that we face today   In studying longer-range targets--I permit myself to use the term “targets” here; I never use it in  public pronouncements--but in setting longer-range targets, we should be clear about our  objectives  I think we should have certain very specific objectives  First, to indicate to the  Congress and to the general public that we at the Federal Reserve are as determined as ever to  gradually bring down the rate of growth of the monetary aggregates so that they would once  again be consistent with the maintenance of general price stability  I think we should have that  objective clearly in mind  The second objective that we should have clearly in mind is that we  need to assure the Congress and the general public that the monetary aggregates, to the extent  that we can control them, will grow sufficiently to facilitate orderly expansion of our national  economy  And our third objective in setting these targets, I think, should be to advise the  Congress and the general public that satisfactory performance of our economy is the basic goal  before us and that we do not have the slightest intention to sacrifice or compromise this goal or  objective in the interest of attaining or approximating the particular long-range projection that  we set     Now next, in setting long-range targets, we should keep in mind the following facts,  among others  First, that this year, M1 has exceeded by a sizable margin the upper limit of the  growth range that we set a year ago, whereas on previous occasions, functioning under the  concurrent resolution, M1 has fallen short of the target range or has fallen within it  A second  fact that we should keep in mind is that the growth range that we set a year ago has been  exceeded not only in the case of M1 but also in the case of M2 and M3  The third fact to keep in  mind is that this is the first time that, I believe, functioning under the concurrent resolution--I  have not checked these statements with any care, I didn’t have time--all three growth rates have  been exceeded  Check these statements of mine, Mr Axilrod, as I go along    The fourth fact is that, whereas M1 has been growing this year  much faster than during 1976, both M2 and M3 have been growing more slowly this year than  they did during 1976  The fifth fact to keep in mind is that the excessive growth of M1 has been  confined to the past two quarters  Sixth fact to keep in mind is that, since the beginning of the  year, short-term market interest rates have risen about 200 basis points  Seventh point to keep in  mind is that long-term interest rates have remained substantially stable this year  Eighth point to  keep in mind is that the stock market has been signaling all year that investors are uneasy about  the profitability of our corporations or about the direction of the national economy       10/17-18/77 - 40 -         The ninth factor to keep in mind is that the economic outlook is less clear than it was three  months ago or six months ago  The tenth fact to keep in mind is that, while the advance of prices  has diminished somewhat in recent months, the underlying rate of inflation has remained stuck at  about 6 percent, or a little higher, per year  The eleventh point to keep in mind is that the anti- inflation policy announced earlier in the year by the Administration has, I believe, not been  carried out and, in my judgment at least, is a shambles  And the twelfth point to keep in mind is  that, in view of what I’ve just said about the Administration’s anti-inflation policy or what has  happened to it thus far, we at the Federal Reserve continue to have a very heavy responsibility in  making our influence felt on the inflation front     This statement of objectives and this recital of facts do not point uniquely to one or another  decision with regard to the longer-range targets  But I do think these facts and objectives do  narrow our choices  I think, more specifically, that a good case--in fact, an excellent case--can  be made for lowering the ranges of M2 and M3  Doing that would help to indicate that we are  continuing on course as far as gradual reduction of our monetary targets goes in the interest of  helping to restore these monetary aggregates to levels that will once again be consistent with  reasonable price stability  Certainly short-term market interest rates have risen materially this  year  They may rise further, and since market rates of interest are in process of becoming more  attractive than interest on savings or time deposits, it is very reasonable to expect that the growth  of M2 and M3 will be somewhat lower in the year ahead     I think that the proper target range for M1 is more difficult to determine  And much will  depend, among other things, on our judgment of the reasons for the spurt here in the past six  months in M1 growth  I believe that two factors were mainly at work  First, changes in  financial technology--such as the growth of passbook savings by business firms or resort to  passbook savings by business firms, growth of NOW accounts, etcetera, which served to  diminish the growth of M1 last year by perhaps 1-1/2 percentage points--these changes in  financial technology have become recently less powerful  Hence M1 is again feeling more of the  effect of the increasing demand for transactions balances     But I believe another significant factor has been at work  At a time of growing economic  uncertainty such as we’ve been passing through, some piling up of cash is virtually bound to  occur  The unexpectedly rapid growth of M1 thus also reflects, in my judgment, the  uncertainties that have accumulated in recent months about the job market, about securities  prices, about foreign exchange rates, and other factors in our economy  Now I’d like to make a  third observation  The exceptionally rapid growth that has occurred in M1 is partly responsible  for the slowdown of income velocity during the third quarter, but this slowdown of income  velocity reflects more fundamentally the recent sluggishness of the economy  And if the  economy should start moving rapidly once again, and that possibility is by no means excluded,  we in this Committee could be quite sure that velocity will rise once again, and rise very sharply     Now if the analysis that I’ve just gone through is broadly accepted, and if we keep our  basic objectives in mind, our recent monetary history in mind, I think this Committee could  reasonably reach any of three decisions about M1  We could leave the range of M1 unchanged;  we could lower the upper limit of M1 by, let us say, 1/2 percentage point; and third, we could  lower the lower limit of M1 and simultaneously raise the upper limit       10/17-18/77 - 41 -         I think a significant argument could be made for maintaining the present M1 range  And  of the various factors that could be cited, I think the most important is that economic activity has  recently appeared sluggish  The rate of growth of the economy is visibly diminishing, and until  it becomes clear that this process will not go far, it would be prudent, wise, not to adjust  monetary growth ranges in a way that would be widely construed as a tightening direction  And  one might make the further point that the rate of growth of M1 has not diminished during the  past two years, 2-1/2 years--that has not been the trend--while the ranges adopted by the FOMC  have been gradually lowered, and a further lowering of the range for M1 in the face of this  performance may lead some members of the public to believe that the Federal Reserve is not  taking growth ranges at all seriously     As for the second reasonable possibility, lowering the upper range of M1 by 1/2  percentage point, let us say--making the range 4 to 6 percent--I think that again is in the zone of  reasonable, responsible behavior  In view of the magnitude of recent overshoots in the growth of  M1, one could argue cogently that the credibility of the System’s intention to clear up inflation  would be damaged unless that range is reduced  And a reduction of the upper limit would  underscore the System’s determination to work toward--gradually, imperfectly, by bits and  starts, perhaps--toward a lower rate of expansion of M1, and such an assurance may indeed have  a positive effect on economic activity by tending to encourage business and consumer spending   And this observation could be reinforced by the consideration that the rapid advance of M1 over  the past two quarters represents trouble that is stored up for the future unless slower growth  follows in the months ahead     Now to turn to the third possibility, that of widening the range by lowering the lower limit  of M1 or raising the upper limit--possibly going to a range of 3 to 7 or something like that--I  think such a possibility or such a move would be logical in view of the greater uncertainty about  the behavior of M1 that exists at the present time  There’s greater uncertainty today in our own  minds than existed 6 to 9 or 12 months ago  However, I would strongly urge this Committee not  to confuse logic with that which is reasonable and wise  If we were to raise the upper limit of  M1 at this time, I think this would be interpreted by many observers to mean that the Federal  Reserve has either given up the fight against inflation or that its determination to do so has  weakened  And also, if we lowered the lower limit, I doubt that many people who follow  monetary events would find such a reduction credible; and those who did believe it might be  frightened by what the Federal Reserve was up to in the sphere of monetary policy     So, in conclusion, my suggestion to the Committee is that we lower the upper limit of M2  and M3 by 1/2 percentage point, which means that in the case of M2, we would move from a  range of 7 to 9-1/2 percent to a range of 7 to 9 percent; in the case of M3, we would move from a  range of 8-1/2 to 11 percent, which is the present range, to a range of 8-1/2 to 10-1/2 percent  As  to M1, I, for one, could be reasonably comfortable either with maintaining the present range or  lowering the upper limit of M1 by 1/2 percentage point     Gentlemen, the hour is 1100, and Mr Broida informs me that coffee is ready, and I think  it would be well to take a break now and resume in 10 to 15 minutes and continue what I hope  will be--expect will be--a constructive discussion of our longer-range targets   [Coffee break]     10/17-18/77 - 42 -          We should be returning to our duties  I introduced the subject of  longer-term ranges, and now we’re ready for what I trust will be a thorough discussion by the  Committee  Who wants to be first?  Mr Mayo, Mr Morris, then Mr Wallace    We’re not ready for monuments    Thank you, Mr Mayo  Mr Morris next, please    Thank you, Mr Morris  Mr Wallich next, please     10/17-18/77 - 43 -          I wish that were true    Thank you, Mr Wallich  We will hear next from Mr Black,  please    Thanks, Mr Black  Mr Coldwell    Thank you, Mr Coldwell  Mr Baughman    Thank you, Mr Baughman  Mr Guffey    Thank you, Mr Guffey  Mr Willes now    Thank you, Mr Willes  Mr Jackson now, please    Thank you, Mr Jackson  Mr Kimbrel now    Thank you, Mr Kimbrel  Mr Gardner, please    Thank you, Mr Gardner  Mr Balles next     10/17-18/77 - 48 -          Thank you, Mr [Balles]  Mr Partee    Very little, and they still compare favorably with where they were  at the beginning of the year or April    Thank you, Mr Partee  Mr Winn next, please    Let me just interrupt  Now, somebody on earth or in Heaven, is, I  think, sensing the mood of the Committee and controlling the clock    Strange things have happened in this room  Now, Mr Lilly, you  got this room cooled off     10/17-18/77 - 51 -          Time stands still for a little while, but not indefinitely  Yes, Mr  Winn    Thank you, Mr Winn  Mr Volcker now    All right, thank you, Mr Volcker  Mr Roos next, please    Thank you, Mr Roos  Mr Lilly now, please    Thank you, Mr Lilly  Mr Smoot, it’s only proper that you could  have the last word for this    Thank you, Mr Smoot  It’s pretty clear that there is a strong  consensus in favor of retaining the present range for M1  It’s pretty clear also that there is a  strong consensus in favor of reducing one way or another the upper limit, or both the upper and  lower limit, of both M2 and M3  Now the range of views expressed about M2 and M3 is fairly  wide, but I think it narrows down pretty much to a choice between two possible actions     One is to lower the upper limit of M2 and M3 by 1/2 percentage point  Let me call that  alternative A, lower the upper limit of M2 and M3 by 1/2 percentage point  And alternative B  would be to lower both the lower and the upper limit of M2 and M3 by 1/2 percentage point   Now, I think that is the zone within which this Committee can reach a definite consensus  And if  I’ve made the choice between A and B clear--have I defined A precisely, clearly?  Likewise with  B?  Then let me have a show of hands on the part of members of the Committee, how many of  you would prefer alternative A?    How many of you would prefer alternative B?    Well, I think that’s pretty clear  Now we’re ready for a vote  unless one or another member of the Committee would like to make a comment    I beg your pardon?    Bank credit would be--I’ll comment on that at the present  We’ll  be voting as follows  On a projected rate of expansion of M1 between the third quarter of this  year and the third quarter of 1978, the range of 4 to 6-1/2 percent; and a range of 6-1/2 to 9  percent for M2; a range of 8 to 10-1/2 percent for M3; and a range of bank credit to be  determined appropriately by our staff  And if that is clear, are there any questions?  Very well,  would you be good enough to call the roll, Mr Broida    Very good  We’ll move on now  A very brief comment, I think,  is all that is needed at this time, Mr Partee, on the work of your Subcommittee on the Directive   The work is not completed  You submitted a memorandum; the memorandum has been read,  studied, and thought about by the Committee, and a very brief comment from you, a minimum of  discussion at this stage, I think, would serve our purpose    We anticipated the results of your deliberations    Well, the only comment I have is to urge you to push along with  these studies, and to insure that you do that, we will give you as a minimum one minute, as a  maximum whatever time you need, to report at the very next meeting  All right, would anyone  else like to comment?  Mr Balles, please    Well, gentlemen, I think we’re ready to turn to our shorter-term  targets  There are various possibilities, by no means exhaustive, set forth on page 7 of the  Bluebook  Mr Axilrod can help us on interpreting what is in the Bluebook, and his help will be  at a maximum and he will be brief    Thank you, Mr Axilrod  Any questions?  Yes, Mr Morris    A good deal stronger    All right, any other question or comment?  Well, if not, I think that  the Committee now has a decision to make  We can break for luncheon right now, or if we’re in  the mood to move speedily, we can get through with our business and still not be famished    What’s the sentiment of the Committee?  Do you want to work  ahead toward--to help that process, let me suggest to the Committee that the ranges for October- November specified under alternative B look quite reasonable to me  I think I would prefer, a  little, a money market directive; but the monetary aggregates directive would also be  satisfactory, though less logical  And that is all that I care to suggest to the Committee at this  time  Who would like to pursue?  Mr Lilly    All right, thank you  Mr Coldwell     10/17-18/77 - 58 -          Thank you  Mr Morris    Alternative B does permit a little additional restraint  And if your  feelings about the bulge that you expressed earlier were justified, that’s the way we would be  moving    It not only would be easier; I think you’d have to show of hands in  that direction    Well, while I disagree with you today, I might agree with you next  month, depending on how the economic information comes in  But I do want to say that you’ve  made a very effective argument for your case, one that should be taken seriously  I’m not  supposed to editorialize, but I speak from the heart, you see  Mr Willis now, please    Thank you, Mr Willis  Mr Kimbrel is next    Thank you, Mr Kimbrel  Mr Partee    Thank you, Mr Partee  Mr Guffey next    Thank you, Mr Guffey  Mr Volcker next, please    Of course, if the aggregates were high enough, we would  communicate with one another before the next meeting  Mr Black now, please    Thank you, Mr Black  Mr Balles, please    Thank you, Mr Balles  Mr Jackson    Thank you, Mr Jackson  Mr Mayo next, please    Thank you, Mr Mayo  Mr Winn, please    Thank you [unintelligible]    Thank you, Mr Gardner  Mr Wallich next     10/17-18/77 - 64 -          You are in favor of an immediate rise?    No    Thank you, Mr Wallich  [Unintelligible]    Mr Roos next    Thank you, Mr Roos    There’s a very strong consensus in favor of the ranges for M1 and  M2, and there are minor differences with regard to the federal funds rate  There is a certain  preponderance in favor of a money market directive, though not everyone has expressed his  views  Now, I see a good majority in favor of a midpoint of 6-1/2 percent, and that includes     10/17-18/77 - 65 -         those who favor a symmetrical range and those who favor an asymmetrical range extending  beyond 6-3/4  But we are pretty closely bunched     I’m somewhat at loss as to what to propose to the Committee  I do think it would be a  mistake to contemplate a possible increase in the federal funds rate of as much as 50 basis points  just on the basis of mechanical rules  I could see the Committee going to 7 percent  I could  visualize the Committee going even beyond 7 percent, depending on the flow of new  information  But to commit ourselves to a possible increase of 50 basis points on the basis of  mechanical rules, when our ability to predict the growth of M1 is so very limited--I think that  would be a mistake  I counsel against it  I don’t know whether the Committee will support me  in that or not; I hope they do     The range of 6-1/4--let me have a show of hands, really  And this may involve a little shift  on the part of this or that member of the Committee  We don’t have the benefit of  pronouncements from Mt Sinai here, and these are shadings of 1/8 percentage point, 1/4  percentage point  Let me have a show of hands on the 6-1/4 to 6-3/4 percent range, whether that  would be, while not preferred by some members of the Committee, more or less acceptable    And go to alternative C figures?  I find that entirely agreeable, and  I hope others do  The difference between the B and C monetary ranges is so small    Well, there seems to be a preponderance of views in favor of a  money market directive--those who indicated  Several members of the Committee did not  express a view on that, but they may wish to do that now  Mr Guffey    I see  Well, again, we’re either being so reasonable or I am setting  an example of reasonableness, that is, in the direction of conciliating such minor differences as  this  What that means is, if we have a monetary aggregates directive, that we will be quite     10/17-18/77 - 66 -         willing to accept 6-3/4  With a money market directive, we move toward that very reluctantly   That is correct, isn’t it Peter?    We’ll get that straight  We’ll test the Committee’s thinking in a  moment    No question about it  If the monetary aggregates came in very  strongly, unless the news from the real economy was very unhappy, I think we might well want  to consider--and I might in all probability recommend to the Committee--that we push the upper  limit up a notch  Well, gentlemen, one possibility is to have a range of 6-1/4 to 6-3/4 with a  monetary aggregates directive  That’s one possibility  Another is to--What was yours, Paul,  precisely?    Just a minute now  Okay  Two packages now  And gentlemen,  the differences between these, you would need a Solomon with all of his wisdom to be able to  define the difference  I’ll call these packages, respectively, A and B     Package A would accept the specifications of alternative B and a monetary aggregates  directive  That is package A  Is that clear?     Package B would accept the monetary ranges under C, a federal funds rate of 6-1/4 to  6-3/4, and a money market directive  Is that clear?  Or shall I repeat the definition of these two  packages A and B?  No request for repetition    Peter, well, let Peter define it  You have a given range, just for  purposes of illustration; the range is 6-1/4 to 6-3/4 and either a money market directive or a  monetary aggregates directive, and you are being requested to specify the difference between the  two    No, don’t  I think that’s in different language but substantially the  same thought that I expressed    Shall I redefine the packages A and B?  All right, those in favor of  Package A--    Those in favor of package B?    Let’s have another show of hands  Those in favor of Package A?    Those in favor of Package B?    Well, I’ll accept--    Gentlemen, these are very, very close, and I think the differences  that separate us are pretty insignificant, considering    This is not part of the record  This is simply an informal device  for gauging the Committee’s sentiment in preparing for a vote    Oh, well, we’ll give you that option  We have alternative B with a  money market directive  How many would feel comfortable with alternative B specifications  and money market directive?    We’ve reached the point where I think we will run rapidly into  diminishing returns  We’ve reached the apex of understanding now  Let’s stay there for awhile   But these are very fine shadings, and I suggest we vote on the range for M1 of 3 to 8, a range for  M2 of 5-1/2 to 9-1/2, a range for the federal funds rate of 6-1/4 to 6-3/4 on the money market  directive  Unless there is a desire for further discussion, Mr Broida will call the roll    To the best of my understanding, we have reached the hour of one   END OF MEETING         "
550,1977-11-15,"  Well, thank you very much  Let me ask you a question or two   Let’s assume that the order by the Court of Appeals is effective as of today, you see  All right,  we hold our meeting and we reach a decision, and that decision is to be published, or one of the  options is to publish it, in the Federal Register    All right now, then, when would it be published at the earliest in  the Federal Register?    I see  All right, that helps me    I see  And how soon would that have to be done?    Well, so one can catch one’s breath, at least    Now my mind went blank momentarily as you were speaking,  Tom, and would you--you spoke of two days as being critical  The December 1 date--that I  understand  But then you also spoke of January 1 under certain conditions as becoming the  critical date  Would you be good enough to repeat that for me?    Now, I understand that  The January 1 date    All right  Now isn’t it clear that that is something we definitely  ought to do today?    Otherwise we would have to release our decision on December 1   Because these other actions that are possible, such as going to the Supreme Court or seeking  legislation, all of that will take time    Well, I think that unless members of the Committee are ready to  abandon our approximate 30-day rule, I think the action recommended by Mr O’Connell is  something we ought to do and do forthwith  I think Mr O’Connell’s recommendation is  thoroughly sound    He can--well, to do two things  [To] take it to the Supreme Court  and in the meantime start inquiries with members of the Congress, seeking congressional relief   As a matter of fact, I’ve already started that, but I haven’t gotten very far    Let me make two observations  First, we would not have to  publish our decision until December 1  And therefore this--the test that you suggest would be an  imperfect test  Second, I don’t want to anticipate the results of today’s meeting  But it’s entirely  possible--perhaps even probable--that today’s meeting will not provide a good test  Mr Morris    All right  Governor Lilly     11/15/77 - 8 -          Well, that’s very difficult for me to appraise at the moment  I  would not rate the probabilities high, nor would I rate them low, as of now  I want to suspend  judgment on that  I think we have a fair chance to get congressional action, but--    Well, you don’t mean--that is, Supreme Court refusing to take on  the case--well, I would not want to express an opinion on that, either  I think one would have to  test the waters, and I’ve only started that  I’m neither, to repeat, pessimistic nor optimistic as  yet    Well, that’s a possibility  Yes, Governor Gardner    I would endorse that completely, unless of course, members of the  Committee have changed their minds, and I doubt if that is the case  But if that should be case,  we’ll learn about that within a very few minutes  Mr Coldwell    No, I would not say that  I think the chances are that we’ll get a  30-day stay, but in case we don’t, I don’t see there’s anything to discuss  If we don’t, we have to  observe the law as laid down by the Court of Appeals     No, but we won’t know that immediately    Well, it might be, and there are other defensive devices, but I think  what we ought to decide at this meeting is, I think we ought to accept--that’s my strong  recommendation to the Committee--what Tom O’Connell has suggested  And then depending  on how events unfold, we ought to discuss--that is, if they go favorably, well, that’s that  If they  don’t, we ought to get together over the telephone, possibly even have a special meeting, and  then decide on what course of action to take  But I don’t think we ought to try to do that this  morning  The problem may not arise   SPEAKER(?)  Second    Yes, but let’s not do it at this table    I’m a little concerned about that  I’m a little concerned about that   Changing the rules of the game--    Well, I do think that staying within our rules and avoiding  excessive specificity would certainly be wise    I take it that was what you had in mind    And I think that is certainly a very reasonable and wise precaution    You mean omit the range    Gentlemen, I don’t think we ought to do that  Or, if we do it, let’s  do it only after very thorough reflection  I don’t like playing games with the law  Now, I think  we ought to stay within our procedure  I think we ought to avoid as much specificity as we can,  such as defining the midpoints, etcetera, the thought that Mr Mayo has in mind  We may even  want to drop the range later on  But at today’s meeting, I think we ought not to do that  I think     11/15/77 - 12 -         we ought to examine the thing far more thoroughly before we reach any such decision  And  we’ll have a little time to explore the matter among ourselves and have the staff examine our  alternative possibilities  We could communicate with one another  And no difficulty may arise;  things may go well on December 1    If I were a congressman, I would whip you over the coals on the  basis of such evidence    There is another thought that I have, but I’m not ready to put it  forward, and that is, I want to explore the precise, well [unintelligible] explore the implications,  and that is, we could instead of issuing a directive to the New York Desk, we could make a  suggestion to the New York Desk  And in actual practice, it isn’t going to make much  difference, or at least [it] isn’t going to make much difference in the near future  Now, in time,  something else might happen  We could do that, but I’m not ready to suggest that    No, that was not my suggestion  My suggestion was first a  negative one, that we not try to decide at this table this morning  Second, that contingency plans  get under way immediately, and that we communicate with one another    All right  I say, number one, that we ought to proceed in a normal  fashion but be aware, fully aware, of Mr Mayo’s word of warning     11/15/77 - 13 -          Well, I think what is being suggested here is very dangerous  We  could be inviting a condemnation by members of the Congress, and some of them are very quick  to jump  And worse than that, we could be inviting condemnation by the court, and that’s far  more serious than condemnation by Henry Reuss or another such character    But the particular circumstance here is a decision by the Court of  Appeals, and I don’t think we ought to put ourselves in the position of being charged [with]  circumventing the law and playing games with the law  I can’t think of anything that could be  more damaging to our future    All right, thank you  Mr Kimbrel, we haven’t heard from you,  and then we’ll hear from Mr Willes, and then Mr Roos    All right, thank you, Mr Kimbrel  Mr Willes now, please    Well, we’ll have a show of hands  Is Mr Willes out in left field or  not?  Those who think he is will raise their hands    More seriously, how many would support Mr Willes’s position    How many would support Mr Willes’s position?  Well, it’s not a  majority, so we’ll put that aside without further discussion  Now, Mr Roos, you--    Well, we could discuss that at length  I think your suggestion is  one--I see no reason why we shouldn’t follow it up, but I think that is only a small part of the  story, and in my universe, the less important part  But I see no reason why your suggestion     11/15/77 - 16 -         shouldn’t be followed up by the staff in the course of our planning  And Mr Holmes, why don’t  you do precisely that  All right  Mr Black, please    Yes  I understand your first  The second troubles me, not because  I have any intellectual difficulty with it, but rather because I don’t think we ought to change our  procedure without thorough discussion, and I doubt that we’ll be ready to--    Gentlemen, you know, really, let’s make the least favorable  assumption, namely, that we have to issue a directive on December 1  We have 15 days, which  is something quite different from issuing the directive immediately  If not, it’s not a clean case   That’s the least fortunate assumption, but it’s not a maximum misfortune, even if you feel the  way some of us do that this is a very undesirable action  We have a 15-day lag  So let’s not  exaggerate the difficulty of the least favorable outcome  My own feeling is that, except for Mr  Mayo’s word of wise advice, we ought to proceed today just as we normally do  In any case,  several members of the Committee have not yet spoken, and we’ll hear from Messrs Baughman,  Guffey, Morris, and then also from Mr Jackson    Well, why not follow both routes, which is the present plan  suggested by Mr O’Connell?     11/15/77 - 17 -          All right, Mr Baughman  Mr Guffey, we haven’t heard from you  yet    Well, I think that’s a very, very reasonable suggestion  Any other  positions you may have?  Very well, Mr Partee, your committee’s charged with the  responsibility promptly  Thank you very much, Mr Guffey  Mr Morris now, please    Which could quite possibly be--it may possibly be--that no new  procedure is advocated    Well, I don’t think we ought to try to prejudge them  Let’s see  how our own thinking develops  My own at the moment is that if we have to publish on  December 1, it’s not really terrible  It would have been a lag of 15 days  It’s not a case of  immediate publication    Well, we also will have the option of a supplementary instruction   Now, between meetings, we at times have changed our instructions, and we’ll have that option    I don’t think we want to prejudge what we’re going to do just a  little before December 1  We don’t know how to do it today    Well--    Well, that is the instruction that we have just given to Mr Partee  as chairman of the [Sub]committee on the Directive    Not necessarily; not necessarily tough alternatives    Well, I’m not waiting even one day on that  By that I mean I  started conversations that I’m going to continue  Now, my problem is to test the waters, you see    Well, I think Mr Holmes and others of the New York staff--just as  Mr Axilrod and others of our Board staff--will certainly be working, as a matter of course, with  Mr Partee’s committee  Mr Jackson now, please    Thank you, Mr Jackson  Mr Balles, please     11/15/77 - 21 -          Thank you, Mr Balles  Mr Winn now, please    Thank you, Mr Winn  Any other comment?  If not, let me try to  summarize what I think is the broad consensus  And if I’m mistaken, please correct me  First, I  think that there is general support for a thorough reexamination of our procedure with regard to  the directive by Mr Partee’s committee and [for] such a report to be made at the time of our next  meeting  And we may want to devote a good deal of time to it  Perhaps meet a couple of hours  on Monday before our regular meeting in December  Second, I think that there is general  support for the legal recommendation made by Mr O’Connell  Third, I believe that there is no  objection to my probing the legislative opinion on this issue  And finally, I think that it may turn  out to be wise to hold a special meeting or a meeting by telephone through the conference device  before December 1  Any objection to these decisions or conclusions?  Well, if not, we can--well,  let’s take a recess  We’ll just stretch our legs for 10 minutes  And then drink coffee to celebrate  the stretching of our legs    [End of executive session]   [Coffee break]    Let me test the consent of the Committee before we get under  way  Would you like an expedited meeting, or do you want to take as much time as we usually  do?  That will help me in running the meeting  I will go either way   ALL  Expedite    All right  I take it the minutes of this [the October 17-18, 1977]  meeting are approved   SPEAKER(?)  Seconded     11/15/77 - 22 -          And we’ll move to a report by Mr Holmes, which will be brief, on  current policy operations    Thank you, Mr Holmes  Any special questions for Mr Holmes?   I hear none  Mr Holmes, do you have any recommendations?    The recommendation is that we codify our procedures, that  nothing new be attempted, and that the codification, after it’s been completed by our staffs, be  submitted to the Subcommittee on Foreign Currency Operations for final approval and actions   Is that satisfactory to the Committee?    Any objections?  All right, I take it that is adopted  Any other  recommendations?    Thank you, Mr Coldwell  Now we will have Mr Kichline’s  report on the economy    [Interrupting]  Third quarter of a year ago?  I thought the uptrend  started the first quarter of this year    No, no, I’m not looking at dollars  All right     Thank you, Mr Kichline  I suggest that we dispense with  technical questions to the staff and that we confine ourselves to expressions of opinion about the  economic outlook, indicating specifically whether we generally agree with the staff or are more  optimistic or less optimistic with respect to economic activity and also the price level  Who’d  like to speak first?  Mr Coldwell, then Mr Wallich, then Mr Mayo, Mr Winn, then Mr  Volcker     11/15/77 - 23 -          Thank you  Mr Wallich now, please    Thank you, Mr Wallich  Mr Mayo now    Thank you, Mr Mayo  Mr Winn now    Thank you, Mr [Winn]  Mr Volcker now    Thank you, Mr Volcker  Mr Baughman now    Are you talking about Houston or a broader geographic area?    Thank you, Mr Baughman  Mr Black now    Thank you, Mr Black  Mr Balles, please    Thank you, Mr Balles  Mr Kimbrel now, please    Thank you, Mr Kimbrel  Mr Guffey next, please    Thank you, Mr Guffey  Mr Partee now, please    Thank you, Mr Partee  Mr Roos next, please    Thank you, Mr Roos  Mr Willes now, please    Thank you, Mr Willes  Who’d like to be next?  Mr Gardner,  please    Thank you, Mr Gardner  Who’d like to speak now?  Mr Jackson    Thank you, Mr Jackson  Who would like to be next  Anyone?  If  not, just let me say one word  I think the members of the Committee know my views on the  economic outlook  The only thing that I would add is, I talked a good deal about taxes recently,  and let me add a footnote to what I’ve had to say  The Administration thinking is moving  increasingly away from emphasis on reform and moving toward an accent on tax reduction for  business and individuals  Reform is playing a diminishing role, apparently, in the  Administration’s thinking     Now, I think we can move ahead, since no one else would like to speak at the present time   Mr Sternlight, we’ll have your brief report now on open market operations    Thank you, Mr Sternlight  Any basic questions to put to Mr  Sternlight?    I think it would be helpful to supply an answer to Mr Lilly’s  question in writing  Any other questions?  Yes, Mr Holmes?    All right  Thank you  I move that we approve the operations of  the Desk  Motion has been made  Second?    Seconded  I think if there’s no objection, I will have a brief report  from Mr Axilrod    Thank you, Mr Axilrod  Any questions of Mr Axilrod?  Yes, Mr  Balles    Thank you    Gentlemen, I think we are ready for our discussion of monetary  policy over the short run  Let me make just two observations  I hope that we will proceed--I  would like to emphasize, I very much hope that we will proceed--in the normal fashion and that  our thinking will not be distracted by the recent court decisions  Second, my suggestion to the  Committee would be that alternative B looks quite reasonable  I would prefer a slight variation  in the growth of the monetary aggregates 1 to 6 [percent] or 1 to 7 for M1 and corresponding  changes for M2, but the figures as given under alternative B are also acceptable to me    Okay, I haven’t given that   SPEAKER(?)  Yes  Corresponding change    Perhaps, or a half   SPEAKER(?)  Mr Chairman, what was the M1 figure you suggest?    Well, the figure as given under alternative B is acceptable to me  I  would prefer a range of 1 to 7 [percent] or 1 to 6  Who’d like to be first?  Mr Volcker, please    Thank you, Mr Volcker  Mr Eastburn next, please    Thank you, Mr Eastburn  Mr Morris next, please    Thank you  Mr Kimbrel now    Mr Coldwell next, please    Thank you, Mr Coldwell  Mr Partee next, please     11/15/77 - 36 -          Let’s enjoy it    Thank you, Mr Partee  Mr Jackson    Thank you, Mr Jackson  Mr Lilly next    Thank you, Mr Lilly    Thank you  Mr Mayo next, please    Thank you, Mr Mayo  Mr Guffey next, please    Thank you, Mr Guffey    Thank you, Mr Black  Mr Wallich next    Thank you, Mr Wallich  Mr Baughman    Thank you, Mr Baughman  Mr Gardner    Thank you, Mr Gardner  Mr Willes, please    Thank you, Mr Willes  Mr Balles, please    Thank you, Mr Balles  Mr Winn    Gentlemen, on the basis of the views expressed by members of the  Committee, I think it would be reasonable to suggest to the Committee that we vote on the  following  a range for M1 of 1 to 7 [percent], a range for M2 of 5 to 9, a range for the federal  funds rate of 6-1/4 to 6-3/4  I’m uncertain, however, about the language of the directive, since  not all members of the Committee have expressed their views  Let me have a show of hands on  the part of the members of the Committee who prefer a money market directive, which is what  we had last time   SPEAKER(?)  Against the 6-1/4 and 6-3/4?    Right   SPEAKER(?)  Governor Wallich--    No, let’s test that expression  Members of the committee who  prefer a monetary aggregates directive will raise their hands    Now we’ll try again with the first, the money market directive    The money market--those who prefer it    Well, the vote is very close  Anyone who hasn’t raised his hand  would like to do so?    Well, we are somewhat divided on the issue, as you can see, but I  could take either, and I don’t want to produce a tie, certainly    I see a very, very tiny advantage, but you know, I don’t believe in  fine tuning, and taking these specifications altogether, one is just about equivalent to the other    That is logically the thought of the money market directive, but in  practice I don’t think there is any significant difference or any difference that I can really define  with any confidence  Could you define the difference with confidence, Mr Holmes?    We’ve had a little discussion  Let’s have a show of hands once  again  The money market directive, those who would prefer it    Well, I would rather not  My business is not to invite dissents    Those who would prefer a money market directive--    Those who would prefer a monetary aggregates directive--    Well, who has not voted    You’re pointing to line 67?    I see no difficulty myself  Does anyone see any difficulty in  adopting Mr Mayo’s suggestion?  There may be a slight advantage  Well, I hear no objection   Lets proceed the Mayo way     Well, let me repeat, we’ll be voting on a money market directive, a range for M1 of 1 to 7,  a range for M2 of 5 to 9, and a range for the federal funds [rate] of 6-1/4 to 6-3/4  Unless there is  a question or comment, we are ready for a vote    Even unread?    All right, is anyone in doubt about the change [in the statement on  the retail sales data]?  All right, that will be made  Are we ready for a vote?  Apparently  Mr  Broida would you be good enough to call the roll  "
576,1977-12-19,"  Our meeting will get under way now  I believe all of you have  been informed of the passing of [former Board Chairman] Marriner Eccles, who served us for 12  years or more--I’m not sure of the exact period--at the Federal Reserve Board  I think it would  be proper if all of you joined me in standing to pay our respects to the departed member of this  family, in a moment of silence  Mr Gardner will represent the System at the funeral, which will  be held on Thursday, I believe     We will get this meeting under way by calling on Mr O’Connell to discuss the present  status of the Merrill case, and where he thinks we are in the judicial realm, and where he thinks  we will be going  Mr O’Connell, please    What document is this now?    All right, thank you, Mr O’Connell  Are there any questions  about the status of the Merrill case?  Yes, Mr Eastburn    Any other questions?     12/19-20/77 - 3 -          Mr Baughman    Mr Guffey?    Any other questions?  If not, let me say a few words about efforts  directed toward legislative relief  Unless the Supreme Court decides to set aside the decision of  the Court of Appeals, assuming that the case ever gets to the Supreme Court--that is quite  uncertain  First, the Solicitor General has to recommend that the Supreme Court take on an  appeal  And second, the Supreme Court has to decide whether to have the case appealed to it   Assuming these two hurdles are overcome, unless the Supreme Court overrules the lower court,     12/19-20/77 - 4 -         we will need to seek legislative relief, and I think that is something we should get under way  rather promptly     Now, I have had several conversations with members of the Congress on this question   One was a suggestion to Mr Hannaford, who had introduced a bill calling for the reinstatement  of the Memorandum of Discussion, and as you may recall, I testified on that piece of legislation  several weeks ago  I suggested to Mr Hannaford that he add a title to his bill that will permit us  to delay the release of our directive for something like 30 days  In other words, give legislative  sanction to our current practice  And he is sympathetic to that, but I don’t have a definite  response from him  Secondly, I have held a preliminary conversation with Congressman Parren  Mitchell on this, and he’s been noncommittal  Third, I had a lengthy meeting with Chairman  Reuss on this question, and as you may know, in the past Chairman Reuss has indicated that he  felt that the decisions reached by the FOMC should be announced promptly  And that has been  his position all along, as far as I can remember  When I outlined the problem to him, indicating  what I and most, if not all, of my colleagues felt about this decision of the Merrill case, he stated  that yes, he had objected to the delay in making public the FOMC decisions; he had objected to  that in the past, but now, it is no longer an academic issue, and he is prepared to re-examine his  own position     Now in addition to these preliminary conversations, I and the staff have been giving some  consideration to the possibility, or more accurately, the desirability, of seeking an amendment to  the GAO [General Accounting Office] bill that is now being considered by the Government  Operations Committee of the Senate  Now that is something that might possibly be useful  That  is, to have an amendment added to that bill, and that is the quickest legislative medium we have  for obtaining our objectives  The chances are, [the House sponsor, Rep] Rosenthal, wouldn’t  much care about that particular thing one way or another, but he would be interested primarily in  getting the kind of bill that was passed by the House, getting that accepted in Congress  And that  is something I intend to take up, well, that’s my present intention  I haven’t reached a firm  decision on this  I intend to take up first with the senators--Sasser is it?  You testified, Governor  Coldwell, on the GAO bill  That is a matter of courtesy, and I think I should start there and go to  [Senators] Ribicoff and Percy, the senior members of that committee    No  No, it presumes that a compromise on the GAO bill may need  to be reached  The kind of compromise that I have in mind is the possibility of striking the  section dealing with bank examinations  In other words, not allow GAO access to bank  examination reports and--     Well, that is a fair question  My own guess is that the GAO bill in  some form is going to pass  And that, if the section on bank examination reports could be  deleted, we could do reasonably well  Now, in saying that, I have no objection at all, needless to     12/19-20/77 - 5 -         say, seeing the whole bill defeated  On the contrary, there is nothing I would like to see better   But I am not optimistic that that can be accomplished    Well, that’s fair, that’s fair  That’s why I have delayed any  conversation there, because I like to feel my ground there  In the House, that’s different     Well, now, we have to be a little careful  Unless I have a  conversation with Senator Sasser to begin with rather soon, there is a chance that the bill as it  came from the House will be reported out favorably    Well, I know, but I think I would have to hold my conversation  before that  Once you reach the markup stage, well then, the fate is, practically speaking, sealed   You need to have somebody there within the committee, or more than one, to lead the fight for  the elimination of the whole thing or for some sort of decent compromise  So I think testing the  waters within the Senate Committee on Government Operations will become essential very soon    Well, I’d love to have someone on the Democratic side as well as  on the Republican side  If you are going into a legislative battle, you ought to be armed on both  sides if at all possible, and Senator Sasser--having served as chairman of the hearing--will  undoubtedly speak with a measure of authority in the committee’s deliberations      Well, that I’m not acquainted with--    That, I’m not acquainted with  I wish you would look that up  immediately, because if that is true, we’d have a better chance in Senate Banking for doing  something than we will have in the Government Operations [Committee]     Well, that is all I can say, really, about the steps that have been taken or are presently being  considered in the way of seeking the legislative solution  As for the chances of success, it is  much too early to try to evaluate that  Are there any questions about the legislative approach?  If  not--    Yes, Mr Balles    No, we are not going to do that  I was trying to indicate  something I am thinking about, and this is on the assumption that, after as good appraisals as we  could make, the chances of defeating the GAO bill [in] the Senate Government Operations  Committee are [found to be] negligible, are small    I don’t think we will have that problem  We’ll guard against that   Any other questions?  If not, let me call on Governor Partee, who has worked with a  [sub]committee of our members on the procedures that might be followed if the court’s order  becomes effective  Mr Partee, would you be good enough to make your report now?    Well, thank you for a very constructive and also lucid report  I  wonder if other members of the [sub]committee, and I know--    All right, Mr Gardner, do you have a--    All right  Mr Volcker, please    Mr Eastburn?    Mr O’Connell, suppose that a request is made under the Freedom  of Information Act concerning the vote of the Committee, whether it was unanimous or not  And  if there were dissents, who dissented  How much time would our staff have in respect to such a  request?    Well, just to explore, what might be done under the law?  Suppose  that at the end of 10 days the response is negative  Or to be more accurate, the response is such  that, by such and such a date, the exposure will be made--it will not be made within the 10-day  period, but somewhat later than that  Suppose that is the response on the 10th day     12/19-20/77 - 11 -          Well, what would be the consequences of denial?     Well, by that time, the 30 days will have run its course    I think what this discussion has indicated is that, if such a request  is forthcoming, we’ll have a good month, anyhow, to work out an answer if we don’t have an  answer earlier  Is that a fair conclusion?     I’d say the first time and the last time     Yes, please    You know, when we depart from the Committee’s decision  through a telephone meeting--or, typically, what we have done is send out a telegram--we’ve  indicated our reasons  We spell those out in a few sentences, and presumably that procedure will     12/19-20/77 - 13 -         continue to be followed so that our reasons for deviating from the FOMC decision would be laid  before them    As I understood Mr Partee, this is a recommendation to be  followed over the next few meetings rather than to be followed permanently    That might be a later decision, while we are learning how to live  under this new rule, and with a view to learning what the market reactions are and with a view to  minimizing the disturbance  This is not a recommendation for a new permanent procedure, is  that correct?    Gentlemen, the several members of the Committee would like to  address questions and make comments, and I’m going to call on Mr Guffey next, and then Mr  Roos, and then Mr Winn, and then Mr Mayo       12/19-20/77 - 14 -          I missed the import of your last statement about the reporter  calling a member  I’m sorry, would you be good enough to restate that point?     Yes, but I thought that our rule was not to discuss with reporters  what goes on in the meeting  Therefore, if anyone of us received a call like that, we shouldn’t  respond    Well, I think that’s something to watch if we--certainly, I hope, no  matter what happens, we are not going to get on a new course and start talking about what goes  on at these meetings    Therefore, the possibility of a distorted impression should never  arise if we don’t talk about it--there will be no possibility of a distorted impression  And I think  that’s been our practice all along    Well, I think that whole question has to be reexamined, and what  the specific answer may be at the moment, I’m not sure, but I am sure of one thing  And that is  we have to work out a procedure whereby the amount of talking we do and the kind, the amount,     12/19-20/77 - 15 -         of talking that we do in response to reporters’ inquiries will be negligible if it takes place at all,  and some kind of disciplined procedure, I think, has to be worked out      Well, the answer may be found in saying less, rather than saying  more  For example, if, say, the range is 6-1/4 to 6-3/4, and if we want the asymmetrical  midpoint, it is not at all clear to me that that is something that has to be made a part of the  directive     If we actually took the vote, yes  But we could have a general  discussion which would serve as a guide to the Desk without taking a vote, and I think we’ve  frequently done just that      If that is something that we want to put into the directive  We may  not want to put it in the directive    Well, yes, the range of 1/2 percentage point, I think, is likely to  work quite well when you have a gradual evolution of interest rates  But now, take an extreme  case and suppose that the decision were to move to a range of 6-3/4 to 7-1/4; then the purpose  that you seek of preventing a jolt, or minimizing the probability of a jolt, just couldn’t be served    Well, one way of dealing with a kind of abrupt change that I spoke  of would be to divide that change, to carry out that change in two sets  One decision being made  at the time of the FOMC, and a further move that completes the change a couple of weeks later,  let’s say, in a special meeting or telephone conference      Well, let’s move on to questions now  Next to Mr Roos, please    I think you’ve done it very well  Let me try an answer to your  question, please, Larry  Our present federal funds rate range is 6-1/4 to 6-3/4  Now let’s  assume, just for purposes of analysis, a modest move in an upward direction, a range of 6-1/2 to  7 percent  We make that decision today, we publicize it today  All right, now then, the market is  going to respond to that  The judgment of the market will be that interest rates are going up and  securities prices are coming down  Now then, a week or two later, depending on how the  monetary aggregates estimates unfold, we find that the aggregates are coming in at relatively low  values, and we’ll be then aiming at a federal funds rate of 6-1/2 percent; and possibly we’ll want  to go a little lower if the monetary aggregates are coming in extremely low or negative     In the meantime, the Treasury will have put out an issue, and some of our corporations will  have put out issues, and they will never forgive us  [They will say,] “Here, you’ve mislead us,  you’ve rocked the market and we came in, we paid a higher interest rate, you’ve mislead us”   Now I think what Partee and his [sub]committee have tried to do is to smooth the adjustment as  much as possible  That’s my understanding    We’d be just as prepared to do that under the new set of rules as  we have been hitherto, because no change in policy has been recommended by the Partee  [sub]committee  All that the Partee [sub]committee is trying to do is to take the kind of thinking  that exists within the Committee and enable us to adjust to the Merrill decision so as to minimize  shocks in the market  Now that’s my interpretation     Well, it’s two things  You are thinking small on analytic grounds,  and you’re thinking in terms of a small range, because that’s where we’ve been recently    Mr Winn, please    Well, just a factual point  We have had a 1/2 percent[age point   tolerance range in the] federal funds rate since May, and the federal funds rate has moved during  that period by approximately 120 basis points  And possibly the reference point here should be  the April figure rather than the May figure, in which case it would have moved about 170 basis  points  In other words, with the narrow federal funds rate [range], we still have been able to  achieve a significant upward thrust    Only once, I think--how many--    Well, prior to May of this year we had a range of 3/4 percent  except for one month, when we had a range of 1 percent  But I want to repeat what I think is an  important part of Mr Partee’s report  Mr Partee did not recommend that we adopt a federal  funds rate [with a] 1/2 percentage point [range]  What he recommended is that we do that over  the next few meetings  Is that correct?    More frequent adjustment between meetings and a recognition of  perhaps the desirability of widening the range depending on what we learn about the market  behavior  Mr Mayo, please     Well, I--    Well, I don’t feel that way  I feel that this recommendation is an  important recommendation  I think this discussion is very helpful  Nevertheless, I would accept  your conclusion that we need not decide today to observe a federal funds rate range of 1/2  percentage point over the next six months  I don’t think we need to decide that  In fact, I don’t  think we should  But I do feel that the report made by Mr Partee’s [sub]committee and the  sympathetic discussion, to the extent that it has taken place, is something that we ought to try to  remember for the next few months and evaluate as we see fit, month by month, as we deliberate   So I accept your conclusion  Do you, Mr Partee?    I think the answer is easy  We publish dependable information  when we have it     Yes, we are, as every statistical agency does   SPEAKER(?)  Didn’t you ever know that?    All right  Mr Wallich, please    I think we’ve had not very frequent--but it hasn’t been necessary  very frequently--special recommendations made to the Committee in line with the evidence as it  turns up, as the aggregates develop, with the recommendation to move beyond the Committee’s  recommendation  We have done it twice this year; we’ve done it, I think--    Well, that is, I think any suggestion for a new type of directive  will be reviewed by the Partee [sub]committee     All right, let’s turn to Mr Balles now, please    You know, I follow everything you say with a great deal of  sympathy until you get into the political part of the argument  If we had a reserve target, and if  in the process of applying it, interest rates moved up, believe me, the Congress would respond in  just the way it has been doing  And there may well be great advantage in what you suggest, but  as for the politics of it, I think you’re off base    May I suggest that is a question of law that I want to fight out with  Mr O’Connell, and I don’t want to raise that question here and now because it would take a  great deal of time  I’ve been troubled by that, and I suggest that, as far as today is concerned,  that we not dig any more deeply into the matter until--    Well, we’ll have to--    In the meantime, these discussions of the decision and of our  directive will have taken place      All right  Mr Jackson    Well, I think the solution may be found outside the  recommendation of the [sub]committee  But I am not going to enter into a legal debate with Mr  O’Connell with so many people listening  We will have to do that in private  Mr Morris now,  please    Mr Willes now, please     All right, thank you  Mr Kimbrel now, please    Well, I think that’s wise  I think that the objective of this meeting,  as I see it, is not to arrive at any decision but to share our thinking, and I believe it would be fair  to say that most of us think that the recommendation by the Partee committee for the months  immediately ahead are a good starting point for our deliberations later on; are not necessarily an  articulated starting point, but one that we will retain as we deliberate in the months immediately  ahead, assuming that the Merrill decision is going to stay with us     We may be lucky, and something may happen, and if the Supreme Court takes on this case,  we’ll have time for a legislative decision, which I can’t be too optimistic about, but I would not  be pessimistic about legislative relief  I think once this matter is explained to members of  Congress, there will be a fair degree of sympathy with a 30-day delay such as we have practiced   Anything else we’d like to say this afternoon?    Yes, but when we announce in our directive the quantitative  specifications that we intend to live by during the coming weeks, we also indicate that there may  be some inconsistencies among these specifications  We also indicate there may be some change  in the Committee’s thinking, and we always have a sentence in our directive that makes that  clear  And all that we have to do to take care of your point is to perhaps underline that sentence  so the people will pay attention to it    Not only that, but a movement of 50 basis points is not regarded as  standing approximately still in the marketplace  Not by traders, and not by our Treasury, and not  by most of us    Mr Guffey, please    If we are right in thinking that disruptive moves may occur, then I  think it is our duty to try to prevent that rather than let the destructive movement take place and  then go to the Congress and say, “See, a destructive movement has taken place, and therefore we  seek legislative relief”    Well, anything else to be said on this subject this afternoon?  If  not, I think we have had a good discussion  We will start tomorrow, on time, and with our  regular--   [End of executive session]   December 20, 1977    Good morning, gentlemen  We’ll get our deliberations under way   And as always, we need to act on the minutes of the last meeting  Is there a motion to approve?    The motion has been made and, I take it, seconded, and I hear no  objections  And we will move on, therefore, to the report on foreign currency operations by Mr  Pardee     12/19-20/77 - 32 -          Thank you, Mr Pardee  Are there any questions or comments?  Mr Roos     How much do you think we would need to commit in order to  change that opinion, assuming that it really exists?     12/19-20/77 - 33 -          How much do you think we might need to commit over a month?    Mr Volcker?    Since the beginning of the year, the figure would be $32 billion,  $33 billion, and that amount with interest rates higher here than in most industrial countries now   And even our own modest intervention--and in spite of that, the dollar is down perhaps 6 percent  now against the G-10 countries plus Switzerland     Unless you have what Paul has indicated    No, I’ll tell you what the program should be really  It isn’t that  I  don’t think that would make much sense    I realize that, but at a price that I would consider unacceptable, as  you would     The course of action open to us, and I think Mr Pardee mentioned  some--I think once we get a creditable energy bill which will signify, first, a conservation policy  in this country, and second, the encouragement for developing new sources of supply, I think  that will be very constructive to the foreign exchange market  I think, second, once we get a tax  policy designed to improve the business environment, investment climate, in this country, that  will help to bring dollars here, and not central bank dollars but private dollars, investment dollars  in the way of direct investment, portfolio investment  I think that would be constructive  I think  third, once we have a creditable anti-inflation policy on the part of the Administration, that that  will be constructive  I think these are the fundamental changes that we need     I do think we’ll have an energy bill, and a good energy bill, before too long  I think we’ll  have a good tax bill before very long  As for an anti-inflation policy, that is now being seriously  considered by the Administration; as yet, nothing that is very encouraging apparently has  developed in that area, but that is receiving serious thought at the present time  And therefore,  by mid-January, certainly by January 19, we will have economic messages, I think, that will be  constructive     In the meanwhile, there is a modest program, that I will not describe, that Mr Blumenthal  [Secretary of the Treasury] and I have put before the President, which could be helpful in  reducing our trade deficit for the coming year  What the chances are of the President adopting it,  I can’t say  We have been over this ground with him before, and he has not responded with any  enthusiasm  And that may still be his position  So I think, no, we don’t want to contract our  economy, holding down our rate of growth  We may have a problem in that area quite apart--we  don’t want deliberately to do that  We may have a problem in that area before too many months  pass  I’m well aware of that possibility  But I think there are other areas where we can influence  foreign exchange sentiment, and I believe we’ll do so before too long     Now as for intervention, I would favor intervention on a larger scale, but only once some  official action of a constructive sort occurs, and then I’ll support larger intervention  Right now,  I see very little point in it  I think we have been demonstrating our ineffectiveness, and if  anything we will continue on the present scale or do less  And there are also--you know there is  some loose talk about intervention  Suppose--make the assumption that we were willing to     12/19-20/77 - 35 -         intervene in the amount of $5 billion, $8 billion; it’s quite an assumption, but make that with me   Who abroad will support that program?  Which central bank will support that program on a  scale?    It couldn’t be done  We couldn’t carry it out  Now, then, I think  central banks around the world have acquired so many dollars by now, they’re not at all eager to  add to their holdings of dollars  If we, therefore, wanted to borrow dollars on a large scale, we’d  be frustrated  That’s my opinion  Am I wrong on that, Mr Pardee?    Well, they have very serious second and third thoughts on that  subject at the present time     You know, there’s a lot of loose talk about oil conservation  And  if we started conserving oil on a significant scale immediately, this would guarantee a business  depression in this country and over the entire world  So on a moderate scale, you get it under  way, build it up gradually, that’s one thing  But to move in with a conservation policy of a kind  that some foreigners--well, people here, too--talk so loosely about would be very destructive of  our economy--therefore, the world economy, too     So, you take gold  Well, you mentioned a number of things that, yes, are under  consideration--serious consideration--but there are limits there  A significant amount of gold  sales at the present time could bring great troubles to France, political trouble, that we ought to  think about, and trouble to Portugal  And as for selling gold to central banks, quite apart from  the policy consideration, I don’t know to what degree central banks around the world would be  willing to buy gold  Do you have an opinion on that, Henry?    You know, selling perhaps a half a billion dollars of gold--all that  I would say is, beyond a modest amount, would cause--well, we ought to think twice, three times  before we begin to embark on it    Well, I think that’s only a--    I think it is a--yes, I think it’s very bad  And I’ll tell you why    I think this is an analysis that applies in the abstract to individual  countries around the world, and applies concretely, practically, to most countries of the world,  but certainly not to the United States  First, because world trade is conducted preponderantly in  terms of the dollar, and second, because the dollar is a store of value for every central bank, for  every multinational corporation, for people of wealth and means around the world as well as  Americans       12/19-20/77 - 37 -         And when the dollar depreciates, this releases dangerous forces for the world economy   To the extent that you have movement out of dollars into other currencies, the dollar will  depreciate further  But then, as that happens, the people holding dollars, and they’re  everywhere, become troubled about their own future, the future of their company, their country   And when people become troubled and uncertain, there is a pronounced tendency to delay  action; spending, investing that might have been done will be postponed  And there is a real  danger of stagnation, or worse than that, spreading around the world     And beyond that, the OPEC members are meeting now, and hopefully they will decide to  do nothing about the price of oil  Well, these countries have their political problems, and being  paid in dollars as they are, every time the dollar depreciates, they see the price that they receive  declining, and forces build up within their countries to raise the price of oil  And we haven’t yet  adjusted to the increase that got under way toward the end of 1973  So I don’t think that the  conventional theory about a depreciation of a currency leading to a restoration of a trade balance  really applies to any significant degree to a country such as the United States, with its dollar  responsibilities and involvements all around the world    Other things equal, which I’ve tried to argue will not remain equal    Have I--    We think the--    We at the Federal Reserve or the US government?    I seek basic improvement along four routes, three within the  control of the United States  A definite, creditable, persuasive energy policy; a tax policy that  will create clearly a more hospitable environment for investment, foreign as well as domestic;  and a creditable anti-inflation policy  Now these are the basic things we can do; they’re small  things we can do that I refer to without becoming specific     Now the fourth channel for improvement is a faster rate of growth abroad, which will  mean larger imports from the US, and that is a province--yes, we can be helpful at the margins,  perhaps, but that is something that lies outside of our power  I don’t see any other route, any  other basic path to improvement in the position of the dollar      Well, to my mind, larger invention, [if it is used] at a time when  some official action is coming into play, to help the market along and give it an extra push--at  that time it would make good sense  Short of that, I am very doubtful about larger intervention   And I haven’t mentioned, and in fact I have not given much thought so far to, a congressional  problem we have if we do embark on an intervention policy that differs significantly from the  one that we have been pursuing    Well, Mr Volcker referred to that very appropriately    Relative to the $32 [billion] or $33 billion of the central banks  around the world--    And we are doing it really to prevent the dollar, to the extent that  we can, from depreciating  Now we like to talk about disorderly markets, in correcting that, and  some of us may understand what that means  Others do not understand what that means     Mr Baughman, you wanted to comment  I’m sorry I’ve been so late in getting to you    Well, I’m glad of that    All right, we’ll hear now from Mr Winn, and then Mr Willes    Well, I don’t know whether this is--to me it’s one of economics,  [the most] massive economic stupidity of this century  Here is an industry which was pioneered- -we did the scientific work, we devised the technology, we led the world--and the industry is  dying in this country and beginning to flourish abroad  And why we are doing that to ourselves,  I don’t understand, but I’m out of touch with the environment with so many ecologists who  know what is right for America, who want to purify our air, and cleanse our souls, and make us  ready for Heaven immediately    Well, why not    Oh, I think they got it much bigger than that    We are just permitting that industry, or forcing it, to die    Gentlemen, we are a little outside of our own area there; these are  subtle matters of foreign policy and whatnot, and we have no expertise in that area  Mr Willes,  please      Mr Zeisel, we are ready for you now      [Interrupting] The increase in the third quarter--    Of what magnitude?    And real GNP?    There is another revision, recently made; has that been reported--    Well, I am aware of it  It’s not unfavorable; let me stop there    What labor force growth are you assuming for 1978?    In terms of numbers what is it?  Do you remember, and how does  it compare with the actual number for this year?    Don’t bother, I think you’ve answered my question    --22 million  But we had a much larger increase this year  Didn’t  we have an increase of--    Well, thank you very much for your report  Now I think that it  would be well if purely technical questions were put aside and put to the staff after the meeting,  or during the recess  And I think we as a Committee should focus our comments around the  staff’s projections  That is to say, whether we think they’re approximately right in our judgment,  or too optimistic, or not optimistic enough, so that the general thinking of the Committee with  regard to the economic outlook would come through in the course of our discussion     That is important for our internal purposes--that is, in arriving at a judgment on monetary  policy--and there is a public reason, because now, what happens in this Committee, you see, in  the course of our deliberations, has to be summarized and made public  And unless we express  our views concerning the outlook for the economy--whether we more or less agree with the staff  or deviate in one direction or another--the report that our staff draws up and which is made  available to the public [will] not [be] as revealing as it should be  And you know, very often we  will not speak out because we tend to agree with the staff  Well, if we don’t speak out, then our  staff doesn’t have enough of a basis for expressing the Committee’s thinking  So that’s the  reason for my emphasis this morning     Who would like to speak first?  Mr Wallich, Mr Black, Mr Kimbrel, then Mr Jackson  and Mr Baughman--well, we’re started--and then Mr Roos  Mr Wallich, please    Thank you, Mr Wallich  Mr Kimbrel now, please    Well, also, you know, I think the neglected factor in the  automobile market is the increased participation of women, and to some degree teenagers, in the  labor force  Now these new participants in the labor force need transportation  And with public  transportation in many parts of the country neglected or poor, and with the penchant that the  American public has for private automobiles, I think that this must be a significant factor on  automobile sales  What do you think?    Well, now you’ve accented the supply of finance; what about the  demand side?    That’s entirely possible, but I think there is another factor that is  of increasing significance to the housing market--     the increasing awareness on the part of the American public [that]  the one really effective hedge against inflation is real estate, and to the average man, that means  owning a home      You know, wherever you go these days, people talk about  protecting their family and doing something for themselves and their families, and then those  who bought a home will recite their experience for the benefit of others  And as long as we have  inflation at anything like the present rate, to say nothing of the possible higher rate, I think this  will continue for some time    But the opposite side of that is rebuilding of inner cities and urban  centers      No    All right  Mr Roos now, please    Well, each of us has more or less definite views on that  As far as  I am concerned, what I find so troublesome about the unemployment problem is not the overall  total but its massive concentration among black people, and particularly black teenagers  I think  we have an explosive factor in our society in that fact  I think the consequences of black and  teenage unemployment will be with us for the next 50 or perhaps 100 years, even if that trend  were arrested, but we haven’t arrested that trend  Now we’ve had a very sizable expansion in  employment, but it hasn’t touched our black people or teenagers to any extent  As far as black  teenagers are concerned, the unemployment rate has risen during this remarkable period of  expansion of jobs    Beg pardon?    Yes I think so  I think we are on a tragic course  There is some  new thinking going on  Whether it will bear fruit or not I don’t know  We came closer to a  youth differential [wage] in Congress this year than ever before--the youth differential lost by  one vote  And that question will come up in the next session of this Congress, and there are two  proposals that I think will be receiving serious attention  One is a youth differential to be  effective, let us say, for a period of six months or thereabouts and then it would be eliminated   That is, for the first six months, it would be a much lower minimum wage, and then it would rise  to the regular, legally established level  Another proposal--and I threw [it] out in a recent speech     12/19-20/77 - 52 -         and after doing some checking with a slender sample of the black community--and that is to try a  pilot experiment in a half-dozen cities, where you [would] have a permanent youth differential    Oh, I would agree with that entirely    Well, I suggest that we postpone trying to answer that question  until we turn to the monetary policy part of our discussion  I’m not going to try to pre-judge the  trend of our thinking     Well, it may work out that way, but you have counterforces, you  know--white women entering the labor force in increasing numbers; unskilled, relatively  uneducated black teenagers out of jobs  Now that has been going on for some time  It’s  complicated  I don’t think we can do very much about it here except to be alive to the issue and  in our individual capacities do what we can to deal with the problem  I think it’s a distressing  national problem with explosive potentiality  Mr Black, please    Okay  Mr Jackson, please     12/19-20/77 - 53 -          That should be corrected in the future, Mr Axilrod    Thank you, Mr Jackson  Perhaps we cannot conclude our  economic discussion before coffee break     [Coffee break]    Mr Baughman, please  We are resuming our economic  discussion     With 100 percent?    Or 100 plus percent loans?     12/19-20/77 - 55 -          I have names of members of this family in a certain order, but I’m  going to part from what I have now, and having heard from Texas, I think we ought to hear from  New England next     You know, as a political parentheses, it’s hard for me to believe  that Congress would write a tax bill the effectiveness of which starts in October    I understand that; November follows October--    And therefore the effective date will be sooner    All right, now  Mr Volcker, please  This is the time for your  balancing act     12/19-20/77 - 56 -          Thank you, Mr Volcker  Mr Winn now, please    Okay, Mr Winn  Mr Eastburn now, please    You know, some years ago, I made a study on the effects of major  strikes on the economy--an historical study taking strikes that lasted four weeks or longer in the  coal industry, the railroad industry, steel industry  And if you look at the output figures of those  industries, yes, the effect was very large, but in the overall economy, it was hardly noticeable   While you are living through one of these periods, it’s something that people attach great  importance to, but somehow these major strikes get lost    Near-term influence on rhetoric and some influence on  psychology, but not overall activity  Well, this may be different  Thank you, Mr Eastburn  Mr  Coldwell now, please     I haven’t been aware  What’s been happening in stockpiles?      Has the staff been following this?  I’m not aware of this    Well, let’s have a report, rather promptly, on what is happening  here    Is this for the next fiscal year?    Thank you, Mr Coldwell  Mr Lilly next, please     Well, thank you  Yes, Mr Black?     12/19-20/77 - 59 -          I think that’s true, but there seems to be a new trend emerging in  industrial and commercial construction since the first quarter of the year  How far that will go--    Commercial    I think that one item that doesn’t fit either category is theaters   How large a factor that is--I don’t know    Well, I’d put it in commercial  You have to squeeze it in  somewhere   SPEAKER(?)  I think it’s more industrial    All right  Mr Partee now, please     12/19-20/77 - 60 -          When you say that, Mr Partee, are you taking into account the  probability of the sizable reduction in tax--    I think that’s true, but in such an evaluation, it’s not just a matter  of adding up; we must not neglect the energizing effect that the Texas economy may have on the  country as a whole  That’s where the pioneers and the innovators and community boosters come  from, and that proves a little infectious, partly psychologically, simply by virtue of the  competition that it offers to other parts of the country, which are bound to respond in order to  stay alive    No    That’s right   SPEAKER(?)  The best people left    Mr Mayo, may we hear from you now?    Thank you, Mr Mayo  Mr Willes now, please    All right, thank you, Mr Willes  Mr Gardner now, please     12/19-20/77 - 63 -          Thank you, Mr Gardner  Mr Guffey, please    Thank you, Mr Guffey  I’m not going to take any time in  commenting on the economic outlook  I do want to say just one word about the automobile  market  The fact that automobile sales have been a little soft recently does not disappoint me at  all  I think that consumers are acting rationally in that department  I would expect some decline  in auto sales, and I welcome it  I think consumers have been going into debt at an excessive rate   Automobiles are bought largely on credit, and the terms in that industry trouble me  The overall  expansion of consumer credit troubles me  I think we are, if anything, at a dangerous level now     As far as the future is concerned, I look to business capital investment to drive this  economy forward  I hope that consumer spending will not move up rapidly, partly for reasons  that I have stated and which I will not stop to amplify  I do think that business capital  investment will be in line with our staff expectations and perhaps go beyond that, but I am  optimistic on a good tax bill  If that isn’t forthcoming, I would have to join some of the skeptics  around this table  But we will know relatively soon  If the tax bill is a simple tax reduction bill  which gives adequate recognition to the needs of the business community, I think it will receive  wide support in the Congress  And I’d be much more optimistic about speedy enactment than  Mr Partee was when he commented on the subject  But much will depend on the character of  the bill that is sent down, and the thinking in the White House is moving in the direction that I  would term constructive  But final decisions--not all of them have as yet been made     We’re ready to move on  Mr Sternlight, may we have your report on operations of the  domestic Desk    Thank you, Mr Sternlight  Mr Coldwell    Any other questions?    Mr Eastburn, please    Any other questions?  Very well, is there a motion to approve the  transactions of the Desk?    The motion has been made and seconded, and I take it that the  transactions are approved, and we thank you, Mr Sternlight, for your report  We will move now  to Mr Axilrod, who will instruct us with his customary brevity     12/19-20/77 - 66 -          Yes, Mr Black      Any other questions?  Yes, Mr Wallich    I think Mr Wallich was referring to the seasonal that seems to be  emerging in seasonally adjusted data    Not explain away--explain scientifically    Any other question or comment?  Very well, thank you, Mr  Axilrod     We are at a point now where I need guidance from the Committee as to procedure  Mr  Broida advises me that items 7 and 8 on the agenda can be postponed, and item 6, therefore, is  our decisive subject matter still before us  This is something that we can try to take up before we  break for luncheon, or we can break for luncheon around 1 o’clock and then come back  As far  as I’m concerned, I always keep my calendar on FOMC days entirely free  My patience is  infinite  I want members of the Committee to feel that each one has a full opportunity to speak     12/19-20/77 - 68 -         his mind  And therefore, we can either rush this part of the proceedings or take whatever [time]  members of the Committee feel is advisable  Mr Balles?    Well, we don’t have to make up our mind now  Our thinking  about the time for ending may change in the course of our discussion  Sharp differences may  emerge within the Committee that will call for a more lengthy debate  On the other hand, we  might find ourselves moving toward a consensus rather speedily     So let’s get our discussion of monetary policy under way  And without taking much time,  let me say this  I think our monetary aggregates have quieted down  I think also that the  economy is behaving quite well, but there are uncertainties surrounding the economy, and they  have been duly noted at this meeting  I think it would be very unfortunate if interest rates were  to drop in the weeks immediately ahead in view of the condition of the foreign exchange market   I personally would not like to see--in view of the behavior of the aggregates and the condition of  the economy and some of the uncertainty surrounding the President’s program--I would not like  to see interest rates go up, though I’d be more concerned about a decline in interest rates than  about a rise     I would suggest to the Committee as a target to shoot at or to shoot down, a federal funds  rate under alternative  B and an M2 rate of growth as specified under alternative B  As to M1, I  would prefer 2-1/2 to 8-1/2, and that is my suggestion to the Committee, to accept or reject or  modify as members of the Committee may see fit  Now, who would like to speak first?      Mr Guffey    Mr Eastburn    All right, thank you, Mr Eastburn  Mr Volcker now, please     I would strongly support that  The specific suggestion by Mr  Volcker is on lines 78 to 80, to be revised as follows  “In the conduct of day-to-day operations,  account shall be taken of emerging financial market conditions, including the unsettled  conditions in foreign exchange markets”  And I think the added phrase is constructive and  realistic, and it shows a sense of responsibility  Any dissent from that?    Now, there is another change that has been suggested--it’s purely  factual, and that is on line 18, where “a decline of about 2-1/2 percent in the value of the dollar     12/19-20/77 - 70 -         against major foreign currencies,” that should read “a decline of more than 3 percent”; that’s  simply a correction  The dollar has been moving; as a matter of fact, 3-1/2 percent would not be  wrong, would it?    “More than 3 percent” will capture it  This is just a single day’s  quote, you see  No dissent from that I take it?  All right, thank you, Mr Volcker  And now, Mr  Black, please    Thank you, Mr Black  Mr Coldwell now, please    Thank you, Mr Coldwell  Mr Roos, please     Would this be a correct interpretation of your position, that you  prefer a monetary aggregates directive?    Which would mean an earlier response by the Desk    I don’t think we ought to change the rules under which we operate   That is something that we ought to do only after due deliberation    Well, I don’t want to debate the past about whether we did or did  not change the rules  If the Committee wants to change the rules, the Committee obviously is  free to do so  I merely caution against doing it without due consideration, but that’s up to the  Committee    I don’t disagree with you  What troubles me is that, you see, the  monetary aggregates evolve and they evolve on the basis partly of hard data, partly on the basis  of soft data, partly on the basis of no data  And therefore, the distinctions that you’re making  with such precision are fuzzy in my own mind in view of the kind of evolution of these figures  that our staff generates    I think my statement--I didn’t make my position clear  I didn’t  mean to say that M1 and M2 over a period of time are fuzzy  I meant to say that the Desk is  responding to estimates  And therefore, the distinctions that you are making, I felt in view of the  way in which the Desk operates--and it can’t operate in a very different way--I thought the  distinctions were not really very realistic       12/19-20/77 - 73 -          There, there I am entirely with you  Well, I think you’ve made  your position clear, and I think to accomplish your objective, what that requires is not so much-- first of all, a monetary aggregates directive, and second, probably a lower upper limit of the M1  range, rather than some change in our procedure and special instructions to the Desk     Yes, yes, that’s another way of doing it    Well, I think we understand one another reasonably well, now   Mr Partee, please    Thank you, Mr Partee  Mr Wallich now, please    Thank you, Mr Wallich  Mr Jackson now, please    Thank you, Mr Jackson  Mr Baughman now, please    Thank you, Mr Baughman  Mr Gardner next, please    Thank you, Mr Gardner  Mr Balles, please    Thank you, Mr Balles  Mr Winn now, please    You are worried about the accuracy of our statistics?    A little earlier, when the economy was--    Well, I think we ought to be dealing with averaging time on the  aggregates   SPEAKER(?)  Yes, that’s right    Several members of the Committee have not yet spoken  Mr  Mayo, please    Where is that?    You’d have that read “at about the current level”?    I don’t know why that happened  I don’t know why    Any difficulty in writing that in?  Well, I hear none    I’m glad you caught that, Mr Mayo    Thank you, Mr Mayo  Mr Morris now, please       Thank you, Mr Morris    Thank you, Mr Lilly  Anyone else who hasn’t spoken and who  would like to speak, or anyone who has already spoken would like to speak again?    Please    Yes Yes, in view of the fact that not all members of the  Committee have indicated what they feel, the directive language ought to be--we’ll do that  But  let me just take a few seconds to see where we are      12/19-20/77 - 78 -          That is something for Mr Partee’s committee to look into    That’s been studied to some degree, but let’s study it more  intensely    Gentlemen, let me indicate where we are  I think there is a pretty  clear consensus within the Committee with regard to the several ranges  A range of 2-1/2 to  8-1/2 percent for M1, a range of 6 to 10 for M2, a range of 6-1/4 to 6-3/4 [for the federal funds  rate]   And now let us have a show of hands on the language of the directive  Those who prefer a  monetary aggregates directive would kindly raise their hands--members of the Committee    Those who prefer a money market directive would kindly raise  their hands    Well, I think we are ready for a vote on this--members of the  Committee who would like to raise some questions or make some supplementary comment?     12/19-20/77 - 79 -          Well, I think we are ready for a vote, Mr Secretary    Well, gentlemen--    Legality problem--I don’t know    Well, I’m not acquainted with that issue  I can’t comment on that   Is Tom O’Connell here?  Let’s talk about that at lunch, or is this something you could answer  fairly promptly, Mr O’Connell?    Why don’t you do that, Mr O’Connell  Let’s have your answer  now    Well, maybe this is something Mr Winn is concerned about  I  don’t know the problem  Now I understand the section of the new bill that is perhaps  troublesome  But that is perhaps something that, Tom, you might want to discuss with Mr  Winn, and possibly you might want to discuss it with the attorneys of the several Banks    But to the extent that our directors are disturbed, we ought to get  working on these problems     All right, now, Tom, will you be in charge of that?    I think this has to be clarified    A very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to all of you   END OF MEETING      "
598,1978-01-05," The purpose of this meeting is to make sure that all members of the  Federal Open Market Committee are reasonably well informed about recent developments in the  foreign exchange market and what this government in conjunction with the Federal Reserve and  other central banks has recently done  In line with that purpose, I am going to call first of all on  Mr Truman to review recent developments in the foreign exchange markets  Are you ready, Mr  Truman?      I am running this meeting in my fashion, Mr Truman     No, I’d like to have you cover what has happened to foreign   exchange rates during the past month in particular and secondly the scale of intervention by foreign  central banks  Then I shall call on Alan Holmes to comment on the scale of intervention by the  Federal Reserve and more recently also by the US Treasury  And then I shall call on Mr Gardner  to review what has been done at this end  But first of all, [give us] the raw facts about foreign  exchange rates and the scale of intervention by foreign central banks and then by the Federal  Reserve      And what was it over the entire year [of 1977]?      All right      That’s $13-1/2 billion, according to my arithmetic      All right  Thank you, Mr Truman  Alan Holmes, are you there?      Yes, you might tell the Committee the total intervention that has  occurred thus far  It’s something like $900 million, is it not?      All right      No, let’s defer questions a little while  Thank you, Alan  I am   going to call on Governor Gardner now to describe certain conversations of critical importance to  the Federal Reserve System with the US Treasury, and secondly, certain conversations with  members of the Congress  Mr Gardner, please       Thank you, Mr Gardner  Let me supplement what Mr Gardner  has just told you by reading the precise announcement that was issued yesterday  I am not sure that  each of you has had the opportunity to see it  The announcement was quite brief  Here it is     The US Treasury and the Federal Reserve Board today   issued the following announcement    The Exchange Stabilization Fund of the US Treasury will  henceforth be utilized actively, together with the $20 billion  swap network operated by the Federal Reserve System    A swap agreement has just been reached by the Treasury  with the German Federal Bank and it is already in force   Joint intervention by the Treasury, the Federal Reserve, and  foreign central banks is designed to check speculation and  reestablish order in the foreign exchange markets     Well, if you’ve heard all that has proceeded so far, I think this is now the time for   questioning  Let me take this opportunity--I should have done so earlier--to wish each of you a  happy New Year     Who would like to raise a question first?  When you do, I wish you would announce your   name  I think I can recognize some of your voices, but not all of them; therefore, please state your  name before you put forth your question      Yes, Frank       1/5/78 4   Well, you might broaden that question and ask why there was such  a delay in the President’s balance of payments statement  Without going into detail, let me tell you  that the Chairman of the Federal Reserve System has been very active in recent years and it could  not be accomplished sooner  I will not elaborate over the telephone; I will not go beyond that  Let  me just say one thing  The delay was not caused by anything at our end; that I can assure you   Next question  Mr Coldwell has a question      Do you have any direct evidence that foreign commercial banks are  engaged in any such exercise?      You mean that you know by the grapevine but you have no direct  evidence, is that correct?      Is there anything on the part of our commercial banks that is worth  mentioning in this connection?      Their positions are not abnormal      Well, as for their positions, we have numbers through the middle of  December, do we not?      And have you noticed anything really abnormal in their positions  up to that time?      I know, but the dollar has been depreciating for a number of  months now      Well, I’ll tell you, I’ve been examining this evidence  I must do   some further work on it but my preliminary examination does not indicate anything abnormal  And  I say that because we want to be very careful about what we say on this subject  My own studies  on that are continuing      I can be more specific  I have examined the evidence for the   second half of 1977 to arrive at something like a firm conclusion  I will now be looking at the  evidence for the first half of the year and see if some sort of a trend developed  My preliminary  conclusion is that we have no problem in this area and that I take it is the substance of your remark,  Paul  Is that correct, Paul?       All right, any other questions now?  Mr Gardner has a question or  comment      Mr Partee has a question now      I’m glad you said that, Paul, because I think that much of this talk  about banks is pure gossip  We have millions--[at least] thousands--of individuals involved in  these transactions around the world quite apart from bankers  And the notion that it is speculative  bankers who are testing us and they are the only factors in the market is simply wrong  I don’t like  it--it makes absolutely no sense to me--and I’m grateful to you, Paul, for restoring perspective a bit      Banks act as agents or they act as principals in the same way that  they do in the over-the-counter market      All right, any other questions or comments?      Reports on what?      Any other questions?      I want to endorse that completely  Actually, our intervention so far  has demonstrated to my mind the futility of the exercise pretty much  Now, we are getting some  psychological benefit out of the recent announcement and I hope it lasts  We are intervening more  actively and I think we should up to a point, but I don’t want to see this overdone  This problem  will be handled satisfactorily--the dollar will regain strength--if and only if we have in place, first, a  definite and credible energy policy and if we have in place a definite and credible anti-inflation  policy and a tax policy designed to stimulate foreign investment as well as domestic investment in  this country  Now, these are the fundamental aspects of the problem and unless we attend to these  problems, the dollar in my judgment will remain weak  But for the sake of better relations with  foreign countries and on the chance that we may sustain psychology for a while, I am in favor of  moderate intervention but I don’t want to see the Desk overdo it  And I think members of the  Committee should know that I, and in my absence, Governor Gardner, have been rationing the New  York Desk and not permitting the Desk to [proceed] on its own entirely      Well, you say you’ve accomplished it  I’m willing to give you the  credit      I’m not talking about you personally  By we you mean, I know, the   Federal Reserve and the Treasury and the New York Desk and the Federal Reserve Board  Just  take credit and enjoy it while it lasts      Any other questions or comments?  The silence is ominous  Are any of the Bank Presidents   and Governor Wallich still there?      Well, Governor Wallich is there and Paul Volcker is there  Who  else is there?      Frank Morris is there Who else is there?      Bob Mayo is there, who else is there?      Roger Guffey is there  Who else?      Happy New Year to all of you  We’re all shouting Happy New   Year  If we had banners, we’d just let them fly but then you wouldn’t see them  Any other  questions or comments?  Mr Alan Holmes, do you have a last word for us at this meeting?      Well, we can all join you in that hope  Do you have any  recommendations to the Committee?      I am sorry I asked that question!      You know, your best day was yesterday when you didn’t spend a  penny      No, but you don’t have to intervene every day  I like the question  that was put to you, I think by Mr Partee  Do you expect to intervene every time the market  declines?  After the kind of rise that we had yesterday in the market, today in the foreign  [exchange] market a little reversal in the New York market is only to be expected  That’s the way  the markets function      And what was it before?     1/5/78 10     Well, considering the movements we’ve had that’s hardly a   movement at all  What do you think it would have been if you had stayed out of the market?      I don’t believe it for a minute  I don’t believe it for a minute and I  say it loud and clear      Well, I think we’re in a trading range, almost  Gentlemen, unless  there is some further question or comment, I want to thank you all for participating in this meeting  and I look forward to seeing you at the next meeting of the FOMC  I hear no question or comment  and therefore this meeting is at an end   I am informed that this is not a meeting, it is a seminar   The seminar is at an end  Goodbye       END OF SESSION       "
617,1978-01-17,"  Well, we’ve had Mr Truman’s report  Are there any questions or   comments?  Mr Wallich, please      I don’t understand that statement  If official financing ceases, it will   have to be private financing  The only question is at what exchange rate     Yes, but the question is  At what exchange rate?     And what opinion are you expressing, if any?     Well, I’m not an agnostic  I think that if official financing ceased in   the absence of some highly significant new actions on the part of this government, private  financing would be available at a significantly lower dollar exchange rate  Mr Partee       Mr Volcker, please     Exactly  Well, if I have the staff’s estimates accurately in mind--and   you can correct me, Mr Truman--for 1977 we had a trade deficit of approximately $30 billion and  a current account deficit of approximately $18 billion  Additions to the reserves of foreign central  banks held here, excluding OPEC because OPEC operates the way private individuals or concerns  do, were $28 billion Therefore, we had a capital outflow of $10 billion  If foreign central banks  refuse to add $1--this is an extreme assumption, obviously--to their holdings of dollar assets, and if  we accept the staff projections for 1978, which do not deviate by more than a decimal from what  was achieved during 1977, we’d have a tremendous problem of attracting sufficient private  holdings of dollars or dollar assets  It could be done, but not by standing still in the realm of     1/17/78             4  economic or financial policy  That is, it will be done at some exchange rate, but to do it at anything  like the present exchange rate, I think will require very strong and determined financial policy by  this country      You know, just for the sake of one or two individuals like myself   who do not understand technical terms like leads or lags, Mr Truman, would you explain what it is  that we’re talking about?      Mr Roos, please       1/17/78             5   Well, I think that an increase in interest rates would be helpful in   making private citizens and business firms around the world more willing to hold dollars or dollar  assets  I don’t think there’s any doubt about that  But in my judgment it would be only the  beginnings of an answer  I think the main answer is to be found, even in the way of a bridging  action, by selling Treasury securities to private holders abroad  That’s something that in my  judgment ought to be done and done immediately on a significant scale  And it can be done  It can  be done in various ways  As for fundamental corrective actions, I can see only four paths  One is  the passage of an energy bill, which would assure the world that we will be conserving oil on some  scale and more important that we will be stimulating the development of new sources of energy  supply  Second, I think we need an anti-inflation policy on the part of the Administration,  something we don’t have at the present time  Third, we need tax legislation that is designed to  stimulate foreign investment in this country, business investment as well as domestic That is,  direct investment or portfolio investment  Now, these three roads to a fundamental cure are  available to us; they are within our power in this country  The fourth avenue is outside of our  power--namely, faster economic expansion in the economies in the rest of the world  So, there is  something that the Federal Reserve can do  And I think we’ve taken significant steps in that  direction directly and by way of stimulating the Treasury and the Administration, but I think what  has happened so far is only the beginning of what needs to be done      Well, in my judgment it has  The conventional theory, which is still   heard in Washington now and then, here and there, is that when the dollar depreciates, the  depreciation will cause exports to expand, imports to shrink, the trade balance to narrow,  employment to rise, unemployment to decline, and that is, therefore, one of the major highways to  a national prosperity  Now, that conventional theory has a significant element of validity for many  countries in the world, but not for the United States  That’s because, first, world trade is  denominated preponderantly in dollars  Secondly, and far more important, the dollar is a store of  value for central banks, multi-national corporations all around the world and also individuals--  people of wealth and means all around the  world, not only Americans And when the dollar  depreciates, some will seek cover by acquiring other currencies, which means that the dollar will  depreciate further  Most individuals and business firms will simply hold on to their dollars and     1/17/78             6  squirm and wonder in anguish about the future  And when people are in that state of mind,  normally they’re likely to postpone, if not shelve, spending or investing decisions that they were  previously on the threshold of making  And, therefore, a state of semi-paralysis could spread  around the world  On top of that, as Paul Volcker very clearly stated at our previous meeting, in  some major countries whose currency has appreciated dramatically in recent months, economic  stagnation if not actual recession may set in because of the adverse effects of an appreciating  exchange rate on export industries  And as far as the United States is concerned, the negative  influence stemming from such a deterioration of this or that foreign economy may more than   swamp the positive influence on our trade that may flow from the kind of influence that Mark  Willes described for this or that firm before  On top of that, and third, in the kind of atmosphere  that may be generated in an environment in which the world’s major currency depreciates,  protectionism may easily spread, here and elsewhere and thereby serve to shrink world trade and  world economic development at large  Therefore, I think we’re dealing with a very serious threat  not only to our own prosperity but to the continuance of prosperity around the world  Mr Partee           I don’t think you have responded to my comment  I interpreted your   comment--not your language but the substance of your comment--as being directed mainly to     1/17/78             7  intervention  As far as that goes, I think I have as little faith in intervention as you do  I have not  been in favor of massive intervention  I have tried to hold a tight rein on Mr Pardee, an enthusiast  for intervention on a dramatic scale  What can we do in the way of intervention?  We can just  influence markets here and there a little and it has no permanent significance  There are literally  hundreds of billions of dollars against [us]  How much can we intervene with?  I think total  intervention so far amounts to about $1-1/4 billion  Is that correct?  All right, suppose we made it  $3 billion; suppose we made it $5 billion  I don’t think it would make any significant difference  I  believe, therefore, mainly in bridging action until permanent corrective actions can be taken      I think there’s some indication, yes, of a willingness to move  Is   there sufficient indication?  No  Is there a sufficient sense of urgency?  Not according to my  reading  But I am an impatient man in this field      Well now, why don’t you complete the list?     No, and that there are no bridging actions of the kind that I suggested   previously  Then go on     Well, expansion abroad can help enormously     Well, I don’t think I would call it competitive  I would say that the   dollar would decline further and that would be a prelude probably to an international recession and,  therefore, we should definitely resist it  [As for] the assumptions of inaction that you make, we  should do what we can to make those assumptions not come true      Well, on a long-range intervention policy, I’m with you and Chuck    I see little point in it  I would say that, yes, intervention is desirable largely to show the rest of the  world that we do care  What do we achieve by it?  Very little  As a matter of fact, the rest of the  world has talked a great deal about intervention but its confidence in intervention is diminishing   I’ve talked to central bankers abroad and they’re not very eager, the way they were before, to have  us intervene on a large scale, even though they have a problem with their export industries and the  like  That’s because they are concerned about their monetary circulation, and they haven’t yet  devised sufficient means of offsetting the increase in the money supply that results from our  intervention or for that matter from their own intervention  So, I have very little faith in the  significance or the lasting value--except for very short-run psychological reasons--of intervention     Now, there is this  Take the statement that was put out regarding joint action by the Federal   Reserve and the Treasury  The new element in that statement was the willingness of the Treasury  to enter into swap arrangements and use the resources of the Exchange Stabilization Fund  The  value of that statement was not in the fact that there would be more intervention because of  Treasury participation  The value of that statement was that it gave notice to the rest of the world  that all the talk about the Treasury and the Administration being in favor of a depreciating dollar  --and there being some difference of opinion between the Federal Reserve and the Treasury--[was  not true]  This was a clear indication to the rest of the world that the Administration and the  Federal Reserve were on the same track, interested in protecting the integrity of the dollar  That’s  the only value in that statement      Oh, I think these are technical problems I would not [want to spend   time discussing]  We have a little committee working on that and I hope that committee has  concluded its work  I hope that committee is not going through bureaucratic exercises  By Jove,  there will be thunder inside of this shop if it is      Yes, but we’re not finished with--     Well, this is something that we would do only with the closest   collaboration of the central banks and governments of other countries and I am assured that that     1/17/78             9  collaboration will be forthcoming promptly  The device that you mentioned, selling Treasury  bonds denominated in foreign currencies, is merely one way of accomplishing the objective and not  necessarily the best way      No  Take, for example, one device that the Bundesbank is thinking   of  The Bundesbank gets Treasury certificates now, as I understand it, and they’re very short-term   Instead, let them be two- or three-year certificates and the Bundesbank can turn around and sell  those certificates to its commercial banks and thereby mop up liquidity that had been created in the  process of acquiring these Treasury certificates  [But there would be] limited transferability, you  see  That is, one commercial bank could transfer the bonds or sell the bonds to another commercial  bank but to no one else  There would be no leakages in that case That’s another way of doing it      The bank that is buying in that case would be holding a dollar  security      The Emminger plan?     No, no that’s the second plan  There are two different things  One is   to sell a dollar security; the other is to sell a Treasury security denominated in a foreign currency     In and of itself, yes  But the central banks in other countries are   capable of taking action to ease credit conditions--not only to offset any such sales of Treasury  securities but to go beyond that or independently of that      Well, that seeking of a widening spread is entirely consistent with the   sale of Treasury securities abroad, provided foreign central banks cooperate with us, which they are  eager to do  Technical problems can be worked out      Well, these are not matters of black and white  My language may   have misled you here  The Germans are like other people; they have two minds on every issue just  as we do  On the one hand, they want to mop up liquidity  On the other hand, they want to  stimulate their economy and also to curb inflation  But their thinking is moving in the direction of  easing credit conditions  One reason they’re thinking of moving in that direction--not the only  reason--is that the Americans, thank God, are no longer quite as loud as they were in pointing an  accusing finger at the Germans and telling them they must expand their economy  What we’re  tending to do now [is to talk in more general terms]  That certainly was the line I took in Basle  I  didn’t say a word to any specific country  I merely indicated that one way among others to solve  the dollar problem is for the outside economy to expand faster  Which part of the outside economy  or how, I had not a thought about that  And, believe me, you get a much better response out of  people, and it comes spontaneously, when you talk in that vein than if you just start pointing an  accusing finger at the Germans or at the Japanese  They’ve become so sensitive that even before  that finger starts moving, they’re ready to attack in return  Mr Morris, please      It has been increasing, I’m sorry to say     At this point, let’s hear from Mr Pardee and then I think our   discussion can be continued     Thank you, Mr Pardee  Mr Morris made some interesting   observations  Frank, you may be right that this is an area where it is very difficult for any one of  us, certainly for me, to speak with a sense of authority or great confidence  But there is one  thought, a political thought, that I think is tremendously important and ought to be kept in mind  If  we were to intervene on a much larger scale such as you suggested then I am very much afraid, and  don’t ask me to elaborate on this, that certain thought processes and incipient actions that are now  in motion within the executive establishment and within the Congress might be slowed down  considerably  The feeling may be generated that intervention is taking care of the problem, and  that would be a tragic mistake  Therefore, you see, it’s a very difficult question We are  intervening more; we could intervene much more  But if we did, we would run the grave risk that  the kinds of bridging actions and permanent corrective actions we mentioned--and there may well  be others--might be postponed indefinitely  And, therefore, the problem would remain with us and  the corrective process that is needed would not get under way or it might weaken  So, this is a  political point of tremendous importance in my own mind--and in one way or another we should  keep that in mind  It’s hard to evaluate, but we cannot ignore it  Mr Eastburn      Oh no, why do you ask that?     But, you know, these terms have never been defined, really  I don’t   object to precision and if Mr Pardee can answer your question in a way that would be helpful to  you, God bless him and the rest of us     SPEAKER(?)  Go on Scott, it’s all yours     Mr Pardee, you’ve made your point  We now all know very   precisely what a disorderly market means     Mr Eastburn, do you want to continue?     All right, thank you  Mr Balles, please, then Mr Black, and then   Mr Coldwell     Well, I would be very glad to do that and I’ve recommended such a   program  I don’t think it’s going to be adopted, but perhaps we might postpone that [discussion]  because it will not help us, I think, in dealing with the foreign exchange problem that we’re on at  the present time  Mr Black, please      I’d like to hear the full answer  Would you like to pull over the   microphone?     Mr Black, I sat down in Zurich just a week ago, on Tuesday, with   leading Swiss bankers and asked them that very question  Unhesitatingly each one said that  everybody is in it--people from all over the world as individuals and corporations  I asked more  specifically about banks, having satisfied myself that American banks are not involved  I’ve  pursued that question with central bankers and they were quite sure that their own commercial  banks are maintaining a balanced position in foreign currency; they’re checking on that  The sole  exception is what some subsidiaries of foreign banks may be doing in Luxembourg  That seems to  be a trouble spot--an area from which a significant amount of speculation is generated  And that is  something that requires international attention, particularly on the part of the Europeans      Both, is what I was told  You know, the [dividing] line is so hard to   draw     Perhaps     Mr Coldwell, please     I just hate to see you say that, Scott, because it’s a premature   judgment, I think  We must not reach conclusions on the basis of what has happened in a day or  two days or a week, though I understand your attitude  Two days’ peace is a close approximation  to eternity      Any other questions or comments?   Well, I think a motion to   approve, with or without a sigh, the transactions of the foreign desk would now be in order    SPEAKER(?)  I so move    SPEAKER(?)  Second     1/17/78             16     The motion has been made and seconded  I hear no objections  Do   you have any recommendations to the Committee, Mr Pardee?     Any question about that?     Mr Volcker has [a comment]     Well, let me just understand the rules  If we did nothing today, then   the Committee would have to be canvassed     Well, what is the sentiment of the Committee?  I would only make   one comment  In the past we have had no difficulty in getting certain types of actions by the  Subcommittee and in reaching the full Committee when required; and the Desk has not really been  handicapped  However, there may be an advantage in enlarging the Desk’s authority so that further  consideration by the Committee by telephone or by wire would not be necessary      Any other views or any additional views?  I hear no objections to   Mr Volcker’s suggestion and if I interpret the silence to mean consent--and unless I hear a word I  will interpret it that way--I will take it that this is the decision  All right, thank you very much   We’ll move now to a report on the economy; Mr Kichline and Mr Zeisel will report to us  Would  you be good enough to proceed in your own way, Mr Kichline?      Thank you very much, Mr Kichline and Mr Zeisel, for a very   illuminating report  I think it would be desirable now for members of the Committee to focus on  the broad economic projections made by our staff rather than on technical details  And it would be  most helpful if we would indicate general agreement if it exists or such divergences of thought or  opinion that members of the Committee may have, looking through the near-term economic future  Who would like to speak first?  Mr Coldwell, please      Thank you, Mr Coldwell  Mr Willes next, please     Please     All right  Mr Mark Willes, please     You don’t have prices and I can forgive that because we talk a great   deal about prices  I find it more difficult to forgive the absence of the chart on profits  That we  don’t talk enough about and we don’t think enough about      I love to hear talk about profits because I am sufficiently old   fashioned to think that business profits and the prospect of profits have a great deal to do with the  prospects for the economy  The tendency on the part of economists to talk about the money supply  and tax changes as if these little adjustments here and there drive the economy I think is entirely  mistaken  I think we still have a large private sector and I even thank God for that  What happens  in the sphere of profits--and what expectations are with regard to profits--I think is still the main  driving force of the economy  But you were going to make a comment in addition to the question,  Mr Willes      The latest survey of--     Oh, yes     Thank you, Mr Willes  Mr Mayo, please     Well, let me say just a word about it  I think it is a very reasonable   assumption as far as the Federal Reserve Board is concerned  As far as other agencies of the  government are concerned, perhaps Mr Gardner and Mr Partee who have been active in the  [interagency] coordinating committee will have an opinion on that        Mr Gardner, do you want to supplement what Mr Partee just said?     Has an increase in the ceiling rate been discussed within the   coordinating committee?     I would make a very definite recommendation to Messrs Gardner   and Partee that conversation on that subject get under way immediately  It will take those fellows  at the Home Loan Bank Board at least a half year to make up their minds  And by June or July we  are likely to need something like that      Well, that means we’re already three months late     Are the staffs talking about this subject?     I would urge very strongly [that you start]; it takes time to prepare   the mind  I think staff conversation ought to get under way and the coordinating committee     1/17/78             22  discussions ought to get under way  It takes time for these thought processes to mature,  particularly on the part of an agency such as the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, in this area We  want to hear now from Mr Mayo  Do you have any views on the economy you want to express?      Thank you, Mr Mayo  Mr Kimbrel now, please     All right  Thank you, Mr Kimbrel  Mr Eastburn now, please     Gentlemen, I think that we can’t conclude our economic discussion   quickly and we shouldn’t try  So I suggest we take a coffee break now  When we return, we will  have a short executive session and then resume our discussion of the economy and I shall call on  Messrs Balles, Morris, and Wallich in that sequence  Now, let’s take a break                                                               [Coffee break]     Gentlemen, we will turn to consideration of a couple of items that   can best be taken up in Executive Session  First, we will have a report from our General Counsel,  Mr O’Connell, on the Merrill case  Tom, would you be good enough to report to the Committee?      Well, I think I can speak a little more affirmatively on that  I’ve had  a conversation with the Solicitor General on the subject of procedure, having first made delicate  inquiries as to the propriety of talking with the Solicitor General on the issue  After receiving  absolute assurance that it was entirely proper to talk with the Solicitor General, I had a telephone  conversation with him  My understanding is that before he acts on this case, he and I will sit down  and talk this over at length  Therefore, such a meeting will still take place      Well, that letter followed a personal meeting with the Senator  I’ve   had a similar meeting with Mr Reuss  And copies of the letter and the accompanying memoranda  sent to Mr Proxmire will be sent to Senator Brook, Senator Power, Senator MacIntire, and likewise  to the Chairman of the House Banking Committee, Mr Reuss, to the Chairman of the  Subcommittee concerned with monetary affairs, Mr Parron Mitchell, and also to the ranking  Republicans on the full Committee and on the Subcommittee  Those letters have not yet gone out,  but they will be sent today  I do think that we have a fair chance of getting legislative relief but I  don’t think I can responsibly say more than that at this time  Anything else on the Merrill case  now?  Any questions to Tom on the Merrill case?      All right, let me turn to the second item  The second item pertains to the procedure with   regard to the longer-range targets  I want to discuss procedure and procedure only in this  Executive Session  As you may know, a hearing has been scheduled for January 31  Yesterday, I  learned that Mr Reuss has cancelled that hearing  I have no letter from him  I really have a verbal  communication with some accompanying gossip  I will not tell you what the gossip is; that’s  irrelevant  Now the next question is when [the hearing will be rescheduled]  I have to proceed by  stages and I may confuse you in the process because there has been a new development just a  moment ago, and I have not absorbed that fully into my own thinking, so I hope you will bear with  me  This new development I will mention at the end  While I am talking about the earlier  development and my reaction to it, I will simultaneously be thinking of the new development and  how it fits into the picture       I’ll tell you how I do that but I won’t take the time right now  Let me   make some assumptions which appear to me to be reasonable but, of course, there is no way of  telling whether or not they will turn out to be valid  The first assumption is that Mr Miller will     1/17/78             25  assume office on February 1  My next assumption is that he will be requested to testify on  monetary policy  A date may be suggested, and I think he in turn is likely to respond that he needs  a little time to prepare for that  My final assumption is that he will be granted that time and,  therefore, the hearing might be scheduled no sooner than, say, February 15 and possibly a little  later  Now in making these assumptions, if we were to proceed today [on] a decision on  longer-range targets, a month or so would elapse before they would be announced to the  [Congressional] Committee  That is quite a long interval  First, there is a possibility of leaks  I  feel reasonably secure in this [organization], though I have been shaken up, as the rest of you have,  once or twice in recent years  A more important consideration is that in a period of a month there  may be new developments of a sort that would influence our thinking and I don’t think we ought to  be bound for a period that long by a decision reached today  Third, I believe that Mr Miller  deserves the opportunity to participate in such a decision  For all these reasons, I’m inclined to  think that the wise course would be for us to discuss the longer-range targets, to seek a consensus,  but not take the vote and to regard the consensus that may shape up as having tentative value and  that only  The final decision will be taken later on--possibly through a telephone hookup or  possibly at the next formal meeting of the Committee  Now, that would have been my  recommendation and still is, subject to a qualification stemming from a new development--by now  five minutes old--on which I shall presently comment      The new development is a telephone call from a member of the staff of Mr Reuss’s   Committee requesting that we, the Federal Open Market Committee, submit our long-range targets  to Mr Reuss in writing  That’s the message that came to me  I indicated I would honor no such  message transmitted from staff by word of mouth with an indefinite element as to date, et cetera   However, if we get a written letter--and I requested that within the hour--then the Committee will  respect it  The chances are we will receive such a letter  If the letter requests that we present our  decisions in writing by, say, February 1 or thereabouts, in that case--  [A note has come in for me  so] we may have the answer right now  I will finish my sentence  In that case, my  recommendation would be that we proceed in the normal fashion and reach a decision today       Now I will read the note  I’ll read the note anyhow, but it’s not the note I want to read    “Chairman Reuss on behalf of the Committee will invite Chairman Miller to testify before House  Banking pursuant to…” and so forth and so on  “After the next FOMC meeting in February,  assuming Miller is confirmed”  Well that’s reasonable, very reasonable  “…Chairman Reuss on  behalf of the Committee also plans to invite you…” where “you” is Arthur Burns “to testify before  House Banking after Miller is confirmed so that you could say goodbye to the Committee and the  Committee could say goodbye to you”     SEVERAL  Hooray     Therefore, I may have the opportunity of saying goodbye and I may   also have the opportunity of hearing goodbye  Gentlemen, I think that we will discuss long-run  ranges  In the meantime, a letter may or may not arrive before we conclude  If a letter does not  arrive, then my recommendation is that we seek a consensus, not vote, and then take it up later  In  view of this, I think the time to take it up would be at the next regular meeting of the FOMC  On     1/17/78             26  the other hand, if the kind of letter that Mr Guenther has indicated Mr Reuss will be sending does  arrive while we are still in session, and if the letter is at all reasonable--and as you well know,  we’ve learned over the years that Mr Reuss invariably is a reasonable man who only makes  reasonable requests--I think we will proceed  Or my suggestion to you is that in that event we  proceed in normal fashion to reach our decision  Any question or comment?      We have that option  But whether it--well, that raises a subtle   question that I’m not going to express  But it does raise subtle questions for the Committee to  decide  This time I’m going to be the traditional Chairman who will keep the peace and if he has  any views, he will communicate them only to his own conscience and God  Mr Guenther      Oh  Well, that clears up the matter  Then my suggestion would be   that we defer consideration of the longer-range targets until the next meeting of the FOMC     I think that’s pretty clear  What do you think?       Yes, but--     We could have a two-month interval or a three-month interval from   that point on     That helps there     I don’t believe so  I think the law is very flexible on that  As a   matter of fact, as our lawyers read the law--I might test [unintelligible] of the legal profession as I  join them now and then--the semi-annual hearings can even be held simultaneously, [or rather in]  the morning before the Senate and the afternoon before the House  Never mind whether that’s  desirable or not; that would be consistent with the language of the law  My guess is that the  procedure that we have followed is very agreeable to the staffs of the Committees and to the  political figures involved      Well, I think we have the procedural question neatly resolved and we want to thank you, Mr   Guenther, for this time carrying communication from staff to staff  The one thing I tried to insist  upon is a written communication rather than staff to staff arrangements  This is, I think, an  exception to the general rule but, since it is such an agreeable outcome, the [exception] is well  justified      Yes, I think we are ready to resume our regular meeting      I doubt it  I think it’s simply that the hearing has been postponed   and, therefore, [it is proper] to do it     I think it will be made public by the House Banking Committee     Depending on what they do, we may or may not want to put out a very simple brief statement  I  think you’d better talk this over, Joe, with Ken  It may be desirable for us to put out a very simple  factual statement on the assumption that what the House Banking Committee does in the way of a     1/17/78             28  statement will be inadequate from our point of view 1/    Well, we were in the process ages ago of considering [the economic outlook]  I don’t know   but I believe the last person we heard from was Mr Eastburn  Is that correct?  Mr Balles, may we  hear from you now?      Thank you, Mr Balles  Mr Morris now, please     Thank you, Mr Morris and Mr Lilly  Anything else, Mr Morris?     Mr Wallich now, please     Thank you, Mr Wallich  Mr Winn, please     Well, I want to pause at this point  I want a show of hands,   particularly on the part of our Bank Presidents  How many of you have sensed or experienced a  similar development in your own region among the businessmen whom you see and have contact  with?   [Pause]  How many have sensed the opposite?      Yes, but you come from a foreign country!     All right, thank you  Mr Partee now, please     Thank you, Mr Partee  Mr Volcker now, please     Thank you, Mr Volcker  Mr Gardner now, please     Thank you, Mr Gardner  Mr Lilly, please     I think you’ve paid a very high compliment to this Committee and   the degree of influence that we can have Well, thank you, Mr Lilly  Mr Baughman next, please     Thank you, Mr Baughman  Mr Guffey     Thank you, Mr Guffey  Mr Black, would you like to add any   comments?     And do you have a judgment as to the reasons for the change?     Thank you, Mr Black  Would anyone else like to comment on the   state of the economy?  If not, let me just say a few words  First, it is useful to remember that over  many years now those of us who have been involved in economic forecasting have almost  invariably expressed doubts about the second half of the year relative to the first half  It’s just  useful to keep that simple fact in mind  Second, I say without any fear of contradiction that though  there have been intimations of recession--and they may turn out to be right--I don’t think anyone  here could make a good case for it as of today  The case may come 1, 2, 3, or 4 months later on   The case does not exist today, except as a gut feeling or an intuitive judgment  A reasonable  factual case I do not think can be made as of today     Next I must say that the spurt in consumer spending which has made some people happy has   disturbed me  It is being financed in very large part by credit  We’re having something close to an  explosion of credit in the consumer area  Installment credit and mortgage credit have been used in  large part to finance consumer spending  I believe that the spurt will not continue and I certainly     1/17/78             36  hope so  On home building, I’m with the staff or more optimistic than the staff  The significant  point I think has been mentioned  You know, the American public, in contrast to some or many of  our politicians--perhaps most of them--is very deeply concerned about inflation People all over the  country have been asking themselves the question  What can I do to protect my family?  What can  I do to protect my children, my family, and myself against the ravages of inflation?  And gradually  the thought has evolved and is spreading rapidly that, on the negative side, putting money in the  bank or a savings and loan account is no protection  Buying bonds, Treasury bonds or corporate  bonds, is no protection  Buying common stocks is no protection  It used to be a major protection  but it no longer is  Then what is left?  Well, gold or paintings  But the average man cannot invest  in gold; he doesn’t know how  It’s not something he’s accustomed to  Likewise with paintings   What will he turn to?  Well, there is farm real estate, a remarkable record there  But the average  man doesn’t know how to buy farm real estate  He realizes that location can make an enormous  difference  But there’s one thing the average man is capable of doing  If he doesn’t have a home,  he can buy a home  If he already has a home, he can buy another  The average man is also capable  of judging neighborhoods  All he has to do is get into an automobile or walk and he can locate  areas where the prospect of maintaining good conditions in the neighborhood or some  improvement are pretty good over the next ten years or twenty years  People can do that  And  they’re doing it in increasing numbers  It’s surprising to me  I hear it from college professors; I  hear it from young people; I hear it from my own children  The movement is spreading       And the interest rate on mortgages?  Yes, what Mr Partee has said may well turn out to be   right, but I don’t think people are going to be deterred by an increase in mortgage interest rates of  one half of one percent or even a full one percent  And the money will be available at a somewhat  higher interest rate  So, I believe that this will continue  Whether that is a cause for optimism or  not is something else again  We may easily get ourselves into a condition of overbuilding in this  area, such as we had in 1972-73, but in the year ahead we’ll have plenty of activity in this field      As for business capital expenditures, I have learned over the years--I believe correctly--to pay   far more attention to orders for business capital goods, to contracts for commercial and industrial  construction, to the rate of formation of new businesses, and to appropriations for business capital  expenditures  I pay far more attention to indicators of this type than I do to the surveys of the  Commerce Department  Is it still Commerce and the SEC or is it solely Commerce now?  It’s  solely Commerce now?  And [those indicators] I think have been more accurate  I think the recent  survey--sure, it may turn out to be right--understates the trend that is likely to develop  On balance,  I think we’re going to have a pretty strong economy in the months immediately ahead; how far  ahead I don’t know  But over the longer run, I think we ought to continue worrying about inflation;  we ought to continue to worry about the kind of environment that exists for business capital  spending; and we ought to worry about the unemployment of black people, particularly youngsters  And we certainly ought to worry about the position of the dollar in foreign exchange markets,  which has very dangerous possibilities for our own economy and also the future of the entire  international economy  Well, that’s all that I would want to say      I think we ought to turn now to the [rest of our agenda]  Just a word on the longer-run   targets; we’re not going to take them up today  That will be deferred until the next meeting of the     1/17/78             37  Committee  We still have to hear about the operations of the Desk and reach our decisions on  current monetary policy and on these two special items we have to consider  Therefore, I think we  simply have to return after luncheon and perhaps we can move speedily after luncheon  But, right  now, before we break for luncheon, let’s see if we can’t dispose of items 7 and 8 on the agenda   First, there’s the memorandum of discussion for 1972, and our Secretary, in accordance with the  tradition, has a recommendation to make on that question  Mr  Broida      Any questions about that recommendation?   The motion has been   made and seconded and I take it, approved  Let’s move to item 8  And Mr Volcker, when you try  you can be not only fairly lucid, but even remarkably brief, and this is the time to try for it      Gentlemen, I want to put a question to the Committee, and I may or   may not have a suggestion depending on the answer to the question  I’d like to have a show of  hands--and this time [not] only including members of the Committee but also the Bank Presidents  who are not technically members of the Committee--indicating whether you feel really qualified to  act on this issue  Would you feel comfortable?  I don’t feel comfortable acting on this issue  I  haven’t studied it sufficiently; I don’t understand it and, therefore, I want to know how many of my  colleagues are in my unhappy position or are in a much happier position  So how many of you feel  really qualified to reach a judgment on the question?      I’ll modify it  How many of you feel reasonably qualified to reach   that judgment?  Well, all right, most of you feel reasonably qualified; therefore, I will not make my  suggestion  What is the sentiment of the members?        1/17/78             40   All right, any other view?     Gentlemen, so far I’ve heard a slight preference for option 4  Is that   generally agreeable?  I hear nothing to the contrary and that’s the Committee’s decision  Looking  at the clock, would 215 be a reasonable time to reconvene or would 230 be better?     SPEAKER(?)  215     [The time we will reconvene] is officially 215       1/17/78             41                                                          [Lunch recess]     Mr Sternlight, we are ready for your report now, please     Thank you, Mr Sternlight  Are there any questions?  Mr   Baughman     Mr Kimbrel, please     All right, any other question?  If not, is there a motion to approve the   operations of the domestic Desk?    SPEAKER(?)  So moved    SPEAKER(?)  Seconded     A motion has been made and seconded and [hearing no objections   we have] a vote to approve  Mr Axilrod, we’re ready for your comments     Thank you Mr Axilrod  Are there any questions?  Very well, we’re   ready to turn to our deliberations on monetary policy  I have only one word to say in the way of a  suggestion to the Committee and that is in view of the serious foreign exchange problem that we  continue to face, it would be a serious mistake to entertain a reduction of interest rates at this time   I am going to call on Mr Volcker first and then other members of the Committee, Mr Eastburn,  Mr Morris, Mr Coldwell, Mr Mayo, Mr Wallich, and Mr Black  Paul, it’s all yours      Well, now that we’ve converted a fraction into a decimal--and if   you’re comfortable about that--we can proceed  Thank you, Mr Volcker  Mr Eastburn next       1/17/78             44   Thank you, Mr Eastburn  Mr Morris now, please     Thank you, Mr Morris  Mr Kimbrel, please     Thank you, Mr Kimbrel  Mr Coldwell now     Thank you, Mr Coldwell  Mr Mayo now, please     Thank you, Mr Mayo  Mr Wallich now, please     Thank you, Mr Wallich  Mr Black now, please     25000     Thank you, Mr Black  Mr Partee now, please     Thank you, Mr Balles  Mr Roos, please     Thank you, Mr Roos  Mr Winn now, please     Thank you, Mr Winn  Mr Guffey now, please     Thank you, Mr Guffey  Mr Lilly next, please     Thank you, Mr Lilly  Mr Baughman next, please     We can add zeros all over     Thank you, Mr Baughman  Mr Willes, please     Thank you, Mr Willes  Mr Gardner, please     Well--      Oh, be careful     Gentlemen, I need a little time and I ask you all to relax because the   fractions could become so minute, so delicate, so varied  [Pause]  Gentlemen, I have a suggestion  to make here and please don’t question me too closely because if you do, you will find that I have  quickly run out of knowledge  The numbers are before me  They’re not easy to summarize and I  am not going to try to summarize them  Therefore, I make a suggestion that we vote on the  following  an M1 range of 3 to 8 percent, an M2 range of 5 to 9 percent, a federal funds rate range  of 6-1/2 to 7 percent, but with a strong inclination not to go below 6-3/4 percent, and a money  market directive  Now, that is my best effort to extract a consensus on the variety of numbers and  nuances attached to the numbers that I have heard around this table  Are there any questions,  gentlemen?      Well then, let’s have a show of hands on the upper limit of 7-1/2   percent  Is that reasonable?  I tried to give some recognition to a suggestion made by several  members of the Committee that the range be narrowed somewhat  But going from a range of 6  points to 5 points I think would be adequate for one meeting  Let me repeat then the suggestion to  the Committee  We can vote on the following  an M1 range of 2-1/2 to 7-1/2, an M2 range of 5 to  9, a federal funds range of 6-1/2 to 7, but with a strong tendency not to go below 6-3/4, and with a  money market directive      Well, Mr Sternlight, you will have to live with that, but why don’t   you attempt an interpretation of that and if you need help, we’ll try to supply it     1/17/78             51     That definitely ought to be in there     Well, that’s perhaps a little stronger than I intended     Nobody even heard my comment     Mr Broida, I think is following a suggestion that we use “at about   the current level” rather than 6-3/4 percent  All right, since there are no further comments, will the  Secretary call the roll, please?      This may be the last--well, it will be the last meeting that I’ll be  presiding over  I want to say just one word  I don’t think I’ve said it before  I am very pleased that  at this last meeting of mine the Committee was unanimous  Thank you very much      Gentlemen, I’m very grateful to all of you and to you, Paul  You   have my warmest thanks and very best wishes for a bright future that you personally and other  members deserve  Thank you very much     END OF MEETING      "
646,1978-02-28,"  Gentlemen, we will start our meeting  I am glad to see all of you   once again but I had hoped, as I know all of you did, that this meeting would be chaired by Mr  Miller  He is testifying this morning and he has had his difficulties, but I am reasonably confident  that they may be cleared up this morning  We all have our duty and we will perform it  It has been  a somewhat difficult period for all of us and some mistakes have been made, and I=m responsible  for two mistakes  Well, I don=t know how many I=m responsible for, but I=m responsible at least for  two that I can think of immediately involving this Committee  The first was to advise you not to  take up the long-range targets at the January meeting  That was a mistake  The second was  postponing our regular meeting a week  That was the second mistake  I think that, under the  circumstances, these mistakes are understandable; I hope they are  Nevertheless, they were errors  as things have turned out; they were hurried suggestions  From now on, no matter what happens,  we will proceed according to our regular rules--not deviating to the left nor deviating to the right  one inch  A motion to act on the minutes would now be in order      Approval has been moved and seconded  And I take it there is no   difficulty  We had a report of the Examination of our System Open Market Account  Is there any  desire for discussion of that report?      Mr Balles     Well, I don=t know what we can do about the report, but this question   will come up in Congressional hearings and then we ought to make not only the points that you  have just made but the additional point that we held onto our gold, and that=s why we got into this       2/28/78           2  loss  Gold then was worth $35 an ounce and, if I remember the current quotation correctly it is  something like $181      If you take that into account, as you should, and if profits in terms of   inflated dollars mean anything, we=ve made an enormous profit     Yes, and I have seen figures of this sort cited by distinguished   columnists     While we=re on that subject, we sure are hoarding that gold as if it   were there never to be used  Well, we may possibly have further comments on that when we come  to item 3 on the agenda, and we=ll be there soon      Well, the first figure could be challenged too, but go on     I hope that if and when or as this is debated in the Congress, this will   never be pointed out because that would only add to the confusion  After all, we could, by  pumping reserves into our commercial banks, add enormously to the security holdings of the  System and run up our profits to--well, let me say to any conceivable figure      Well, a motion to accept the examination report has been made  Is there any--     Was such an implication intended, Mr Wallace?     Thank you very much  Any other comment on the examination   report?  If not, a motion to accept the report was already [made]; if seconded we can move on     I think that it has been seconded  Again, [I hear] no objections, so   we=ll turn now to Mr Pardee for his report on foreign currency operations      Thank you, Mr Pardee  Are there any questions or comments?     I think that=s a fair question  Mr Wallich     Mr Coldwell     Mr Jackson     Mr Partee, please     Well, I think this is a fair question, but one that I think we can   postpone until the next meeting when I believe the rules under which we operate are to be       2/28/78           6  reexamined by the Committee  In the meantime, I think we ought to have some discussion,  perhaps some studies by our staff and by some interested members of the Committee  Perhaps  before this meeting is over, we shall want to formalize that  Any other question or comments on  foreign currency operations or the dollar problem as it now exists?  Very well, if not, a motion to  ratify the transactions since the previous meeting would be in order      A motion to ratify has been made and seconded   I hear no   objections  We will pass on to Mr Holmes=s recommendations     The recommendation is clear  Is it acceptable to the Committee?     Any objections to Mr Holmes=s recommendation?  I hear none  I   take it that it is acceptable to the Committee  Any other recommendations?     In the latter case, we need not be lucky; we just do it         2/28/78           7   You say you maximize them  You say that there are many who   agree with your judgment [about the dollar]  I=m sure that is right, but there are many more,  judging from the behavior of the market, who seem to disagree with your judgment  I think it is  that kind of a question      Also bearing in mind that profit and loss, while a significant   consideration, may well be swamped by other factors such as the extent of our exposure as far as  members of the Congress and perhaps the market both are concerned      You mean go beyond a 6-month period or 9-month period?           2/28/78           8   Please     Also, I don=t think that this is a policy we could arrive at unilaterally   The Germans will have their views as well as the Treasury and I do think we have to leave  considerable room for flexibility to those who operate the Desk in dealing with that issue      Let me return if I may to the question we considered previously on net versus gross exposure,   or possibly retaining both but changing the limits perhaps along the lines that Mr Partee had in  mind  I think this should be examined not only by the staff but also by a subcommittee of this  family  I=m going to ask Mr Wallich to serve as Chairman of such a subcommittee and include on  it Governor Coldwell, Mr Volcker, and Mr Black  And that subcommittee could also consider the  question of the repayment and what recommendation if any to make to this Committee  But I don=t  think we would want to lay down a rigid policy; others are involved, as I noted  Yes      Did you comment on the Swiss transactions in the past month?       2/28/78           10     Some criticism has been made of our being involved in the Swiss   transactions  What was your defense for it?     You say “absolutely defensible to the Committee”  You are   engaging in a bit of rhetoric now     Have you heard criticism from the Treasury?     I hope you wouldn=t give that answer too quickly     Or that the whole swap network is a charade     We will [get] absolutely nowhere, because nobody knows what   disorder means, including those who operate the Desk  Yes, we=re using words to justify what  we=re doing  Actually we=re in there under the umbrella of disorder, though there is a thought in the  minds of practically all concerned to stop or check the deterioration in the value of the dollar in the  foreign exchange markets  We might just as well speak very honestly and openly in this room  If  we don=t do that, we=re in trouble  Gentlemen, I don=t like the language of disorder; there is an  element of disingenuousness about it--not intended, but I believe it=s there  Having said that, and if  you still want to pursue this question--      I think this is also a matter that your subcommittee may want to   make a recommendation on  The frame of reference originally was procedural only  But I don=t  think you need restrict yourself to that  Any thought on this subject now, I think, would be helpful   Mr Willes      I do expect that this will be the last meeting at which I=ll be   presiding In view of that, I=ll make a comment now which previously, under normal conditions, I  would have delayed making  But in making this comment, I must advise the Committee once again  that everything that is said in this room at all times must be treated on an absolutely confidential  basis      There are differences within the government about steps that can and should be taken to deal   with the dollar problem  The more active our intervention is, the more excuse others within this  government have for not taking some of the more fundamental steps that need to be taken to restore  the integrity of the dollar in foreign exchange markets  That is a political consideration of the very  greatest importance and one that I think we should very much keep in mind  And I would strongly  support Governor Wallich=s recommendations about the scale of our activity, not only for the  reason that he stated, or even mainly for the reason that he stated or implied, but primarily for the  political reasons that I indicated  Namely, [we should do so] to maintain a certain element of  pressure on others in the government to the effect that this intervention activity is of ephemeral,  transitory significance and that other steps that can be taken should be taken without further delay       2/28/78           15     Well, we=re finally ready for your question, Mr Willes      If anything, it’s probably going down  On the other hand, the   probability of certain bridging actions short of fundamental actions has gone up some      Bridging actions would include the sale of gold into the private   market, the sale of SDRs to central banks, or the executive taking certain action on the energy  problem such as imposing a ceiling on imports or imposing a special tariff  The President can  certainly do the latter and I believe he can do the former  I would consider these bridging actions  The most important bridging action we=ve made no headway with, namely the sale of Treasury  securities denominated in foreign currencies  But I personally have not given up on that because I       2/28/78           16  think that=s by far the most important and by far the most effective bridging action that can be taken  at this time  Yes, Mr Roos       I think that is a question that we can best consider a little later in this   meeting when we turn to the longer-range targets      I think that Mr Roos is fundamentally correct if he=s thinking of   periods of a year or longer  There has been a deceleration in monetary growth rates and of inflation  rates around the world in contrast to the United States      I believe in monetary growth rates as well   Well, it depends on the   period  If you take longer periods--I=m not sure about this--I think as a broad generalization that  would stand up      Gentlemen, perhaps the time has come to move along in our agenda    Oh, I=m advised that Mr Holmes has still another recommendation     Let me ask you a question, a procedural question  You say this has   to be an action of the full Committee   Could the full Committee delegate this power to its Foreign  Currency Subcommittee?      All right, we have Mr Holmes=s recommendation     I personally would prefer to have that power delegated to the   Subcommittee rather than have an enlargement at this time  But this is something for the  Committee to decide          2/28/78           18   The reason for the delegation has been stated indirectly by Governor   Wallich, who wants to keep a tighter rein on the scale of operations at the Desk     You’re agreeable to $2 billion?     Leaving it at $2 billion or enlarging it?     You say reasonably promptly  I would say promptly     Well, the recommendation is certainly a reasonable one  What is the   consensus of the Committee?     Any objection?  I hear none  That recommendation is accepted    Let=s move on to Mr Kichline=s report on the economy     Thank you, Mr Kichline  We=re now ready for a discussion of the   economic outlook  Let us keep in mind that the economic discussion will bear critically on our  consideration of the longer-term ranges for the monetary aggregates  Partly for that reason and  partly also because of time constraints, I think it would be best not to raise purely technical  questions at this time  Those questions can be addressed to the staff later on     Let=s turn to the outlook for the coming year, indicating in particular the degree of agreement   or disagreement [with the staff projection] or any special point of view that you may have with  regard to the economy, or agreement or disagreement with the analysis--I think, very able analysis- -upon [which the staff projection is based]  Mr  Partee, please      Thank you, Mr Partee  Mr Baughman, please     Does this refer to municipals?     Mr Eastburn     Thank you, Mr Eastburn  Mr Mayo now, please     Thank you, Mr Mayo  Mr Kimbrel now, please     Thank you, Mr Kimbrel  Mr Morris     Thank you, Mr Morris  Mr Coldwell     Thank you, Mr Coldwell  Mr Wallich, please     Thank you, Mr Wallich  Mr Volcker now, please     Thank you, Mr Volcker  Mr Winn now, please     Mr Kichline, have you been following this development?     It may be a taxpayer’s revolt, but it=s taking an unwholesome   direction  I=m in favor of a taxpayer’s revolt within the law  Well, Mr Kichline, you ought to start  following this      What does that mean--school bonds are not selling or what?     School closings rather than cutting down on expenditures?     Thank you, Mr Winn  Mr Guffey now, please     Thank you, Mr Guffey  Mr Jackson     Thank you, Mr Jackson  Mr Balles now, please          Thank you, Mr Balles  Mr Roos, please     Thank you for your remarks, Mr Roos  MrWilles now     Anyone else want to speak, or speak again?  At this time, let me   make a few comments  I have no quarrel with the staff forecast  I want to say only that if I had  been giving the report, I would have emphasized the degree of uncertainty that attaches to the  forecast somewhat more than Mr Kichline did  I think uncertainty with regard to economic  prospects has been increasing  The evidence is all around us  I think also that the typical view that  there are no serious imbalances is a mistaken one  I think there are serious imbalances  We have  an imbalance in the realm of foreign trade  Our imports are certainly out of balance with the world  economy  We have an imbalance in the sphere of business capital investment; that is certainly out  of balance with the growth of our nation=s overall production  I think consumer credit is out of  balance with personal income  I think wages are out of balance not only with productivity but also  with the level of unemployment  I think the profits are out of balance with personal income and  also with the cost of production  I think the stock market is out of balance with corporate profits  I  think the state of general confidence is out of balance with the performance of the economy  I  think our governmental deficit is badly out of balance with the behavior of the rest of the economy       2/28/78           31    I want to make one additional comment connected with the last [point]  I think our federal   budget is in a very sorry state  It is a budget that is built on the assumption of nothing better than a  lucky performance of the economy  And we may indeed be lucky  But make the arbitrary  assumption that we get into a recession and then the presently projected deficit--which is in the  neighborhood of $75 billion, counting off-budget outlays as we should--could easily go to $120 or  $125 billion this year or next year  If it did, would we ever in our lifetime--and I refer to the  younger men around here who are the great majority--get back to something like financial stability?  I think, as we turn to the next question, our longer-range targets in the years ahead, members of this  Committee will have to keep asking themselves a question each time and I think they should  Who  will fight inflation if the Federal  Reserve does not?      We probably ought to break for coffee and return                                                            [Coffee break]     We are turning now to consideration of the longer-term ranges for   the monetary aggregates  There is an arithmetical point that Mr Axilrod wishes to bring to the  Committee=s attention before we [proceed]      All right, thank you  I=d like to make just a few brief remarks to   introduce the subject  Let me address in particular the M1 growth rate  In general, if we are to do  what we can to reduce the rate of inflation over the longer run, I think we in this Committee will  need to adjust downward our monetary growth rates  I think we all recognize that and we don=t  want to lose sight of that  Secondly, we should recognize, and I think we do, that M1 grew more  rapidly than we intended last year and that a reasonable case, therefore, can be made for a  compensating downward adjustment at this time  But that, I=m afraid, is only the beginning of a  true analysis of where we are and where we ought to try to go, insofar as we can arrive at a  judgment at this time  If we lower the range for M1 growth at this time, I=m afraid that such a  lowering would appear to lack credibility in view of the actual performance [of M1 relative to its  range] during the past year  The opposite side of that coin is that if we sought to lift the range, I       2/28/78           32  think we would run a risk of strengthening inflationary expectations, which are already in the  process of intensifying  And I think that such a decision on the part of this Committee could have  an extremely adverse influence on the foreign exchange value of the dollar at this time  I=m  inclined to think, taking things all in all, that we ought to leave the range where it is at present,  bearing in mind the desirability of lowering it in the future  And if we do succeed in keeping actual  growth within the current range, that in itself would mean an appreciable decline in M1 growth this  year relative to the past year  And I think that the uncertainty that I and others have pointed to with  regard to the economy perhaps also argues for keeping the range where it is at the present time     As for the higher Ms, in view of the likelihood that the inflow of funds to thrift institutions   will be on the low side this year--I think all the evidence is pointing in that direction--it would be  realistic, I think, to lower the M3 range somewhat, as suggested under alternative B on page 5 of  the Bluebook  Or possibly, instead of lowering both the upper and the lower limits by a full  percentage point, we might want to lower them by 1/2 percentage point  But I think some lowering  would only be realistic and it would be honest  Well, that=s all I have to say at this time Who  would like to speak first?  Mr Kimbrel      I think I would leave M2, since the problem is clearly one of the   thrift institutions rather than of the commercial banks  But some of the influences and thinking on  thrift institutions with regard to savings deposits [and] time deposits will also influence commercial  banks      Thank you, Mr Kimbrel  Mr Roos now, please     Well, I think this could be a suggestion the Committee may wish to   consider  In view of the uncertainty that now exists--and I think we all, in varying degrees, are   aware of that--it strikes me as being questionable whether this is the right time to narrow the range  Also, once we narrow it, we may be stuck with a narrow range; the Congressional Committees  have been trying to push us in this direction  Some members of this Committee have thought all  along that the range should be narrower  The question raised, I think, is a very fair one  I  personally wouldn=t do it at this time  Mr Jackson, please      Are you thinking of large CDs?     Is there any clear sign of that developing?     Thank you, Mr Jackson  Mr Mayo now, please     Thank you, Mr Mayo  Mr Wallich now, please     Thank you, Mr Wallich  Mr Partee, please     You were doing beautifully up to this point  Stop worrying about   those fellows!     Thank you, Mr Partee  Mr Coldwell now     Thank you, Mr Coldwell  Mr Morris now, please     But I think the time has come to say that there are no cowards in this   room, period  I don=t want to hear remarks like that     Thank you, Mr Morris  Mr Eastburn now, please     Thank you, Mr Eastburn  Mr Volcker now, please     Thank you, Mr Volcker  Mr Black now, please     Thank you, Mr Black  Mr Willes, please     Thank you, Mr Willes  Mr Balles now, please         2/28/78           39   It=s a new ballgame     Yes, it=s a new ballgame, and I think the consequences for the   monetary growth rates should be taken into account beforehand by the Board  It should be  considered very carefully by the Board before making a final decision on that regulation, which--      Oh, if that regulation is adopted by the Board, it=s a new ballgame   and it would be a most confusing ballgame for quite a while  I think the Board will have to think  very carefully before reaching its decision  And if its decision is to go ahead, then I think that our  work in this Committee will be cut out for us      Well, I think that a significant period needs to be allowed, first for   study of the proposal  And second, if the Board decides to go ahead with the proposal, I think we  need to give the Congress reasonable time to legislate against us if that should be the inclination of  the Congress  I think it would be unwise for us to put any such regulation into effect immediately   So first we have to weigh the regulation  If we decide in favor of it, we ought not to put it into  effect immediately because of our Congressional problems  I think decency and good relations       2/28/78           40  with the Congress require that members of the Congress have a reasonable amount of time to  legislate against us, if that should be their wish  There is a great deal of interest in the Congress on  this issue  And, as you know, the savings and loans are carrying on an extensive campaign  Mr  Guffey now, please      My recommendation was neutral with regard to a half or a full point     Thank you, Mr Guffey  Mr Baughman     Thank you, Mr Baughman  Mr Winn, would you be good enough   to advise us?     All right, thank you, Mr Winn  The Committee is unanimous on   retaining the present range for M1, except for Mr Roos who also agrees with the Committee on the  midpoint of that range  As for M2, the majority of the Committee is inclined to leave the range  where it is presently  And as for M3, the majority is inclined to lower both limits by 1/2 percentage  point  Any further discussion?  If not, I think our rules, as we now practice them, require a vote by  the Committee       2/28/78           41     No, that comes later in connection with the short-run ranges  We=ll   vote on growth ranges from the fourth quarter of  ’77 to the fourth quarter of  ’78 of 4 to 6-1/2  percent for M1, 6-1/2 to 9 percent for M2, and 7-1/2 to 10 percent for M3  And if the Committee  will bear with me, we shall leave it to the staff to adopt an appropriate number for bank credit,  which is what we=ve done in a good many--I think most--of our meetings      There are very good reasons in dealing with the Congress, and also   in our own thinking, to pay some attention to the credit side and not only to the money side     Let us so advise the staff unambiguously     That=s a very useful reminder  Well, we=re ready for the vote, unless   members of the Committee would like further deliberation  Would you be good enough to call the  roll?      Thank you, Mr Sternlight  Are there any questions or comments?           Yes, Mr Jackson     The Desk is allergic to any such activities  Isn=t that true?     Hard for the market to absorb even sales of insignificant volume?     I think it would be a good idea for the Desk to become--I=ll use the   word “courageous” today--or to become prudent or more prudent and to exercise its greater  prudence by one of these days making a sale of an insignificant volume of agency issues      I think the Committee really ought to reach a decision on this--  perhaps it=s too late--and instruct the Desk to be somewhat flexible in that direction     And while we=re on that, there is an age-old practice that I would like   to see changed, but I don=t want to spend more than ten seconds on the point  And that is when we  formally vote, we vote to approve, ratify, and confirm the transactions [of the Desk]  I think it  would be more accurate, and really more proper, simply to ratify them  It would serve every  purpose  But since time immemorial, from a formal viewpoint we have approved, ratified, and  confirmed  Those who support me in simplifying our procedure are being very radical today  On  confining the vote to ratification, may I have a show of hands?      Well, he=d have to defend all his predecessors, too     I think the explaining we will have to do, if any, is why we haven=t   done it in the past--not why we are doing it now      Upsetting?  [Selling] small amounts was upsetting?     One or two hundred million?  Well, I would not call that   insignificant but, you know, I haven=t kept up with this two trillion economy of ours         2/28/78           44   I think the Committee should address this question  And it should be   on the agenda for another meeting  Mr Axilrod, you have a genius for brevity and this is the time  to demonstrate it once again      Any question?  If not, I=d like to go back, if you will permit me, to   the question that was raised about the inclusion of a figure for bank credit in our longer-range  projections  I quickly gave a reason for doing it  And yet, the fact that we as a Committee do not  deal with it is troublesome  I would like to make a suggestion to Mr Partee, or to your committee  We have made an improvement  We used a credit proxy and that behaved in a wild fashion--from  our viewpoint, at least  The bank credit measure is preferable  I think the measure we really need  and one that would be more nearly symmetrical with our monetary aggregates--particularly M3, the  higher monetary aggregate--would be total credit  Our flow of funds projection gives us a basis for  that  And I wish your committee would ponder the wisdom and the desirability of substituting total  credit for bank credit in our longer-run projections      Maybe  I wish you=d think about that pretty carefully and then at a   later time make a recommendation  Perhaps in the future, with a wiser or more defensible measure  of credit, the Committee would want to ponder it or to take it into account  Well, I=m glad you=ll  undertake that study to find out     I think we=re ready now to move on to the shorter-range specifications  I find alternative B   entirely acceptable  The only additional comment I would make is that in view of the position of  the dollar in the foreign exchange markets--and that is something that is not likely to change  quickly or dramatically--we ought to think most carefully about doing anything that would lower  interest rates at this time  On the other hand, any appreciable rise in interest rates, in view of  uncertainties that surround the economy, would also seem dubious  I=d be inclined to stick with  alternative B and probably with a money market directive  Let=s hear from the Committee  Mr  Volcker      I just object to that  That violates every canon of the English   language, really, to have a range of 1/4 of one percent and talk about a monetary aggregates  directive      We have gotten to a point of fine-tuning that is far beyond our   knowledge or understanding or even our good sense  I=ve made myself clear, I hope     All right  Thank you, Mr Volcker  Mr Coldwell now, please     Thank you, Mr Coldwell  Mr Black, please     Thank you, Mr Black  Mr Wallich, please     May I point out one thing?  The next meeting will be held three  weeks from today  We will have figures on monetary aggregates that will be worth paying some  attention to only by Thursday of next week, which is approximately a week and half from now  If  there ever was a time to try to stand still, both because of the brevity of the [intermeeting] period  and because of conditions in the foreign exchange market and the economy, I would think this is  just  about the time  Thank you, Mr Wallich  We=ll proceed with Mr Kimbrel, please      Thank you, Mr Kimbrell  Mr Partee, please     Thank you, Mr Partee  Mr Morris     Thank you, Mr Morris  Mr Baughman  This is turning out to be a   very interesting meeting     Thank you, Mr Baughman  Mr Guffey now     Mr Willes, please     Thank you, Mr Willes  But I do want to remind the Committee,   once again, that we are talking about an intermeeting period of just half the duration of the  preceding one  Mr Eastburn      Thanks, Mr Eastburn  Mr Jackson      Thank you, Mr Jackson  Mr Mayo now, please     I would go along with Mr Mayo  Yes, I think Mr Mayo=s right    Any objections to that?     Yes, please     Well, if you agree with Mr Mayo, that is sufficient     No, no, no  There=s no such thing     We=ll move on     Thank you, Mr Mayo and Mr Baughman  We move to Mr Roos       2/28/78           51     Well, the aggregates are fully alive and we move on  Mr Balles   now, please     Well, that=s what bothers me  If you just went back 8 years--!     Would anyone else like to speak?     On the Merrill suit, the Solicitor General will be recommending to   the Supreme Court that the Supreme Court take on the case  That is a favorable development    Now, we=re trying to move the two Banking Committees to give us legislative relief, on the  assumption that down the road the Supreme Court will either be unwilling to take on the case or, if       2/28/78           52  it does, may move against us and uphold the lower courts  The bill has been introduced in the  Senate  I had talked to Mr Reuss before in a meeting, telephoned him the other day, and sent him  a letter yesterday urging him to introduce the bill without committing himself to it  Whether he  will or not, I don=t know  If he doesn=t, we will get another Congressman to do it  It would be best,  however, if the chairman of the committee introduced the bill without necessarily committing  himself to it       Well, gentlemen, I think that we=ve had a good deal of discussion, a good deal of banter, and   some differences; the differences are really very minor  A very clear majority of the Committee  favors alternative B  There was some uncertainty, however, in my own mind as to the directive  I  think we=ll need a show of hands on that  Those who are in favor of a monetary aggregate  directive, kindly indicate      Let=s say that the range is 6-1/2 to 7     I=m sorry  The M1 range that a majority favors is 1 to 6 percent as in   alternative B  Let=s make that assumption  Of course, we could proceed another way but I think  that=s the most reasonable assumption to make  The differences are not large, you know  The 0 to  6 is a difference on the midpoint of 1/2 percent; 0 to 5,  yes, is a larger difference, but a majority  clearly favors 1 to 6  Assuming a range of 1 to 6, would the Committee favor a monetary aggregate  directive?      That means I have no way of helping the Committee     Well, actually, I would sum up the thinking of the Committee a little   differently  If we had a range for the federal funds rate that is lower than 1/2 percentage point [in  width], it wouldn=t be 6-3/4 to 7, it would be something like 6-5/8 to 6-7/8  I think that=s the  thinking of the Committee at this time  A range of 6-3/4 to 7, despite the eloquence with which the  case was first presented by Mr Volcker and despite the enthusiasm with which it was endorsed by  Mr Partee, did not win any more adherents--not because the case was put poorly, but because this  Committee is stiff-necked and did not want to move in that direction     How do we resolve this question of the directive language?  I=m not [feeling] very Solomonic   today  Let me try again This time my question is Will the members of the Committee who favor a  money market directive kindly indicate their preference by raising their hands      Now this time I=m going to proceed a little differently  How many   who prefer a monetary aggregates directive would still not feel comfortable with a money market  directive, whether or not you prefer it?  Let=s have a show of hands      In fairness, I think I now have to ask the question  How many   members of the Committee, whether or not you prefer a monetary aggregates directive, would feel  reasonably comfortable with it?      With the other specifications     Well, maybe I should have been less fair  Maybe I should have   stopped when I asked how many, whether or not you prefer a money market directive, could be  reasonably comfortable for a three-week period with it  Perhaps I should have stopped there  Let  me pursue this  Mr Guffey didn=t understand the question  Let me stay on this track of fairness,  though not indefinitely  How many of you would feel reasonably comfortable with a monetary  aggregates directive over a period of the next three weeks, whether or not you prefer a monetary  aggregates directive?      With a 1 to 6 percent [M1] range     Now, we have the narrowest margin on the most subtle point in favor   of money market directive--not in favor of but willing to live with it for only a three-week period   Unless there is a desire for further discussion--  Yes, there is such a desire      The 0 to 5 range with a money market directive as against 1 to 6 with   an aggregates directive?     All right  Those who prefer the former would kindly indicate that     Three       2/28/78           55     No, don=t resign  Apart from missing your cheerful countenance, we   might be short of a quorum  I=d be a little worried about that     Gentlemen, I think we=re ready for a vote  The vote is on a growth   range for M1 of 1 to 6 percent; a range for M2 of 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent; a federal funds range of  6-1/2 to 7 percent; and a money market directive  Before we do that, on line 12 of the draft of the  domestic policy directive, Mr Broida suggests that we state 1-1/2 instead of 1 percent  I assume  that has been checked out by the staff and I assume that it=s [accurate]  Mr Jackson?      I would eliminate the word [“unsettled” and say] “including   conditions in foreign exchange markets”          I think so  Any objection to dropping the word “unsettled”?  I think   it=s better form  Thank you  Are we ready for the vote now?  Would you call the roll?       Well, I want to thank all of you for a very interesting meeting  I  didn=t want to say this but I can say it now  If there ever was a time for this Committee to be  unanimous, it was today     Now, I got a note before--this came in about twenty minutes ago and I haven=t had one   subsequently--which reads as follows  As of this moment the Senate Banking Committee is now  voting on waiving the 24-hour rule and will vote now on Miller That means that Mr Miller may  be confirmed or perhaps is even likely to be confirmed by the committee today  If so, I think that  would be good news for the System  I think we=ll have more information at lunchtime  We are  going to take luncheon together  Or for those of you who are [available], I thought we could have  luncheon together  Those of you who have made appointments, of course, feel free to keep them  I  have no specific agenda, but a room is reserved  What room is it?      Well, there are how many members?    SPEAKER(?)  A total of 17 Board members and Reserve Bank Presidents     Well, if all of the Board members and Presidents come, we have   room for our Secretary and for Mr Axilrod  That makes 19 and I shall think about the 20th one          I don=t know, but he=s been in the hospital since a week ago this   Friday  He is continuing to undergo tests, which leaves us with a great deal of hope, but all of  which does suggest that there are problems that require further explanation and may be serious  I  hope not     END OF MEETING      "
673,1978-03-10,"  Good morning, gentlemen, can you hear me?    SPEAKERS(?)  Yes      The main reason for calling this morning’s meeting is to consider an   increase in our swap line with the Bundesbank from $2 billion to $4 billion  Now, that will be  explained in due course  But while we’re having the meeting, it also seemed desirable to have the  Federal Open Market Committee review the specifications that we set out, particularly with regard  to the federal funds rate, at our February meeting  As I think you all know, the monetary growth  rates have turned quite weak and, therefore, in the normal course of events a telegram would have  gone to the Committee  But since we’ll be discussing the swap line with the Bundesbank, this is  also a good time to consider the second item, namely our present federal funds rate objective      Now, I have one other matter to bring before the Committee  As you know, a new Chairman  of the Committee is to be elected at the organizational meeting scheduled for March 21  But in  view of the fact that Bill Miller has assumed the responsibility of serving as Chairman of the  Federal Reserve Board, and he is now acting and acting vigorously in that capacity, I think it would  be constructive and desirable that he be elected Chairman of the FOMC at this time  It gives me  very great pleasure to suggest to the Committee that we elect Mr Miller now, and then having  elected him, that I turn the meeting over to him  Is there any objection on the part of any member  of the Committee?  [Hearing none, that action is approved]  I don’t hear the applause  [Applause]   Good, that’s better!      Well, I think this is a fine way to proceed  We all wish you the very best   luck and now--let me have that gavel--I turn over this weighty gavel to you  If anybody  misbehaves, you have your instrument at hand      That is, if we repaid the $16 billion, the outstanding swap would drop from   $4 billion to $24 billion     Well, I’d like to say a word or two  As I think the members of the  Committee know, I have not been enthusiastic about intervention policy in view of the fundamental  factors that have been causing difficulties for the dollar and in view of the need to deal with  fundamental factors and also to adopt some bridging actions of a kind that we’ve talked about in  the past  Now, I also have indicated to the Committee previously that, to the extent that we do  intervene--and there is no escape from it on a certain scale--I would very much hope that we would  do so on a modest scale  Among other reasons, I think it is important to keep up some pressure on  the Treasury and on the Administration to deal with bridging actions and the fundamental factors   All this would argue in favor of just staying at the $2 billion figure, not going to $4 billion     Nevertheless, that is not my conclusion and I must explain why  The Treasury and our   President are [now] involved in very serious conversations with the Germans  The Administration,  in other words, has been working toward a statement on dollar policy or on policy looking toward  some strengthening of the dollar’s position  Or to put it differently, the policy is looking toward  some checking of the deterioration that has been taking place The Administration is actively  involved; the German government is actively involved  A package is emerging and it’s not an  impressive package  To avoid embarrassment to this government and to strengthen the possibility  that something constructive in markets will take place, I think it’s essential to raise the figure from  $2 billion to $4 billion at the present time  I recognize that this may lead to larger intervention than  most of us, or many of us--I certainly--would like  But this is something that I think this  Committee and particularly our new Chairman can’t control in very large part  And therefore, my  strong recommendation to the Committee is that we look forward to an increase in the swap line   Now these conversations have gone a certain distance; they haven’t concluded  I’m talking now  about other items in the package  Well, for that matter, [on the proposed change in] the swap     3/10/78              4  facility we still need formal approval by the Germans  All this may possibly break down  I hope  not because the dollar is in difficulty and there is great uneasiness not only in our own country but  around the entire world      I think it must be internal sabotage!     I think it’s fair to add, at least at my end, that I have not discussed a takeout   by the Treasury in connection with possibly expanded swap activity     We don’t have at the present time an agreement with the Treasury that we   will proceed on a strict 50-50 basis  In fact, there has been an understanding that we may have to  take a larger proportion of the total amount of intervention  However, let us keep in mind that the  Treasury under the present plan will have available not only approximately $1 billion, which could  be used for intervention purposes, but [also gold]  A good deal of discussion has taken place with  regard to sales of gold by the Treasury  Now, this is not a part of the present package, and one  important reason is that French elections will take place very shortly and this could complicate the  problems of the French government  But I think it’s reasonable to assume that in the course of the  year a policy will be adopted by the Treasury to sell off gold  How much, I couldn’t say, and I  don’t think anyone in the Treasury could say at the present time  But I would certainly attach a  pretty high probability to some significant sales of gold by the Treasury before the year is over      Also, it helps us in our relations with the Congress and that’s an important   consideration     You say you cannot?     I would suggest that we not adopt a very rigid rule  I’m fully in sympathy   with what Phillip has been saying; I’ve made that clear  And perhaps a rule such as expecting the  Treasury to take no less than 40 percent would serve the purpose just as well  We need a little  flexibility     3/10/78              9     To a total of $4 billion     If the present conversations that the Treasury is having with the German   government prosper, the chances are that the technical details concerning the repayment of our loan  to the Bundesbank will not have been settled  My present guess is that this will go forward sooner  than we would have been able to work out the technical details with the Germans      Unless there is some change   "
