5140,1994-08-16," Thank you  Thank you; it's good to be here  Two issues are of importance to me in assessing the current economic situation First, how much momentum is there in the expansion and second how much slack is in the economy, how close is it to potential output? With respect to the issue of momentum, I  -27-    8/16/94  find myself largely in agreement with the staff analysis presented in the Greenbook Real growth is slowing, but I do think there remains enough momentum to keep aggregate demand growing at a rate somewhat in excess of the growth rate of potential output long enough to push the economy above potential in the absence of some further monetary restraint My own estimate of the degree of momentum in demand has increased over the last few months Most important in my thinking, the decline in the value of the dollar and upward revisions in estimates concerning the strength of foreign economies will be reducing the drag on demand that stems from net exports In line with the staff forecast, I also expect the declining dollar to feed through to some mild upward pressure on import prices Now that the economy is close to potential, higher import prices should create a bit more scope for American producers of import substitutes to raise their own prices I don't want to overemphasize the impact of the dollar decline on aggregate demand and prices, but at the margin, especially in the context of an economy that is nearing potential, this seems like a source of momentum And I see these international factors as offsetting to some extent the moderating influence of higher interest rates on housing and consumer durables spending The strength of new orders for durable goods and the strong profit projections suggest continuing strength in investment, and the staff analysis convinces me that there are risks that the slowdown in demand could be insufficient, absent some further tightening to prevent overheating  With respect to the issue of how close the economy is to potential, I confess uncertainty here Nevertheless, on the basis of both econometric and anecdotal evidence, it seems to me that output has not yet passed potential, although we are approaching it I don't yet see strong enough indications of tightness in labor markets, or enough signs of increasing wage pressure, or sufficient indication of a pickup in the growth of unit labor costs to conclude that we have ventured beyond potential Capacity utilization is high by historical standards, but investment also is adding to capacity at a rapid rate I see only scattered evidence of lengthening lags in filling orders On balance, I'd say my sense is that the economy could stay where it is in terms of unemployment or even shave a few tenths more off the unemployment rate without risking significantly a pickup in inflation This inclines me toward the feeling that there should be some tightening of policy to reduce momentum, but somewhat less than the Greenbook assumes The Greenbook forecasts for real growth in 1995 are somewhat too low in my opinion to end up with an economy in 1995 that is operating near enough to potential  Mr Chairman, I support your proposal and believe there is a good chance that a 50 basis point increase in the funds rate now will be sufficient in the absence of significant news And I like the proposed statement that you read "
5166,1994-09-27," I agree with the central message of the Greenbook that most of the new information that has accumulated during the last six weeks points to continued strength in aggregate demand  -29-    9/27/94  The incoming data do not yet provide any significant evidence of a sufficient slowdown in real GDP growth However, this is not based on a great deal of evidence A lot more data will be coming in over the next month that will clarify whether this impression is correct or not I personally am concerned that we have put quite a bit of restraint into the pipeline, a good share of it quite recently, and it may yet make its impact felt Under the Greenbook assumption of an additional 100 basis point rise in the funds rate, I am considerably more pessimistic than the Greenbook about the 1996 forecast for real growth For example, in the MPS model the impact of such a tightening becomes really discernible only after about four quarters, namely by early 1996 And after eight quarters, such a rise would take about 09 percent off real GDP That leaves me with a sense that a forecast of 22 or 23 percent real growth in 1996 may be overly optimistic with that added restraint  A key question now concerns the behavior of prices--whether there is evidence at this stage that inflation is accelerating This in my view is an especially important issue given our concern with inflation as an ultimate policy goal and also the feeling that the economy is operating at close to potential where there is a decided risk that inflation could begin to creep up But here my analysis differs somewhat from the staff forecast In particular, I think we are seeing and will continue to see for a time an increase in the relative prices of raw materials and imported goods These higher prices will feed through into the CPI for a period of time, causing a temporary increase in the rate of inflation but not a permanent increase in the trend inflation rate, or worse yet, an acceleration in inflation I think the increase in inflation will be temporary even if there is only enough restraint to hold the unemployment rate at its present level, roughly the natural rate given staff estimates And I think the markets have overreacted to the increase in producer prices in August  Now, the Greenbook is also forecasting that consumer price inflation will be up for the next three quarters and then will return to roughly 3 percent by the end of 1995, and I agree with that forecast My difference with the Greenbook concerns whether or not a period of unemployment in excess of the natural rate is needed to get inflation back into line I think not, but the Greenbook thinks that it will require a period of unemployment in excess of the natural rate in the latter half of 1995 and 1996 to subdue inflation, and that's something more than a quibble because it does govern one's view about how much additional restraint it is going to take to hold inflation at its present level  To elaborate just a bit, I think we are witnessing now a perfectly normal cyclical phenomenon, namely, the relative prices of primary commodities and raw materials tend naturally to increase with the level of domestic and more importantly world economic activity The prices of these materials have been increasing rapidly all year, but from initially depressed levels I expect these prices to rise further due to faster global growth, but then I expect them to stop rising once economic activity stabilizes Similarly, we have had a significant depreciation of the dollar, which is causing and will probably continue to cause for a time a rise in the level of import prices But the staff doesn't expect the dollar depreciation to  -30-    9/27/94  continue and so we should expect import prices also to rise and then stop rising  My conclusion is that these shocks should feed into faster CPI inflation only for a time, and once the adjustment is complete, inflation should revert toward its previous level I expect this to occur even if the CPI increase feeds partially through into wages, although the greater this feedback, the longer this temporary burst in inflation will persist I agree with Governor Kelley that there is a danger that inflationary expectations can overreact Historically, I think the evidence on the likely pass-through of temporary price shocks into wages is quite inconclusive  The only caveat I want to add in this analysis is that I'm assuming along with the Greenbook that the unemployment rate is not going to be allowed to fall below the natural rate--and that means not very much lower than it currently is--for any significant period of time With respect to the question of whether or not we are below the natural rate, I think wage behavior provides the best direct evidence The fact that wages have been so well-behaved, with average hourly earnings rising only 02 percent last month, for example, convinces me that we have not overshot the natural rate  I support your proposal, Mr Chairman I think it's conceivable that sufficient evidence could accumulate over the next month or so to warrant a rate hike before our next meeting, but it would take quite a bit to convince me that further tightening prior to the next meeting is in order "
5191,1994-11-15," Since our last meeting, the evidence has continued to accumulate that there is enough momentum in aggregate demand to carry the economy past potential output We have yet to see much slowdown in the interest-sensitive sectors, and it may well be that easier lending terms have offset somewhat the impact of higher interest rates The news on the international side of yet further upward revisions in foreign GDP growth reinforces the view that the economy will overshoot the NAIRU with potentially inflationary consequences The recent decline in the dollar exacerbates this concern, although fortunately the dollar has risen a bit against both the mark and the yen since the Greenbook was put to bed The amount of slack in the economy, however it is measured, clearly has diminished I think that the performance of wages and prices accords quite well with the predictions of a Phillips curve model in which the economy is currently in the vicinity of the natural rate So there are few surprises there It is not surprising that we are seeing some early warning signs of rising inflation, including business reports that there will be price increases after the first of the year and anecdotes about rising wages to retain and attract qualified employees I think the staff's inflation forecast that the CPI will rise to 3-1/2 percent in the first half of 1995 is quite reasonable based on historic experience It is difficult, though, to construct a scenario in which inflation over the next year would rise by a lot more than the staff forecast So, I think there is limited upside risk of an inflation rate increase over the next year or so The key question, of course, is whether and how quickly this modest rise in core inflation may become embedded in inflationary expectations, feeding back into wage and price formation I think there is risk here unless aggregate demand is restrained  Now, what concerns me most in connection with the Greenbook forecast is that the assumed further tightening of 150 basis points entails considerable downside risk to the economy that will be concentrated in 1996 In light of the current strength in the  -30-    11/15/94  interest-sensitive sectors, it is tempting to conclude that the monetary tightening we have had so far isn't producing and will not produce the slowdown we desire But the time honored view among economists is that monetary policy operates with long lags I consider this view to be supported by considerable empirical evidence If so, there is a real risk of a hard landing, instead of a soft landing, if we are too impatient and overract Demand may be strong now because monetary conditions were so easy until last spring The tightening is really quite recent and its impact most likely has not yet been fully felt Indeed, as President Jordan noted in his comments, the November Michigan survey suggests a sharp deterioration in household appraisals of buying conditions for houses and significant declines in willingness to use credit and savings The October survey suggested that some of the current strength in housing may stem from the belief that interest rates are on the rise, so it is better to buy now than later  This view, namely that there remains restraint in the pipeline, seems consistent to me with the Greenbook forecast because, given the lags of monetary policy, the Greenbook's projected slowdown in 1995 must primarily be related to the interest rate increases that already have occurred, along with other factors, and can't be related primarily to the assumed further tightening of 150 basis points The staff forecast implicitly assumes that we already have enough restraint to slow growth in 1995 by enough to bring unemployment back to the natural rate by the end of 1995 In that case, the argument for an additional 150 basis points of restraint rests on the staff's assumption that without that restraint, demand would rebound strongly in 1996 Now, that view may be correct, but the logic of why there would be this strong rebound in demand in 1996 without the 150 basis points of additional restraint does not seem compelling to me I think there is a distinct possibility that that much extra restraint would represent overkill and that the overkill would make itself felt in 1996 In addition, I would point out that the Greenbook forecast assumes that the tightening is going to have relatively little additional effect on long-term rates While I'm not a good forecaster of movements in long-term rates, certainly that assumption has proven incorrect thus far I conclude that the degree of tightening assumed in the Greenbook poses a serious risk of a hard landing in 1996, although in the absence of some further tightening, I think there would be an unacceptable risk that inflation would accelerate  As I mentioned, it seems clear to me that some tightening of policy is needed to prevent inflation from accelerating, but I have strong doubts about the need for an additional 150 basis  -40-    11/15/94  points My guess is that it will take 75 to get the job done, and I can live with 75 basis points today But on balance, I guess I would agree with Ed Boehne, and I would favor 50 today I share his concerns As Don mentioned, it worries me that in the absence of an announcement of the type we issued in August, 75 can backfire Instead of simply flattening the yield curve and our seeing very little effect on long-term rates, a rise of this magnitude may raise market expectations both about the risks of inflation--because we are so concerned about it--and market expectations about the ultimate expected tightening that we intend here I am concerned about the possibility that bond yields could rise more than the Greenbook forecast, which could provoke a stock market reaction My own preference would be for 50 today, but I can live with 75 as well "
5216,1994-12-20," My opinion concerning the strength and likely future direction of the economy has changed just marginally since our last meeting Certainly, the evidence has continued to accumulate that we have an economy with a very good head of steam We see that in the employment report, a significant rise in the help wanted index, growing order backlogs, and frankly to my surprise in the Michigan indexes of car, appliance, and house buying intentions which all turned up after having fallen, in some cases substantially, in November So I must admit I'm surprised to see so little evidence of a slowdown, although I continue to feel--as I stated last time--that we are seeing in part the lagged effects of a prolonged period of low interest rates, as Governor Blinder also noted  There is certainly some risk that real growth will slow less in 1995 than the Greenbook forecast now assumes and that we could overshoot potential output in 1995 by more Nevertheless, I'll just continue to emphasize, as others and I have in the past, that our previous actions have added a great deal of restraint to the pipeline Since our last meeting real interest rates have risen considerably, and as Bill McDonough emphasized, real interest rates by various measures are not low by historical standards We have seen, finally,  -29-    12/20/94  a decline in the stock market, which will bring wealth effects on consumer spending into play, and for once the dollar has been appreciating--which re-enforces direct interest rate effects and plays some moderating influence on the inflation forecast In addition, of course, as Mike has emphasized, inventory accumulation is bound to slow and it seems possible to me that accelerator mechanisms can then kick in to slow the economy significantly  So, I see a number of changes in the pipeline that I expect to work to cool off demand but with a very substantial lag And frankly at this stage I remain uncertain as to just where the economy would be in 1996 with the 100 to 150 basis points increase that is assumed in the Greenbook I share the concern of a number of private forecasters and of some of you that this degree of tightening in the near term could slow demand growth and that we could end up producing a boom/bust scenario To avoid such an outcome, it seems to me that the funds rate would have to fall rather quickly, by more than the Greenbook assumes, once growth slows to trend, even with the economy below the NAIRU  Mr Chairman, I favor alternative B to hold the funds rate at 5-1/2 percent at this meeting, and I favor it for the reasons suggested in the Bluebook I also concur with the sentiments expressed by Governors Blinder and Lindsey and President Forrestal I think a wait-and-see strategy is reasonable, given the magnitude of previous tightening and particularly given our uncertainty about whether and how much the economy is likely to slow on its own and my own uncertainty about how much additional tightening is going to be needed I would prefer a symmetric directive with a strong presumption that we would wait until the next meeting in order to act "
5229,1994-12-30, Second 
5271,1995-01-31," Exactly  Governor Kelley mentioned that it is possible to spin out two rather different scenarios concerning the economic forecast at this point, and I agree with him In one scenario, no significant slowdown is in sight and the inflation outlook is pretty worrisome In the second, we do have a slowdown in progress We have already seen the first signs of that and it could be larger than the Greenbook anticipates Frankly, at the moment I am losing about the same amount of sleep worrying about each of these possibilities I think the baseline Greenbook forecast resolves the various uncertainties in an extremely sensible way to come up with a point forecast It is giving reasonable weight to the new data that point to a slowdown, but it also is maintaining some skepticism about its magnitude I want to convey my compliments to the chef on the forecast and I want to add my thanks for having changed the presentation for which I am very grateful; it also helps me think about policy  What I conclude, though, is that the risk in the forecast has increased a lot My level of uncertainty about where things are headed is higher than at any previous time over the last six months Now, it seems to me as I read the newspapers that the press is almost uncritically accepting the slowdown scenario, producing new anecdotes in support of that view almost every day I think there are signs that the economy is slowing down Governor Blinder has explained why we should be expecting to see a slowdown, based on the idea that we still have restraint in the pipeline, and it should be making a big difference between 1995 and 1994 as he explained I am not going to review that reasoning, but I want to comment about some of the evidence  We had a surprising and unanticipated slowdown in retail sales in November and December, resulting in consumption expenditures in the fourth quarter that were lower than the Greenbook anticipated and inventory accumulation that was higher Governor Lindsey has been  -100-    1/31-2/1/95  pointing to the massive buildup in consumer debt, which arguably will soon lead to some significant retrenchment I think we could end up with a larger inventory cycle than is anticipated in the Greenbook Reinforcing the possibility of a slowdown, we have a decline in durable goods orders, once defense orders are excluded It looks to me as though those numbers are somewhat consistent with capital spending growth at least cooling off All the anecdotal evidence from the reports about home building suggests that we have an industry that is on the verge of decline We had a Dodge report yesterday pointing to a significant slide in construction spending We now see automobile companies offering rebates on popular models, lowering production plans, and shutting down assembly lines for some periods Dealer orders for inventories appear to have declined, maybe because the cost of carrying them is higher now, but maybe also because traffic through showrooms has declined On the international front, as Governor Blinder pointed out, we have risks of declines in our exports to two of our most important trading partners, Mexico and Canada, with the possibility that if the Mexican crisis harms other emerging markets, our exports can suffer there too We now have passage of a balanced budget amendment in the House and talk of fiscal restraint, and I certainly do not know where that is headed I do not disagree in any way with what the Greenbook has done to produce a point forecast, but I see some downside risk there, too  I couple those negative demand side factors with the fact that inflation has been well contained--running lower in the fourth quarter than I think anyone expected, with the ECI numbers suggesting no significant evidence of wage pressures even in very tight labor markets including the Midwest Now, I agree with the assessment of Phillips curve models I do not think there is significant reason to change our estimate of the NAIRU at this stage A couple of numbers seem to be off, but they are within the range of forecast errors, so I am not yet buying into the idea that the NAIRU is lower than 6 percent But that possibility is alive in my mind; I do not have a closed mind to it, and I don't think any of us should I consider that a live possibility but not one I am yet ready personally to endorse  Then I come back to the issue that Bob Forrestal mentioned, and I think it is important especially given the lags in policy I do not want to cross the barrier into policy, but we can ask just how high rates are at this point Are they high or low by historical standards? I come out with an assessment that they are not low by historical standards The real fed funds rate is not low even given where we are in the business cycle A couple of years ago, John Taylor, a Stanford professor who was a member of the Council of Economic Advisers, devised a very simple monetary policy rule that I look at to provide a rough sense of whether or not the funds rate is at a reasonable level One property of this so-called Taylor rule is that it is quite sensible in the sense that it takes his forward- looking econometric model and looks for rules that perform well As I mentioned yesterday, the Taylor rule is a hybrid rule; it is a policy rule based on the output gap and on deviations of an inflation target from 2 percent It performs well, but maybe even more importantly it provides an incredibly close approximation of the Fed's reaction function since 1986 with the sole exception that the Fed eased more in 1992 and 1993 and then tightened more since early February 1994 than the rule would have called for With the inflation and output gaps at  -101-    1/31-2/1/95  present levels, this rule right now would be forecasting a funds rate of 51 percent Other sensible rules, including nominal GDP targeting rules that we mentioned yesterday, would also be looking for a fed funds rate at this point in the 5 to 56 percent range, so we are not so far from target  Having said all of that, it seems to me that one also could discount most of what I just said about the slowdown We are all looking for evidence of a slowdown, and I am worried that saying we are there, as Cathy said, may be wishful thinking--two retail sales numbers do not make a trend Consumer debt is up but so is income, and the debt service burdens of households are not rising Consumer optimism is high Order backlogs are growing even if durable goods orders have tapered off, and the levels remain high, and that hardly presages a downturn in investment spending Yes, inventories have risen a bit, but inventory/sales ratios are not high, and the downside risk from this source is somewhat limited In any case, the Greenbook is anticipating a decline in inventory investment The inventory downturn would have to be still larger to create significant downside risk Automobile manufacturers, of course, do not want sales to fall off, but we are counting on some slackening in demand for autos With respect to housing, it may be strong because employment and personal income have been growing One could argue that seeing will be believing; we really have not seen anything much happen yet in spite of the anecdotes  If I had to assign probabilities to these two different scenarios at the moment, I would put a 7 on the strong scenario and a 3 on the weak one that I started with, coming out exactly where the Greenbook does on balance But the conclusion I want to leave you with is that my level of uncertainty has increased enormously, and I think the potential forecast error at this point is extremely high My policy conclusions follow from the idea that the risk at this point is extremely high  I would like to associate myself fully with Governor Blinder's analysis and also with the conclusions that he drew from it As I indicated, I think the forecast risk is very high at the moment, and I also agree that more data would be helpful in deciding On the other hand, if I absolutely had to decide today, I would favor a further 50 basis point increase in the funds rate If we knew that we needed that increase in the funds rate, I do agree that sooner is better than later On the other hand, a short delay imposes only a very minimal cost I do not think we should feel compelled to raise the funds rate today, and I do see definite benefits from waiting a little longer to decide I fear that if we act today, our move may turn out to be one we will regret I realize,  -113-    1/31-2/1/95  of course, that if we wait another few weeks as Governor Blinder suggested, we will see further data that I would definitely like to see an additional retail sales reading, another employment report, and some further CPI and PPI numbers I would like to see another housing starts number and some auto sales numbers as well In my mind, this would reduce my uncertainty about which of the scenarios is the right one That is why I favor waiting, not at all until the next meeting but just for a few weeks, to look at those data  I understand that there is an expectation on the part of the market that we are going to move 50 basis points today, but I don't think that should force us to move today The market's expectation, which I read as a further 150 basis points increase before we stop tightening policy, does not coincide with my own On the basis of current information, I am envisioning only this 50 basis point increase Given what I know about the economy and the uncertainty that I have about the natural rate, it would take a lot of new information for me to contemplate going up 150 basis points That is part of the reason why I mentioned the Taylor rule, to give us a sense of where we think the funds rate should be I find that many people I talk to reason as follows As long as actual growth exceeds growth in potential output--that is, as long as the economy is growing faster than, say, 25 percent--the funds rate should be raised Sometimes I find myself falling into that pattern of thinking, too--that the economy is growing too quickly and that means we should tighten some more But this is a crazy way of thinking, and it definitely runs the risk of ending up with too much tightening We can move 25 basis points or 50 or 75 basis points each time, and that is the way we end up with overkill That is why I think we have to have a sensible notion of the right level toward which we should be heading And we may have to stop before we see the slowdown under way The Greenbook has one way of coming at what that level should be--7 percent I do not disagree with the Greenbook strategy But the Taylor rule and the other rules that were distributed to you call for a rate in the 5 percent range, which is where we already are Therefore, I am not imagining another 150 basis points  In spite of having said that my choice would be to wait, I intend to vote for your proposal The reason is that I think the differences that we have largely concern tactics and not strategy My guess is that, while I would prefer to wait, the probability is high that in three weeks I would want to go along, that I too would prefer a 50 basis point increase I also grant that my views on tactics could be wrong and, therefore, I do not intend to dissent "
5308,1995-03-28," The data that we reviewed at our last meeting provided inconclusive and, as we put it, tentative signs of slowing in growth The magnitude of any moderation in demand growth seemed uncertain and the timing of the long awaited slowdown was also in question That certainly raised the concern that it wasn't going to occur quickly enough to avoid a further reduction in labor market slack, with future inflationary consequences Since that meeting, I think we have learned a lot, although I agree that not all doubts have been erased From my point of view, the Greenbook does an outstanding job of digesting all the new information The analysis it presents is very well reasoned I would say the evidence in hand now points to a slowdown that is somewhat greater and more pervasive than previously anticipated The incoming data coupled, of course, with our recent rate hike have led to downward revisions in the projected growth in virtually every component of demand I think the outlook for net exports, at least beyond the current horizon, is the single modest exception to that pattern From my standpoint, what we are finally seeing is the result of previous Fed tightening emerging through the pipeline, with the interest-sensitive sectors, housing and autos, leading the way exactly as theory and past experience predict On the down side, we are now seeing a significant inventory buildup in automobiles leading to production cuts in the spring, and that significantly weakens the forecast in the near term Investment growth also looks like it is slowing, not excessively but nevertheless slowing So, at the moment the economy looks to me like it is not too hot, it is not too cold, it is just right  The long-term inflation risk, it seems to me, is not entirely absent Therefore, we have to be vigilant to see how things progress from here But it does seem to me that the risk has subsided a little We now have a forecast embodying more labor market slack in 1995 and 1996 than our last Greenbook forecast, and a forecast of significant new capacity coming on line Most important, of course, what we are seeing is, to my mind, surprising and continued moderation in compensation growth and subdued growth in unit labor costs If wages continue to be, as Ed Boehne put it, a nonproblem, that suggests that eventually we may have reason to question whether that the NAIRU is 6 percent or 1 or so lower I think we should keep an open mind on that topic  The Greenbook emphasizes that the dollar poses significant risk to the forecast I thought the simulations in the Greenbook did a very good job of assessing the risk I agree with President Forrestal that the exchange rate should not be a target of our policy, but it does have appreciable effects on output and inflation Nevertheless, it does seem to me that the risks from the dollar are roughly balanced because, although we are told some interesting stories about why the dollar is doing what it is doing, I think when all is said and done that I would agree with Ted's conclusion that in truth the recent movement in the dollar does not seem to be warranted by any perceptible change in fundamentals On balance, I would say that in a market like this where psychology matters so much, random walks work well That is probably going to be the best forecast of where things are headed Certainly, the dollar could move a lot, but  -36-    3/28/95  it could go either up or down The Greenbook assumption of a path with the dollar staying where it is seems appropriate to me, on balance I take as the moral of those simulations that what we need to do at this point is watch and wait and be prepared to adjust policy in either direction if the exchange rate or any other risk factor in this forecast changes significantly On balance, I see the risks to the forecast as being in both directions and roughly balanced at this point  I agree with your proposal for alternative B for no change today Although I could live with asymmetric, I would prefer symmetric for the reasons that have been explained by President Forrestal and Governor Blinder At the moment, it seems to me that the economy, with some reasonable probability, is on track for a soft landing There are all kinds of uncertainties in the outlook Indeed, we may have a false negative; we may be learning that There remains a risk that inflation may not come down in the way we would like I certainly hold open the possibility that at some future point we may need to raise rates more But over this next intermeeting period, when I think about what data are likely to come in, it seems to me that the risks are balanced and that tends to call for symmetry Certainly, I agree with what Don said We should not get stuck where we are I have no objection whatsoever to intermeeting changes The approach of possibly smaller changes, 25 basis points one way or another, has a great deal of appeal at this stage It is simply that at this point, for the next month and a half, it seems to me that the risks and likely information indicate risks in both directions and that that calls for symmetry "
5341,1995-05-23," As I evaluate the most recent set of economic data, I remain quite optimistic that we will achieve the soft landing projected in the Greenbook, with growth slowing below trend during 1995 and rising back toward trend in 1996, and with inflation remaining contained during the process Historically, of course, soft landings have rarely been achieved, but this time it seems to me that the preconditions are better First, any overshoot of potential output that has occurred thus far is relatively small in contrast to past cycles Second, inflation has remained remarkably well  -26-    5/23/95  contained Third, inflationary expectations have not risen Fourth, we now have clear evidence of a significant slowdown under way, but there is little evidence of any inventory overhang outside the automobile and housing sectors, and I think that limits the possibility of a hard landing  One of the favorable factors affecting the outlook is that, in the words of the Greenbook, ""labor costs remain under remarkable restraint"" Increases in compensation are running significantly below forecasts based on econometric wage equations Benefit cost increases have slowed substantially, and there has been no offset, at least thus far, in the form of higher wages and salaries In recognition of that fact, the Greenbook has revised downward its forecast of hourly compensation growth But with core inflation behaving about as expected, thus far at least, the Greenbook forecast of core inflation has been revised downward by less That strikes me as a reasonable assumption for the short run, but if the compensation surprise persists over the longer run, it is quite likely that we will see compensation restraint showing through to restraint in core inflation, and we will end up with a slightly more favorable inflation trend as well In that sense, I think the forecast contains some downward risks on the inflation side, but it is really too soon to know whether this compensation surprise will turn out to be transitory or permanent If it is permanent, that would imply a decline in the natural rate of unemployment At a minimum, the economy is in effect experiencing a favorable supply shock, which is quite welcome in a period where the economy may have overshot potential output and there is continuing pressure from the prices of intermediate materials and imports  As I evaluate the risks in the forecast with respect to real GDP growth, they seem to me to be roughly balanced at the present time I do have a few concerns on the down side First, I am concerned about the possibility, which Governor Lindsey emphasized, that the personal saving rate may not decline as much from its current first-quarter level of 51 or 52 percent as the Greenbook assumes, and hence that PCE growth may be less strong Over the last two years, personal consumption expenditures have been buoyed by strong spending on durable goods In line with the Greenbook, I think it is quite likely that the growth of spending on durables will slow substantially because a significant portion of the earlier spending probably went to satisfy pent-up demand Now, it seems natural to expect the personal saving rate as measured in the national income and product accounts, which include expenditures on durables, to rise when spending on durables is weak and to fall when spending on durables is strong simply because durable goods provide a flow of services over a long time horizon and are thus a form of savings from the households' perspective In fact, this is the assumption that is embodied in the Board's MPS model Now, the Greenbook assumes that the NIPA personal saving rate will decline, as Governor Lindsey mentioned, to 44 or 45 percent in 1996, and that is a level somewhat above its 41 percent average in 1993 and 1994 when consumption of durables was so strong But it is well below its 5-1/4 percent average for 1991 and 1992 My concern is that that assumption may be too optimistic, and since consumption is such a large fraction of total expenditures, an error here can have significant repercussions for the forecast  -27-    5/23/95  A second downside risk comes from the potential spillover effects of the inventory adjustment currently under way in the automobile sector, which is forecast to depress real GDP growth in the current and subsequent quarters I don't want to quarrel with the Greenbook analysis here; it is just that I always worry that there is a possibility of significant repercussions through the multiplier if households cut consumption in response to a decline in income and through the accelerator process if investment slows down in response to a decline in the growth rate of real GDP, especially at a time when capacity constraints are easing I am simply saying that these spillovers could turn out to be greater than the Greenbook assumes Governor Lindsey has done an excellent job of describing the risks from fiscal policy, and I share his concerns  Of course, there are also risks on the up side As Vice Chairman McDonough noted, these work through interest rates, exchange rates, and the stock market The Greenbook assumes that the bond market rally is overdone and that a portion of the decline in intermediate- and long-term bond yields will be reversed If this assumption proves false, it is conceivable that interest-sensitive sectors will rebound, turning a slowdown into a pause  Mr Chairman, I support your proposal for ""B"" symmetric I think that an unchanged funds rate is warranted given the Greenbook forecast with risks roughly balanced "
5368,1995-07-05," During the last six weeks my optimism has diminished that the inventory adjustment process is going to be behind us after two quarters and that thereafter the economy will return to trend growth with unemployment in the vicinity of the NAIRU The inflation outlook, however, has correspondingly improved Although the most recent employment report was a wake-up call, I think the news since our last meeting has been predominantly negative Governor Blinder's prescient prediction at our last meeting that the Greenbook forecast for the second and third quarters of 1995 would once again be written down by an average of 1/2 percentage point per quarter has proven accurate, although he, too, underestimated the downward revision Even so, I still consider the Greenbook's forecast a bit optimistic because I think the bulk of the risk with respect to real activity is on the down side With even a modest further shortfall in final demand growth, it is easy to elaborate a scenario in which the inventory adjustment process is more protracted than previously foreseen, and the longer-term outlook, once inventory factors have turned to neutral, entails higher unemployment and a larger output gap than the Greenbook envisions We could easily end up I think in an extended growth recession  At our last meeting, I was somewhat sympathetic to the Greenbook's conclusion that the bond market rally might be overdone, and I was a bit concerned about the upside risk that interest- sensitive sectors might rebound too strongly My concern on this score has faded I now see the bond and stock market rallies functioning simply as automatic stabilizers that partially cushion the downside risks I think the impetus of lower long-term interest rates and wealth effects that are working their way through the pipeline will buoy spending on housing and related consumer durables later in 1995 and in 1996 That impetus is needed to avoid a hard landing If longer-term bond yields were to back up, which is an outcome anticipated by the Greenbook under the baseline fed funds assumption, the downside risks would be greater  Let me just briefly enumerate what I see as the major sources of downside risk at this stage They have all been mentioned in the discussion during the go-around The first concerns inventory investment, which I think could easily turn out to be higher this quarter than the Greenbook forecast of $29 billion in real terms This forecast is guesswork since, as Mike noted, a lot of crucial second-quarter data are missing And if inventory investment is higher, more of the adjustment remains ahead than the Greenbook contemplates I mentioned this last time and I just want to reiterate it because it is very important in my own thinking There is always the downside risk that an inventory adjustment could trigger a  -31-    7/5-6/95  snowballing process of cumulative decline through the multiplier- accelerator process with negative feedbacks on consumption as disposable income falls and on investment as business expectations are disappointed in line with what Gary Stern said had happened at firms in some parts of his District As firms see their expectations for growth on which their investment plans are based being disappointed, that could trigger a decline in investment Governor Lindsey voiced concern at our last meeting that credit terms may stop easing or may even tighten during a process of slow growth or conceivably recession if default rates, which are now showing some hints of picking up, were to rise further  Another risk concerns consumption, which has been sluggish this quarter and could easily rebound less strongly toward year-end than the Greenbook assumes, particularly if a backup in long rates puts downward pressure on the stock market The Bluebook's simulations reveal that a higher saving rate poses serious risks to the forecast With a 1/2 percentage point increase in the saving rate, those simulations show unemployment rising to 68 percent by mid-1996  A third risk that many of you mentioned and also concerns me has to do with export growth, which is a needed source of strength as we go forward The depreciation of the dollar has left American goods very well priced in world markets but, like many of you, I am concerned about growth prospects in Canada and Japan and our other trading partners Karen Johnson gave good reasons to believe that growth will rebound later this year in the rest of the world as in the United States, and I certainly hope that comes true But it does seem to me that most of the risk is on the down side and the downside risk here is magnified through multiplier spillovers across countries It comes through one country spending less and other countries seeing their exports fall and their growth prospects disappointed  And then, of course, there is fiscal policy where since our last meeting I think the prospects for a contractionary fiscal package have improved considerably  Now, to offset those sources of weakness, the Greenbook forecast relies on a strong rebound in housing demand and associated spending on furniture and other durables, including motor vehicles But under the baseline fed funds assumption with some backup of long rates, I see a real risk of insufficient revival in these sectors Moreover, as the Bluebook baseline simulation makes apparent, and Mike Prell reiterated this, by 1996 the tighter fiscal scenario alone clearly points to reduction in the natural, equilibrium, or whatever you want to call it, Wicksellian real rate of interest consistent with an economy operating at potential In the Bluebook baseline, the real funds rate must decline to 2-1/2 percent by 1996 and 2 percent by 1997 to keep the economy operating at potential So, I agree with the conclusion of both the Greenbook and the Bluebook that as we go forward the real funds rate will have to decline from its current level  In setting these M2 ranges, do we normally look for some consistency between the target range and the Committee's nominal GDP projections? We just did our nominal GDP projections for 1996 Their full range is 4-1/2 to 6 percent and the central tendency is 4-3/4 to 5-1/2 percent; we were asked to prepare our individual forecasts on the assumption of a desirable monetary policy So, if we take those nominal GDP forecasts and assume that M2 velocity is constant, wouldn't that suggest that 5 percent M2 growth would be consistent with the forecasts we are providing to the public and Congress? And shouldn't 5 percent be the midpoint of the M2 range? If it is not--and it is not even under alternative II for 1996--it seems to me that adopting the alternative II range, and certainly the alternative I range, communicates a lower real growth target than our nominal GDP forecasts imply A growth rate of 5 percent for M2 is probably consistent with, say, 1-1/2 or 2 percent real GDP growth If our M2 target is taken as the middle of our range, a 1 to 5 percent M2 range implies lower target real growth than that Even under alternative II, the midpoint of the M2 range is 4 percent and that could entail perhaps 1 or 1-1/2 percent real GDP growth for 1996  But we were asked to communicate our goals for 1996 and not for 2000  I would like to associate myself with Governor Lindsey's comments I would favor alternative III for 1995 [Laughter] and alternative II for 1996 I certainly understand the sentiments that you expressed, Mr Chairman This is not the most important decision we are going to make this morning I think we are dealing with an imperfect law that asks us to communicate our objectives in an imperfect way I certainly understand why you don't want the ranges to be the focus of your Humphrey-Hawkins testimony, and I understand that they can be confusing Nevertheless, at the end of the day it seems to me that this is the law of the land and we ought to do the best we can to live with it and to have the forecasts that we put forward be ones that are defensible If you are asked why we have selected these monetary targets, I hope you would be prepared to answer Then I ask myself how you would go about answering If you were to say that we are assuming a continuing upward trend in M2 velocity and if that were a defensible assumption, that would be fine That would imply, in turn, real objectives that I would find perfectly appropriate But if you were pushed that far, as I imagine you won't be, and if you were not prepared to say that an upward trend in M2 velocity is our underlying assumption, then you in effect would be communicating on behalf of this Committee objectives which I would not regard as my objectives and I don't think they are the objectives of this Committee After Bob Parry said that our nominal GDP forecasts don't represent our objectives, I reread the instructions They said the projections for both 1995 and 1996 should be based on what in our judgment would be an appropriate monetary policy So, I thought that was the instruction under which we were to be operating  It would be an appropriate monetary policy--  --consistent with our projections for nominal GDP    7/5-6/95  But I think Bob Parry said that the nominal GDP projections, or their central tendency, should not be interpreted as our objectives Did I misread that?  That is where I was coming from I understand why you don't want this to be a central issue of the testimony In the case of 1995 we have language for M3 that says that raising its range is a technical adjustment You don't seem to feel that M3 is going to be the focus of the Humphrey-Hawkins testimony It seems to me that we could adjust up the range for M2 for 1996 and make a very similar statement about a change in our views about the velocity trend for M2 and say the increase is a technical adjustment At any rate, that is where I would come out  Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation to lower the funds rate today As I already emphasized, I am concerned about downside risks and the possibility of destabilizing feedbacks that could weaken the economy more than the Greenbook envisions On the inflation side, I think a funds rate cut is consistent with our longer-term objective of gradually attaining price stability, given the greater slack already in evidence in both product and labor markets Moreover, all our forecasts, with or without a cut in the funds rate of the size we are envisioning here, show a decline in inflationary pressures as we go forward  To me, one of the major rationales for such a cut, as Governor Blinder and others have emphasized, is that we need to cement in place the existing financial conditions that are already working to provide the critical cushion against the downside risks So, I would like to see a cut to prevent a further backup in long-term interest rates, namely, to ratify the expectations implicit in the current structure of longer-term yields I certainly am not arguing that we should be setting monetary policy by following the fed funds futures, but I think we should recognize situations when the market has gotten things right and act accordingly I see the reduction in market interest rates that has occurred since our last meeting as a very natural reaction--Gary Stern mentioned this, too--to a softening economic outlook and as an automatic stabilizer mechanism that cushions the the economy when it is buffeted by spending shocks Our task at this point is to be careful to avoid a pitfall that is well recognized in the literature on monetary policy It is that interest  -70-    7/5-6/95  rate targeting has the potential to thwart the operation of that natural adjustment mechanism, thereby exacerbating economic volatility So, I see a cut in the funds rate now as essentially giving the green light for this market mechanism, which is already working, to continue its work I certainly agree that the rationale is stronger for a cut now As the Chairman emphasized, and the Greenbook and Bluebook acknowledge this, eventually we have to cut the funds rate because the equilibrium real funds rate is tending to fall as we go forward  In my view this is a mid-course correction and it is designed to do a little sooner as an insurance policy what I would envision our having to do anyhow in the not-too-distant future In a sense we put some extra restraint in place last February at a time when it seemed as though the momentum in demand was never going to subside That situation has changed dramatically; it changed pretty quickly after the February meeting Now I think of that as extra braking action that is no longer needed, and I see this as a move to a more neutral stance I remember that Bill McDonough warned us at the February meeting that we needed to be forward-looking and that we would one day have to make a pre-emptive forward-looking move toward ease that would catch the market off guard, but nevertheless we should have the courage to behave in that forward-looking way even though it would be a surprise My only regret at this stage is that we really are not as far ahead of the curve as Vice Chairman McDonough envisioned in his remarks then So a 25 basis point cut in the funds rate is not going to be a surprise to the market In fact, for much of the past month the odds of a 50 basis point cut at either this meeting or the next have been close to one  What should we do today? I guess my inclination would be if I had my druthers to choose a 50 basis point move today because I think it is needed, if not now then in the near future, to move to a more neutral policy stance In a way, it would be psychologically stabilizing for households and firms to be able to rest a bit more secure in the knowledge that the Federal Reserve wants to take actions to keep the economy growing But I also recognize the arguments against such a move today that the Chairman and others among you have articulated on the basis of the possible impact on financial markets So, I can certainly support the proposal for a 25 basis point cut today I would have a strong preference for an asymmetric directive, although I don't mean by that a presumption that there would be an intermeeting move "
5392,1995-08-22," Thank you, Mr Chairman I think the news that has accumulated during the intermeeting period is almost entirely favorable with respect to the outlook, both for real performance and    8/22/95  for inflation over the forecast horizon While I, too, would like to find a reason to disagree with the Greenbook, I find myself in substantial agreement with the Greenbook's assessment of the data Most important to my way of thinking is that we now have mounting evidence that the inventory adjustment under way is proceeding more rapidly and with substantially less disruption of growth in final sales than I had been fearing The continued strength of consumption and investment spending in the face of the inventory adjustment, coupled with strong evidence of a rebound in residential construction, substantially mitigates what I had thought was one of the most serious downside risks At this stage, as David emphasized, substantial risks to the outlook for real growth remain, but I agree that they are much more balanced than they seemed to me in July As David also indicated, it's possible to argue that there remains enough momentum in aggregate demand to potentially rekindle inflationary pressures In that regard, I would simply point out that we have had a significant backup in interest rates since our last meeting, coupled with a significant appreciation of the dollar I think that those two forces are working to restrain this upside risk  At our last meeting, Mr Chairman, you argued that the present level of the real funds rate is above the neutral or equilibrium level that is needed for stable growth with a continuing secular downtrend in the rate of inflation The Bluebook for the July meeting reinforced the conclusion that, particularly with projected fiscal contraction, this neutral real funds rate would be declining gradually over time I certainly agreed with that conclusion then and I continue, as Governor Blinder emphasized, to think that eventually the real funds rate is going to need to decline to keep the economy on track beyond the forecast horizon I agree with Governor Blinder's explanation that if we were to go beyond the six quarters in the Greenbook, we would see initially a mild shortfall in growth below what is needed to keep the economy operating at potential and then the gap would begin to widen It's in that sense that a decline in the real funds rate is eventually going to be needed to keep the economy on track Nevertheless, over the forecast horizon I think that the outlook has definitely improved  On the inflation front, the news has also been quite favorable Recent readings on producer and consumer prices along with the appreciation of the dollar have lessened the concern that the uptick in inflation that we saw in the first half of the year could presage a higher inflation trend And as David Stockton emphasized, the continued moderation in the growth of benefit costs and compensation is a favorable factor in the inflation outlook It may be too soon to break out the champagne, but it seems quite likely to me that we will succeed in capping the inflation rate in this cycle and preserving the gains that have been made on the inflation front in the 1991 recession and the ensuing recovery  I support your proposal, too "
5417,1995-09-26," We don't know the facts  1981  Mr Chairman, my opinion about the national economy has changed very little since our last meeting Although the inventory adjustment may not be entirely behind us, the various sectoral reports on spending seem consistent with continued growth over the next year or so at a pace close to trend I interpret recent inflation reports as confirming that prices remain well contained At this stage I think the biggest single risk to the outlook comes from the fiscal situation Although the odds of a train wreck remain low, a default on the government debt could touch off financial repercussions that would greatly upset Greenbook types of projections But, of course, on that score we will just have to wait and see what happens  The longer-term problem that confronts us at this stage, though, is gauging whether the federal funds rate remains above the level that is needed to achieve trend growth further out in the forecast period, and I mean in late 1996 and 1997 and beyond That seems a long way off, but the Greenbook simulations reveal what we already know, namely, that the lags in monetary policy are sufficiently long that any policy changes that we might undertake over the next months would have their maximum effect in 1997 While it is  -26-    9/26/95  looking into the distant future, I don't think it's entirely premature to be thinking that far ahead What I think the Greenbook projections suggest is that the real funds rate is a little too high to support trend growth with the assumed degree of budget contraction, and it may turn out that the budget contraction will be greater; we will see  In this sense I think we have what Charles Schultz dubbed a ""termites in the basement"" problem, although he was using that phrase to talk about the federal deficits of years ago A ""termites in the basement"" problem is a nagging, chronic little problem that can eventually cause a lot of grief if it is not attended to Termites nibble away slowly so the problem just creeps up and there is no great sense of urgency that one absolutely has to deal with it on one day as opposed to the next That is how I perceive the Greenbook outlook I think there appears to be a problem there It starts as a small problem, but unless it is attended to it will grow into a more significant problem Simulations that we have done with the MPS model reveal that after 1997--I know that is a long way out--the problem really begins to snowball into a crisis The MPS simulation suggests that if the budget is balanced by 2002, the real funds rate would need to decline from roughly its present level of about 2-3/4 percent to about 1-1/4 percent If the funds rate stays where it is, the economy is not likely to remain on an even keel I would also note that the Greenbook and the MPS model are not alone in reaching this conclusion Many outside forecasters are predicting an eventual decline in the funds rate That also seems to be the conclusion of participants in financial markets since longer-term yields apparently embody an assumption of declining short-term rates I think that adjustments in long-term market rates could easily suffice to keep the economy on course, but they are predicated on at least an eventual adjustment in the federal funds rate Again, as the Greenbook suggests, I think the outlook for the near term, next year and even the next two years, looks good I don't view this as a crisis, but I do believe there is a ""termites in the basement"" problem  I support your proposal for ""B"" symmetric, although I do find myself very much in sympathy with President Forrestal's analysis I think he has made a case for moving today, but on balance it seems to me that the timing isn't urgent, and I am quite content to wait  Let me begin by saying that there is a great deal about this bill that I can endorse I think the focus on price stability as the single appropriate long-term goal of the FOMC is correct I endorse the repeal of the Humphrey-Hawkins Act I think those numerical target reporting requirements are unrealistic and counterproductive I like the idea that we should be asked to define price stability and report to Congress on how we intend to achieve it I like the bill's recognition of the fact that the attainment of price stability is not costless in terms of transitional losses in output and employment, and I like the fact that it explicitly directs us to take these losses into account in the transition period So, I think this bill moves us in a good direction  Having said those positive things, I do have two qualms about this bill The first is that it does not positively endorse stabilization policy as an objective Its tone is quite negative and by inference it suggests that if we have just one tool of policy we cannot focus on more than one goal I have said previously that I think that stabilization of economic activity is an important goal in its own right, and I think it will remain so even after price stability is attained I recognize that one could make the argument that the actions that are appropriate to stabilize output and employment are going to coincide with what one needs to do to stabilize the price level, namely, to lean against the wind The problem is that the world is more complex than that, and these two objectives will not always go hand in hand There are apt to be tradeoffs between the variability of output around its trend and the variability of inflation around a level of zero That does not mean that I reject in any way the natural rate hypothesis So, I think our policy ought to be directed to the pursuit of two goals, not one; and as I previously argued, something along the lines of the Taylor rule provides a formal way of thinking about how we could use policy to pursue multiple goals without in any way sacrificing the goal of long- run price stability On the other hand, I do agree with the point that multiple goals have created uncertainty in the minds of the public and Congress about the aims of monetary policy, and I agree  -41-    -42-  with Alan Blinder that we need a systematic way of clarifying what we are doing  The second concern I have is that not only does this bill not positively affirm a stabilization objective, it actually repeals a key portion of the Employment Act of 1946 It goes much further than the repeal of the Humphrey-Hawkins Act It repeals that part of the Employment Act that was a declaration of the responsibility of the government I won't quote the whole thing, but it says in part that the government should ""use all practical means for the purpose of creating and maintaining conditions which promote useful employment opportunities for those able, willing, and seeking to work"" There are two questions The first is whether the Employment Act of 1946 has implications for the Federal Reserve One might say that this Act is just a declaration of government policy and that it has no specific meaning for us whatsoever A little bit of legal research that we did suggests that that is not the case We uncovered a 1971 memo from the Board's General Counsel, Mr Hackley, who wrote, ""The declaration of Congressional policy set forth in Section 2 of the Employment Act unquestionably applies to all agencies of the federal government including the Board, since the Board as well as the Federal Open Market Committee is part of the federal government"" This fact has been expressly recognized by three Federal Reserve Board chairmen-- Chairman McCabe, Chairman Martin, and Chairman Burns What Mr Hackley concluded was that this broad mandate certainly did govern the general policies of the Board, although we did not have the specific obligation to pursue the particular goals set out in the Economic Report to the President So, I think it does have implications for the Board, and even if the Employment Act of 1946 had no implications for the Federal Reserve at all, I would oppose repeal of this feature of the Employment Act because it has implications for the federal government more broadly "
5442,1995-11-15," I will just conclude the roundtable by echoing my agreement with a number of the points that already have surfaced in this discussion Certainly, from my perspective the incoming data flow since our last meeting has contained surprises and the surprises do necessitate some rethinking of the underlying momentum in aggregate demand and also the inflation risk The staff's view is that the news points to significantly greater underlying strength in aggregate demand and a modest reduction in inflation risk I certainly agree with both of those assessments in a qualitative sense, but like Governor Blinder and a number of other members I guess I question whether or not the new forecast does represent something of an overreaction to one month of really rather perplexing economic news In the September Greenbook, the staff forecast an unemployment rate of 62 percent in the fourth quarter of 1997 accompanied by a real federal funds rate of 28 percent The current forecast envisions an unemployment rate of 57 percent in the fourth quarter of 1997, namely 1/2 point lower or as Governor Blinder put it 1-1/4 points higher on real GDP, along with an unchanged federal funds rate of about 28 percent in real terms The staff, I would guess, has concluded that the recent news has not just a transitory effect--it's not just a statistical aberration as Ed Boehne put it--but has permanent significance  A look at a method that I thought was useful for summarizing how much the staff's forecast has changed would be to measure this in terms of the equilibrium real federal funds rate One can infer from the alternative simulations presented in the Greenbook that the equilibrium real federal funds rate, which I am now defining as the real federal funds rate in 1997 that would be consistent with a given fixed unemployment rate, has been revised upward by about 130 basis points since our last meeting In other words, the IS curve has shifted up by about 130 basis points over the last month according to the staff I think the staff procedure for generating the current forecast is easily defended on statistical grounds because surprises in demand do appear to have persistence Nevertheless, I hesitate to accept the conclusion at this point that one month's confusing data should occasion such a large revision in our assessment of the economic outlook, especially when there is a variety of indicators pointing to greater softness in the economy These would include--and all of these have been mentioned--anecdotal reports from industry contacts, yesterday's weak retail sales reading, sluggish auto demand, evidence of rising consumer debt problems that Governors Lindsey and Kelley have emphasized, today's IP number, softness in the purchasing managers' survey, a rising moving average of initial claims for unemployment insurance, and signs of softer growth in European economies All this is coupled with impressive commitments to fiscal consolidation And finally, of course, we have the current train wreck, which could impair household finances and spirits going into the Christmas season Rather than quibble with the details of the staff's point forecast, I would prefer to reserve judgment for a while and await further clarification from incoming data, assuming that the government shutdown doesn't actually end up eliminating the continuing data flow  On the inflation front the news since our last meeting, it seems to me, has been on balance favorable I was particularly impressed by the reading on the core PPI which has remained unchanged and the fact that intermediate goods inflation has registered its  -41-    11/15/95  second monthly negative But most important, as a number of you have emphasized, is that total hourly compensation grew at a mere 23 percent in the third quarter, and I guess it is that continuing restraint in the employment cost index that justifies the downward revision of the NAIRU and the improvement in the inflation forecast I think the revisions in the staff's natural rate assumption and in aggregate demand reflect a response to data surprises that we don't fully understand But in this instance I would emphasize that the reaction is based on a lot more than a single month's data I certainly would agree with Bill McDonough's assessment of the evidence here We now have had about six quarters in which the rate of growth in nonfarm compensation, as measured by the ECI, has been falling in spite of continued low measured levels of labor market slack It does seem from my standpoint, and I assume from the staff's and Bill's as well, that most of the models we monitor have been consistently surprised The surprise has persisted; it is substantial Our models are overforecasting, if I understand the evidence properly, on the order of 7 percent in the annual growth rate per quarter, and cumulatively this certainly is a statistically significant surprise Of course, I also agree that we need to be careful here and not overreact to the information I think the staff has been cautious They have not yet concluded that we are witnessing a permanent structural shift I agree this may end up being a transitory supply shock I do remain perplexed that the moderation in compensation and unit labor costs has not yet translated into a reduction in core inflation I would also agree that price-price Phillips curve predictions, while slightly off the mark, remain essentially on track  At our last meeting I argued that the economy suffers from what I called a ""termites in the basement"" problem It is a bias toward below trend growth the further out one goes in the forecast It stems from insufficient momentum in private spending to compensate for growing fiscal drag and the real federal funds rate remaining at its current level As I try to move away from the data and simply focus on economic fundamentals, I find it difficult to understand what components of demand can be expected to replace lost government spending on a persisting basis over the longer term unless there is continuing impetus from interest and exchange rates I think that financial markets share this view Indeed, the Greenbook acknowledges that the present level of real long-term interest rates is conditioned on both the expectation that there will be deficit reduction and the expectation that short-term rates eventually will fall gradually I think the expectation of a cut in the funds rate in the not too distant future, as Peter Fisher emphasized, is built into the current structure of fed funds futures so that a failure to validate that expectation is most likely to lead to a backup in long rates While the current Greenbook forecast calls the markets' views as well as my own into question and indeed the Greenbook may turn out to be right--I have an open mind on this--from my perspective the level of uncertainty has increased I would like to wait and see what the Christmas season and the budget negotiations hold in store, but I consider the preponderance of risks at this point to be on the down side of the Greenbook scenario  For the late 1960s and early 1970s I think that's right  I would associate myself with the analysis presented by Presidents Forrestal and McDonough and Governor Blinder, although, Mr Chairman, at the end of the day I support your policy suggestion for ""no change"" at today's meeting I continue to think, for reasons I have given before, that the real funds rate remains on the high side, especially from the longer-term perspective of supporting growth toward the end of the forecast period I certainly would admit that the staff analysis this time around has created some doubts in my mind and I would value having additional information to resolve some of those doubts At the end of the day, therefore, I can certainly support your suggestion of ""B"" On the symmetry issue, because I see the risk as being on the down side from that longer-term perspective, I would prefer an asymmetric directive although I do not think that we will need to move during the intermeeting period in the absence of a significant shock So, symmetry could certainly be an acceptable outcome I am worried about becoming frozen by the budget negotiations and also appearing at the end of the day to be ratifying some Congressional actions I think that concern does tend to support Governor Lindsey's suggestion of a move today However, in the end there are enough uncertainties in my mind about the forecast that on those grounds I would not favor a move today "
5466,1995-12-19," Thank you, Mr Chairman Although we have obtained a significant slug of new data on the economy since our last meeting, my view concerning the outlook has changed very little I continue to think that the inflation outlook is favorable, that growth is likely to proceed at a moderate pace over the next year, and that under current monetary policy, there will be a bias toward below-trend growth over the longer term With respect to inflation, I have been particularly impressed by the decline in inflationary expectations, which Bob Parry mentioned Both long- and short-term inflationary expectations have fallen about 1/2 percentage point since the second quarter of 1995 Direct measures of inflationary expectations  -23-    12/19/95  suggest, I think, a dwindling fear of an inflation breakout on the part of both households and forecasters, and that is a change in perception that is well warranted We should remember that such expectations do have at least some direct impact on workers' demands for wage increases and the willingness of firms to grant them at any given level of labor market slack So, reduced inflationary expectations make a direct contribution to an improved inflation outlook As Bob also mentioned, the decline in inflationary expectations means that real interest rates, both long- and short- term, have not declined as much as nominal interest rates Now, I have no quarrel with the short-term outlook in the Greenbook, although I do think the jury remains out on whether or not inventory adjustment is going to proceed along the very benign path that is projected in the Greenbook But really my most important concern has to do with the longer-term outlook, not for 1996 but into 1997 and beyond I think that should be the focus of our deliberations since that is when the monetary policy changes we undertake now will really take hold, given the long lags in policy My reasoning here is similar to that offered by Larry Meyer in his latest forecast According to his characterization, the outlook is for what he calls a soft landing with bias After a period of near-trend growth in 1996, he foresees a bias toward below-trend growth thereafter with rising unemployment, assuming that the real federal funds rate is kept at its current level Similarly, our own MPS model contains such a bias toward below-trend growth under the Greenbook fed funds assumption, although it does project an even stronger 1996 than the Greenbook due to the lagged but temporary influence of wealth effects from the stock market  I thought I might enumerate some of my reasons for expecting this bias toward below-trend growth, and I will just quickly mention seven factors that are operative in my view The first is that lower long-term rates have been boosting residential construction with a lag, and I would expect, as does the Greenbook, that that effect ultimately will peter out Second, we are finally seeing a cessation of the at least year-long trend toward easier credit terms, and that means that one source of stimulus that has been working as an offset to monetary policy over the last year will stop imparting further impetus to aggregate demand Now, we can dispute whether and how much stock prices matter to consumption, but if higher stock prices are contributing and will continue to contribute in 1996 to strong consumption growth, eventually this influence is going to subside I think it will be gone by the end of 1996 even assuming there is no major market correction Fourth, pent-up demand for consumer durables is presumably spent, and it seems to me that rising delinquencies on consumer debt coupled with higher debt service ratios suggest at a minimum less robust consumption growth going forward Fifth, the growth in business fixed investment seems likely to wane through accelerator effects Sixth, the lagged effects of the depreciation of the dollar, which should stimulate exports in 1996, will be petering out in 1997 and thereafter under the Greenbook assumption of a stable dollar Finally, seventh, I would mention that fiscal drag will, of course, be at work throughout and beyond the forecast horizon  So, it becomes hard for me to see exactly what is going to keep the economy growing at trend over the longer haul In addition, if consumption spending, in contrast to the Greenbook assumption, is currently being buoyed by the strong performance of the stock market,  -24-    12/19/95  then any significant stock market correction imparts some downside risk to the forecast There is consistent empirical evidence in favor of the MPS model assumption of a marginal propensity to consume of 4 or 5 percent out of added wealth If we take that seriously-- obviously we can dispute that--it makes quite a difference In particular, a 10 percent correction of the stock market would add a half percentage point to the unemployment rate after 6 to 8 quarters So, clearly, the view that policy is restrictive at this stage involves a difficult and tricky judgment call I think type I and type II errors are both possible The Greenbook does offer a very coherent defense of the opposing view, and I think Mike defended that view vigorously Fortunately for us, monetary policy is a flexible instrument; it can be adjusted in either direction so that any mistakes we might make are reversible  Mr Chairman, I support your proposal I think we have good reasons to feel pleased with the performance of the economy over the last 18 months Our job now, as I perceive it, is simply to enable these favorable trends to continue For the reasons that I have already enumerated, I think the current level of the real funds rate is on the high side It is arguably higher now than it was last February--as you mentioned, Mr Chairman--given the decline in inflationary expectations I think this poses a danger to the outlook, not in the short run, not over 1996, but over the longer term even though I recognize that that is a difficult call about which reasonable people can disagree Nevertheless, having made that call I think that monetary policy should be forward-looking when we are lowering interest rates just as we are when raising them On the fiscal policy linkage issue, it seems to me that acting today rather than waiting for a budget deal to be completed will enable us to mitigate at least to some extent the unfortunate public perception of a Fed that plays budget politics by holding out rewards and punishments related to progress on the negotiations Although having said that, I certainly agree with what Governor Lindsey said Fiscal policy matters to the economy and, of course, we cannot ignore fiscal policy linkages in deciding on our own policies "
5490,1996-01-30," As I outlined my thoughts on the national economy in preparation for today's meeting, I realized that I am running the risk of sounding like a broken record by reiterating themes that are completely familiar, given the remarks I have been making during the last several meetings With respect to inflation, I have not seen any reason to alter my view that it is unlikely to move higher in spite of the fact that the economy is operating with a measured unemployment rate that is a tad below the staff's and most economists' point estimates of the natural rate In that regard, I think it is important to remember that even if we fully accept the natural rate hypothesis, the natural rate is a parameter that not only  -27-    1/30-31/96  changes over time but also is very imprecisely estimated A recent paper that some of you are familiar with applies every conceivable econometric bell and whistle to compute a confidence interval for the natural rate of unemployment It is hard to get it down below 2 percentage points for a 95 percent confidence interval That is disconcertingly wide, and I interpret that as a good measure of our ignorance on this So, I think it also is worthwhile to look at other measures of inflation pressures--capacity utilization, vendor performance, order backlogs, strike activity, and so forth Looking at those measures, I see no intensification of underlying inflationary forces at this point As President Broaddus mentioned, hourly earnings have edged a little higher, and that is something we will have to watch But in my view, total compensation is what matters, and the ECI does not show upward movement, although it certainly would be nice to have a recent reading In addition, I see commodity prices and intermediate materials prices as well behaved, and the dollar has appreciated  With respect to the pace of economic activity, the new chain- weighted GDP figures reveal an economy that grew over the first three quarters of 1995 at a pace a bit shy of the likely growth of potential output, which staff now estimates at 19 percent With the government shutdown and the blizzard, interpretations of the statistics for the fourth quarter of 1995 and the current quarter are obviously quite confusing, but my sense on balance is that growth has weakened a bit and I am becoming--to use the same word that Ed Boehne used--a bit more jittery and marginally more pessimistic about the short-term outlook Today's report on retail sales coupled with a plunge in the Conference Board's measure of consumer confidence--to which we should not overreact--reinforces my view that there is some downside risk The level of inventory investment remains above the normal level that would be associated with an economy growing at potential So, I agree with the Greenbook assessment that declining inventory investment is going to remain a drag on economic activity for a time, and the planned reductions in motor vehicle assemblies that several of you mentioned may indeed have ripple effects throughout the economy As Mike Prell noted in the Chart Show, the moving average of unemployment claims has edged upward Unemployment expectations in the Michigan survey, which are significantly related to growth of consumption spending, do appear to be on an uptrend even if one abstracts from a very significant recent run-up in December One of the facts that always astounds me about the American economy is how a large number of jobs are permanently destroyed in any year, good and bad Recent estimates place this loss at about 10 percent of all American jobs in any given year, even in good years Since it is very clear that we are always getting substantial restructuring both within and across industries, we should not be surprised when we hear announcements of layoffs, even significant ones But having said that, I also sense that the very large and very visible job losses like those that were recently announced by AT&T do attract widespread attention and reinforce what I perceive to be an ongoing sense of apprehension in the workforce about employment prospects, with implications for wages and also potentially for consumer spending  Ted Truman emphasized that the behavior of the dollar matters to the forecast The dollar has appreciated about 3 percent on a trade-weighted basis since our last meeting If we aggregate movements in the dollar together with changes in short-term interest  -28-    1/30-31/96  rates into a single index, which is sometimes called the monetary conditions index--if I have done this properly and used a reasonable weight on exchange rate changes of about 1/6 or 1/7--my calculation would be that this appreciation since our last meeting is equivalent to an increase of about 40 basis points in the federal funds rate The Greenbook certainly recognizes that the appreciation of the dollar will produce a drag on net exports down the road I also would underscore another point that the Greenbook makes, which is that the market value of the dollar right now is conditioned on an expectation of further Fed easing If this expectation is frustrated, there may well be further dollar appreciation  With respect to the intermediate-run forecast through 1997, I emphasized previously my view that the American economic house is fundamentally sound but that there is this little problem of ""termites in the basement"" or a bias toward below-trend growth, and I have not altered my view on that one iota I am not going to take the time to reiterate all the reasons I gave last time, but a prominent factor in my own thinking is the behavior of longer-term interest rates These rates have fallen and are imparting impetus to the economy I think that impetus will continue for a time, but it is going to ebb eventually and we will be left with a risk of subpar growth over the medium term I certainly am not envisioning an economy that is heading for an imminent recession, but I think a growth recession with gradually rising unemployment is a distinct risk if we keep the funds rate where it is now That is roughly the same level in real terms that we reached last February when most of us considered monetary conditions to be quite appropriately somewhat restrictive  A number of you around the table have emphasized that we need to have a strategy in mind for reducing inflation I certainly agree with that and in that regard I would endorse the opportunistic strategy that Don described in his sermon last time I see an opportunistic strategy as one that would not consciously use monetary policy to push the economy below potential in order to achieve a reduction in inflation, unless inflation initially were significantly far from its optimal value I don't think the current inflation rate represents price stability I believe the current inflation rate is too high, but it is not vastly too high I would see an opportunistic strategy as one that would look for gains on the inflation front during periods when negative shocks unavoidably create slack in the economy Because I hold that view, I regard as quite acceptable for now what I think is currently the most reasonable forecast, namely one where output is expected to continue to grow at a trend rate close to the economy's potential and with no prediction that inflation will decline significantly over the forecast period  I am afraid I am the odd one out here I don't think the monetary aggregates should, or do, play an important role in policy I certainly don't think the Humphrey-Hawkins testimony should focus on the aggregates I believe we should continue, as we did last July, to downplay the relevance of these ranges to policy If we are concerned about sending the message that we have a commitment to price stability, we ought to do so in words and, perhaps better than that, we ought to explain in words how we intend to achieve that objective As I indicated last July when I dissented on this matter, it is important to engage in honest communication with Congress To me the honest choices are target ranges that are centered on the staff's best guess of where these aggregates will come out given our preferred monetary policy course, which should be related to the economic forecast that we will be presenting in the Humphrey-Hawkins testimony In my view, the existence of uncertainty does not change this Yes, velocity is very uncertain, but at a minimum we ought to have ranges that encompass the staff's best guess about what monetary growth we are going to end up with under the preferred policy strategy I don't want to push the centering issue too hard My preferred strategy here would be Alternative III, but especially in light of David's argument about opportunistic strategies that I endorse, Alternative II would be acceptable to me Alternative I, which does not even encompass the staff's point forecast for M2, does not strike me as honest communication Again, I would say that it's easy to rationalize a change as a technical adjustment We did this--for M3--in July and it did not appear to create any reaction whatsoever  As I have said previously, I am quite sympa- thetic to the communications goals embodied in the Mack proposal For the same reasons, I am attracted to many of the arguments that President Broaddus has presented, although I certainly agree with Gary Stern on the issue of credibility I think we could proceed to communicate more even without legislation Whatever happens to the Mack Bill, I think it is desirable to work toward that end In that sense, I agree with Al  -44-    1/30-31/96  The problem from my standpoint is that before we communicate, we really need more extensive debate and study of exactly what we want to communicate I do not know precisely what members of this Committee mean when they use the words ""price stability"" I don't know if they mean literally 0 or 1 percent inflation or a range of 1 to 2 percent Also, I don't know if we are talking about targeting the price level so that we would expect the level of prices to be the same 100 years from now as it is today That is a very different thing from targeting zero inflation and then forgiving mistakes It is very clear that the costs of elevated inflation are high, and, in that case, we need to move inflation down to lower rates, and that a consensus exists to do it But as we get to lower rates of inflation, we need to think much more carefully about the costs and benefits of moving to still lower rates There are benefits, but during my time on the Committee, we never really have talked about what the benefits are or attempted to evaluate them concretely I believe there also are costs of moving to very low inflation rates I am persuaded that there is at least a significant one-time output loss There also may be a further permanent loss that occurs because a little inflation, particularly in an economy with slow productivity growth, greases the wheels and makes relative wage adjustments easier and may facilitate intersectoral allocations of labor This is a subtle point, but I think we never have evaluated or tried to measure it  So, I think we are not quite ready to proceed without a further discussion Also, we need to think through what type of strategy is appropriate to reach the target Al and I have previously debated this Inflexible inflation targets don't strike me as a good strategy I think there is a flexible approach that would take account of trade-offs between active stabilization and inflation objectives, but we have never really worked this through as fully as we ought to So, I believe in communication, but I have some qualms We need further study At the end of the day, though, I thoroughly endorse Al's concrete suggestion that we should, at a minimum, be communicating a strong commitment to holding the line on inflation at 3 percent to keep it from rising higher To me, an opportunistic strategy would do precisely that It would lean quite hard against any increase in inflation and it would look for opportunities to bring it down  On the question of the greasing-the-wheels argument, I have read the staff paper It is a very good paper, but I think there are methodological questions that remain open and different ways of approaching it I understand the empirical findings that you have, and I would not regard them as definitive This is probably not the right place to get into methodological issues, but if you want just a bit more on this question, I would point to an entirely different type of study that doesn't use longitudinal data sets Truman Bewley from Yale has spent several years interviewing managers and human resources people at several hundred firms in the New England area to try to understand their wage-setting policies He is in the process of writing a book summarizing what he found He gave a seminar here not long ago, and I think it would be fair to say that the bottom line conclusion is that wage rigidity stems from the fact that firms find it extraordinarily difficult to cut wages This is the unanimous finding of his several years of interviews That is what people say It's not that wage cuts never occur, but it is a very serious constraint on what firms feel themselves capable of doing That is a different kind of evidence on this issue, but it is an empirical question as you have indicated  Mr Chairman, I support your proposal and I agree with your assessment of the risks As I have argued, I do think some further adjustment is needed to achieve that elusive neutral monetary policy From my perspective, in spite of the fact that we did make downward adjustments in the funds rate in July and December, all we have done thus far is to offset the decline in inflationary expectations That leaves the real rate at about its February 1995 level, which was a real funds rate that I think most of us considered to be consistent with braking the economy History has borne out the fact that we did brake the economy I agree with the assessment that our foot remains slightly on the brake and we ought to remove it How much our foot is on the brake is an extremely tricky call from my standpoint The alternative simulations presented in the Greenbook certainly caution us that we would be running a very significant inflation risk if we were to adopt the easier alternative and cut the funds rate by a cumulative 100 basis points I absolutely concur with that conclusion Such a cut would incur a tremendous risk I would not envision anything of that sort But is a 25 basis point cut reasonable? It is tremendously hard to gauge whether or not it is reasonable One thing that I found myself doing to try to get a sense of whether or not this is a move within a reasonable range is to look at that Taylor rule chart in the ""Financial Indicators"" package What that shows is that, using Taylor's rule as he proposed it, we are currently at the high end of a reasonable range of values Looking at our behavior now in terms of our own past behavior, we are well within the ballpark of our past behavior From that perspective, current policy is not overwhelmingly tight, but certainly a further downward  -60-    1/30-31/96  adjustment of 25 basis points would still leave us well within the range of our past behavior It would not be a major move inconsistent with what we have done before Again, that would not represent an opportunistic approach, but one designed to bring inflation down So, I certainly support this move "
5512,1996-03-26," Thank you, Mr Chairman The progress of the economy over the last several months has been reminiscent of ""the perils of Pauline,"" with blizzards, government shutdowns, threats of default on the national debt, strikes, and a frightening albeit brief dive in the stock market threatening the progress of our heroine Nevertheless, the single most probable outcome at this stage is that this economy will survive its treacherous adventure and ultimately attain trend growth with stable inflation I agree with the Greenbook assessment that the stage appears to be set for a rather sharp rebound in economic growth from the average pace in the fourth and first quarters Considerable progress appears to have been made in reducing inventory overhangs, so there is a reasonable prospect that inventories will become a neutral factor in the economy in the not too distant future Meanwhile, demand has held up surprisingly well in the face of a rather large inventory adjustment in the fourth quarter  Over the longer term, a projection of near-trend growth through 1997 with roughly stable inflation strikes me as a plausible scenario, although there are some risks On the negative side, I am particularly concerned at this stage about the possibility of a significant stock market correction The current level of stock prices is not impossible, but it is increasingly difficult to justify in terms of fundamentals Disappointing earnings reports could easily set off a correction I am also concerned about the likely negative, albeit lagged, impact on housing and consumer durable spending of the very substantial increases in interest rates since our last meeting I find the longer-term Greenbook projection of housing starts particularly optimistic in light of these increases On balance, with intermediate- and long-term interest rates at their current levels, I feel less certain than the staff that trend growth is possible as we go out in the forecast period But there are also some risks on the inflation front While recent readings on average hourly earnings provide reassurance that wages are not accelerating, the jump in health insurance costs evident in the fourth-quarter employment cost index creates the worrisome prospect that these benefit cost increases may be poised to rise further I don't think we should overinterpret one single report, but I do agree with the Greenbook's assessment that this is one of the risks going forward  Mr Chairman, I agree with your proposal and I also agree with your assessment of the key risks  -27-    3/26/96 "
5535,1996-05-21," I would like to comment on two issues central to the national economic outlook first, the possibility that aggregate demand growth will exceed trend over the forecast period, pushing the economy well beyond potential; and, second, the prospect that core inflation will begin to drift upward even if the economy continues to operate with current margins of slack On the first issue, the Greenbook portrays an economy poised for growth near trend by the second half of 1996 In my assessment of the outlook, the risk of sustained demand growth exceeding the growth of potential is not absent Frankly, I was surprised by the strength of both consumption and investment spending in the first quarter Nevertheless, I still consider the Greenbook projection of moderate near-trend growth over the forecast horizon to be sensible and most probable With the inventory adjustment process seemingly nearing completion, at least by the end of this quarter, I find it hard to identify any fundamental factor or imbalance--other than the dangerously lofty level of stock prices--that I consider likely to spur either unsustainably rapid growth or alternatively to pose a significant risk of recession The stock market factor, it seems to me, could cut either way; it poses both kinds of risk Why do I feel that way? For the same reasons the Greenbook emphasized Pent-up demand for consumer durables seems to be spent If we can continue to rely on what is one of the most trustworthy relations in macroeconomics, namely the accelerator, it seems probable to me that the growth of investment spending will slow The combination of moderate growth in our key trading partners, coupled with a dollar that has appreciated about 4 percent just this year--the dollar's movement is working as a stabilizer, as Ted Truman emphasized--should contain impetus originating in the external sector  In addition to the appreciation of the dollar, of course, the most potent force countering any spending shock that may have occurred is the large swing in financial conditions Now, it is arguable that some portion of the roughly 80 basis point increase in long-term interest rates since late January reflects higher inflationary expectations But my own reading of survey measures of inflation expectations suggests that most of the movement represents an increase in real rates I think such an increase is perfectly consistent with the perception that demand is stronger than previously thought, that the shock to demand is not transitory, and that the Fed indeed will need to pursue tighter policies than had been anticipated earlier to keep inflation in check It seems to me that given the usual lags, this interest rate swing should begin to exercise a restraining influence by the second half of the year A rule of thumb I sometimes use is that a one basis point increase in the long rate cuts $06 billion off aggregate demand, which means that, say, a 70 basis point increase in real rates would chop $42 billion or 06 percent off GDP This is sufficient to counter a rather sizable and permanent upward IS shock So, I see the interest rate fluctuations that have occurred as serving as an important stabilizer Under present conditions, it seems to me that the rebound in long-term rates is an appropriate antidote to increased upside risk However--and here I certainly  -22-    5/21/96  agree with the comment that the Chairman interjected in response to Al Broaddus's statement--it seems to me that the 6 percent long bond yield that we had in January was premised on the assumption that we would have several further cuts in the fed funds rate I also would agree that the present level of roughly 7 percent in the long bond rate appears to be consistent with a funds rate that is expected to remain about where it is or, with some probability, to increase slightly during the remainder of the year  I also want to spend a minute, if I may, commenting on the outlook for core inflation because I think the Greenbook inflation forecast is a little too pessimistic Clearly, we have an economy operating at a level where we need to be nervous about rising inflation, even abstracting from supply side shocks We can't dismiss the possibility that compensation growth will drift upward, raising core inflation and in turn inflationary expectations This is a major risk Obviously, we need to be vigilant in scrutinizing the data for signs of rising wages and salaries We should be concerned if a pattern of faster wage and salary growth materializes, if that translates into faster compensation growth, and if in turn the faster compensation growth translates into more rapid core inflation But the sentence I just uttered contained three ""ifs""  First, we need to see a pattern of faster wage and salary growth As a number of you pointed out, we have seen one disturbingly large reading on wages and salaries in the most recent employment cost index survey But the upward movement there was mysteriously rapid for sales workers and one reading does not a trend make The second ""if"" in my sentence concerned whether an increase in wage and salary growth will translate into faster compensation growth, and that is a big ""if"" At this point, the 12-month change in total compensation growth in the ECI has remained virtually unchanged at around 3 percent for five quarters I would just remind you that standard economic theory suggests that both firms and workers going to the bargaining table ought to be concerned with and ought to be bargaining over total compensation, not wages and salaries alone Assuming that both firms and workers recognize the tradeoff they face between benefits and take-home pay, slower benefits growth should be reflected in faster wage and salary growth So, on its own, faster wage and salary growth is not cause for alarm Now, I do not want to push this hypothesis too far because, although this is a reasonable possibility, it certainly is not the only possibility I am simply urging caution and am warning against automatically assuming that the growth in these two components of compensation is unconnected and that they lead their own lives  My final ""if"" concerned the relationship between faster compensation growth and product price inflation and whether we should automatically assume that the translation there will be one-for-one The counter argument is that for the last several years product price increases have outstripped increases in unit labor costs and that has resulted in widening markups, unusually strong earnings growth, and a rise in the profit share In that sense, core inflation is on the high side now, given compensation growth and productivity trends The staff documented this situation and highlighted its implications in the January Chart Show Widening profit margins are a development that should not be expected to continue indefinitely Eventually, those margins are bound to stabilize or even to decline a bit That  -23-    5/21/96  could occur in a number of ways with a decline in the inflation rate coupled with stable compensation growth or with an increase in the pace of compensation growth and stable inflation I think the first possibility implies some downside risk to the inflation outlook, and I do not see that in the Greenbook forecast The second possibility is that compensation growth is indeed poised to rise somewhat, bringing a halt to the continuing widening of profit margins That could occur without any translation into higher core inflation These are a bunch of ""ifs"" They are all imponderables and they are open questions that will only be answered with the benefit of hindsight  Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation for ""B,"" symmetric My preferred policy as this stage is cautious inaction I guess that's called ""watchful waiting"" As I indicated in my earlier comments, the current level of long-bond rates and the stronger dollar seem sufficient to me at this stage to contain the evident upside risk to spending This level of long rates does seem consistent in my view with the maintenance of the funds rate at its present level, at least for the time being The market certainly perceives some chance that the funds rate will need to rise this summer and next fall, and so do I because I think the risks have shifted But the market is not demanding or even expecting such a move today Market participants would be surprised, and I think it could provoke an excessive adjustment in long-term yields  -36-    5/21/96  I certainly understand the reasons for wanting to move in advance of an increase in inflation I agree with that reasoning, and I definitely do not object to the reasoning that is incorporated in the Greenbook about the inflationary process But I share some of the doubts that the Chairman has expressed so well, and also Presidents Boehne and Stern We do not understand fully what is going on in the labor market as evidenced by the errors in our earlier inflation forecasts, and I would like to wait and get a little more information If the current Greenbook forecast is accurate, we will soon see clear evidence of an increase in compensation growth and an uptick in core inflation When we see that, I think we definitely will need to respond The staff's financial indicators package now routinely depicts the recommendations of Taylor's rule This is a rule of thumb that I regularly consult as a very rough guide to reasonable policy I don't mean to say that I think one should follow this rule religiously, but according to that rule--and a number of you have made this point--policy is roughly appropriately positioned at this time It seems appropriate given current inflation and resource utilization But the chart also indicates that it will be appropriate to tighten if the Greenbook forecast materializes, and I accept that conclusion  With respect to the symmetry issue, I prefer symmetry for the reasons that have been explained by Vice Chairman McDonough and President Boehne  I agree with Governor Lindsey I think this is a discussion that we definitely need to have to clarify what we mean by price stability and what strategy we have in mind to get there I am also concerned, especially given my interest in an opportunistic strategy, that it would be awfully hard to fill in the boxes relating to what I would expect in 1998 If we extended the horizon out a little longer to, say, the year 2000, I would find it easier to fill in the boxes and participate in our discussion "
5561,1996-07-02," Thank you, Mr Chairman I will try to be brief because, like President Broaddus, I would like to take a little extra time in our next go-around concerning price objectives for monetary policy  The key questions today are identical to those at our last meeting Will aggregate demand really moderate in the second half of the year, and are we about to see an uptick in core inflation due to increasing wage pressures in already tight labor markets and the feedback of higher food prices into wage demands? With respect to the slowdown in aggregate demand, I confess both ignorance and concern I agree with the Greenbook that aggregate demand will probably slow toward trend, for all of the reasons that are by now familiar, and will probably do so with the usual long and variable lags Higher interest rates and a somewhat stronger dollar will eventually take some toll on housing, associated consumer durables, and net exports The influence on growth of inherently transitory factors like the rebuilding of auto inventories will soon wane, and the data already point to a slowing pace of noncomputer investment spending, consistent with predictions of the accelerator But I admit there is only scanty evidence that housing markets are poised to cool Computer investment may turn out stronger than the Greenbook anticipates I also agree with the Greenbook that with leaner inventories, a surge in inventory investment is possible and poses upside risks If final demand growth proves significantly stronger than was anticipated, inventory investment could again increase, touching off a new round in the inventory cycle The risks here seem weighted toward the up side  With respect to inflation, though, as a number of you have emphasized, the news has been favorable Core inflation in the CPI and PPI remains well contained and, as the Roberts memo and the Chairman highlighted, consumer inflation as measured by the chain- weighted PCE is running just over 2 percent I would emphasize that our most recent readings on long-term inflationary expectations also are quite positive, suggesting the absence of any deterioration there Food prices do seem poised to rise, with pass-through to wages and core inflation a possibility But eventually, even if it is beyond our forecast horizon, it seems to me that these weather-related price hikes will unwind, bringing core inflation back down, too In my opinion, temporary supply shocks should be essentially irrelevant to monetary policy  At the same time, labor markets do seem tight, although they are no tighter now than they have been for most of the last two years Several of us commented at our last meeting, and a number of you focused on this today, that there are several aspects of labor market behavior that are puzzling Increases in compensation are running significantly below what our models would predict Core inflation still exceeds the pace consistent with the apparent trend in unit labor costs, and profit margins have widened In my estimation, the entire pattern of surprises that we are seeing is exactly consistent with what one would expect to see as a result of a structural change that has a negative impact on the bargaining power of workers Such a shift might result from an increased sense of job insecurity related to technological change or corporate restructuring as the Chairman has emphasized It could be due to factors raising workers' perceptions  -37-    7/2-3/96  of the likely cost of job loss It could be due to improvements in the ability of firms to outsource either domestically or internationally because this poses a threat to the bargaining power of workers It could be due to an increased prevalence of more flexible pay-for-performance arrangements  We often remind ourselves that the natural rate is not a time-invariant constant But it is structural shifts like the ones I have mentioned that in modern theories of the labor market would shift the natural rate of unemployment and result in a persistent, not just a very transitory, decline in the natural rate The unfortunate thing is that the hypothesis that the natural rate has declined for these or for other reasons remains just that It is a hypothesis, and it can only be confirmed with an accumulation of data and the passage of time The staff, I believe, is properly skeptical We may be living on borrowed time, and there may end up being a price to pay for having allowed the economy, to use Governor Lindsey's phrase, ""to push the envelope"" In my estimation, though, with each passing quarter--and I now count seven--in which unemployment remains near 5-1/2 percent and core inflation declines or remains stable, the Committee's degree of confidence that the natural rate has fallen should rise a little Mine certainly has  I will apologize in advance, since my comments are a little on the long side I would like to begin by summarizing my views and then run through a mini cost-benefit analysis of the welfare consequences of a permanent reduction in inflation To preview my conclusions, I think we should move to lower inflation but gingerly, because we really do not know how large the permanent costs might be in the form of higher unemployment, and we should find out by testing the waters, studying the results, and rethinking further initiatives if the costs turn out to be too large  The experience of our northern neighbor should serve as a warning to us to move slowly The Canadian economy usually tracks the US economy fairly closely Recently, though, Canada has pursued and achieved very low inflation targets, but its real economic performance relative to the US economy has been very poor The divergence between the two economies in the 1980s was likely due to differences in the US and Canadian treatment of unemployment insurance, but the declines in the employment ratio since 1990 are most likely due to restrictive monetary policy targets that have achieved the lower end of the Canadian target range of 1 to 3 percent inflation Since mid- 1992, the Canadian unemployment rate has averaged 105 percent, 3 percentage points above the estimated Canadian NAIRU, while core inflation has remained virtually stable instead of decelerating the 6 percentage points--to negative 45 percent by mid-1996--that would have been predicted by the usual Canadian Phillips curve relationship That suggests a long-run Phillips curve that is quite flat in the neighborhood of zero inflation  To perform the relevant cost-benefit calculation of lower inflation in the United States, we need to measure both the transitory costs involved in moving from where we are to our ultimate inflation target and then any permanent costs and benefits associated with different steady-state inflation rates I would like to start with the easy part, the short-run costs because here I think the literature is clear and we can narrow down the range The sacrifice ratio in our new FRB-US model without credibility effects is 25, resulting in an output cost of about 5 percent of GDP per point of inflation In principle, credibility effects could lower the sacrifice ratio, but both international cross-section evidence and time series evidence for various countries provide no support for a credibility effect, and I agree with David Stockton's conclusion that ""empirical evidence of credibility effects of announced inflation targets is difficult to find""  So much for the range of short-run costs Now, to make it worthwhile to bear an output cost in Dave Stockton's range of 3 to 6 percent of GDP per point of inflation reduction, the permanent net benefits would have to be substantial, although any benefits that are dependent on GDP will grow over time If we think of the short-run costs as a risky investment, we would need to earn a pretax return on a par with alternative uses of funds If we assume a 6 percent required rate of return and 2 percent growth in real GDP, we would require an expected permanent net benefit somewhere in the range of a bit over 1 to 25 percent of GDP--  Right If you like, you can vary the assumptions  I'm sorry; I am thinking of real rates So one would need a little over 1/10 percent to about 1/4 percent of GDP as a net gain per point of inflation reduction to justify that type of investment The question is, from whence might such benefits accrue? In the interest of time, I want to focus on only the things I consider maj or  The only identifiable benefit of low inflation that I think could be big enough to create the needed payoff is connected with the tax system and its interaction with inflation The most important recent study is that of Martin Feldstein, and it shows that the benefits in question are positive and large, contrary to most people's intuition Feldstein calculates that the benefits due to lower tax distortions from a 2 percentage point reduction in inflation under his baseline assumptions amount to 1 percent of GDP The lion's share of that gain, 92 percentage point, accrues from reducing the deadweight loss associated with distortions in the timing of consumption over the typical saver's lifetime But Feldstein's calculation relies not only on the assumption of a moderate positive interest elasticity of savings demand but also on the, to me dubious, assumptions that first, most saving is for retirement and second, that there are no tax- sheltered retirement savings vehicles Feldstein's calculations omit the many ways under existing tax codes that savers can and do shelter income on retirement savings, including pension plans, tax-deferred savings plans, and annuities This suggests to me that Feldstein's number could be off by an order of magnitude I would add that despite the technical difficulties in rewriting the tax code, these gains could be achieved at far lower cost simply through legislation  Now, I think there are likely to be significant, permanent costs of very low inflation, and David Stockton pinpointed them accurately First, a little inflation permits real interest rates to become negative on the rare occasions when required to counter a recession This could be important, and I think the current situation in Japan provides a textbook example of the difficulties in stimulating an economy that is experiencing deflation Even with nominal short-term rates at 5 percent, real short-term rates cannot fall into the needed negative territory  Second, and to my mind the most important argument for some low inflation rate, is the ""greasing-the-wheels argument"" on the grounds that a little inflation lowers unemployment by facilitating adjustments in relative pay in a world where individuals deeply dislike nominal pay cuts With some permanent aversion to nominal pay cuts, the output and unemployment costs of lowering inflation that we ordinarily think of as transitory simply never disappear because the long-run Phillips curve becomes negatively sloping as inflation approaches zero This is arguably the recent Canadian experience A recent paper by George Akerlof, Bill Dickens, and George Perry, forth- coming in Brookings Papers, shows through simulation experiments the frequency with which nominal wage cuts would be required to avoid permanently higher aggregate unemployment as American inflation falls toward measured zero under realistic assumptions about the variability  -43-    7/2-3/96  and serial correlation of demand shocks across firms The authors assume that firms experiencing losses can and do cut wages after two years, which is in accord with existing evidence by Blinder and Choi, Bewley and others, and that workers will accept nominal wage cuts when they perceive it as needed and fair Even so, these authors find that the needed frequency of nominal cuts rises rapidly as inflation declines Here are some numbers On top of those firms that would cut wages after two years of losses, an additional 5 percent of firms would seek to cut wages at 3 percent inflation, 10 percent at 2 percent inflation, 19 percent at 1 percent inflation, and 33 percent of firms would ideally impose wage cuts on workers at zero measured inflation  Productivity growth is placed at the current 1 percent level An aversion on the part of firms to impose these desired nominal wage cuts results in higher permanent rates of unemployment As the numbers I just cited would suggest, the impact of resistance to nominal wage cuts on permanent unemployment is highly nonlinear It would be barely noticeable at present US inflation levels It is also worth pointing out, picking up on the comment the Chairman just made, that what matters to permanent unemployment is not the steady state inflation rate per se but the sum of the inflation and productivity growth rates, which determines the trend in nominal wages If we go back to the 1950s and 1960s and ask why we had low unemployment with low inflation, I think the answer is that productivity growth was much more rapid and that makes a big difference  The key question is how much permanent unemployment rises as inflation falls, and here the methodology used to assess the consequences does matter These authors used general equilibrium methodology and here is what they find The natural rate rises above its assumed 58 percent minimum to 61 percent as measured inflation falls from 4 down to 2 percent; the natural rate rises to 65 percent at 1 percent inflation, and then to 76 percent at zero percent inflation With different methodology, the impact of nominal rigidity could be lower But even so, I think it is apparent that an economy where 20 to 30 percent of firms need to impose pay cuts in a typical year to operate efficiently is likely to be an economy that will end up functioning below its potential  The simulations in this paper assume that, except in circumstances where the firm is really in trouble, workers resist and firms are unwilling to impose nominal pay cuts for fear of harming worker morale and causing productivity-reducing backlash In Canada between 1992 and 1994 when core inflation was under 2 percent and unemployment 3 percent above the estimated NAIRU, 47 percent of 1,149 observed labor contracts had pay freezes but only 6 percent had wage cuts The question is, how common is resistance to nominal wage cuts? I certainly do not have time to review all the available evidence, but I want to say that I think we are dealing here with a very deep-rooted property of the human psyche that is uncovered repeatedly in experiments, surveys, and interviews Very recently, Bob Schiller of Yale posed the following question to a random sample of Americans He asked, ""Do you agree with the following statement I think that if my pay went up, I would feel more satisfaction in my job, more sense of  -44-    7/2-3/96  fulfillment, even if prices went up just as much"" Of his respondents, 28 percent agreed fully and another 21 percent partially agreed Only 27 percent completely disagreed, although I think it will comfort you to learn that in a special subsample of economists, not one single economist Schiller polled fully agreed and 78 percent completely disagreed [Laughter]  To the best of my knowledge, the only potential evidence in favor of the proposition that Americans will and frequently do accept nominal wage cuts without changing jobs comes in recent studies whose methodology I consider flawed These studies use individual data from the Panel Studies on Income Dynamics, a longitudinal study that follows individuals over time To compute the wage changes of employees who remain in the same job, these various studies take the difference between wages reported by the same individual in consecutive years The problem with this approach is that it is known that reporting error in wage levels is very large, and such errors result in an artificially high incidence of calculated wage cuts In commenting on the most recent paper of this sort, by David Card and Dean Hyslop, John Shea computed the incidence of reported and actual wage cuts of 379 participants in the PSID whose occupation, industry, and area of residence enabled him to uniquely define the bargaining agreement covering them He found that 211 percent of those respondents had reported wage cuts, but in contrast, only 13 percent were actually covered by bargaining agreements that contained wage cuts  Where does that leave us? I want to wrap up by indicating what happens when we do the cost-benefit analysis by using the Akerlof, Dickens, Perry estimates of inflation-related changes in permanent unemployment along with Feldstein's estimates of the tax- related welfare benefits under his baseline and more conservative assumptions about the interest elasticity of savings As I total things up, it appears to me that a reduction of inflation from 3 percent, which I take as roughly our current level, to 2 percent, very likely, but not surely, yields net benefits The ""grease-the-wheel"" argument is of minor importance at that point, and tax effects could be significant But with further reductions in inflation below 2 percent, nominal rigidity begins to bite so that the marginal payoff declines and then turns negative To my mind, to go below 2 percent measured inflation as currently calculated requires highly optimistic assumptions about tax benefits and the sacrifice ratio Of course, if inflation cum tax distortions were remedied through legislation instead of Federal Reserve policy, the net benefits would be lower  I agree with that  -45-    7/2-3/96  I would agree with your conclusion that we need higher productivity growth, but I have not seen any evidence that convinces me that we would get it But certainly if we did get it, or if productivity growth were higher, it would be easier by an order of magnitude to live with price stability  One could argue that we have roughly a 1 percent bias in the CPI so that right now we have, say, 2 percent productivity growth and 2 percent core inflation  Such productivity growth would mean that we are living successfully with 2 percent inflation  Because productivity growth is really higher than we have measured it  I am perfectly happy with the last view  I would simply respond to that by saying that the Federal Reserve Act directs us to aim for both maximum employment and price stability To the extent that there is no tradeoff at low inflation rates and there are benefits that outweigh the short-run costs, then price stability, literally zero inflation, is good and we should go for it To the extent that there is a tradeoff, we have to weigh what to do, and I think I am pointing to the possibility of a tradeoff as we go to very low inflation rates  No, I am discussing the issue of the ultimate objective If we have to pay a permanent price at zero measured inflation in the form of permanently less employment and higher unemployment, I do not read the Federal Reserve Act as unambiguously telling us that we should choose price stability and forego maximum employment  -49-    7/2-3/96  But it does not obligate the Federal Reserve to pursue that goal  I agree, yes  That is what I said, what Bob Parry just stated  There are 17 other people besides the two of us  Mr Chairman, will you define ""price stability"" for me?  -50-    7/2-3/96  Could you please put a number on that? [Laughter]  Improperly measured, I believe that heading toward 2 percent inflation would be a good idea, and that we should do so in a slow fashion, looking at what happens along the way My presumption based on the literature is, as Bob Parry summarized it, that given current inaccurate measurements, heading toward 2 percent is most likely to be beneficial  I merely meant that the existence of IRAs cuts the welfare gains from lowering inflation  I did not say what the quantitative impact was  I am sorry I agree with Governor Meyer and would support the statements he has made I regret that I have not thought through this measurement issue carefully, and so you should not take my 3 percent and 2 percent inflation numbers as necessarily focusing on the CPI  I agree fully with Governor Lindsey's reasoning on this along with his assessment of the likely consequences of saying that we have made a technical adjustment I would certainly grant that our Humphrey-Hawkins report has honestly stated that the ranges in Alternative I encompass the Committee's expectation for growth of M2 under conditions of price stability, and we said in the report that we thought M2 growth would be near the upper end of the range All that is true But what we are required to do, as the Bluebook notes, is to communicate to Congress our objectives and plans for growth of the aggregates for the calendar year, taking account of past and prospective developments in employment, prices, and other factors The latter do not include what we view as the likely ranges under conditions of price stability My sense is that this is not a big deal I think we should simply do what we were asked to do in the Humphrey-Hawkins legislation We would say that we are making a technical adjustment; we made a technical adjustment to M3 in July of last year I would note, incidentally, that I have dissented twice before on this issue; Governor Lindsey has dissented once No one, not even a reporter, has ever called me to ask whether there was a deep monetary policy disagreement among the FOMC members or whether we had lost our commitment to price stability I have never heard one word from any reporter about this I have said that I dissented for a technical reason and the boredom factor set in so rapidly that no one wanted to hear another word about it I believe that is what would happen now  It is just a little note  I can't, Mr Chairman! I agree with your analysis and many of you have been eloquent in expressing thoughts that I agree with the Vice Chairman, Governor Meyer, Governor Rivlin, President McTeer, and others among you I can certainly support the recommendation to leave the funds rate where it is with an asymmetric directive I agree that the risks are unbalanced at this stage, and I certainly can envision a set of data between now and our next meeting that would justify in my mind a move following a phone call But I agree with you that there is a great benefit to waiting and watching a while longer to decide how things are going I consider this a period of great uncertainty To my mind, the most serious risk at this stage is that we simply do not know how demand is likely to behave going forward I think that if we have significantly underestimated the continuing robustness of aggregate demand so that we see a significant reduction in labor market slack in coming months or, alternatively, if our assumption that something has changed in labor markets is clearly  -93-    7/2-3/96  proving to be incorrect, we will be compelled to move and I will certainly support those moves I found the Bluebook policy simulations and also the Taylor Rule computations useful To my mind, they mean that we are roughly correctly positioned at this point; we are in the neighborhood of the equilibrium real funds rate So, I do not feel that our policy stance is way off from where it should be, and I think we can wait and see how these things materialize I don't think we need to jump the gun in order to establish our credibility to prove to markets that we are prepared to act All we need to do is actually to act when we see that the circumstances justify it  Mr Chairman, I agree that the swap arrangements are by and large a legacy of times past and may have become something of an anachronism But even if these arrangements have become largely symbolic, they do seem to me to be an important symbol of our commitment to international cooperation Here I agree particularly with Governor Rivlin and President Boehne I think it would be dangerous simply to dismantle these arrangements in a way that creates international tension I do not really see these arrangements as dangerous I understand the principle that President Broaddus has enunciated as to why they could be dangerous to our ability to conduct an independent monetary policy, but I think that fear is overblown I agree with President Boehne that they could even be helpful on occasion in the future  I would support the suggestion that you made, Mr Chairman, that it might be wise to look for an opportunity in Basle or elsewhere to discuss the future of these arrangements quietly with our central bank partners and to see what their reactions would be I would not want to see needless tension created here I also agree that before we have those conversations, it would be wise to figure out where we might want to go in the future to be able to react to suggestions that we replace these arrangements with something else With respect to a system of repo and reverse repo-type arrangements, I think that is a possibility that is well worth exploring But I would agree also with President Broaddus's list of the questions that would need to be addressed and answered What do we see as the fundamental purpose? Is it to guard against systemic risk? Is it a service to our allies? Is it for our own reserve management needs? Will we do transactions on demand? Is this a privilege? Is this a right? Are there limits? With whom do we intend to deal? What criteria will we use to decide which countries? I think Governor Kelley's question about private markets and the impact that we might have on private institutions as we become increasingly large players in this area is a question that we should explore along with the broad issue of the governance structure if we proceed We need to work out who will make the decisions and what authorization will be required I think this is a good opportunity for the staff to go home and do some work "
5585,1996-08-20," Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation I continue to consider the inflationary risks biased to the up side I believe we have agreed that regardless of whether we prefer opportunistic or deliberate strategies, we should resist any sustained uptick in inflation I support that policy I also think Don Kohn has properly warned us that if we are actually below NAIRU and fail to act, all we will end up doing is buying more output and more jobs now at the expense of less output and fewer jobs later, in effect adding to cyclical fluctuations rather than mitigating them Ordinarily, I would prefer a preemptive approach to controlling inflation rather than, as Tom Melzer put it, simply waiting to shoot until we have seen the whites of its eyes  Nevertheless, I think the current situation is unusual In spite of the apparent inflation risk, which has been present now for a considerable time, inflation has been declining, not increasing, and now demand finally appears to be moderating So, the level of uncertainty about the future course of inflation under current policy settings is extremely high And particularly because a move today would constitute a change of direction and a surprise to the public and to financial markets, I would prefer to have a slightly higher degree of confidence that a policy change is actually needed before making one In situations where forecast uncertainly is extremely high, I, at least, find it appealing to look for some guidance from the recommendations of sensible feedback rules, so I would simply reiterate what Don Kohn pointed out, which is that the funds rate judged by Taylor's Rule or other simple benchmarks is now at quite a reasonable level given current levels of unemployment and inflation On the other hand, the rule definitely calls for a policy adjustment  -44-    8/20/96  if either of two things occurs first, if the degree of labor market slack declines appreciably, presumably because demand fails to slow as we anticipate; or second, if broad inflation measures rise Under those conditions, I would certainly support a tightening of policy "
5609,1996-09-24," Thank you, Mr Chairman In reviewing the data that have accumulated since our last meeting, I find myself in rough agreement with the Greenbook's assessment The evidence clearly points to a reduction in the momentum in aggregate demand with a slackened pace of spending growth now likely in consumption, government spending, and residential investment during the current quarter With the pace of final demand now moderating, the upside risks from inventory investment are also reduced On balance, it seems likely that demand growth will revert toward trend in coming quarters, with the risks to that forecast roughly balanced  The primary problem that confronts us is that labor markets are already tight, and during the assumed transition to trend growth slack is likely to diminish even further We thus appear to be on course toward a landing that is ideal except for the fact that we are now poised to hover above the runway without actually touching down [Laughter] Even if we agree with the Greenbook's argument that the  -20-    9/24/96  decline in the unemployment rate to 51 percent in August should not be interpreted literally, it does seem evident to me that the labor market has notched tighter In this respect the unemployment data seem consistent with the anecdotal evidence It is not uncommon to hear that it is now ""impossible"" to find qualified entry-level workers, whereas six months ago the word ""difficult"" would have been used more frequently At a recent Dallas board meeting that I attended, one director described the pressures that an inability to hire entry-level workers was placing on supervisors who were forced to work overtime He explained that quit rates were rising among his supervisors as a consequence I think this is precisely the type of anecdote that one would expect to hear at the onset of an inflationary episode If widespread pressures of this type emerge, it seems likely that firms eventually will be forced to bid up wages to retain workers and then pass through higher unit labor costs to prices At the same time, though, the current episode has some unique features  While the labor market is tight, job insecurity also seems alive and well Real wage aspirations appear modest, and the bargaining power of workers is surprisingly low Although there is upward pressure on entry-level wages, more senior workers and particularly those who have earned wage premia in the past, whether it is due to the power of their unions or the generous compensation policies of their employers, seem to be struggling to defend their jobs and to avoid sacrificing the perks they currently enjoy I would also interpret the UAW negotiations as indicating that we have aging auto workers who are focused on securing their own benefits during their lifetimes but appear reconciled to accepting two-tier wage structures with less generous packages for new hires Of course, we hear reports of continued upward pressure on wages in skilled technical jobs, but that should hardly surprise us because the wage differential associated with skill and education has been widening secularly since the late 1970s, most likely due to technological shifts in the workplace favoring skilled and disfavoring less educated workers And, of course, while wage growth has accelerated, compensation growth has increased only moderately because companies have offset more rapid wage increases with greater health care cost containment We may hypothesize that that favorable trend is about to conclude, but anecdotal reports suggest that corporations remain confident of their ability to achieve further cost savings  In contrast to past expansions that have led to inflationary upticks, capacity utilization is not excessively strained Delivery lags have not increased The world economy is not in a synchronous boom Firms still insist that it is impossible to pass along price increases, and the behavior of broad inflation measures remains consistent with that perception The dramatic table in Part II of the Greenbook reveals no evidence of an intensification in inflationary pressures Nor can we find evidence that compensation pressures are eroding earnings The markup of prices over unit labor costs in the nonfinancial corporate sector, for example, has not been declining, and pressure on profit margins is a typical precursor of an inflationary outbreak Further, we have yet to see any evidence of an uptick in inflationary expectations I found it striking that when rumors surfaced that hinted at a higher chance of a Fed rate increase today, longer-term rates rose rather than fell So, we may well be at a point where inflation is poised to rise, but if we are, I think we are still at an early stage of the inflationary spiral The anomalous  -21-    9/24/96  behavior of inflation in the face of seemingly tight labor markets is, of course, leading virtually all economists to lower their estimates of NAIRU  For all the reasons that I have given, I am sympathetic to the view that the world has changed Nevertheless, let me conclude by saying that I would not want to carry such reasoning too far First, an unemployment rate of 51 percent lies near the lower end of almost anyone's estimated NAIRU range Second, whatever the NAIRU, the unemployment rate does have predictive power for changes in the inflation rate The probability of an increase in inflation is clearly higher when labor market slack is lower For that reason, I conclude that the risk of an increase in inflation has definitely risen, and I would characterize the economy as operating in an inflationary danger zone  Thank you, Mr Chairman I can support your proposal to adopt an unchanged policy with an asymmetric directive and to continue to evaluate incoming data as it bears both on the degree of momentum in demand and the inflationary pressures latent in the current environment But I find myself very close to the margin and would also have been quite willing to support an upward adjustment of 25 basis points today, had you proposed that I can support your  -38-    9/24/96  proposal because, for the reasons that I outlined earlier and you explained in fascinating detail, this is an unusual episode I believe we are still at quite an early stage of an inflationary uptick, if indeed this turns out to be one I also agree that with demand moderating and current inflation stable or falling, we may end up deciding that it is unnecessary to move the funds rate upward  But having said that, I believe that a very solid case can also be made for raising the federal funds rate at least modestly, by 25 basis points, on the grounds that the unemployment rate has notched down further, the decline in labor market slack is palpable, and the odds of a rise in the inflation rate have increased, whatever the level of the NAIRU and the associated level of those odds I believe I am echoing Governor Meyer in saying that I favor a policy approach in which, absent clear contra-indications, our policy instrument would be routinely adjusted in response to changing pressures on resources and movements in actual inflation I think such a response function operationalizes the precept that the Fed should ordinarily lean against the wind A 25 basis point increase in the funds rate is a small move that entails only mild resistance to the forces that are threatening to blow the economy off course In my mind, what goes up can also come down, and we risk an error if we make the hurdle for moving our policy instrument too high I am concerned that a policy of maintaining short-term interest rates unchanged, in essence creating a flat LM curve in the face of spending or IS curve shocks, risks increasing the variability of real economic outcomes and decoupling the financial market mechanism and response that should be serving as an automatic stabilizer in the economy I see the markets as doing their part in moving longer-term rates in response to economic news But I think we can only count on those responses if our own responses are predictable and we are perceived as willing to play our part, too My concern is that a failure to shift policy just modestly in response to shifting inflationary risks could undermine the assumptions on which the markets' own stabilizing responses are based "
5633,1996-11-13," Thank you, Mr Chairman Since Thanksgiving is almost upon us, it seems appropriate to count our blessings, which are numerous Economic performance with respect to both job creation and inflation has been excellent, and developments during the intermeeting period have enhanced the prospect that these favorable trends will persist In the first place, it now seems probable that spending  -22-    11/13/96  growth will moderate quickly enough to avoid placing additional strains on the labor market Second, inflation remains well contained In fact, the data on broad measures of inflation in Part II of the Greenbook suggest that inflation performance has been better than merely well contained since, as Bob Parry mentioned, every broad measure of inflation other than the total CPI has been trending downward since 1993  With respect to inflationary pressures in the pipeline, the third-quarter ECI report failed to confirm our collective fear that labor market pressures would translate into an accelerating compensation trend I was quite pleased to see that with the passage of yet an additional quarter in which compensation ran at such a moderate pace, the staff has finally revised down their estimate of NAIRU to 56 percent I consider this a sensible response to roughly two years of evidence that the dynamics of inflation have changed a bit Additional good news from an inflation perspective is that prices of commodities and intermediate goods have turned down since our last meeting The outlook for food prices has improved, and even the outlook for energy prices is more favorable In contrast to pressures in the labor market, pressures on capacity do not seem intense at this point, and investment in plant and equipment is still rapid enough in the staff forecast to mitigate capacity pressures even further over the forecast period  Finally, there are hints that firms may be stepping up the less visible investments that they make in their workers to create through training the skills they require in their workforce but find in short supply in the labor market I would agree with Governor Rivlin's comments in this regard In particular, I was struck by a recent Business Week article that detailed myriad ways in which the Marriott hotel chain and several other large corporations are working with unskilled, disadvantaged workers to inculcate good work habits and in particular to teach English as a second language to improve basic literacy and create opportunities for eventual promotions into more responsible positions These investments are on the flip side of the hysteresis process that is believed by many observers to have raised NAIRUs in European countries; that occurred as young people unable to find jobs experienced deterioration in their skills and lost attachment to the world of work So, I would agree with the view that there are benefits as well as costs to tight labor markets  In spite of all that is going right in the American economy, I too remain concerned about the outlook My first worry relates to the Greenbook's assessment I agree with the staff that we may well be living on borrowed time and that inflation will eventually accelerate if the unemployment rate remains at its current level, as in the Greenbook forecast Although I believe there is strong evidence that NAIRU has declined below 6 percent, it seems difficult to use the data in hand at this point to defend the proposition that it is as low as 52 percent  My second worry relates to the behavior of aggregate demand Here I have no quarrel with the staff's estimate of moderation in growth to a shade above trend in 1997 and 1998, but I am concerned about the risks With drags on growth stemming from government spending, residential spending, and trade, and with reduced impetus to growth from investment spending, the behavior of consumption, as Mike  -23-    11/13/96  Prell emphasized, is critical to the outlook The Greenbook assumes that consumption will quickly rebound and then grow in line with disposable income As Mike noted, consumers have greater income and wealth and their confidence is high, so it is perfectly reasonable to assume that the third-quarter spending lull was temporary and a statistical aberration Indeed, I think one could easily justify a much stronger consumption forecast than in the Greenbook, given the enormous gains in stock market wealth and the huge increase in household net worth that we have seen in spite of the buildup in consumer debt On the other hand, I am equally concerned about the downside risk to consumption because at this stage a rebound in consumption spending is a forecast and not yet a fact During the third quarter, it seems that three things occurred simultaneously consumer spending stalled, the growth of consumer credit plummeted, and lending standards tightened I do not know just what caused what, but with household debt burdens--if one includes leasing payments as Governor Lindsey likes to do--approaching all time highs and with bankruptcies surging and consumer credit charge-offs running well above expectations, it is not very surprising that lenders would tighten standards It seems perfectly possible to me that the consequence could be weaker spending by liquidity-constrained households than the Greenbook assumes I also would agree that a significant stock market correction, which cannot be ruled out, adds downside risk  Well, where does that leave me? It leaves me thinking that it is certainly within the realm of possibilities that growth may slow enough over the forecast period to bring the economy back toward NAIRU under the Greenbook assumption concerning monetary policy  Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation I think that an asymmetric directive is warranted for all of the reasons enunciated in the Greenbook I believe the inflation risk definitely remains asymmetric I also share Governor Lindsey's and President Minehan's concern about euphoria in asset markets On balance, though, it seems to me that the incremental data since our last meeting point toward more moderate growth than last time as well as a better inflation performance I would consider it perfectly possible for demand to end up moderating more than the Greenbook assumes, eliminating the excess pressure in the labor market and any need for additional monetary tightening So, for now I am certainly comfortable with more watchful waiting "
5658,1996-12-17," Thank you, Mr Chairman I will try to be brief this morning because my view is little changed from last time The limited new data that are available since our last meeting support the staff's prediction that the lull in consumer spending over the summer was likely a temporary aberration and not the onset of any period of significant retrenchment due to tightening consumer credit or escalating debt burdens Indeed, I have been fighting the crowds and searching in frustration for parking spots at local malls in recent days only, I assure you, to provide some firsthand independent research concerning the strength of Christmas spending [Laughter] Frankly, my concern with the possibility that consumer spending may be too robust rather than too weak has increased At a minimum, the risks with respect to consumption now seem to me to be quite balanced However, moderation in government spending and residential investment combined with the significant drag from net exports--and that drag has been revised upward in the latest Greenbook due to the stronger dollar as Ted Truman mentioned--those sources of drag, I think, should offset above-trend growth in consumption and investment spending over the forecast period If we add to that the fact that inventories are seemingly at reasonable levels in relation to sales, the Greenbook forecast of overall growth in demand seems perfectly plausible with the risks looking quite balanced, as Governor Meyer stated a minute ago Meanwhile, the news on the inflation front does suggest continued moderation in core inflation, with relief on the horizon most likely with respect to energy prices  To my mind, labor markets are undeniably tight You remarked last time, Mr Chairman, that we should be careful not to lull ourselves into a false sense of security about incipient wage pressures by reading too much into that suspiciously low third-quarter ECI, and I agree with that So, I still feel that we need to avoid complacency about the potential for inflationary pressures to emerge from the labor market down the road But while I think we cannot rule out the possibility that this long expansion is about to end with a period of stagflation and that that is a significant risk over the term of this forecast, that outcome is by no means a certainty Capacity utilization, as a number of you have mentioned, is not strained at this point Incoming data do suggest that earnings and profitability remain strong, so I do not see any squeeze on corporate profits at this stage In fact, this stunning combination of strong corporate profits, a healthy but sustainable pace of real growth, low and maybe even declining inflation, and lower real interest rates due to enhanced prospects of a balanced budget is a mix that may indeed continue to support a level of stock prices that the Greenbook--I liked the staff's term for this--called aggressive I thought, if anything, that that was an accurate statement and, given the careful analysis done here at the Board, that it was perhaps an understatement Like Governor Lindsey and some of the rest of you, I consider the stock market a significant continuing risk to the outlook So, I do worry that this confluence of favorable events has fostered what you describe, Mr Chairman--I think appropriately--as irrational exuberance in asset markets I think your recent remarks alluding to the potential for large asset price movements that are likely to have adverse impacts on economic activity was extraordinarily useful in prompting at least some introspection and some second thoughts by market participants about the rationality underlying the current evaluation of equity prices Maybe your speech also served to heighten just a little the appreciation by the market  -31-    12/17/96  that there do remain real risks around what is admittedly a very rosy forecast  I forgot that  I support your recommendation I see policy as appropriately positioned now and agree with President Parry that that becomes apparent from the observation of rules or from the Greenbook forecast But to my mind the risks are asymmetric I appreciate the clarification of the meaning of that term, and with that clarification I certainly am happy to support continued asymmetry today "
7335,2004-06-29,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman    The Twelfth District economy gained momentum in recent months and is   expanding in line with the nation  Consumer spending rose smartly, and our contacts report that   price discounting for a variety of small retail items has declined as demand has grown  District   housing markets saw strong price appreciation and strong sales  Some of the sales activity,   however, appears to be a response to anticipated mortgage rate increases, suggesting that markets   will calm down again in subsequent months  We are also seeing a continued general recovery in the   manufacturing sector as rapid growth in exports, especially to East Asia, has propelled strong gains   in overall output and sales   Job growth has also gained momentum in the West—especially outside California, which   has lagged a bit in recent months  As a result, employers in some areas report that it is getting   June 29-30, 2004 106 of 203          harder to find qualified applicants for job openings  The mountain region in particular has seen a   large increase in job vacancy rates over the past year and a half, and this has been associated with a   pickup in the growth of labor compensation relative to the nation  In fact, growth in compensation   recently has been nearly a percentage point higher in the West than in the nation  Such divergences   have occurred before, because of regional labor demand shocks, and have disappeared as workers   moved into the region to fill those jobs  Labor compensation in the West then returned toward the   national pace  At this point, it is too early to tell whether the recent pickup is transitory, due mainly   to such a regional demand shock, or is the leading edge of a trend that will spread more broadly in   the national economy    Turning to the national economy, our views about the outlook are pretty much in line with   the Greenbook  Recent data suggest that economic growth in the second half of the year will be   reasonably strong, and the most likely outcome over the next couple of years seems to be that the   pace of growth will exceed potential, bringing the economy gradually back toward full employment    What is new about the outlook compared with May is the strong employment growth reported for   April and May, which raises confidence that consumer spending will remain strong enough, as   fiscal stimulus wanes, to support the very desirable projections for economic activity and inflation   that are outlined in the Greenbook  Of course, to keep output from overshooting potential, policy   will need to tighten, given its current highly accommodative stance  We think a path of the funds   rate reasonably close to that currently embodied in the fed funds futures will be appropriate given   what we now know  Such a path easily qualifies as measured  Of course, our views will evolve   with unfolding data     In terms of the inflation outlook, I agree that rather substantial risks remain on both the   upside and also the downside  On the upside, there is the possibility that the role of transitory   June 29-30, 2004 107 of 203          factors—as opposed to movements in compensation and productivity—in explaining the surprising   recent uptick in core inflation is overestimated by the Greenbook  The uptick in core inflation could   also affect future wage bargains  The dollar could fall further, and oil prices could jump or remain   elevated  We have also seen a small uptick in compensation growth, although my reading of the   labor market is that there remains a significant amount of slack  Finally, not emphasized in today’s   presentation, there is upside potential for inflation if trend productivity growth falls short of the   rather robust rate that I believe is built into the Greenbook forecast   However, there are also a number of downside risks to inflation, as the Greenbook and the   presentation this morning emphasized  One that David emphasized has been particularly important   to us in our analysis—namely, that profit margins have been extraordinarily large and the markup of   goods prices over unit labor costs in level terms has risen to a new high  This large markup could   return to more normal levels through falling inflation or through faster growth in labor   compensation or a combination of the two  We saw such a run-up and rapid reversion toward   normality during the second half of the 1990s  Based on our analysis, which is similar to an   alternative simulation reported in the Greenbook, it is quite possible that, if prices and wages adjust   consistent with standard model equations over the next year and a half, the restraint on inflation   could be quite significant  In any event, the most likely scenario appears to be that core PCE prices   will increase by a little over 1½ percent this year and around 1½ percent in 2005  I see the risks to   this forecast as being rather large, but also the inflation risks seem roughly balanced  "
7360,2004-08-10,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Twelfth District economy has expanded at   a solid pace in recent months  After a pause in June and early July, District consumers appear to   have opened their wallets again—spending more on entertainment, travel, and a range of services    Even with higher fuel prices, District tourist destinations are well booked, and industry contacts say   that they are having a good summer  Housing markets remain vibrant, but higher materials costs   and anticipated interest rate increases have begun to temper the pace of new building    On the business side, firms remain focused on containing costs and improving efficiency    Contacts note that almost no decision gets made without asking how it will affect productivity over   the next five years or so  After the long decline in the District’s IT sector, signs of improvement are   August 10, 2004 40 of 103          emerging  Production capacity is up, employees are working more hours, and firms have begun to   add jobs  In some areas, demand for employees with technical training or experience has risen so   sharply that it is outstripping supply, and businesses are responding by poaching from other firms,   producing sizable wage payments in these IT-focused areas  So far, however, rapid productivity   growth has held unit labor costs in check  Improved labor markets and rising wages have begun to   attract job seekers and, after falling for several years, labor force participation has picked up   somewhat in many District states and the fraction of the unemployed that were either new or   returning entrants has increased    Turning to the national outlook, disappointing data for June and the July employment report   have caused us to revise down our real GDP forecast and have elevated our concern about downside   risks to the outlook  Recent weakness in personal consumption expenditures is particularly   worrisome  Growth in consumer spending was probably affected by weather, a temporary dip in   auto sales that was reversed in July, and of course, higher energy prices  But as David mentioned,   standard model estimates suggest that the quantitative impact of the oil price hikes we have seen this   year should have depressed PCE by only a few tenths of a percent  So, in my view we should   therefore consider the possibility, as David did, that other factors may also be at work  For   example, the level of mortgage refinancings in recent months has plummeted, and conceivably—I   have no evidence to this effect, but conceivably—equity withdrawals for cash-out refinancings had   provided a greater boost to spending than was commonly recognized   In addition, the saving rate is at a very low level  Consumers kept up their spending   throughout the recession and recovery despite only modest income growth  With interest rates   rising and equity prices declining notably since our last meeting, households might try to get their   finances in order and bring the saving rate up to more normal levels  An alternative scenario in the   August 10, 2004 41 of 103          Greenbook suggests that an increase in the saving rate to 1 percentage point higher than the baseline   would lower real GDP growth about a percentage point, to a sluggish 2½ percent in 2005—and it   would be even less given the revised staff forecast  With consumer confidence strong and   disposable income likely growing at a solid rate, even with weak job growth in July, I agree that the   odds are good that the economy will soon rebound from the late spring and early summer doldrums    I don’t think we should overreact to a brief lull, but the downside risk to the Committee’s forecast of   sustainable growth has clearly risen, in my opinion     Turning to inflation, I’ve been encouraged by data from May and June showing a   moderation of core consumer inflation  Recent ECI readings also reveal that wage and salary   growth remains very well contained, although overall compensation growth has been elevated by   large increases in health and pension benefits  On balance, these developments support the view   that the recent run-up in inflation mainly reflects temporary factors  I continue to see large risks to   the inflation outlook on both the upside and downside  Of course, we have been, as you have,   continually surprised by increases in oil prices over the past year or so; and the possibility that this   pattern will continue represents an upside risk for inflation at the same time that it represents a   downside risk to demand  But a downside risk for inflation is the exceptionally high markup of   goods prices over unit labor costs  And if the adjustment to a more normal markup is shared in a   typical way by goods prices and labor compensation, this could depress inflation by a noticeable   amount   Looking forward to our policy discussion, the recent moderation in core consumer inflation   coupled with doubts about the robustness of the expansion suggests to me that we should tighten the   stance of policy at this meeting in line with market expectations of a 25 basis point increase in the   federal funds rate  Going forward, my hope is that we will follow a wait-and-see approach,   August 10, 2004 42 of 103          adjusting the pace at which policy accommodation is removed to the ebb and flow of data   concerning both labor markets and inflation developments  In view of the recent weakness in the   economic data and the downgrading of the forecast, I would favor modifying the final sentence in   our statement to indicate that we intend to fulfill our obligations to promote both price stability and   sustainable growth    Mr Chairman, I agree with the proposal to raise the funds rate 25 basis   points today and the idea that the default going forward should be to continue doing this on a regular   August 10, 2004 86 of 103          schedule  But I agree with Governors Kohn and Ferguson that our decisions should be data-  dependent  I am concerned about the downside risk and think that we might need to pause   I prefer to include sustainable growth along with price stability in the final sentence  First of   all, I believe very strongly that we have a dual mandate, and that language reflects it  But beyond   that we have the sentence in line 3 that says, “The economy nevertheless appears poised to resume a   stronger pace of expansion going forward,” which is a rather confident statement that we feel we’ll   be able to continue on the path of raising rates  And I think the reference to sustainable growth   simply acknowledges that there is a slight downside risk to that forecast   I understand the desire also to shift back to more formulaic language concerning risks and   away from the kind of explicit statement we’ve had about future policy, though I personally think   the latter approach has worked quite well  I was struck, however, by the difficulties of describing   the risks as I read the language in alternative C  I dislike the language in alternative C intensely; I   won’t go into the reasons right now  But as Governor Gramlich mentioned last time, the Committee   has thought about this issue quite thoroughly and has studied the options, and there are many   problems with the kind of dual risk assessment that is shown in alternative C  I can’t see going back   to that kind of language easily without a thorough discussion of the problems involved  "
7385,2004-09-21,"  I have a question for David  I think one way of summarizing the   Greenbook forecast is to say that the equilibrium real federal funds rate that is implicit in that   forecast is very low  As I read it, it’s on the order of 1 percent, which I interpret as very   depressed relative to the equilibrium real funds rate that would be implicit in the FRB/US model,   for example  I would find it helpful if you could pinpoint what the source of this divergence is    By that I mean which components of spending or aggregate demand do you see as particularly   depressed relative to what the FRB/US model would predict?  Where are the model’s residuals   large?  A related question, in light of the comment that you just made, involves the gap between   the Greenbook forecast and the FRB/US model forecast of the exchange rate  Simply running   the model, given what has happened to net exports, I suspect that one would predict a substantial   September 21, 2004 24 of 100          decline in the real exchange rate  The Greenbook is projecting a much flatter path of the real   exchange rate  Is it because net exports are the big source of the divergence that you have the   very low equilibrium funds rate?     And is that what the FRB/US model would predict?     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Since our last meeting, economic activity in   the Twelfth District has continued to expand at a solid pace but more slowly than earlier in the   year  In most of the District, housing markets remain vigorous, but there have been scattered   signs of cooling in some areas  High volumes of international trade have kept many seaports   operating at capacity and have overburdened parts of the warehousing and distribution chain  So   far, however, bottlenecks have been relatively minor  District job gains remain modest and well   off the pace of earlier in the year  Looking forward, our contacts report that they expect to   increase hiring in coming months to meet sales and output levels  Many comment, however, on   the difficulty of finding workers with the requisite skills and experience  Relatively unskilled   labor, in contrast, is perceived to be readily available   September 21, 2004 54 of 100          Turning to the national economy, recent data suggest that the sharp slowing in activity in   June was short-lived  The bounceback in consumer spending, including auto sales, is   encouraging, and the drop in oil prices from recent highs should also help  While all of this is   good news, we still haven’t seen real strength in job growth, and it’s not yet clear whether output   growth will return to the robust rates of last year or something much closer to the growth rate of   potential  These are key issues because of the slack remaining in labor and product markets  In   this regard, the Greenbook presents a rather sober view of the economic outlook, despite its   assumption of persistently low real interest rates    I’m in sympathy with the Greenbook’s view  First, while the oil shock almost certainly   had something to do with the recent weakness in the economy, I have yet to be convinced that its   effects were particularly large  Therefore, we might not get a big boost to activity from its   dissipation  Second, it seems likely that partial expensing is providing noticeable stimulus to   equipment investment this year, which means that the underlying impetus in the recovery is not   as strong as many think  Finally, I remain concerned about the potential for weakness in   consumer spending, which could restrain growth even more than the Greenbook envisions  In   spite of only modest income growth, consumer spending provided critical support for aggregate   demand during the recession and afterward, and the saving rate remains at an extremely low   level  With interest rates rising, households may seek to get their finances in order and bring the   saving rate up to more normal levels  An alternative simulation in the Greenbook illustrates that   this could be a potent factor in restraining growth over the next couple of years  In addition,   mortgage refinancings have remained low, and the associated loss of cash flow to households   could undermine spending for a time   September 21, 2004 55 of 100          Turning to inflation, the data for July and August have been very favorable, especially   following the May and June data, which also showed modest increases in core consumer prices    This development strongly suggests that the run-up in inflation last winter reflected temporary   factors   Overall, it’s a bit of a mystery why this expansion has not been marked by faster average   growth together with a larger reduction in the amount of slack, given persistently easy financial   conditions, including the low levels of real interest rates, as well as the decline in the dollar and   the increase in equity prices over the past year or so  But, of course, continuing caution in the   wake of September 11, the wars in the Middle East, and the corporate governance scandals are   reasonable candidates for an explanation  The continuation of this pattern suggests that the   equilibrium real federal funds rate remains quite depressed relative to its historical average, so   monetary policy must remain accommodative for the foreseeable future  A pause in the process   of raising the funds rate is, thus, likely to become appropriate in the near future, especially if   inflation remains well behaved as expected  At the present time, however, the real funds rate is   so low that a modest tightening at this meeting seems justified    I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman  "
7409,2004-11-10,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  The economic situation in the District has   changed little since our last meeting  Activity continues to expand solidly but not exuberantly,   closely mirroring the nation  Housing markets, with only a few exceptions, remain robust    Consumer spending is solid in both the retail and travel sectors  Our ports are extremely busy and   in some cases are even overburdened because of heightened activity on both the import and the   export sides  One area where there may be softening is manufacturing, as some of our contacts   report slower demand growth than earlier in the year  Finally, job gains remain modest in the   District, and unemployment has inched down only slightly  As a result, labor supply remains   ample, and we hear little about worker shortages or accelerating wages   Turning to the national economy, recent data on economic activity have flashed both   positive and negative signals, but on balance they suggest that growth is sustainable though   trendlike—not nearly as robust as the strength we saw last year  In spite of the small uptick in the   unemployment rate, October’s stunning job growth raises the odds that labor market slack will   decline over time  The October employment report is also reassuring because strong job growth   mitigates the downside risk to consumer spending from muted growth in personal income   The Greenbook forecast, even as revised on Friday, was sobering  It shows only a meager   acceleration in activity next year to a rate that is only modestly above potential, despite continued   monetary stimulus and a shallow upward path to the funds rate—shallower than markets now   expect  This forecast seems plausible to me for several reasons  First, of course, oil prices are   surprisingly and persistently high  Second, fiscal stimulus will turn weaker next year  Third,   there’s a good prospect that the private saving rate will rise from its current low level once housing-  price appreciation moderates and the growth in wealth that consumers experience as a consequence   starts to taper off  Fourth, it seems likely that the trade gap will continue to drag down growth,   even though the dollar has fallen somewhat since we last met  And, finally, we do not see business   November 10, 2004 35 of 107    investment in equipment and software rebounding at a sufficiently buoyant pace to propel truly   robust, above-trend growth     The high-tech sector poses risks to the forecast  As David noted, the Greenbook forecast for   IT investment has been revised down rather significantly in the last two rounds in response to   disappointing data that showed real growth of only 4¼ percent in the third quarter  Still, I consider   this forecast quite strong  It anticipates that the share of IT investment out of total equipment   investment will rise almost to the level reached at the end of 2000  I think it’s important to recall   that the 2000 peak was bolstered by several special factors, in particular the capital spending binge   by telecom service providers and the buildup to Y2K  In addition, it was propelled by a very rapid   pace of diffusion of personal computers and networks, a pace which may prove difficult to maintain   much longer  As Governor Ferguson noted in a recent speech and in his remarks to the Committee   last time, the more moderate pace of decline in quality-adjusted computer prices over the last year   may signal a decline in the pace of technological change in this sector  Furthermore, there is some   industry opinion that the pace of the development of software is beginning to slow   On the inflation front, the most recent data have been favorable  Despite the blip in core   CPI inflation in September, it appears that core inflation and longer-term inflation expectations are   well contained  The Greenbook forecast for the next year of 1½ percent in core PCE inflation and   just under 2 percent in core CPI inflation seems quite reasonable, although there are upside risks   from oil and the dollar   Overall, with inflation well contained, output growth that shows no sign of establishing real   momentum, and slack still remaining in the economy, I see no reason to presume without further   evidence that monetary policy needs to be tightened more rapidly than is assumed in the Greenbook   path  In my view, today’s move will complete the process of removing the insurance premium that   was incorporated into the federal funds rate as an emergency measure  As the Bluebook indicates,   November 10, 2004 36 of 107    the federal funds rate will have returned to a range that is consistent with the prescriptions of a   variety of Taylor-type instrument rules  Future moves in my view should, therefore, be data   dependent   If the Greenbook proves accurate, we will have many opportunities to pause in the process   of raising the funds rate over the next year or so, especially if the dollar and the price of oil do not   show significant declines  If they do decline significantly, the appropriate path for the funds rate   could steepen rather dramatically, but there is little need to anticipate changes in these variables   since we can monitor them daily and they take time to play out in the economy  For today’s   meeting, it seems entirely sensible to raise the funds rate 25 basis points  My comfort level with   this move was noticeably enhanced by recent employment gains  But I think the jury is still out on   the appropriate move in December, and I believe that we should craft a statement that leaves all   options open    Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation to increase the funds rate   25 basis points, but I am concerned about adopting the proposed statement  When I opened the   Bluebook this time, I was actually pleased to see in alternative B what I thought was a well-crafted   statement that hinted at a possible pause in a way that was rather artful and subtle, without   foreclosing any option in the future whatsoever  And I thought the reasoning in the Bluebook in   support of “B” was strong and convincing  As Vincent stated, both before and after the   employment report, market participants expected some hint in the statement of a possible pause   After we received the employment report, there was an update to the Bluebook that   contained alternative B′ as the proposed statement  So I took B′ as a response to the employment   report, and to my mind that was an unwarranted shift  I would note that the Greenbook assessment   of the appropriate path for the funds rate had not changed as a consequence of the employment   report  But we observed a large and, if the Greenbook is right, excessive market response to the   employment report  We saw that in the immediate move in the fed funds futures  I suppose if one   interprets the employment report as a very strong signal—and perhaps this is the view that you were   expressing—that structural productivity growth is lower than we had been assuming, then this B′   statement would be an appropriate response  But it seems to me that the Greenbook has already   incorporated an expected decline in productivity growth  I suppose in the Greenbook the decline is   cyclical not structural, but it is built into the Greenbook forecast  The employment report simply   confirmed what the staff had earlier been expecting when they had been surprised by the low   employment growth  So it seems to me that adopting B′ reinforces the market expectation about the   future path of monetary policy in a way that I would not like to see it reinforced  My own   preference would be to move today but to adopt alternative B rather than B′  "
7434,2004-12-14,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Economic activity in the District is expanding   at a moderately strong pace, closely mirroring that in the nation  Housing markets remain especially   robust, and consumer spending at stores and on travel is solid  The high volume of international   trade flowing through the District has resulted in backlogs at our ports in southern California  In   addition, there have been some reports that firms are facing difficulty in getting access to enough   trucks and railroad cars  Not surprisingly, shipping prices have risen   Turning to the national economy, I’ve been heartened by recent economic data, which for   the most part have been positive  The November employment report was disappointing, but taken   in the context of the last several months of job growth and other data, I have become more confident   that the economy has found solid footing   Looking forward, the decline in the dollar and the recent retreat in oil prices add further   support to aggregate demand  Even so, it is notable that output growth so far has only moderately   exceeded potential despite huge doses of fiscal and monetary medicine  And the Greenbook,   though more upbeat this time than last, forecasts a similar pattern for 2005, even with only a gradual   removal of monetary accommodation    Turning to inflation, the 2005 Greenbook forecast of core PCE inflation of about 1½ percent   and core CPI inflation of 2 percent strikes me as very reasonable  In support of this view, our   contacts tell us that consumer prices remain relatively stable  Indeed, our contacts see continued   competitive pressures to control costs  Such pressures were evident in labor negotiations at grocery   stores in southern California earlier this year and more recently at major hotels in the Bay area  I   see the risks to inflation from uncertainty about the future paths of the dollar and oil prices  Another   risk, which I’ve mentioned before, relates to the high markup of prices over unit labor costs  A   reversion to more-normal levels could result in a significant reduction in the rate of inflation    December 14, 2004 20 of 118           Finally, what happens to productivity growth is also important for the inflation outlook, as the   Greenbook alternative simulations demonstrate   I would like to focus the remainder of my comments on productivity and its implication for   inflation and monetary policy  As we discussed at the last meeting, the recent moderation in the   pace of price declines for high-tech goods, coupled with weakness in high-tech investment last   quarter, hints at the possibility of less-robust productivity growth going forward  If this turns out to   be the case, we would expect some upward pressure on inflation  I would like to emphasize,   however, that there is a real chance that productivity growth over the next few years will come in   higher than anticipated in the Greenbook  Over the past four years, labor productivity growth in the   nonfarm business sector has averaged nearly 4 percent—about 1½ percentage points above its pace   over 1996-2000, in spite of a sharp drop-off in capital deepening after 2000   Some people argue   that improved productivity growth since 2000 is largely temporary and will reverse over the next   few years  For example, the recent surge in productivity may reflect the fact that businesses have   been extremely cautious in adding workers  Proponents of this view expect caution to dissipate and   productivity growth to slow as firms become more confident about the outlook   But if business caution in making long-term commitments were the primary motive for   weak job growth, we would expect—but do not see—employment expanding along other margins,   such as the workweek  One reason for optimism about the underlying productivity trend is that   multifactor productivity during the second half of the 1990s was probably greater than estimates   derived from standard growth accounting  We now realize that a considerable amount of the   investment during the late 1990s had a low or even a negative rate of return, biasing up standard   estimates of the contribution to productivity growth from capital deepening   December 14, 2004 21 of 118           Moreover, all signs suggest that businesses are continuing to adapt and reorganize their   practices in order to take full advantage of the opportunities afforded by new ICT technologies, and   this process seems likely to continue playing out for some time  For example, one of our major   banks indicated that through ongoing use of technology they have been able to support growth in   customers and services with fewer staff  A further example is the continuing expansion of   Wal-Mart and other big box stores—a trend that has had a dramatic effect on productivity growth in   the retail and wholesale sectors   Finally, there is evidence suggesting that the extraordinarily high rates of investment during   the second half of the 1990s were disruptive to businesses  According to one estimate, such   adjustment costs reduced productivity growth about ½ percentage point during that period  All in   all, it’s entirely possible that productivity growth, both structural and actual, could average around   3¼ percent over the next two years, as in an alternative Greenbook simulation  This pace is about   equal to the average rate of productivity growth during the last seven years, including periods of   both high and low investment  In the Greenbook simulation that combines such a step-up in   productivity growth and a declining markup, inflation falls to ¾ percent in the second half of next   year and remains at that level  Such an outcome is troubling, given our concerns about the effects of   deflation and difficulties in conducting monetary policy in such an environment   So, in summary, I consider the 27 percent Greenbook estimate of structural productivity   growth as reasonable and the risks to inflation as balanced  But there is significant upside   productivity potential and associated downside risks to inflation  Given the costs of an unexpected   and substantial decline in inflation, these risks should be a significant concern  For today’s meeting,   it seems entirely sensible to raise the funds rate 25 basis points and to craft a statement that leaves   our options open to eventualities   December 14, 2004 22 of 118            I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman    Well, just briefly, I’d say that I definitely support the publication of the   minutes on an expedited schedule, given that it is feasible  And I agree completely with Don’s   analysis of the benefits  It does seem to me that, in moving toward perfecting a rational   expectations kind of equilibrium, the minutes released in a timely fashion, when they’re still   relevant, contain enough information about the Committee’s reaction to data and how it processes   those data that it should help the market improve its understanding of the rationale for policy  And   that includes the fact that there isn’t unanimity on the Committee; there is a range of opinions about   the outlook and the risks  Just in the brief time that I’ve been back on the Committee, there have   December 14, 2004 93 of 118           been occasions when the minutes were released at a point when they were actually misleading   because the views of the Committee had changed  I’ve found that unfortunate   Let me respond to Cathy’s point  While I can understand that, if the Committee decides to   move back to more formulaic language in the statement and to omit any reference to a consensus   about future policy, some might view earlier release of the minutes as a substitute for those kinds of   statements  But I would consider that both unnecessary and unfortunate  I support Ned’s comments   about that, in that I think it’s actually quite helpful to have an explicit statement about the   Committee’s consensus view regarding future policy  So I would not like to see this become a   simultaneous decision to forgo that in favor of the earlier release of the minutes  "
7461,2005-02-01," Thank you, Mr Chairman  I also wanted to begin by complimenting the   staff on their excellent and balanced paper and presentation   When I first participated in this Committee back in 1994, I believed that inflation by any   measure exceeded the comfort level of every FOMC participant  The goal of lowering inflation over   time was a universally shared and well-articulated goal  At that time, a qualitative definition of price   stability arguably sufficed to communicate the Committee’s objective to the public  Now that   underlying inflation has receded to a level that many of us consider optimal, though, the transition   costs of lowering inflation have become moot, and there are potential benefits of enunciating a   numerical long-run inflation objective   I think the articulation of such an objective would facilitate coherent internal policy   discussions To the extent it helps anchor the public’s inflation expectations, it would enhance our   ability to avoid deflation in the vicinity of the zero bound on interest rates A numerical objective   might also reduce the potential for destabilizing inflation scares following adverse supply shocks,   enhancing the scope for monetary policy to respond to their real effects  The public enunciation of a   long-run inflation objective I think also enhances accountability and transparency, and those are   desirable goals that we should pursue   Now, of course, I worry about the possible costs and unintended consequences from taking   such a step In this regard I’m very sympathetic to the arguments that President Minehan has   expressed And Governor Kohn has articulated these same concerns on a number of previous   occasions Such a policy might be the first step along a slippery slope that ultimately undermines the   Committee’s mandates for maximum employment, as well as broader financial stability  So for that   reason, I think enunciation of a numerical inflation goal simply must be in the context of a clear and           February 1-2, 2005 34 of 177  effective communication of our multiple objectives and the policies that we follow to achieve them    I’d like to come back to that point in a minute   I recently reread the transcript of the 1996 FOMC meeting at which the Committee I think   last discussed a numerical objective for inflation  At that meeting there was actually a considerable   consensus among participants, including myself, for a 2 percent long-run objective for CPI inflation    Since then, of course, there have been several important developments relevant to this choice  Back   in 1996, I argued that the inflation objective should contain a cushion sufficient to grease the wheels   of the labor market  The potential negative impact of downward nominal wage rigidity on real   economic performance diminishes, however, as productivity and hence average wage growth rises    And as Doug mentioned, it turns out that high productivity growth over the past decade made   downward wage rigidity a nonissue But for me, this shift has been offset by the experience of very   low inflation both here and abroad, which has certainly heightened my concern relating to the zero   lower bound So, on balance, taking a number of other factors into account, I find myself still pretty   comfortable with the numerical objective we discussed almost a decade ago   Instead of adopting an objective based on the CPI, I would now enunciate an objective based   on the core PCE This seems sensible given the methodological advantages of that index and the   Committee’s recent emphasis on it  Taking measurement bias between the two indexes into   account, my preference would now be for a long-run inflation objective of 1½ percent for core PCE   inflation   I wanted to discuss a couple of details relating to that objective First, I prefer a core   measure of inflation even if total inflation is more closely related to societal welfare  As a   communications device, I think we should focus our attention on underlying inflation and not on   movements that we view as transitory  Second, on balance, I find myself preferring a point estimate   rather than a range Specifying a range is helpful and commonly what is used  It’s helpful in   emphasizing the FOMC’s imperfect control of inflation, but it might wrongly suggest that the   Committee is equally comfortable anywhere inside that range  In addition, it might suggest that we           February 1-2, 2005 35 of 177  would react in some nonlinear fashion if inflation moves outside the range  Moreover, the staff   paper shows that, viewed as a formal confidence interval, a reasonable range that we could actually   hit, say, 90 percent of the time, might stretch from zero to 3 percent, which is simply too wide to be   helpful   Let me briefly turn to Vincent’s second question, which concerns how we might   communicate a long-run inflation objective to the public  My answer would be to take the polling   and surveying elements of Vincent’s alternative 3 and combine them with the communication   strategy of his alternative 1 To elaborate, I would hope that by the end of this discussion we might   obtain some consensus on a numerical long-run objective, possibly through a poll or survey of   participants If a consensus on a numerical objective were reached by this group, it could then—and   probably must be—expressed in the minutes   In trying to formulate what that description might look like, I found myself attracted to the   very carefully crafted language proposed by Governor Bernanke in his presentation at the St Louis   Fed’s 2003 conference on inflation targeting His suggested language states that “the FOMC   believes that the stated inflation rate is the one that best promotes its output, employment, and price   stability goals in the long run” He also proposed stating that “the FOMC regards this inflation rate   as a long-run objective only and sets no fixed time frame for reaching it  In particular, in deciding   how quickly to move toward the long-run inflation objective, the FOMC will always take into   account the implications for near-term economic and financial stability”  I think these provisos are   important in explaining to the public why the Committee endorses an inflation objective that actually   differs from true price stability  And, by emphasizing the potential for conflicts between price   stability and real economic performance, it highlights the Committee’s commitment to pursue not   just one but both parts of the dual mandate  I think the minutes should also note that the issue of an   appropriate numerical long-run objective would be revisited from time to time and that it might be   appropriate for the Committee to reappraise—although typically reaffirming, I expect—the inflation                 February 1-2, 2005 36 of 177  objective annually I view these steps as augmenting the status quo, but with a much clearer   expression of our views on optimal inflation   Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Twelfth District economy continues to   expand, posting growth in line with that of the nation Consumer spending remains strong, led by   gains in travel, services, retail goods, and especially housing Businesses have also been spending,   and our contacts expect to increase investment in coming months                        February 1-2, 2005 86 of 177  The weaker dollar continues to benefit District exporters who report booming demand for   their products Although international trade volumes remain high, increased hiring and around-the­  clock work schedules have cleared out the backlog of ships at our ports  Some bottlenecks remain in   the ground transportation networks as a result of storms, mudslides, and infrastructure problems but   these, too, are waning   Turning to the national economy, recent economic data have been encouraging, raising my   confidence that the expansion has found a secure footing The December employment report was by   no means spectacular, but it strengthened the impression that the labor market has firmly established   a pattern of moderate improvement  In terms of the outlook for the real economy, I’m generally in   agreement with the Greenbook  But I think it’s important to emphasize that this forecast, which   calls for growth only moderately above potential with a very gradual diminution of the remaining   labor market slack, depends on a very gradual pace of monetary tightening  The Greenbook   incorporates only three more 25 basis point increases in the funds rate this year  Moreover, even   with this modest tightening, I consider the Greenbook optimistic in expecting longer-term interest   rates to remain at their present levels  In my judgment, the risk with respect to longer-term yields is   asymmetric  Should longer-term yields increase, growth could fall well short of the Greenbook   projection, as shown in an alternative simulation   Turning to inflation, the data received since our December meeting, particularly the CPI and   the ECI, have been favorable The forecast for a rise of about 1½ percent in the core PCE price   index in 2005 strikes me as very reasonable  We’re all aware of the sources of risk in this outlook,   including the future paths of the dollar and oil prices, the currently high markup of prices over unit   labor costs, trend productivity growth, and, of course, the degree of slack left in the economy   In December I argued that the risks to inflation from productivity developments were   reasonably well balanced I hold roughly the same view on the risks emanating from labor market   slack and would like to focus the remainder of my comments on this issue                       February 1-2, 2005 87 of 177  A considerable body of research—most conducted within the Federal Reserve System—has   examined the possibility that the last recession and recovery were characterized by unusually large   structural shifts, resulting in an exceptional degree of mismatch in the labor market  If an unusually   small fraction of the currently unemployed are qualified for existing or emerging job vacancies, the   true degree of slack in the labor market is overstated by measured unemployment  In effect, the   NAIRU has risen This possibility motivates one of the alternative simulations in the Greenbook   At the AEA [American Economic Association] meetings in Philadelphia last month, I   chaired a session in which four teams of Fed economists subjected this structural-shifts hypothesis to   close scrutiny I emerged from this session a skeptic  I see this recent research as casting   considerable doubt on the hypothesis that the jobless recovery was a period of pronounced economic   restructuring In fact, the consensus of the session was that sectoral reallocation has probably been   running at roughly normal levels for our dynamic economy   The finding of unusually large sectoral shifts is based on the behavior of several   nontraditional measures of restructuring  In contrast, such traditional measures as the dispersion in   industry employment growth rates revealed the last recession and jobless recovery that followed to   be a period of low, not high, sectoral reallocation  The problem with traditional measures is that   they may confound cyclical with sectoral changes  The alternative restructuring measures, however,   turn out not to be robust to minor changes in the time period studied and the methodology used     One sign that mismatch is not unusually high, at least during the recovery period, comes   from data on job creation and job destruction  In 2003, for example, total job reallocation—defined   as the sum of job creation and destruction—stood at its lowest level in the last decade for which data   are available Another sign that mismatch is not especially high comes from the Beveridge curve   relating unemployment and job vacancies  A shifting out of the Beveridge curve, signaling higher   levels of vacancies coexisting with any given level of unemployment, would provide evidence of   increased mismatch  Using a new measure of job vacancies that adjusts for well-known biases in   help-wanted advertising, staff at our Bank, however, found no evidence of such an outward shift                          February 1-2, 2005 88 of 177  If skill mismatch had intensified, we might also expect to see diverging unemployment rates   and compensation paths for workers of different skills  However, analysis by our staff shows that   since the onset of the recession, the unemployment paths of less- and more-educated workers have   been similar, and the change in compensation growth for lower-skilled occupations has been at least   as rapid as for occupations requiring higher skills  These findings align with reports from our   contacts who tell us that for the most part they’re able to hire workers at all skill levels  Even in   markets where workers are harder to find, our contacts report little difference in hiring difficulty or   compensation growth by skill   With respect to the introduction of labor-saving technologies, our sense is that such   innovations are affecting the entire skill distribution For example, reports from two of our contacts,   a lawyer and a farmer, illustrate this point  We were told that the law firm had replaced skilled legal   workers with software designed to search for criminal evidence in e-mail files  The farm introduced   machinery that reduced the number of field workers needed to harvest row crops from 400 to 40    So, my bottom line is that I do not think the evidence supports the case that NAIRU has increased   due to an unusual degree of mismatch in the job market   Turning finally to policy, I think it makes sense to remove a bit more accommodation at this   meeting, but I do think we’re reaching a point where relatively soon we will need to begin to slow   this process down   I support your recommendation  "
7486,2005-03-22," Thank you, Mr Chairman  Little has changed in the Twelfth District   economy since we last met  It has continued to expand in line with the nation For that reason, I’ll   focus my remaining remarks on the national economy   The data we have received since late January have been remarkably consistent in their   upbeat message  Important indicators from the output side—employment in manufacturing   production, in particular—gained strength over the past couple of months  The same can be said of   most of the major components of domestic demand  The strength in orders and shipments for core   capital goods, despite the expiration of partial expensing, was particularly significant In the   Greenbook, all of this good news appears to show up mostly in the form of higher interest rates that   offset the upward pressure on growth in the second half of this year and in 2006   Developments that bear on productivity have also been heartening  First is the recent   upward revision to fourth-quarter productivity growth as well as estimates of continuing strength for   the current quarter Second, enhanced prospects for business investment in equipment and software   bode well for productivity in the future Finally, some of the signs of slowing in IT [information   technology] investment that were worrisome last year have moderated, although there is still reason   for some caution about the outlook  IT investment bounced back in the fourth quarter, and   production of high-tech industries has been strong in recent months  Taken together, these   developments helped to assuage concerns about a pronounced slowdown in productivity growth, and   I remain optimistic that advances in this area will continue to boost output growth and restrain   inflation   Of course, there are always risks Developments in oil markets are an obvious one, and bond   rates are another concern It is striking that, until recently, long-term rates were falling a bit, even as   policy tightened and short-term rates rose  The 10-year Treasury yield even now is below its level in                          March 22, 2005 42 of 116  June when the Committee first raised the funds rate, and this has led to considerable discussion of   whether term premiums have fallen to levels that are lower than can be justified by fundamentals  If   the term premium is abnormally low now, economic growth could be significantly dampened if the   term premium suddenly returns to more normal levels  And the risks here are nicely illustrated by   an alternative simulation in the Greenbook  For this reason, the low level of long-term interest rates   constitutes a downside real risk to the staff forecast   Our staff decided to examine this issue more closely  We looked at several model-based   approaches to explaining and estimating the term premium for 10-year Treasuries  All of the   approaches predict a lower average premium since at least 2001, compared to the average for the   1990s This result appears consistent with a number of macro developments, including reduced   volatility in interest rates, output, and inflation So a portion of the paradox of why bond rates are so   low may be that the term premium has declined for reasons that are justified by fundamentals   The element of risk for the outlook arises because the approaches we examined suggest that   the term premium is even lower than is justified by fundamentals  According to our estimates, long-  term rates still remain 30 to 60 basis points below the fundamentals-consistent level, even after the   run-up in long-term yields since the last FOMC meeting  Since our previous meeting, the 10-year   bond rate has risen by just under 40 basis points Using the approach that yielded the larger term   premium conundrum, our analysis suggests that about one-third—about 12 basis points—of the   intermeeting increase is due to the correction of the low term premium  The remaining two-thirds is   split between a higher path for expected future short-term real interest rates, presumably due to   strong economic news, and higher inflation expectations  The latter concern is reflected in an   increase since late January in inflation compensation, especially over the next few years  Part of this   increase is probably due to upside surprises in recent inflation data and part of it to increasing oil                    March 22, 2005 43 of 116  prices Our analysis suggests that oil developments might have raised 10-year inflation   compensation by less than 01 percent    To sum up, our estimates suggest that the term premium has probably increased moderately,   about 12 basis points, since our last meeting  But even so, the premium may remain as much as 60   basis points below normal, according to our estimates  Our analysis thus suggests that the risks for   the term premium on bond rates are asymmetric  While the Greenbook expectation of a relatively   flat path for bond rates through the end of next year may be a reasonable modal forecast, I don’t   think the risks here are balanced And, indeed, they seem to be on the side of restraint for demand     Of course, the recent news on inflation, and, in particular, the core PCE in January, was   disappointing And with oil prices rising further, it seems reasonable to raise the core PCE inflation   forecast through 2006 by a tenth or two, to just over 1½ percent But I do not think we should   overreact to January’s adverse inflation data, especially in light of the continued containment of   wages and salaries and evidence of even greater strength in actual and structural productivity growth   than previously assumed in the staff forecast   In my view, the policy situation has changed notably since the last meeting  We now see   stronger momentum in aggregate demand, importantly due to more robust investment spending and   slightly disappointing inflation data This means, as is implicit in the Greenbook forecast, that we   now appear to be further from the real short-term neutral funds rate than previously, and monetary   policy remains quite accommodative    What I would like to see today is for us to raise the funds rate by 25 basis points and retain   both the “measured pace” language and the characterization of policy as accommodative  At   present, I believe the Greenbook path and market expectations are quite well aligned and coincide   with my own view of the appropriate path for policy, given current information  In my view the                    March 22, 2005 44 of 116  term “measured pace” remains a good description of the likely path, and I would think it wise to act   to confirm market expectations today rather than upset them  I don’t think that retaining the   “measured pace” language eliminates the Committee’s flexibility to raise the funds rate by 50 basis   points if it does prove necessary Obviously, such a move would need to be justified by the strength   of incoming data, but with those data I believe the markets would have adjusted to the idea by the   time it became appropriate to implement it     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support your recommendation to raise the   federal funds rate 25 basis points I can also support alternative B, although I have significant   discomfort with the balance-of-risk statement in line 5  I agree with President Lacker’s comment   that it has now been made essentially meaningless and can’t stay there long   I would simply echo the opinion given by many people around this table that it is very   important that we continue to communicate our views and what we know about future policy  I like   the line 6 way of doing that Obviously, we have to change the language as circumstances change   and devise at some point an alternative to “measured,” but writing an English sentence or two to   explain where we think policy is going is, I think, the best thing to do And I think we need to do   that even when we get to the point where the expectation is that policy will remain unchanged and   we will be watching news to decide where we go from there   I’ve never been a fan of the balance-of-risk statement  I know there have been a number of   committees that have tried to look at how to revise it  I suppose it’s worth doing that again, but my   sense is—I agree with President Lacker—that it is fatally flawed  But I believe that communication   is very important and we should try to communicate in a less formulaic way  "
7510,2005-05-03," I have a question for David concerning investment  At our last meeting, I   certainly had the feeling that the outlook for the economy and for demand was a lot more robust than                                       May 3, 2005 18 of 116  I had previously thought, and the Greenbook reflected the same view  In large part that was based   on rejecting the pothole theory related to partial expensing for investment  We thought that there   would be a pothole in January It didn’t occur January data on orders were strong, and the staff   decided, I think, that there was a lot of momentum in investment spending  Certainly the   fundamentals seemed quite strong  But for February and March the data are really very weak It   seems to me that the response in the Greenbook this time is to stick with the view that the   fundamentals are strong and the investment spending outlook remains quite strong  There hasn’t   been a lot of downward revision there I wonder if you’d just talk about that a little bit  One   possibility might be that, in fact, January wasn’t a perfect test of partial expensing  Suppose that   firms could take advantage of that expensing provision if they placed an order by December 30    Maybe some orders were placed and didn’t actually show up in the December data  They might   have shown up in January I don’t know the details of how that series is constructed Another   possibility is that we may be learning from the February and March data that the outlook for   investment spending just isn’t as robust as we had thought, but it’s not because of partial expensing    In any event, it seems to me that there was not a lot of downward revision in the medium-term   forecast for investment spending  I just wondered if you would discuss your thinking   Not just ordered?   It’s a level effect   Thank you, Mr Chairman  It has been less than a year since I returned to   the policy table, but already there is a sense of déjà vu all over again [Laughter]   The recent pattern of higher inflation and softer spending seems remarkably similar to the   developments we witnessed late last spring and early summer—then, as now, after a spike in energy                                 May 3, 2005 42 of 116  prices The latest data on employment, retail sales, and durable goods orders reveal unanticipated   weakness on the real side of the economy  Readings on overall and especially core inflation have   been uncomfortably and unexpectedly high  If the current situation persists or deteriorates further,   we could face some difficult policy choices ahead, but I remain cautiously optimistic that the   slowdown in growth and the uptick in inflation will both prove transitory   I believe we can draw some lessons for assessing current conditions and for calibrating   policy going forward from last year’s experience  Last year’s jump in energy prices delivered a   significant shock to consumers and businesses  For a time, the growth of consumer spending slowed   and inflation increased But after the initial jolt, the growth of consumer spending and economic   growth overall rebounded Higher energy prices again have hit consumers hard in the pocketbook   and businesses on the bottom line, but there’s good reason to anticipate a similar recovery in   spending this year, especially with oil prices having come down of late  So the lesson from last   year’s experience is that we shouldn’t overreact to the present soft patch or short-run fluctuations in   real-side data when the fundamentals for growth appear to remain relatively sound    I, therefore, find myself in agreement with the Greenbook’s perspective  Beyond the current   quarter, the forecast has been revised only slightly, with the major components of demand projected   to continue expanding at a fairly healthy pace This forecast mirrors the perceptions of our Twelfth   District business contacts who, outside of the Bay Area and Los Angeles proper, report that they   remain quite upbeat about the economy   For inflation, last summer’s experience similarly advises a cautious policy reaction to the   data The recent uptick in core inflation probably reflects pass-through of cost pressures due to   higher energy, commodities, and import prices  If so, the upturn is apt to be transitory, since now,                                 May 3, 2005 43 of 116  just like last summer, underlying pressures on core inflation appear to remain subdued  Several of   the good fundamentals driving the outlook for inflation are worth highlighting   First, the data surveyed in Part 2 of the Greenbook suggest that at least some, and possibly   considerable, slack remains in labor markets  Corroborating this view, our contacts, even in some of   the most rapidly growing areas of the Twelfth District, report little trouble filling job openings   except in some skilled trades that are in high demand in construction  I met recently with top   executives of SBC West, a major employer in California and Nevada  They indicated no difficulties   whatever in hiring at any skill level, with only a few exceptions, such as accounting  Like most of   our contacts in the District, they also saw no significant wage pressures  Indeed, nationwide data   suggest that labor cost pressures appear quite restrained For example, as David noted, last week’s   ECI data showed no sign of any acceleration in private compensation   The underlying trend in productivity is also solid, and, as I discussed at a previous meeting, I   remain optimistic that it will remain so, in which case unit labor costs are likely to remain   constrained Our contacts report continued scope for productivity improvements  For example, the   SBC West executives with whom we met explained how new technologies permit tasks to be   performed via computers at headquarters that in the past required technicians to make service calls   Of course, “pricing power” is a phrase that is used frequently by our contacts, but the   mention of pricing power is focused exclusively on pass-through of cost increases due to energy,   materials, and transportation  In construction, agriculture, and transportation, firms report   considerable success in passing these cost increases along In other sectors, the experience has been   more mixed  One director who runs a major clothing retailer reported only limited pass-through to   consumer prices in the face of competitive pressures and continued gains in productivity  With   markups still high, firms should be able to absorb some cost increases without raising goods prices                                 May 3, 2005 44 of 116  Moreover, to the extent that these costs are being passed through to prices, they appear to provide   only one-time boosts to the price level   In terms of policy, I support a 25 basis point increase at this meeting and retaining the   “measured pace” description of the likely path for policy going forward, at least for today  Weak   real-side data might suggest a pause to evaluate the extent and likely duration of the slowdown  But   incoming inflation data could justify more aggressive action  Given the latest uncomfortably high   readings on inflation, I think we have to remain vigilant  The constancy of long-run inflation   expectations provides some reassurance, although I worry that if we had similar readings on such   expectations in the early 1970s, they would have been slow to rise then as well, as bond markets had   grown complacent about inflation   Last time, we adopted language that many of us thought made our balance-of-risk statement   tautological In fact, it turns out that the statement is not tautological, and I no longer consider it   true [Laughter] In my view, even with appropriate monetary policy action, the risk to the   attainment of sustainable growth is unbalanced to the downside, while the risk to the attainment of   price stability is unbalanced to the upside It is the risk to our dual objectives, but not to each   individual objective, that I consider balanced overall   Releasing an unchanged balance-of-risk statement might suggest to some that this   Committee has ignored the palpable shift in economic conditions toward higher inflation and slower   growth Indeed, an uncharitable description of the current statement is that it has gone from not   serving any purpose to potentially being perceived as factually incorrect Rather than try to modify   the balance-of-risk statement, I think it is perhaps time to retire it, for reasons that I will explain in   more detail in the policy go-round   Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support, of course, your proposal to raise the   federal funds rate 25 basis points, and I think the strategy that you suggest with respect to the   language in alternative B also has merit for today  It seems to me advantageous at this point to make                                 May 3, 2005 94 of 116  minimal changes in the statement, as alternative B does  I think market expectations are essentially   entirely sensible, and it does not make sense today to do a great deal to perturb those expectations   I think the policy path we’re on, as Don put it, likely has a positive slope I’m comfortable   with the term “measured pace” because I think it continues to indicate that whether we call policy   accommodative or somewhat accommodative, the likely direction of the federal funds rate is up, and   I think we ought to be communicating that  I believe that we retain considerable flexibility to pause   or to be more aggressive  We see that, as you pointed out, Mr Chairman, in the futures path as the   market responds to the news   So, I think we do have flexibility  But I agree with Governor Ferguson that we need an exit   strategy from this exit strategy, and my proposal is to get rid of the balance-of-risk statement    Maybe today is not the right day to do it, but as part of our ultimate exit strategy, which we may well   need at the next meeting, I would love to see that go  I feel that we do need to communicate   something about the future, but in my view crafting a simple English sentence or two to describe the   consensus on the Committee is the way to do it  To me the balance-of-risk statement was an attempt   to give hints about the future path of policy without saying anything about the funds rate directly but   instead about the determinants of policy  And I just don’t think that’s possible   I read President Poole’s memo and I understand the desirability of having standard language,   but we have a Committee that hasn’t obtained a consensus on the determinants of policy We don’t   have a common definition of maximum employment or price stability  We don’t have a common   view on the importance of forecasts or an agreement on relative values of gaps versus growth rates   in making those forecasts  Without that kind of consensus, we just can’t come up with a formulaic   assessment about the balance of risks  It might work for a couple of meetings, but then we’re going   to get ourselves in a situation where it will fail, and that’s where I feel we are today                                 May 3, 2005 95 of 116  So, going forward, it may be that the time to change this language is when we do pause and   no longer feel certain what the direction of policy is Maybe at that time a simple statement that says   something like this will be the sensible way to go  “Under current conditions, policy seems well   positioned to achieve our dual goals and we will respond, as needed, to fulfill our obligations to   foster price stability and sustainable economic growth”  "
7541,2005-06-29,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I just wanted to make a couple of comments   and also ask a quick question  My first comment relates to the run-up in price-rent ratios that we’ve                                    June 29-30, 2005 35 of 234  seen It seems to me that there might be a couple of factors that could explain at least some portion   of the run-up, though probably not all of it, that weren’t mentioned in the presentations   First, it seems to me that financial innovations affecting housing could have improved the   view of households regarding the desirability of housing as an asset to be held in portfolios and thus   raised the equilibrium price-to-rent relationship for residential real estate  What I’m thinking of is   the idea that equity held in residential real estate is a lot more accessible today than it has been in the   past  Home equity credit at commercial banks is up fourfold since 1999, and many households   obviously are now keenly aware that refinancing provides a low-cost avenue for tapping into the   equity in their homes  So, in a sense, there might be less of a liquidity premium embodied in the   return for housing  Also, if people feel that the liquidity constraints in holding housing as an asset   are diminishing, that could explain a reduced need for precautionary saving in traditional liquid   assets It could even make people willing to put more of their wealth into down payments on   houses and may have raised prices through that mechanism   The other thing that occurred to me is that there might be effects from tax changes  We’ve   had changes in the rules for tax exemption and in 1997 on capital gains from the sale of primary   residences that would make holding real estate assets more attractive  And the changes in capital   gains taxes more generally in 1997 and then again in 2003 would have worked in the same   direction   One of the things that we looked at that we thought was interesting was the behavior of   price-rent ratios for residential housing and for commercial office space  Commercial office space   price-rent ratios are highly cyclical—I guess they always have been—but it appears that the   behavior of price-rent ratios in residential housing has closely mirrored what we’ve seen in   commercial office space  The ratios for both have gone up about 30 to 35 percent since around                                   June 29-30, 2005 36 of 234  1998, though the dynamics are totally different  Commercial office space rents have been falling—   it’s not that the prices have been rising—but the price-rent ratios have moved very similarly   A second comment I wanted to make concerns the relationship of creative finance to the   housing market  One view that I think is very prevalent is that the use of credit in the form of   piggyback loans, interest-only mortgages, option ARMs [adjustable-rate mortgages], and so forth,   involves financial innovations that are feeding a kind of unsustainable bubble  But an alternative   perspective on that is that high house prices, in fact, are curtailing effective demand for housing at   this point and that house appreciation probably is poised to slow  So the increasing use of creative   financing could be a sign of the final gasps of house-price appreciation at the pace we’ve seen and   an indication that a slowing is at hand  Previously, lenders applied very rigid constraints on loan-to­  value ratios, but essentially those constraints are now being eased at the margin through these   creative financing techniques  And that’s providing some elasticity to what was a firm roof  It may   slightly diminish the price elasticity of the demand for housing, but the fact that it is blossoming   now basically suggests that we really are at the ceiling where it’s binding and will ultimately   constrain appreciation   Finally, with those two comments, a question  It concerns the presentation by Andreas and   the numbers cited on loan-to-value ratios at origination  One of the things we’re seeing in   California and elsewhere in our District—and maybe this is true nationwide—is a growing use of   piggyback loans Loan-to-value ratios of 90 to 95 percent are common in California, and we’ve   even seen combination loan-to-value ratios and piggyback loans going up to 125 percent  I guess   that means two things, one of which is that the traditional first mortgage looks utterly conventional   Those mortgages have an 80 percent loan-to-value ratio and I suppose they are being sold off to   Fannie and Freddie  The other thing is that with such conventional mortgages being sold to Fannie                                                    June 29-30, 2005 37 of 234  and Freddie, there’s no need for private mortgage insurance  So Fannie’s and Freddie’s books may   look better in some sense—less risky—than they really are because of all of the second mortgages   going up to possibly 125 percent    Yes So I wondered if that was something that you’re aware of and   something that is included in the numbers    Thank you, Mr Chairman  At our last FOMC meeting, I worried about a   slowdown in growth and a pickup in inflation  I hypothesized and hoped that both would prove   transitory  On the whole, I consider recent data reassuring that the soft patch in the spring was just   that—maybe not even that—and not a precursor of a more entrenched slowdown   While the Greenbook subscribes to the view that the slowdown in growth was transitory, the   staff has made an upward revision, by a couple of tenths, to its forecast for core PCE inflation for   this year and next year, now projecting inflation of about 2 percent in both years  I’m a bit less   pessimistic on inflation than the staff  Recent data on core inflation have been pretty good of late    Moreover, I see the fundamentals—namely, the pressures on future inflation—as providing room on   balance for some optimism  The most worrisome factor is that oil prices have risen further,   although this should tend to boost core inflation more this year than next year   As David noted, the recent jump in compensation per hour should probably be discounted,   since it appears to be due to one-time factors  On the encouraging side, I see a noticeable decline—   about 17 basis points—in inflation compensation at both the 5- and 10-year horizons, high markups,   an appreciation in the dollar, a leveling off of commodity prices, very modest increases in the ECI,   still rather robust structural productivity growth, and some indications of remaining slack                           June 29-30, 2005 132 of 234  The situation with regard to slack, as David noted and emphasized, is complicated because   the unemployment rate is relatively low, near most estimates of NAIRU  But several other   measures, as he pointed out and as we also routinely monitor—including the employment-to­  population ratio, capacity utilization, the output gap, and the other indicators that David showed   us— do suggest that slack remains    One final point on the inflation outlook is that one of the best forecasters of future inflation   is past inflation  And I’m told that this is a point that was emphasized at a special topic session a   couple of years ago On this score, things look fairly good, with core PCE price inflation at 17   percent over the past 12 months   While I guess I can and have quibbled a bit about the inflation outlook for the next year,   overall I think the Greenbook forecast seems reasonable  Real GDP appears poised to grow just   slightly above its potential rate, gradually eliminating remaining slack  And core inflation, while   currently near the upper end of my comfort zone, at least to me seems likely to moderate a bit over   the next few years   The Greenbook forecast depicts an almost textbook scenario of an economy continuing   along the path toward a rather attractive steady state  Going forward, there are obviously some   sizable risks, and I count the unwinding of possible house and bond market bubbles as one or two   that are high on my list  But I think the most likely outcome is—as in the Greenbook projection—   that we will continue to move in a positive direction over the next couple of years  And given what   we now know, I think the funds rate path assumed in the Greenbook, which is very close to the   market’s current view, is appropriate  That is, we are likely to need to raise rates a couple more   times before slowing the pace of tightening rather substantially  And I want to emphasize that, in   my view, the well-calibrated monetary policy we’ve had has played an important role in keeping the                                      June 29-30, 2005 133 of 234  economy moving along this textbook path during a period characterized by some quite difficult   circumstances   I know that Monday’s pre-FOMC briefing emphasized that economic activity has been   burdened by some major drags over the past year or so  These include the oil shock, the   deterioration in the trade balance, and the still low level of investment spending relative to GDP    The result is that we’ve had to keep interest rates exceptionally low for a long time, just to get   respectable economic growth  In fact, respectable and not stellar growth is all we have gotten, even   with exceptionally low long-term yields and unexpectedly rapid gains in house prices  And those   are two factors that, on their own, would be working to push up the equilibrium real funds rate    So the merely respectable growth in the economy has really rested on the backs of just a few   interest rate-sensitive sectors  business investment, consumer durables, and housing  From that   perspective, it’s really not all that surprising that house prices have risen a great deal, and it’s not   surprising to hear our directors and other contacts comment that liquidity is abundant and that   lending is taking place for deals that one of our directors simply characterized as “stupid”  I think   he meant by historical standards  [Laughter]  My point is that to offset the drags, we’ve needed to   give the economy a strong dose of stimulus, which inevitably boosted the housing sector—and that   just to get reasonable economic growth  That is equivalent to saying that the equilibrium real fed   funds rate is unusually low—14 percent in the Greenbook path    So, for me, the policy imperative that follows is that we need to be careful not to overdo the   pace of policy tightening  I noted that in recent months several FOMC members have commented   that we usually know we’ve come to the end of the tightening phase when we have tightened one or   two times too many  I think we should be especially attentive to this concern this time around,   because the expansion does depend so heavily on just a couple of interest-sensitive sectors  And                                     June 29-30, 2005 134 of 234  John Williams’s analysis yesterday highlighted the fact that if house and/or bond prices fall, the zero   bound could become an issue we would be discussing again     To conclude, I’m all for raising the funds rate by 25 basis points at this meeting, and I   believe the language in the press release should seek to maintain the path for the expected fed funds   rate that now exists in the market  My worry is that unless we’re careful in crafting the language as   we raise the rate today—and likely again in August—markets will start to build in more increases in   subsequent months than they have so far  I think we are nearing the point when we will need to   start pausing, and I hope we can maintain that expectation in the market in the period ahead       Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation  Like President Fisher, I’m   concerned about the language describing inflation  I think it will be somewhat of a surprise to the                      June 29-30, 2005 169 of 234  market, which is taking some comfort from recent inflation data, and it may well perturb   expectations upward  But I support the recommendation  "
7565,2005-08-09," My comment concerned the nonmarket portion of the core PCE and its   revisions, and you’ve covered much of what I wanted to get at in your answer to the Chairman  I   don’t want to belabor the point, but I will spend just a minute on it     In looking at this very large revision in the nonmarket component, I naturally ask myself   whether or not this should change our interpretation of what inflation was in 2004  Is the                    August 9, 2005 27 of 110  character of the revision one that suggests we’ve received additional data telling us that inflation,   indeed, was higher than we thought?  Or is its character more that of a methodological   revision—that is, we have no new data but have processed it differently, and now we’re   changing the yardstick or the ruler we use to measure something?   My interpretation—and I’d like to make sure that you agree with it—is the former  I   believe it’s more of the character of having received new data that told us, with an unchanged   measurement tool, that inflation in 2004 was higher  For the hospital insurance and medical care   component, an analyst made a programming error, and that led to an underreporting of true   inflation in that component in 2004  And in the noncommercial bank, or other financial sector   component, an analyst built in an assumption—I think probably largely about mutual funds—   that the pricing of mutual fund services would be declining over time  But when BEA looked at   the data, they discovered that was a terrible assumption and that it had not occurred  So, that has   the character of new data indicating that what was built into the index was wrong  Therefore,   inflation in the nonmarket component, which I think is 18 percent of the overall core PCE, really   was higher than we thought and there’s no reason to ignore it  At least those were the major   parts of the revision   I admit that there’s something arbitrary about the methodology that is   used But the change we see is not due to a change in the methodology for assessing the truth    One could use a different methodology  The change is akin to new information that, given a   fixed methodology, tells us that inflation was really worse in 2004 than we thought   Thank you, Mr Chairman  Recent data, including the benchmark   revisions, have altered my perception of the economic scene noticeably  We now see more   underlying strength in economic activity relative to potential through the second quarter and into   July The July employment report suggests that job growth has also gained momentum, and   developments in a broad range of financial markets suggest that market participants share this   assessment  The Greenbook, sensibly, has raised its assumed path for the funds rate to bring   growth next year back to the pace of potential     The inflation picture is clouded up in both senses of the word  It is unclear and also a bit   foreboding The picture is a bit foreboding because the benchmark revision boosts inflation as   measured by the core PCE to 19 percent over the last 12 months, which is at the top of my   comfort zone It’s unclear, because our two main inflation gauges are now giving different   readings on the performance of inflation over the last year, although both, fortunately, suggest   that inflation has been relatively tame over the past several months  With a normal gap of about   ½ percentage point over the core PCE, the 21 percent increase in the core CPI, in contrast,   presents a rather benign inflation picture                   August 9, 2005 38 of 110  Of course, the issue for policy is not so much where inflation was in the past but, rather,   where it is headed Given the unusually small and likely transitory gap between the two   measures of core inflation, we tried to break through some of the cloudiness associated with this   divergence in signals by examining statistically which measure typically does most of the   adjusting to bring the spread back into line  A finding that the CPI typically does most of the   adjusting would be bad news A finding that the PCE price index normally bears the brunt of the   adjustment would be good news  Unfortunately, we found few statistical regularities  Both   measures have taken the lead at different times, so we can’t count on either one to provide a   reasonable signal at the present time   Moving from actual inflation outcomes to the pressures affecting inflation going forward,   it seems likely that higher oil prices are being passed through to core inflation to some extent    So unless they rise further, the effect on core inflation should begin to dissipate next year    Unfortunately, I think I also said the same thing at our June meeting, and they did rise again   Another risk relates to unit labor costs, which have risen notably over the past year after   several years of little or no change  This partly reflects slower, although still robust, productivity   growth Insofar as the decline in productivity growth has been cyclical rather than structural, our   analysis, and that of other researchers, suggests that it will have little effect on inflation  In other   words, it is structural productivity growth and trend unit labor costs that mainly drive inflation    It would take a drop in structural productivity growth to boost inflation   As discussed in the Greenbook, the recent benchmark revisions probably do warrant a   modest decrease in our estimates of structural productivity growth, which does add to inflation   pressures, making the outlook a bit less favorable than I originally thought  Nevertheless, it is                         August 9, 2005 39 of 110  encouraging that, even after a downward adjustment, productivity still seems to be growing   somewhat faster than the robust rates achieved in the second half of the ’90s   I’m less concerned about inflation pressures emanating from the other component of   labor costs, namely, labor compensation  Although compensation per hour jumped recently, this   appears to be due to one-time factors and thus should be discounted  This interpretation is   supported by the smaller increase reported in this morning’s release on the second quarter and   from readings from the employment cost index, which excludes these items and has shown only   modest increases   Furthermore, recent increases in labor compensation could be part of the process by   which labor’s share of GPD is returning to more normal levels, following a period of unusually   rapid growth in profits that has been pushing up capital’s share This interpretation is supported   by recent econometric work by our staff suggesting that transitory deviations of the markup from   its mean are typically unwound over time by movements in labor compensation, not inflation   Indeed, our contacts are telling us that in the absence of much pricing power, increases in   labor costs are hurting their bottom lines The increased pressure on margins appears to have   reinvigorated the search for productivity gains  For example, a natural gas drilling company in   our District just installed chips in all of its wells that alert a central control when a well is down    With this technology the firm has been able to shed workers who check the wells manually, and   it has decreased the down time of wells in the network   So for all of these reasons, I’m inclined to think that inflationary concerns about unit   labor costs should be focused more on possible changes in structural productivity growth than   long-term labor compensation                August 9, 2005 40 of 110  Another source of inflationary pressure relates to slack in the labor market  In my view, a   whisker of slack probably still remains, but on balance there is probably less than we saw in   June Of course, the unemployment rate remained at 5 percent in July, but other measures, such   as the employment-population ratio, a survey of job market perceptions, and industrial capacity   utilization now signal a bit less slack   So, overall, the economy is noticeably stronger than seemed likely in June  Some of the   slack that remained at that time has been eliminated, and the trajectory for inflation has shifted   up a bit The market’s expectations concerning the degree of Fed tightening have increased, as   have longer-term yields  I consider it obvious that we should continue on the path of raising the   funds rate, and I’m comfortable with the wording in Alternative B   Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation and agree with the   rationale that you gave for it  "
7587,2005-09-20," Thank you, Mr Chairman   It goes without saying that the devastation   caused by Hurricane Katrina has elicited a deep sense of empathy in our District  In terms of the             September 20, 2005 51 of 117  economic effects, we’re paying special attention to energy and international trade  So far, at   least, the effects on the Twelfth District economy appear to have been muted   Since the end of August, retail gasoline prices are up about 30 cents per gallon on the   West Coast, less than elsewhere in the nation  There was some early concern that Gulf Port   cargo would be diverted to the West Coast, creating bottlenecks or significantly increasing   shipping costs, but these concerns have largely dissipated   Our contacts remain fairly optimistic about the prospects for the regional economy but   are very concerned about the future path of energy prices, especially since Hurricane Katrina    Even before the hurricane, they were worried that higher gasoline prices and impending   increases in home heating expenses would curb consumer demand  Indeed, PG&E, the public   utility for northern California, just announced that rising natural gas prices could drive home   heating costs in the area up by as much as 40 percent this winter  Discount retailers in the   District expect these increases to put a dent in holiday spending  In addition, higher fuel prices   already have trickled into prices for building materials, and contacts expect post-hurricane   rebuilding efforts to boost those prices further and lengthen queues on some orders   Turning to the national economy, I share the Greenbook’s assessment of the near-term   impact of Hurricane Katrina on economic growth Pre-Katrina, the outlook was for very strong   growth in the second half of 2005  It now seems likely that second-half growth will be   substantially reduced due to the disruptions to production in the Gulf region and the negative   impact of the run-up in energy prices on consumer spending  Of course, over this time frame   there’s little that monetary policy can do to affect actual outcomes                            September 20, 2005 52 of 117  While the proposed policy statement associated with alternative B acknowledges   increased uncertainty about economic performance in the near term, I believe that the   uncertainties associated with the medium-term outlook have also risen substantially, and risks   now exist that in my view pose a clear and persistent threat  On the upside, rebuilding   commitments are escalating by the day  The recovery and bounceback fueled by massive fiscal   stimulus could more than make up for the slowdown this winter, propelling the economy on an   unsustainable upward trajectory similar to the optimistic scenario laid out in the Greenbook    But downside risks to growth also loom  Rebuilding schedules could easily slip   Moreover, the pace of restarting closed oil and natural gas platforms and rigs in the Gulf of   Mexico has leveled off, and the prognosis for restarting the remaining closed facilities as well as   refineries and natural gas treatment plants remains in question  If disruptions persist or further   shocks to supply occur, the economy could develop more along the lines of the pessimistic   scenario in the Greenbook Moreover, we may not yet have seen the full brunt on spending of   the pre-Katrina energy price increases  It’s sobering to note that in the postwar period, the US   economy has rarely escaped such severe run-ups in oil prices without suffering a significant   downturn   Turning to inflation, I was quite concerned at our August meeting by the elevated rate of   core PCE inflation, which was skirting the top of my comfort zone  Since that meeting, I’ve   become more confident that core inflation remains well contained  Recent data on core price   inflation have been encouraging Core PCE prices have risen at a 1½ percent rate over the six   months through July, right in the middle of my preferred range, and core CPI inflation has also   been well behaved I’m also encouraged by readings on wage growth from the employment cost                       September 20, 2005 53 of 117  index and from the household survey, a series that our research staff has recently started   compiling and tracking  These remain remarkably subdued  The elevated rate of growth in   compensation per hour from the productivity and cost report over the past year far exceeds the   readings provided by these other series and may be more an outlier than a strong signal of tight   labor markets and wage pressures   While my comfort level with respect to core inflation has improved since August, the   Board’s staff has raised the Greenbook forecast of core PCE price inflation in 2006 by 02 of a   percentage point to 23 percent due to the run-up in energy prices since the August meeting  I   must say that I actually found the low-inflation alternative simulation in the Greenbook more   compelling  This scenario assumes that inflation expectations remain well anchored, and it   shows core inflation falling over the next two years, reaching 1½ percent in 2007   On that point, the relative stability of longer-term break-even inflation rates derived from   the TIPS market this year, even as oil prices surged, provides evidence that the public remains   confident in the Committee’s commitment to price stability  Of course, the jump in inflation   expectations seen in this month’s preliminary Michigan survey was worrisome, but we must be   cautious not to read too much into that report since it was taken so soon after Katrina   To assess the likely pass-through of energy into core consumer inflation, our staff has   estimated Phillips curve type forecasting models akin to those employed at the Board  An   important finding emerges  Changes in real oil prices did have an economically and statistically   significant effect on core inflation, but only up to the early 1980s  Importantly for the current   situation, they find no evidence of such a relationship in the data since the early ’80s  The   critical difference between the pre- and post-1980s experience probably relates to the public’s                            September 20, 2005 54 of 117  inflation expectations  During the 1970s, they became unmoored from price stability but now   appear to be well anchored, as in the Greenbook’s low inflation scenario   With respect to policy, I support a 25 basis point rate increase rather than a pause today    A pause at this meeting justified by a need to further assess Katrina’s impact would be sensible if   we actually expected to know a lot more about the medium-term outlook by November, but   that’s unlikely to be the case A pause could counterproductively mislead market participants   about the likely future path of policy or create the misimpression that the Fed is unduly   pessimistic about the outlook  So I consider it wiser to stick with our “measured pace” approach   for now I think it’s well justified by the Greenbook forecast, uncertain as it is, and consistent   with market expectations  But going forward, we obviously need to be flexible and adjust our   views about where we’re ultimately heading on the basis of new data and forecasts   I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman, and I agree with   Governor Kohn that it is the right thing to do in spite of the greatly increased uncertainty  "
7609,2005-11-01,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  At our last meeting I was optimistic that we   would avoid a brush with stagflation despite the higher energy prices and the setback in production   from Katrina  Developments during the intermediate period have generally reinforced my                                      November 1, 2005 35 of 114  optimistic view  Although considerable uncertainty still clouds the outlook, I regard reports on both   real economic activity and inflation to be generally encouraging   On the real side, it now appears more likely that the disruptions caused by the hurricanes will   be transitory  Oil and wholesale gasoline prices, for example, have fallen below their August levels   before Katrina  Furthermore, rebuilding has been gathering steam quickly, and spending outside of   the Gulf region remains robust  In the Greenbook, the effect of this encouraging news about the   underlying vigor of the economy has been held in check by the assumption of tighter financial   conditions, so the path for GDP is little revised   With respect to the prospects for inflation, I remain more optimistic than the baseline   Greenbook projection  David suggested in his remarks that it was possible to make a case for   inflation doing better than the Greenbook projection, and I will pursue that case now  Certainly, the   latest data have been favorable  Over the six months ending in September, the core CPI increased   only 13 percent at an annual rate, while the core PCE price index was up 15 percent  These data   raise the question Where is the energy price pass-through?  PCE energy prices have been rising at   double digit rates for more than a year, but they have left remarkably little imprint on core inflation   At our last meeting, I described some econometric evidence showing that since the early   1980s, changes in real oil prices have not had an appreciable effect on core inflation  Today I   thought I would cite some reports from our business contacts that appear to be generally in line with   this result They do note that there has been some success in passing energy cost increases down the   supply chain but, given competitive pressures and the lack of pricing power, they tell us that the   buck usually stops before the consumer   I thought I would give you an example inspired by the season  A large pumpkin grower/   processor [laughter] near Portland has seen a 20 percent jump in the price of plastic packaging                                        November 1, 2005 36 of 114  materials  She reports that she can pass these costs on to the small retailers she serves, but they are   not able to charge consumers more for retail pumpkin products  So this Thanksgiving you need not   worry about paying more for your pumpkin pies  Obviously, forecasting beyond that is hazardous,   but looking out toward Christmas, I thought I would note that one of the country’s largest growers   of poinsettias is on our Advisory Council, and he is highly confident that there will be little pass-  through of energy costs into retail poinsettia prices  [Laughter]   Also in contrast to the Greenbook, I see no significant pressure for higher inflation coming   from increased inflation expectations  In particular, despite the surge in energy costs this year,   current estimates of inflation compensation, both over the next five years and the subsequent five-  year period, remain at the same average level that prevailed during the first half of this year  A   further sign that inflation expectations remain well contained can be found in the continued subdued   growth of wages and salaries  Last Friday’s reading on the ECI [Employment Cost Index] I thought   revealed no evidence of any pass-through of higher headline inflation or higher inflation   expectations to labor compensation  So I see no indication of the ’70s style wage-price spiral in the   offing   Overall, I judge our credibility to be very much intact  Of course, our credibility going   forward does depend on continued vigilance  The economy now appears to be close to full   employment, with a good deal of momentum  And annual core inflation, at least as judged by the   core PCE measure, remains near the upper end of my comfort zone and, arguably, inflation risks are   tilted somewhat to the upside  So with respect to policy, I support at a minimum the removal of any   remaining policy accommodation  The Bluebook shows that the funds rate has finally entered a   broad zone of plausible neutral rates, but under the circumstances, I personally would be more                         November 1, 2005 37 of 114  comfortable with a policy position toward the center of this zone  So a few more increases,   including one today, seem to me likely to be required   In implementing monetary policy, it seems to me that actions matter, but so do words, and I   wanted to briefly open up the question of the statement  I think for today the words of alternative B   should suffice, but Vincent has repeatedly suggested, and a number of you have emphasized, that   we need to consider how to modify the statement language  Several elements of this statement have   expiration dates that are quickly approaching  So I think it’s an important issue for us to discuss     As we go forward, I see three problems with using the kind of language that is in alternative   B First, it refers to policy accommodation, which will arguably soon be exhausted  Second, it   refers to a “measured pace,” when at some point presumably we will reach a stopping point in this   tightening cycle  And, third, it now contains a near-tautological balance of risk statement that I   think serves no obvious policy purpose  Of course, these three problems could be fixed at different   meetings  For example, if the inflation picture sours, the “measured pace” language could continue   to be used well past the elimination of the policy accommodation phrase  As Governor Gramlich   feared, the balance of risk statements could outlive us all!  [Laughter]   Still, trying to fix all of these three problems at once has some appeal, and I thought that   alternative C did just that  It eliminates the balance of risk statement and the policy accommodation   language; and it substitutes a new forward-looking policy statement for the “measured pace”   phrasing My main criticism of alternative C is that it jettisons any mention of the conditionality of   our actions on future data, and I believe such conditionality is always worth highlighting and   particularly deserving of emphasis now, toward the end of our tightening cycle   I believe that a good model for future statements would have three sections a policy decision,   a descriptive rationale, and a bit of forward-looking policy guidance  The policy guidance should                                 November 1, 2005 38 of 114  be nuanced—tailored to prevailing circumstances and explicitly conditional—and it should not   include a formulaic balance of risk statement  Let me give a concrete example based on alternative   C If the Committee believes, for example, that further tightening remains necessary once policy is   no longer accommodative, it could state, following the rationale section, that “under these   conditions the Committee perceives that further policy firming is likely to be necessary,” or “will be   necessary,” or “might be necessary”  “Nonetheless, the Committee will respond to any changes in   economic prospects to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability and foster sustainable growth”   Once the Committee feels that further tightening is not necessary, it could state that “under   these conditions the Committee perceives that the current stance of monetary policy will likely   remain appropriate going forward  Nonetheless, the Committee will respond to any changes in   economic prospects, and so forth, to fulfill its obligations”  In any case, I hope that this proposal   might be useful in jump-starting our discussion of these issues    Vincent, I have a question that concerns alternative C in Table 1    Currently, the only part of the FOMC statement that the Committee votes on is the balance of risk   section, and that now includes the forward-looking “measured pace” language  My sense is that, to   the extent we continue to have forward-looking language in the statement, it’s something the   Committee should vote on  But in looking at alternative C, what you did there was to move the   forward-looking language into the descriptive rationale part of the statement, which in my   understanding is not subject to a vote  To me there’s a governance issue there that I find troubling,   and I wondered if you would comment on it Was your expectation in alternative C that the   forward-looking language would not be voted on?  Or do you envision the Committee voting on the   entire statement?  So, my question has to do with governance     Is there a reason why the vote now does not cover the rationale sentences?                               November 1, 2005 84 of 114   Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation for the policy move and also   the statement today And I look forward to more detailed discussions about revising the statement   going forward  "
7631,2005-12-13,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Incoming data since our last meeting have been   quite encouraging  Economic growth over the next few quarters should be boosted by rebuilding and   the full return of energy production in the Gulf  As rebuilding winds down and the lagged effects of   monetary policy tightening take hold, it seems plausible that growth will slow toward potential,   keeping unemployment around the current level of 5 percent, the scenario envisioned in the   Greenbook   The economy’s remarkable resilience in the face of devastating hurricanes and three years of   rising energy prices suggest that the expansion has gained footing and no longer needs support from   monetary policy accommodation  Instead, a key issue facing us over the next few meetings is                                     December 13, 2005 35 of 100  whether policy might actually need to move to a restrictive stance in order to forestall inflationary   pressures   I will therefore focus my attention on the factors affecting the inflation outlook  To do that,   we need to look first at the here and now and remind ourselves that recent readings on core prices   have consistently come in at or below expectations  There are no signs of acceleration  In fact, core   PCE [personal consumption expenditures] price inflation has slowed over the past year; the most   recent reading of 18 percent over the past twelve months is down 03 from the preceding year  And   the downward inflation trend has continued through this year, with core PCE inflation running at only   16 percent over the past six months, which is about the middle of my preferred range  Of course,   even though recent core inflation data look pretty darn good, there may be forces at work that could   undermine price stability  In my remaining remarks, I’d like to comment on some factors that could   push inflation higher and consider their likely effects in the current situation   The first risk to price stability is that, contrary to the Greenbook forecast, growth may not   actually subside toward potential  So labor and product markets could tighten further, pushing   unemployment below NAIRU, which current estimates place around 5 percent  This possibility is   illustrated in the stronger aggregate demand scenario in the Greenbook  That simulation shows that   monetary policy would, of course, need to tighten  But the inflation consequences would be modest,   given a reactive Taylor rule monetary policy response  So to deal with this risk, it seems to me that   policy need not be preemptive   A sustained slowdown in productivity growth would pose a more challenging dilemma for   policy and the inflation outlook  Fortunately, however, productivity growth over the past year has not   slowed  Quite the contrary, it has been surprisingly robust  Output per hour in the nonfarm business   sector grew more than 3 percent over the past year, beating out previous estimates of structural                            December 13, 2005 36 of 100  productivity growth of around 2¾ percent  As I discussed at our meeting a year ago, I think there are   compelling reasons why productivity growth may well remain elevated for some time, having to do   with the gradual diffusion of new technologies and workplace practices throughout the economy    Therefore, I concur with the staff’s conclusion that the accumulated evidence indicates that structural   productivity growth is around 3 percent and with the corresponding upward revision in the outlook for   actual productivity  Given the sluggish adjustment of wages to changes in productivity, the stronger   path of productivity reduces the rate of growth of unit labor costs, putting downward pressure on   inflation  So productivity trends suggest a tempering of inflationary pressures, not an intensification   Energy prices also pose a potential threat to inflation  But as I argued a few meetings back,   the empirical evidence does not support significant pass-through of energy prices into core inflation  I   won’t repeat those arguments today but simply note, once again, that core PCE inflation has actually   moderated, despite a nearly 30 percent increase in energy prices over the past year, on top of a 15   percent rise in the previous year  Moreover, energy prices on the whole have come down sharply of   late, and, therefore, the risk of significant pass-through to core inflation has moderated as well     In addition, it appears that the Fed’s credibility has held up well this year, despite the supply   shocks associated with higher energy prices and hurricanes  Survey measures of longer-run inflation   expectations are about where they stood before the storms  Longer-run inflation expectations based   on Treasury securities have come down about ¼ percentage point since the last FOMC meeting and   are now below levels of a year ago   Finally, it’s possible that wage growth could accelerate, putting upward pressure on the   growth of unit labor costs and inflation  And, indeed, the Greenbook forecast projects exactly such an   acceleration, reflecting lagged pass-through of earlier increases in both energy prices and productivity   into wages In particular, the Greenbook forecasts that hourly compensation, as measured by the                                December 13, 2005 37 of 100  employment cost index, will increase 42 percent in 2006, following a 3 percent gain this year  It   projects an even larger—17 percentage point—acceleration in compensation per hour in the nonfarm   business sector   To gauge the likelihood of such an acceleration in compensation, my staff examined the pass-  through of energy prices and productivity into wages  They used forecasting models in which wage   inflation is determined by lagged wage inflation, price inflation, productivity growth, and the   unemployment rate  Now, it turns out that when the sample period used in the analysis includes the   1970s, our empirical work finds clear evidence of pass-through from energy prices into compensation    But when the sample begins in the 1980s, pass-through effects from energy prices to compensation   are dramatically weaker or insignificant  This result is consistent with the finding I reported   previously  There is no real evidence that energy prices pass through to core consumer inflation since   the early 1980s  With respect to the pass-through of productivity growth into compensation, our staff   finds evidence of only very gradual pass-through regardless of the sample period  Going forward, our   models predict significantly less increase in compensation growth than the Greenbook over the 2006­  2007 forecast horizon  We conclude from this empirical work that an increase in inflation due to a   sharp acceleration in compensation growth is, at most, an upside risk to inflation and not the most   probable outcome   I opened my remarks by noting that a key issue facing us over the next few meetings is   whether policy needs to move to a restrictive stance in order to forestall inflationary pressures  While   we must obviously remain vigilant and respond to developments that threaten price stability, the   evidence that we have at this time, in my opinion, points to relatively low and stable inflation going   forward  Moreover, history teaches us that it is not easy to foresee the point at which past policy                                   December 13, 2005 38 of 100  tightening takes hold and the economy reaches a turning point  Therefore, it’s important that we keep   the lags of monetary policy actions in mind in our deliberations and not go too far    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support a 25 basis point increase today and I   also support the language in alternative B  It seems to me that the framework in “B” maintains  its   existing form and also offers forward-looking guidance  I think we’ve had a very constructive   process, much to my surprise, in the way 19 people have taken turns at drafting a statement that has   evolved really quite nicely  The statement has the potential to evolve further next month and in   March; we’ve already discussed ways in which it can evolve—by eliminating “some,” changing “is   likely” to “may,” or possibly excluding “measured”   For today, I guess I’m comfortable keeping “measured”  I think there are arguments on both   sides of it  I think it is important to signal that we have no intention of doing something more   aggressive than a 25 basis point move  On the downside, as President Pianalto said, when you   combine “measured” with “is likely” and simultaneously remove “accommodation,” markets may                                      December 13, 2005 87 of 100  conclude that we have in mind at least two more steps, maybe more  And potentially removing   “accommodative” may signal that we intend to go beyond neutral into a restrictive stance   But it’s really hard to interpret how the markets are going to react to this  And frankly, I think   this statement comes as close as we can get to doing what I would like to see today, which is to   essentially validate the expectations that are currently in the markets and in the Greenbook  Those   expectations are that we are highly likely or almost certain to move another 25 basis points next time   and that what we will do in March and beyond is an open question  I think this is not a statement that   is likely to bring long-term rates down, although we will see shortly    On the issue of asset prices, I would simply second the comments that Governor Kohn made   about them  It’s a topic for greater discussion in the future  "
7654,2006-01-31,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Recent data on economic activity, as   summarized by the fourth-quarter GDP figure, have been surprisingly weak  But there are good   January 31, 2006 31 of 106    reasons to believe that much of the softness will prove temporary, so I tend to agree with the   Greenbook and other forecasts in expecting a rather sharp rebound in the current quarter   That said, I want to sound a note of caution  This view is based on incomplete data for the   fourth quarter and a paucity of information concerning activity in the first quarter  It is not   inconceivable that the weak numbers for the fourth quarter could presage a more-prolonged,   sluggish phase as the lagged effects of past policy tightening and higher oil prices take effect  This   caution is heightened by my concern that the economy faces some pretty big downside risks,   especially having to do with the interrelated issues of possible overvaluations in housing markets   and low term premiums in bond markets  These risks are highlighted by the alternative simulations   in the Greenbook concerning a rise in the saving rate and a higher term premium  In summary, I see   the Greenbook’s view of real activity for this year as very reasonable, but downside risks to that   forecast give me pause   Turning to inflation, core PCE inflation over the past twelve months—at 19 percent—has   come in higher than I would like to see  But assuming that growth slows to trend later this year, my   outlook for inflation in 2006 is more optimistic than the Greenbook  One reason stems from work   our staff has done on the extent of pass-through from energy prices to both labor compensation and   core price inflation  As I’ve said before, the evidence suggests to us that there has been relatively   little pass-through since the early 1980s, perhaps due to the credibility of our commitment to the   stability of core inflation  Under our assumption of very little pass-through, we expect the core PCE   price index to rise around 1¾ percent, both this year and next  The Greenbook shows an increase of   2¼ percent this year, presumably reflecting larger energy-price pass-through, and then a drop to   about 1¾ percent in 2007 as the effects of energy prices subside  So though I differ with the   Greenbook on inflation in 2006, over the longer period I think we’re about on the same page   January 31, 2006 32 of 106    So as I look at the total picture, I would say that the overall outlook is quite positive  The   economy is near full employment with real GDP tending toward trend-like growth  Core inflation is   within a reasonable range but a bit on the high side  Needless to say, it’s fitting for Chairman   Greenspan to leave office with the economy in such solid shape  And if I might torture a simile, I   would say, Mr Chairman, that the situation you’re handing off to your successor is a lot like a   tennis racquet with a gigantic sweet spot  [Laughter]   Positive though the situation is, it also obviously raises the issue of how much higher the   funds rate needs to go to keep the economy on this desirable trajectory  There are a number of ways   of looking at this question, all yielding similar answers  First, a funds rate of 4½ percent rests right   near the center of the range of estimates for the equilibrium funds rate  Along the same lines, our   staff ran simulations of FRB/US to calculate the net effect of monetary policy actions over the past   several years on real GDP growth  The results are that, after adding importantly to growth over the   last few years, past policy accommodation is roughly neutral in terms of growth this year and next    A second approach is to compare a funds rate of 4½ percent with the recommendations of Taylor-  type rules  Such calculations suggest that a 4½ percent funds rate this quarter is a bit on the tight   side now but should be about right later this year under the Greenbook forecast  The long-run   simulations in the Bluebook are a third method to judge the stance of policy  These simulations   show the funds rate optimally peaking at a little over 5 percent, well above where we are now  But   a major factor accounting for this relatively high peak is the Greenbook’s assumption, incorporated   in the Bluebook simulation, that energy pass-through pushes up core PCE inflation to 2¼ percent   this year  And as I’ve emphasized, we’re not convinced that this much pass-through is likely, and   our lower inflation forecast implies a lower peak for the funds rate along an optimal path   January 31, 2006 33 of 106    Taken together, then, these approaches suggest to me that if we tighten policy at this   meeting, as I think we should, we will be close to the appropriate peak in the funds rate based on   what we know now  As for the future path of the funds rate, I believe it should be highly dependent   on unfolding events and cannot be prejudged with any degree of confidence  So the bottom line is   that we need to position ourselves for flexibility in our policy choices going forward    Thank you, Mr Chairman  And I also support fully your recommendation   with respect to the 25 basis point move and with respect to the language, and I agree with the Vice   Chairman’s comments that the discussion about what we should vote on is very important  It has all   become an aspect of policy, but there are a lot of details to discuss, and we should defer a decision   on it  "
7677,2006-03-27,"  I have two brief questions, one for David and one for Karen  To David, my   question is whether or not you have changed your assessment of the normal gap that we should   expect between the core CPI and the core PCE, since those two measures seem to give rather   different readings about the strength of inflation pressures  I have long thought that 04 or 05 was   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 21 of 167       the natural differential to expect between those two measures  But it looks as though, at the moment   and perhaps going back several years, the average differential between the two measures may have   narrowed to something closer to a quarter of a point  We have talked about this as a mystery, but I   wonder whether, because it is persistent, we should not be benchmarking our view of the core CPI   at a slightly different place than, say, 2 being the equivalent to 1½ on the PCE   And for Karen, my question has to do with the evolution of net exports and the difference   between your persistent forecast of worsening net exports and the forecast of Macroeconomic   Advisers, which you have probably looked at, which projects a turnaround  David mentioned that   we only need to see a modest slowing or a downturn in the housing sector to realize sustainable   growth going forward  But that assessment is contingent on what’s forecast for every other   component of aggregate demand  As I compare the Greenbook forecast to Macroeconomic   Advisers’ forecast, the thing that really stands out, and has stood out for quite a long time, as a   consistent, strong difference is the Greenbook’s forecast that net exports will be a growing drag on   the economy and Macroeconomic Advisers’ view that net exports are just poised to turn up  I   assume that the difference comes down to differences in your assessments of the effects of past   depreciation of the dollar on net exports  My question is, Is that right?  I am assuming that you are   well aware of this difference, and I am just curious to know what your perspective is on that    We have noticed a change in the relationship between the core CPI and the   chained core CPI, which suggested to us that maybe something is going on relating to substitution   bias at the upper level of the index  You focused on the nonmarket component of the PCE, and I   wondered if something unusual might be happening with the core CPI relative to other measures    Thank you, Mr Chairman  May I say it’s a great pleasure to see you back   at the table  And while I hesitate to wish your predecessor’s eighteen years of service on anyone, I   look forward to many interesting and productive meetings under your leadership   The latest monthly data show significant strength in activity for the quarter just ending, and I   agree with the Greenbook’s assessment that this strength represents a temporary catch-up after the   weak fourth quarter  I anticipate that growth will likely settle back to trend as the year progresses,   especially as the lagged effect of tighter financial conditions damps interest-sensitive sectors  The   current risks to this scenario are by now a well-known litany—housing, energy prices, the saving   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 35 of 167       rate, foreign demand, and term premiums  Overall, I judge the risk to the growth forecast to be   pretty well balanced   I did want to comment briefly on the risks associated with housing  This is the sector that   obviously bears close watching because it can represent the leading edge of the effects of the   monetary tightening  Thus far, published data on housing starts and permits provide rather little   evidence of a significant weakening in construction activity, although other indicators such as   home-buying attitudes and new home sales, along with a growing amount of anecdotal evidence,   suggest that tighter financing conditions are finally exacting a toll  I think one possible reason that   starts and permits have remained so strong is that the inventory margin is taking up some of the   slack in demand  Indeed, the stock of unsold homes on the market has now reached quite high   levels     I noted a similar phenomenon in talking to a real estate developer in what has been the   sizzling Phoenix housing market  In that market, demand has been so strong that builders couldn’t   build houses fast enough to satisfy buyers  So delivery times for new homes were very long  And   as the demand for new homes has slowed recently, we haven’t seen a noticeable change in building   activity, but there has been a significant decline in delivery times  As this margin, like unsold   inventories, returns to more historical norms, I think that we’ll see the moderation in demand show   up in new construction numbers as well   Turning to inflation, I think it’s worth stressing how good recent readings have been  Over   the past twelve months, core PCE prices are up 18 percent, the market-based component   15 percent, and the core CPI just 21 percent  As I’ve noted in previous meetings over the past six   months, we have been more optimistic than the Greenbook about the prospects for core inflation   during 2006  For quite some time now, we have been on the order of several tenths of a percentage   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 36 of 167       point lower  And I continue to think that core PCE price inflation will come in at about 18 percent   this year   As the Greenbook forecast drifts down, I think maybe my stubbornness is paying off  My   relative optimism partly reflects my view, based on econometric evidence using data after the early   1980s, that there is little pressure for higher inflation coming from the pass-through of energy prices   to labor compensation or core prices  Another important element in my optimistic inflation outlook   is inflation expectations, which I consider to be well contained and unlikely to provide significant   upward impetus to inflation  At the same time, I think it’s important not to ignore the potential   adverse inflationary consequences from a resurgent economy   I realize the link between resource utilization and inflation is a contentious topic  Actually,   the Philadelphia Fed’s Survey of Professional Forecasters asked its respondents whether they used   the concept of a natural rate of unemployment in their macroeconomic projections, and the replies   indicate a split of about 50–50  About half the economic forecasters, in other words, use such a rate,   and the other half don’t  And my guess is that there is also a considerable difference of opinion   around this table  Personally, I’m persuaded that excess demand in a market does tend to push up   prices and that the domestic labor market is no exception to this rule  I think that the econometric   evidence supports that view   President Fisher has been arguing, and perhaps some others would agree, that what matters   is not just US productive capacity but worldwide capacity  I do agree that the world—or, more   accurately, the aggregate supply curve—has probably become flatter  But while globalization has   had a profound impact on the US economy in a number of ways, I think that there are a number of   reasons to doubt that it will overturn, at least completely, the normal historical relationship between   domestic labor market slack and inflation  The first point here is simply that many goods and most   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 37 of 167       services still must be produced in the United States, and so foreign capacity isn’t an issue  The   second point is that, in order to utilize productive capacity in foreign countries, we do need to run a   trade deficit; in principle, such deficits eventually put downward pressure on our exchange rates,   which tends to raise the prices paid for imports in the United States  I’m sure this is a topic we will   be discussing in a lot more detail going forward   Of course, the measurement of aggregate excess demand or slack is difficult, and I’m   sympathetic to the view that there is no bright red line for the unemployment rate that, once crossed,   triggers higher inflation  But by examining a variety of indicators, I think it’s possible to get a   useful notion of aggregate resource utilization  I would judge that these measures currently fall in a   range from a modest amount of slack to a modest amount of excess demand  Specifically, the   unemployment rate, the vacancy rate, the employment–population ratio, capacity utilization, and   other measures are all within a few tenths, in unemployment rate terms, of full employment   Looking ahead, with the unemployment rate already at 48 percent, I think it’s logical to   worry that wage and price inflation will rise over time if resource slack diminishes further  And   with GDP growth forecast at 3¾ percent this year, a naïve calculation based on Okun’s law suggests   that the unemployment rate could fall to 4½ percent by the fourth quarter  In contrast, the   Greenbook assumes that the unemployment rate will remain unchanged  The Greenbook inflation   projection is, accordingly, more optimistic than a forecast based on the naïve model   Now, given the importance of the behavior of unemployment to one’s forecast of inflation,   my staff has been looking at the performance and fit of Okun’s law—namely, the relationship   between output growth and the change in the unemployment rate  And I think their analysis   provides support for the Greenbook assessment  Using a dynamic version of Okun’s law that fits   exceptionally well after 1961, my staff finds evidence of an error correction between the output and   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 38 of 167       the unemployment gaps  During 2005, unemployment declined substantially more than a simple   version of Okun’s law would have predicted  And this dynamic model suggests that, even with fast   economic growth, the unemployment rate will likely be pushed up a bit this year, as this unusual   decline in 2005 is reversed   So to sum up, I see steady growth and few pressures for price acceleration    Okay  I guess my view is that it’s a risk, but at the moment, by various   measures, we’re pretty close to, not beyond, full employment  The unemployment rate has declined   unusually rapidly over the last year, but a simple Okun’s law calculation—and I think that the staff   has commented on this in the past, if I’m not mistaken—would assess the decline we’ve seen in the   unemployment rate during 2005 as especially large, given what output growth was  In that sense,   the unemployment rate is now giving us a reading of less slack in the economy than we would get   from other indicators  Our forecast is that the mysterious decline in the unemployment rate last year   will be reversed so unemployment will hold steady, even with growth at the magnitude that the   Greenbook is projecting (around 3¾ percent)  That’s what the error-correction mechanism is about   So I’m optimistic about inflation because I see us ending 2006 at roughly full employment,   with the unemployment rate in the vicinity of its current level  I’m also optimistic about inflation   because we’ve been persuaded that since the 1980s we’ve seen very little pass-through of energy-  price increases into core inflation  That has been a source of considerably more optimism on our   part than on Greenbook’s part in that it continues to project pass-through of energy and commodity   prices into core inflation through 2006   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 39 of 167        Well, I think the econometric evidence suggests that the pass-through has   declined and doesn’t speak clearly to the reason for the decline  My guess would be that inflation   expectations have become better anchored, and market participants have more confidence in the   Fed’s commitment to price stability  And so there are fewer, in effect, inflation scares of the type   we had in the ’70s, when inflation expectations became unhinged  In that sense, of course, it is   contingent on policy  I think policy has also been more consistently responsive to movements in   inflation—not only in the sense of having become more creative but also in the sense of   systematically raising the real federal funds rate in response to an increase in inflation, which wasn’t   always the case previously    It certainly could    That could be one of the drivers  Sure, I agree with that    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I think overall we are in a good position at this   point with the economy essentially at full employment and growth homing in on potential, which   will, I hope, hold unemployment roughly steady  Core inflation is pretty steady although, at least by   several measures and particularly the core PCE, it is in the top half of the range that I would like to   see  But I agree with Governor Kohn that this is a matter that we should consider  What index, and   where it is relative to what we would like, bears further thinking about    If you take inflation to be in the top half of a comfort range as opposed to the middle, an   optimal policy setting would place the funds rate toward the upper end of a neutral range or would   be minimally restrictive  I say “minimally” because we are at most a little above the middle of the   so-called comfort range and also because the various rules presented in chart 7 of the Bluebook   suggest that the appropriate response of policy to a deviation of inflation from the middle of the   range is actually quite small   If inflation were to decline, say, 50 basis points, from 2 percent to 1½ percent, the response,   according to most of the rules in the table, of the fed funds rate to that deviation is on the order of 25   or 30 basis points  So it is sort of a one-policy-move difference  At this point, it seems to me,   policy is pretty close to appropriately positioned   In terms of risk assessments, I share Governor Kohn’s concern about the possibility that   growth won’t actually slow to a sustainable pace and so the economy may overheat  But I am also   concerned about overshooting, in part because the delayed effect of our policy actions may show up   especially in the housing sector with greater force than we expect and we are a little uncertain—  David mentioned this yesterday—about just what the spillovers might be to consumer spending via   balance sheet effects or wealth effects  I think we do need to be sensitive to the possibility of   overshooting, and here I would endorse President Hoenig’s comments on that  So I can certainly   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 127 of 167       support a 25 basis point tightening today coupled with some slight policy inclination for further   firming  But I would not like to do anything to boost the market’s perceptions of the likely ending   point of the cycle  I’m not sure what the best way is to accomplish that  I had first found myself   having some preference for using the alternative language suggested for B that would say that some   modest additional policy firming may be needed  But I am not sure that is the right way to go   As I look forward, I share the concern that a number of you have expressed—that as we get   to the May meeting we are going to find not only that markets expect us to go another 25 but also   that an additional 25 will be priced into the market  And it seems to me that the construction of our   statement raises the likelihood that markets are going to continue to build in expectations for moves   beyond 5 percent  Let me explain in part what I’m worried about  I am worried about the way in   which line 3 of alternative B characterizes our concerns about energy and commodity prices  As I   looked at the new Bluebook handout that Vince just gave us, I liked the change that has been made   in line 2 where it says that the economic growth has rebounded but in effect then adds, “But look, in   our Committee forecast, we wanted to let you know we’re expecting really strong numbers for Q1,   but we think it is then going to moderate to a more-sustainable pace”   Now, we might have tried to do the same thing in line 3, but unfortunately we didn’t  We   don’t state what our forecast is to give markets a reasonable way to judge incoming data  Let me   get a bit more specific about what I mean  Consider the Greenbook forecast for core PCE inflation   for the remainder of this year  I’m more optimistic than the Greenbook is, but the Greenbook   forecast is that, for the remainder of this year, core PCE inflation is going to come in at 22 percent,   which is certainly above the top end of the comfort range that I or anyone else who has opined on   this has suggested   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 128 of 167       So what will the market response be if the Greenbook forecast actually materializes?  It   seems to me that the Greenbook projects that the uptick would be temporary, so we needn’t   respond  But the statement in B essentially says, “Look  The run-up in energy prices has had only a   modest effect on core inflation”  In effect, it says we continue to think that that will be the way the   world transpires, and in the end I think it says that we regard it as an upside risk to our forecast that   elevated prices of energy and other commodities have the potential to add to inflation pressure  So   if, in point of fact, the Greenbook is right and we start seeing 22 for core PCE, what will markets   conclude?  “Yes, this is what they’re worried about  They’re really worried that an upside risk to   their inflation forecast is that inflation is going to come in this high  What are we to conclude other   than that this is a negative surprise to the Committee, and therefore they are going to go above 5   percent?”  So we have told market participants in line 2, “Don’t be surprised if you see a very strong   growth number in Q1  We think that’s temporary  It’s going to abate”  What we haven’t told   markets is the comparable thing, namely, that we may well see a boost in core PCE inflation for the   next couple of quarters, but we think it is temporary   One thing that we could do would be to change the phrasing and say in line 3 that the   elevated prices of energy and other commodities may boost core inflation modestly for a time  That   would distinguish this from the case of rising inflation due to resource utilization, which we do see   as an upside risk to our forecast  But generally whether or not we make this change, I am concerned   that we are going to see more increases priced into fed funds futures, and I would cheerfully endorse   the kind of move that has been made in this draft of alternative B, in which the Committee’s   forecast for growth has been clearly enunciated  And moving in that direction for our baseline   forecast for inflation would be a useful way to go as well   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 129 of 167       If I could just spend one more second, I would like to propose a bit more wordsmithing in   alternative B  A principle, or a practice, that I learned at the Council of Economic Advisers that I   think would be a good one for us is that you never make a statement that purports to be a statement   of fact unless it can be fact-checked  [Laughter]  This process is rigorous there  I would say the   first statement in line 3—“as yet the run-up in the prices of energy and other commodities has had   only a modest effect on core inflation”—is not fact-checkable  I believe that’s the case  I think   most of you believe that’s the case  I wouldn’t want to have to fact-check it  I don’t know how you   would do it  I would add something like “has apparently had only a modest effect on core   inflation”  The point about the fact that productivity gains have held the growth of unit labor costs   in check, I don’t personally mind that at all  I agree with that  I simply think that it is not the only   thing—arithmetically modest compensation gains have done the same thing  So I do not mind   listing it, but I would say “have helped”      I would just endorse President Minehan’s summary of reactions and the   comments that have been made around the table  I think the innovations in this meeting have been   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 147 of 167       excellent  I think the meeting has run very well  Having more time has certainly enriched the   discussion of both the economy and the policy situation  I agree, too, with President Minehan’s   suggestion that there will be times when we probably do not need two days  I have also been   around through some calm times, when there was just not that much to discuss on the policy front,   and I think we need some flexibility  Special topics, I completely agree, are very, very worthwhile,   and I would not want to see them go  On the practical front, I would endorse President Poole’s   concern about conflicts with board meetings  You know, for me there would be no way of getting   back for Wednesday afternoon  We begin our board meetings on Wednesday afternoon as well  So   that’s a practical concern  "
7702,2006-05-10,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Incoming data on the pace of economic activity   surprised me slightly to the upside, although the indications are that housing is continuing to cool  Such   an upside surprise is of concern, given that we are probably in the neighborhood of full employment and   inflation is already on the high side of a range I consider consistent with price stability  I have also been   slightly surprised, and unpleasantly so, by incoming data on core inflation     Beginning on the real side, recent data might signal greater underlying momentum in aggregate   demand, portending more of the same going forward  But other developments during the intermeeting   period portend slower growth this year  In particular, energy prices and longer-term interest rates have   risen surprisingly and substantially  Taking all these factors into account, we have marked down our   forecast for real GDP growth a bit for the latter half of 2006 and for 2007  We see growth coming in   slightly below trend starting in the second half of this year and the unemployment rate moving up   May 10, 2006 28 of 120    toward 5 percent  This forecast assumes that policy is tightened at this meeting and once more over the   next several meetings   One development on which I would like to comment briefly is the rise in long-term interest rates    Since the beginning of this year, the nominal ten-year Treasury rate is up about 75 basis points  About   50 basis points of this increase is accounted for by a rise in the real component, at least as measured by   TIPS rates  It seems natural to assume that this increase in real long rates will restrain future growth, but   the outcome for economic activity is not unambiguous  It depends on what caused real rates to rise in   the first place, and the causation is far from obvious   For example, higher long-term rates could reflect rational market expectations of a significantly   stronger domestic economy over the next few years  But such an explanation does not strike me as   particularly plausible because, although recent data are slightly on the strong side, they are not   dramatically strong  Moreover, the uptick in real rates appears to be especially pronounced in implied   yields at the long end of the curve—in the distant future, in periods well beyond a plausible forecast   horizon   A second possibility is that higher US interest rates reflect a shift in global capital flows away   from the United States, perhaps due to the unwinding of the carry trade or growing concern about the   US current account deficit  Such a shift might account for the sharp drop in the dollar over the same   period  In simple models, such a shift in portfolio preferences has ambiguous effects on domestic   demand because the depreciation in the dollar could stimulate aggregate demand by more than higher   yields depress it  It’s not my intention to overemphasize the risk that growth will not slow  My point is   simply that, although the rise in bond rates seems likely to help slow the economy, we should not take it   for granted   May 10, 2006 29 of 120    Turning briefly to inflation, I’m uncertain whether the recent bulge reflects various special   factors, as David mentioned, some pass-through of energy and commodity prices, or pressures from   resource utilization  Parsing the CPI report, I found it difficult to discern evidence that the uptick does   reflect pass-through of energy and commodity prices into core inflation  I would be quite concerned if   the uptick reflects pressures from resource utilization and turns out to be persistent  However, half a   dozen measures of slack that we monitor suggest no noticeable change in slack since late March  These   measures also suggest that we are in the vicinity of full employment and not noticeably beyond it  Data   on both productivity and labor compensation are largely reassuring   My final comment concerns the rise in inflation compensation since our last meeting  While the   possibility of some loss of Fed credibility certainly can’t be dismissed, I believe we should not   overreact  First, the rise we’ve seen is not out of line with the typical volatility in this series  Second,   we must remember that inflation compensation includes not only expected inflation but also an inflation   risk premium  Of course, both of these elements could be higher because of a lessening of credibility    But the inflation risk premium could also be higher because the world now strikes market participants as   a riskier place, perhaps because of geopolitical concerns that have nothing to do with credibility    Indeed, a growing perception that the world is riskier could explain both the uptick in inflation   compensation due to a rise in the inflation risk premium and some of the rise in TIPS yields due to   higher real interest rate risk  Factor analysis performed by our staff suggests a strong correlation with   the common factor for the term premium and longer-horizon, but not shorter-horizon, breakeven   inflation rates and TIPS yields   My point is that determining what has caused inflation compensation to go up is not an easy   matter, and concluding that it’s due to a lessening of credibility may be premature  So overall, while we   have revised our core inflation forecast up slightly, we continue to be fairly optimistic that inflation will   May 10, 2006 30 of 120    remain reasonably well contained going forward  Inflation in the core PCE price index of around 2   percent over the next year or so seems like the most likely outcome to us    We’ve not tried to estimate an actual breakdown between those two things  We   do look at models that estimate the term premium, but we’ve done some empirical work that suggests   simply that movements in inflation compensation, the inflation risk premium, and longer-term TIPS   yields tend to be correlated at long horizons  But I don’t have an estimate of that precise breakdown    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support alternative B  I favor raising the funds rate   25 basis points, not 50 basis points, today  The statement helps us get off the treadmill we’ve been on   and enhances flexibility, but it doesn’t tie our hands into pausing in June if the data between now and   then are so strong as to necessitate, in our view, a further move at that time  I think B does leave open   the door to as much additional tightening as may be needed, whereas C actually suggests that we think   the tightening is over   Now, personally, I judge the additional amount of tightening needed to be modest, although I   think a bit of additional restraint is probably desirable  I think we are close to being done because I’m   comfortable with the Greenbook forecast, and I also think our policy stance is roughly appropriate based   May 10, 2006 92 of 120    on a variety of rule-based metrics  I do think a bit more tightening is needed because I’d prefer to see   core inflation gradually head down toward the center of my comfort range rather than see it stabilize in   the vicinity of 2 percent, as in the Greenbook forecast  I want to emphasize that only a bit is required,   not a show of overwhelming force, because, as one example, the benchmark Taylor rule would suggest   that a ½ percent reduction in the target inflation rate, say from 2 to 1½, the center of my comfort zone,   calls for an additional increase of only 25 basis points in the funds rate, and various simulations using   optimal policies as opposed to rules would similarly show a quite slow convergence toward the lower   target rate  We’ve seen that in past Bluebooks   I strongly favor a pause in our campaign in order to evaluate the effect of our policy actions to   date, unless incoming data after this meeting contain large upside surprises  Like President Hoenig, I do   certainly understand the urge to continue raising rates at every meeting until we’re sure the economy is   slowing  I still remember very well the 1994 tightening episode, and then, as now, there was a sense of   great momentum in the economy, posing significant upside risks to inflation  In circumstances like that,   the urge to continue tightening is natural  It is instinctual  Unfortunately, with policy lags such a   strategy is a sure recipe for overshooting  If we’re lucky enough to stop at exactly the right point this   time, as I believe we actually did in ’95, we can be sure that it will feel risky at the moment we stop and   wise only in retrospect  The risks for policy, in my view, are now two-sided, and this is especially true   with the substantial run-up since our last meeting in longer-term interest rates   Downside risks due to a possible policy overshooting are now balanced in my mind with the   upside risk that we have not done enough, and I would consider a pause to evaluate where we stand as   desirable and appropriate, unless of course there is new and surprising information    I strongly support what Governor Kohn said  "
7729,2006-06-28,"  This is a question for Steve or for Karen  In Monday’s international   briefing you referred, and I’ll quote, to the possibility that we may be “nearing limits on global   capacity” when you were discussing foreign inflation prospects  I’m really following up on   President Fisher’s question here  I want just to clarify what your thinking is about how global   capacity figures into those foreign inflation forecasts that you make and then potentially into US   inflation  One model might be that inflation in each country depends mainly on the country’s own   domestic capacity or unemployment along with some role for import prices  If so, you might refer   to global capacity as just an average of the states of foreign labor markets, possibly driven by some   June 28-29, 2006 33 of 177    common external force that’s driving global growth in all the countries  An alternative is that you   might feel that there is some role for global capacity in the inflation process above and beyond how   it may affect import prices  That’s, I guess, the view that President Fisher has put forward, and it is   interestingly endorsed in the BIS annual report that came out yesterday    I mean, this is a large topic, but I don’t mean to ask too large a question  I   just want to clarify what your thinking is, especially when you use that term    Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  The staff presentations make abundantly clear   that most of the data we have received since we met in May have been disappointing in one way or   another  Recent economic activity appears to have been quite a bit weaker than expected, as   exemplified by the Greenbook, which shows a significant downward revision to 2 percent growth in   June 28-29, 2006 61 of 177    the current quarter and a noticeable downward adjustment to 2¾ percent in the second half of this   year  However, in view of the possibility that labor and product markets may have moved a bit   beyond full utilization, as well as the recent high readings on core inflation, a period of growth a bit   below potential could be seen as necessary to prevent a buildup of underlying inflationary pressures   Under the assumption of one more funds rate increase at this meeting, it seems reasonable to   me that growth will remain somewhat below its potential rate, that the unemployment rate will   gradually trend upward to slightly above the NAIRU by the end of next year, and that core inflation   will gradually move down toward my comfort zone  If things work out that way, I suppose the   outcome would be nearly optimal, given that we are starting from an undesirably high inflation   figure in the second quarter   My concern is that it is very difficult at this stage to rule out a much less desirable scenario   in which the lagged effects of our earlier reactions restrain activity more strongly and more   persistently than we now expect  We might also see further financial disruptions as a consequence   of investors’ increased risk aversion, which is the bearish possibility that Dino described earlier  In   other words, the question is whether the large surprise in the second quarter will be followed by a   series of similar surprises later this year  I am concerned about downside risks to the real outlook,   especially until we can better gauge the magnitude of the repercussions from the weakening in   housing markets that now clearly is under way   The data on core inflation in recent months present the opposite concern, having been higher   than expected and pushing core inflation slightly above my comfort zone over the past year  This   raises the possibility that we are making systematic errors in our understanding of the fundamental   forces driving inflation  The key question is whether the necessary decline in inflation requires   more action from us or whether inflation is being pushed up by temporary factors that will dissipate   June 28-29, 2006 62 of 177    on their own  The Greenbook, I think quite reasonably, shows core inflation edging down over the   next year and a half as the effects of several temporary factors abate  One possibility in this regard   is that there has been a modest pass-through from energy-price increases to core inflation and that   these effects will dissipate if energy prices stabilize at today’s elevated levels  Moreover, part of the   recent uptick traces to large increases in housing costs that are finally showing up in the CPI just as   the housing market is slowing  As David noted in his briefing, the CPI measure of changes in   housing prices for owner-occupied housing reflects movements in market rental rates rather than   house prices and interest rates   After long being stagnant or even falling, rents are finally moving up  Perhaps with higher   mortgage interest rates and lower expectations of house-price appreciation, speculative properties   are being dumped into the market, and families in the market for housing are now more inclined to   rent rather than buy, driving rents up and housing prices down  It certainly would not be surprising   to see a return to a more normal relationship between rents and house prices  Such a phenomenon,   if it is now playing out, would most likely be transitory rather than permanent, although it could   play out for quite some time   Unfortunately, at this point it is difficult to tell how much of the recent rise in core inflation   is temporary and how much is due to underlying inflation pressures like tight labor and product   markets, which would suggest a more persistent problem for policy  I would feel more concerned   were it not for the largely reassuring data on productivity, labor compensation, and profit margins    That said, the good news is all in the forecast, whereas the bad news is in the data  So I certainly   can’t rule out the possibility that the increase in core inflation in the second quarter is the leading   edge of a developing trend   June 28-29, 2006 63 of 177    In summary, I think the most likely scenario is a relatively benign one  However, we have   had some rather large surprises in both output and inflation since we last met  It seems to me that,   in the policy round coming up, the more important matters are the risks that growth could slow   much more than now seems likely or that inflation could prove to be a more serious problem than I   currently expect it to be or, for that matter, that both factors could come into play  It is unlikely that   we will be able to sharpen our assessment of these risks very much until more time passes and more   data become available    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Based purely on the economic data, I   consider it a close call between raising the funds rate 25 basis points today and pausing  I   definitely think that policy should have a firming bias because inflation is too high  However, I   do consider policy to be mildly restrictive, and I see a lot of uncertainty right now about the   prospects for both real GDP and inflation    My preference would be to move up a bit more slowly, if in fact it turns out that we do   need to tighten more, in order to allow additional time to assess the economic situation as we go    In other words, the option value of pausing, especially in view of how close the next meeting is,   would have ideally, in my view, made it preferable to pause on purely economic grounds today    There is a wide range of possibilities for the future  I am deeply concerned about the   pace of core inflation in recent months, but as I said yesterday, I take comfort from the continued   June 28-29, 2006 104 of 177    strength in productivity growth, modest increases in wages, and the high level of markups  But it   certainly is a possibility that inflation will remain where it is or pick up even more than we have   seen so far, and in that case, further action will surely be required to bring it under control  I’m   also quite aware of the possibility that output will slow much more than the Greenbook expects   and that the rise in inflation we’ve seen recently will turn out to be a temporary bulge  Financial   conditions have tightened considerably, and we may regret not getting off the escalator of raising   the funds rate at each and every meeting because, if in fact output does slow down even more   than the Greenbook projects, we will probably overshoot the appropriate level of the funds rate,   perhaps by a considerable amount    In response to President Lacker’s comment about how we affect inflation, it seems to me   that we do affect inflation by manipulating aggregate demand  That is the channel through   which monetary policy works  To my mind we have two goals, not one, and we are now in a   regime with mildly restrictive policy so that we face a tradeoff between the pace at which we’re   going to bring inflation back to our target and the path of unemployment along the route    So although on purely economic grounds I’d prefer to pause at this meeting, I certainly   recognize that it would be difficult to leave the stance of policy unchanged at this time  In   general, I believe that we should do the right thing, even if it surprises markets, but in this case   our public statements seem to have convinced the public that we will raise the funds rate today    If we didn’t follow through, there would likely be some loss of credibility for policy  Moreover,   as I’ve indicated, I see today’s call as an exceptionally close one between firming and pausing    Therefore, I can certainly support another increase in the funds rate of 25 basis points today    With respect to the statement, in response to Vince’s point about what our policy choice   is today, I believe our objective should be to craft wording that lowers the market’s assessment   June 28-29, 2006 105 of 177    of the chance that we’re going to move again in August below what it is, which is about   85 percent at this point  The revised statement does an excellent job in accomplishing that, and I   endorse the analysis of the statement that Governor Kohn gave as he went through the various   parts  I do find, however, that I’m also attracted to the wording suggested by President Poole as   an alternative  It’s another way to accomplish the same thing, and it has the added attraction of   including the statement that we judge our stance after today’s move as mildly restrictive  It does   open up the distinct possibility of our pausing in August, depending on the information we   receive   To my mind, there is a real policy challenge as we go forward  Policy—I agree with   President Poole—is mildly restrictive  The Greenbook forecast has unemployment moving   above the NAIRU and inflation gradually coming down  However, assuming that the inflation   bulge is not a purely transitory one that will disappear rapidly, the process for inflation to move   down is going to take a while  The communication challenge I think we face and will face for   quite a while is how we will live through a period in which inflation exceeds our objective  We   need to express the idea that that is an unacceptable long-run situation  But I endorse the   comments that President Poole made  We have to make sure that every time we receive an   adverse inflation reading—and that could occur for quite some time while the medicine of our   policy is working—we don’t respond by raising the funds rate again   "
7752,2006-08-08," Thank you I have a question for David and Karen, and it picks up on   President Poole’s My question has to do with what, if anything, we can learn about the role of   energy-price increases as a factor raising core inflation here from the experience of other   countries Since we’re not the only country experiencing increases in energy and other   commodity prices, my question is whether or not there is some econometric or other evidence   that pertains to the degree of energy-price pass-through into core inflation in other developed   economies  I’m thinking particularly of economies in which inflation expectations are   reasonably well anchored—for example, the United Kingdom, Canada, and the euro area  What   do we know about energy-price pass-through into core inflation?  Is there evidence of that?   Thank you, Mr Chairman  So far the economy has stuck pretty close to   the script of the soft landing sketched out in the June Greenbook  Real GDP growth slowed   markedly in the second quarter  Housing construction has declined sharply, and house prices   have decelerated; this situation suggests that our policy actions have taken hold in this   interest-sensitive sector  The recent sharp rise in oil prices should also put a damper on growth   of real income and consumer spending  Most forecasters now expect below-trend growth in the   current quarter Nonfarm payroll employment has shifted down to a more-sustainable pace, and   the unemployment rate has risen to 48 percent, just a bit below standard estimates of the   NAIRU Core inflation, although uncomfortably high, came in 02 percentage point below the   June Greenbook’s forecast in the second quarter  In addition, despite further large increases in   August 8, 2006 24 of 158                   the price of oil, inflation expectations held firm  In light of these developments, a reasonable   forecast is for growth to continue to run slightly below its potential rate, the unemployment rate   to edge up, and core inflation to recede gradually     At our last meeting, I laid out some of my concerns about downside risks to the outlook   for growth and upside risks to inflation Quite honestly, I cannot say that the recent data have   done much to assuage my angst on either account  The recent falloff in housing activity and the   deceleration in house prices have been faster than expected  The current Greenbook has   residential investment falling at an annual rate of 14 percent in the second half of this year,   nearly twice as fast as projected in June These surprises intensify the risk of a sharper   slowdown as the lagged effects of our past policy actions come fully into effect  For example,   the housing slowdown could become an unwelcome housing slump as envisioned in one of the   Greenbook alternative scenarios A large homebuilder in our District summarized the views of   many of our contacts when he recently commented that “the housing market has not yet popped,   but a hissing sound is now clearly audible” [Laughter] He pointed to rapidly rising   cancellations as a particularly ominous sign  I will be watching the incoming data closely for   signs as to whether the housing slowdown remains orderly as hoped or takes a steeper downward   slide, posing a greater risk to the economy   My concerns about inflation have also been somewhat heightened by the recent data or,   more precisely, revisions to past data Core measures of inflation continue to be well above my   comfort zone Of course, after the experience of last year, when core inflation was revised up by   a considerable amount, I approached this year’s annual NIPA revision with some considerable   trepidation I was relieved to see that the core PCE price inflation data came out of the revision   relatively unscathed, revised up just 01 percentage point for 2005; but other aspects of the report   August 8, 2006 25 of 158                   were somewhat less reassuring for the inflation outlook  First, the rate of labor productivity   growth over the past three years has been a bit slower than we thought, primarily because of   downward revisions to the rate of capital accumulation, so that the Greenbook now projects   structural productivity growth of 27 percent, about ¼ percentage point slower than we thought   back in June This revision suggests somewhat less downward pressure on inflation emanating   from cost reductions and, therefore, greater upside risks to inflation     But that wasn’t the only surprise tucked away in the annual revision  The upward   revision to compensation growth over the past four quarters implies that growth in unit labor   costs over the past year has been more rapid than we had believed  I had thought that there was a   good chance that compensation per hour and unit labor costs would increase relatively   moderately going forward, helping to contain inflationary pressures  The data revision was thus   a bit of a wake-up call for me, and I have revised upward my views on the outlook for   compensation and unit labor costs  My reading of the report is that the revised data provide a   clearer and less sanguine picture of the trend in this measure of compensation  However, the   employment cost index was in line with expectations in June and continues to show moderate   growth Moreover, even with revisions to productivity and compensation, the markup in the   nonfarm business sector remains very high by historical standards, suggesting that firms do have   room to absorb costs   Overall, I view the inflation outlook as highly uncertain, with a pronounced upside risk    As I mentioned at the last meeting, we just don’t have a good handle on why core inflation has   risen of late or how persistent this rise will be  While it is comforting to attribute the increase to   energy and commodity-price pass-through, empirical evidence suggests that pass-through effects   August 8, 2006 26 of 158                      have been quite modest since the mid-1980s  If so, the door is open for other explanations that   may have a more lasting influence and require a more aggressive policy response   Something that makes me even more uncertain about the inflation outlook is that standard   backward-looking Phillips curve models of inflation appear to be breaking down  It has been   widely noted that the estimated effect of resource utilization on inflation in such models has   become much smaller over time  But equally striking is the finding that the sum of coefficients   on lagged inflation when freely estimated appears to have fallen as well, suggesting that inflation   has become far less persistent  In fact, our staff finds that, in looking over the past ten years, it is   better to assume that core inflation will return to its sample average over the next four quarters   than that it will remain in its recent range or follow a standard Phillips curve model    Interestingly, this decline in the persistence of core inflation has occurred at roughly the same   time that long-run inflation expectations, as measured by the Survey of Professional Forecasters,   appear to have become well anchored, and this may not be a coincidence  Economic models   with forward-looking inflation expectations tell us that, if the central bank has credibility and   holds to a fixed long-run inflation target, then inflation will be less persistent than is implied by   the standard backward-looking Phillips curve model  Indeed, the puzzle for macroeconomists   has been why we see so much inflation persistence  Perhaps we no longer do If that is true,   inflation may decline faster than the Greenbook expects   Admittedly, the past ten years form a relatively small sample from which to draw   definitive conclusions  But the inflation process may have changed in a fundamental way, and   we should be open to that possibility I would like to stress that this evidence and the analysis   concern the simple correlations of the inflation data that are used for forecasting  The evidence   does not relate to structural relationships, and therefore it does not necessarily inform us about   August 8, 2006 27 of 158                            how our policy decisions affect the economy or about the best course for policy  In summary,   although my modal forecast is relatively benign, I remain very concerned about risks to both   growth and inflation    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I favor alternative B  It is a tough decision  I   personally consider this the wiser course of action, although I think there’s no question that a case   can be made for raising rates today  Alternative B has several advantages  First, a pause at this   meeting will give us a chance to review incoming data over the next six weeks, which isn’t that   August 8, 2006 84 of 158                               long We need a chance to better ascertain where the economy is headed and whether the elevated   levels of inflation we have seen are persisting   I think there is significant downside risk to growth, as I mentioned, with housing being a   particularly acute example  I think our policies are taking a bite out of economic momentum, and I   agree with the analysis that our Chairman gave of at least the downside risk from that source   I am also disturbed by the trajectory of core inflation over the first half of the year  We’ll see two   CPI reports and other data by the next meeting, and I think maybe they will help us sort out just how   sustained the rise in inflation is truly likely to be   As I said, there’s no doubt in my mind that you can make a good case for raising rates today,   and frankly I probably would have ended up favoring that myself, despite the associated risk to   growth, if I thought there were an imminent danger of our losing our inflation-fighting credibility   with the markets and the general public  But that’s not the case at all in my view  The markets   don’t expect us to raise rates today  Yet inflation expectations are contained  President Lacker has   emphasized, and I agree with this, that we cannot take our credibility for granted  Economic models   that allow for imperfect credibility show that, when a central bank lacks full credibility, it should   respond somewhat more aggressively to inflation than would be optimal if it were completely   credible, which is President Lacker’s point  I agree with that  But such models don’t imply that the   central bank should act as if price stability were the sole objective  In the current context, that   suggests to me that our credibility is likely to be preserved as long as we continue to respond to   economic conditions in a manner that is basically consistent with the pattern that the Committee has   established over the past decade, which is similar to, say, a modified version of the Taylor rule  I   think that’s what we’ve been doing and essentially should continue to do   August 8, 2006 85 of 158                                                   An advantage of alternative B, and I think this is important, is that it does suggest concern   with inflation risks  I completely agree that we should express that concern  I expect and I hope   that inflation is going to edge down, but I don’t have a great deal of confidence in that forecast  I   would not want to see a statement suggesting that inflation risks are balanced at the present time; I   think it would be misleading  Our statement should, in effect, contain an asymmetric bias toward   tightening, and that’s true whether we actually raise rates or we don’t raise rates  So I would oppose   alternatives A and C, and I have no objection to substituting the language from alternative C for that   in B as Governor Kohn suggested   I find it hard to predict what the market reaction is going to be, but the language could end   up raising the market’s expectations concerning future rates  I would consider that appropriate in   light of the fact that standard policy rules and optimal policies reported in the Bluebook do suggest   that some further increases in the fed funds rate are likely to be called for in coming months  Our   communications should be consistent with that analysis and not indicate that we think we’re   probably done   So what’s the advantage of alternative B?  We can get off the escalator of 25 basis points per   meeting, take a pause, and evaluate incoming data without saying that we think we’re done with the   tightening phase  I do worry that a market psychology has developed that suggests that the minute   we stop raising rates we’re absolutely finished  In contrast to the Greenbook’s trajectory, which is   that we’re going to stay here for a while and not quickly reverse, markets now apparently anticipate   a rather rapid policy reversal The Greenbook assumption is a more sensible position—it would be   a more sensible set of market expectations than the idea that we will have a quick reversal  It would   not be unwelcome to me at all to see the market trajectory for the future bounce up   Thank you, Mr Chairman  I think this Committee has made huge strides   over the past decade toward greater transparency and more-effective communication, an example   being that—it was in 1994, I guess—we actually started issuing post-meeting statements  I think   we’ve seen significant dividends from those innovations  They have advanced the goals of both   policy effectiveness and accountability Our communication strategy at this point, in my view, is   August 8, 2006 124 of 158                      not fundamentally broken, and so I hope that what we can accomplish in the coming months is to   produce some improvements in current practice without going for wholesale changes    I thought today I would just touch on a couple of points that I’ve been thinking about   relating to communications, without getting into specifics  Frankly, I think the goals are fairly   noncontroversial I regard them as pretty much motherhood and apple pie issues  What’s   challenging is figuring out exactly how to use communications better both internally in the   Committee and externally to serve our policy goals    A couple of cautionary notes First, I want to endorse the point that Don made that we   should not put in our list of goals that our objective is to maximize transparency for the sake of   greater transparency The research in this area provides very ambiguous advice about how much   transparency is optimal  Second, we need to be careful that our communications don’t actually   impede the process of making appropriate policy decisions or our ability to do so  In contrast to   some of you, I have generally favored the inclusion of forward-looking language in post-meeting   statements, at least when the Committee has a reasonably clear idea of where policy is going, as   it has until quite recently  But including such guidance does have the potential for building false   expectations that can constrain our actions I hope that we will continue to provide forward-  looking guidance to the public because I think it does enhance the effectiveness of our policy   actions  But I think we will need to be very clear that those kinds of policy pronouncements are   not unconditional commitments to future actions, and we need to continue to emphasize data   dependence   I want also to emphasize a point that Cathy made, which is that communication is a   two-way street by which we communicate with markets and the public but we also receive   feedback from markets and the public concerning economic conditions and expectations   August 8, 2006 125 of 158                concerning the future We benefit from that feedback perhaps as much as or more than the   public benefits from the utterances that we make  That is a kind of independent reality check on   our forecast and analysis  Therefore, we have to be careful to ensure that these outside voices   aren’t drowned out by people who parrot back what we say  There are times when I have very   much worried that our communications have turned the markets into a mirror in which we see   little more than our own reflection   Now I’d like to spend just a couple of minutes on what to me is the most critical   challenge that we face as we go forward with our communication strategy It relates to the   apparent dichotomy between speaking with one voice and speaking as nineteen individuals  The   question is how to provide the public with the clearest and most coherent description of our   collective goals, strategies, and policies while continuing to promote an environment in which   diverse opinions among the nineteen FOMC participants are not only tolerated but encouraged    In the past we have managed this balancing act in different ways depending on the   circumstances, and we’re going to need that kind of flexibility as we go forward  On the one   hand, there are settings in which the Committee provides a reasonably unified view to the public;   that occurs in our post-meeting statements and also in the Chairman’s testimony to the Congress    On the other hand, we have a number of outlets for the expression of members’ diverse views—   the FOMC meeting minutes, participants’ speeches, and the ranges of FOMC forecasts that are   published in the Monetary Policy Report  I think that type of approach, of having some unified   statements and many opportunities for expression of diverse opinions, is useful  First, it gives   the public a reasonably accurate sense of both the areas of consensus in the FOMC and the range   of opinion Second, taking an “agree to disagree” approach lessens the likelihood that the   FOMC will become trapped in a kind of group-think mentality, in which we end up conforming   August 8, 2006 126 of 158                                for conformity’s sake  Of course, with the freedom to disagree, we do have a responsibility,   when we make statements, to be careful that those statements are not interpreted as representing   the views of the Committee as a whole  Finally, an approach that tries to limit the range of   issues on which a committee as big as ours attempts to speak with a united voice will end up   enhancing the sense of collegiality and cooperation in the Committee   The post-meeting statement provides a concrete example of the tricky balancing act that   we confront We all know it’s often easier to agree on a decision concerning the federal funds   rate than it is to agree in every detail about why we came to that decision, let alone about what   we expect going forward It’s impractical for the statement to convey the full range of our   opinions and to attempt to give very detailed explanations of the Committee’s thinking—again,    it tends to ignite disagreements about which specifics to include or to exclude and about even the   precise phrasing of each and every line So in thinking about that, I find myself wondering if a   better approach might be to recognize the intrinsic limits of the statement and to focus on   communicating only necessary elements that clearly lie within the consensus view, leaving fuller   discussion to the minutes and other things   The same issue about unity versus diversity is going to arise when we come to discussing   our longer-term inflation objective  I do greatly favor increasing clarity concerning the   Committee’s long-term inflation objective, but frankly I’m uncertain which approach is going to   be the most attractive to accomplish that  There is a range of possibilities One possibility is that   the Committee could provide that type of information through the publication of the range and   central tendency of participants’ longer-term inflation projections, which presumably reflect   ultimately their inflation objective  Another possibility is that the Committee could try to agree   on the specific numerical objective to communicate to the public, assuming that a sufficient   August 8, 2006 127 of 158                            consensus does exist in the Committee  Certainly, the benefit of the latter approach would be a   clearer signal to the public, which would be beneficial  But the tradeoff here is that we have to   be careful not to straitjacket participants into a particular view that they don’t fully endorse  So   as we go forward, I think we’re going to have to approach these issues case by case  In general,   as I think about the question of unity versus diversity in our communications, I am moving to the   conclusion that it’s probably better to err on the side of preserving the advantages of the diversity   of views at the cost of somewhat less of the clarity and coherence that would come if we could   provide a unified voice to the public  "
7777,2006-09-20,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Since our last meeting, the data bearing on the   near-term economic outlook suggest both slower economic growth and a bit less core price inflation   going forward  In terms of economic activity, the recent news has been uniformly negative,   resulting in a significant downward revision to growth in the Greenbook  Indeed, compared with   the outlook of other forecasters, the Greenbook’s projection of real GDP growth for the second half   of this year is quite pessimistic; it would now rank in the lower 5 percent tail of the distribution of   individual Blue Chip forecasters  I think this pessimism is not completely unfounded, however,   largely because of my worries about the housing sector  The speed of the falloff in housing activity   and the deceleration in house prices continue to surprise us  In the view of our contacts, the data lag   reality, and it seems a good bet that things will get worse before they get better     September 20, 2006 41 of 132                      A major homebuilder who is on one of our boards tells us that home inventory has gone   through the roof, so to speak  [Laughter]  He literally said that  With the share of unsold homes   topping 80 percent in some of the new subdivisions around Phoenix and Las Vegas, he has labeled   these the new ghost towns of the West  In fact, he described the situation at a recent board meeting   in Boise  He had toured some new subdivisions on the outskirts of Boise and discovered that the   houses, most of which are unoccupied, are now being dressed up to look occupied—with curtains,   things in the driveway, and so forth—so as not to discourage potential buyers  The general   assessment is that this overhang of speculative inventory implies that permits and starts will   continue to fall Inventory ratios will rise, and the market probably will not recover until 2008  So   far, builders remain hesitant to cut prices, fearing that doing so will cause a surge in cancellation   rates on sold but unfinished homes  However, builders now routinely offer huge incentives, and   price cuts appear inevitable  We have been following the Case Schiller house-price index, which is   based on house-price data in ten large urban markets, three of which are in California  Beginning in   May of this year, futures contracts on this price index also began trading; they suggest that house   prices will be falling at an annual rate of about 6 percent by the end of this year  Of course, trading   in this new futures market is still somewhat thin, but it is a signal that we need to keep a very close   eye on the incoming data and watch whether the housing slowdown is turning into a slump   Turning to inflation, core measures of consumer price inflation remain well above my   comfort zone, but the latest readings on consumer prices have been modestly better  Unlike the   Greenbook, I think the outlook for inflation has actually improved a bit since our last meeting   largely because of the recent drop in commodity and crude oil prices  The relief on energy prices is,   of course, very welcome, but we do have to be careful not to overestimate the extent to which past   energy price pass-through has been boosting core inflation  For example, airfares might seem like   September 20, 2006 42 of 132                              an obvious case in which outsized consumer price increases reflect energy price pass-through    However, our staff recently calculated the share of jet fuel costs to total airline operating expenses   and estimated that the jump in those costs likely accounted for less than half the rise in airfares this   year  Instead, airfares may reflect strong demand and constrained capacity as indicated by very high   airline passenger load factors  Still it seems likely that energy pass-through has played at least some   role in the run-up of core inflation this year, so any energy price pressure on core inflation is likely   to dissipate over time   Now, as David noted, the Greenbook has completely offset the favorable effects on core   inflation from lower energy prices by boosting the growth rate of labor costs  In contrast, I attach a   little less weight to the recent data on compensation per hour  My guess is that most of the   difference between hourly compensation and the ECI does relate to profit-linked items like bonuses   and stock options, and that suggests to me that marginal costs of production are not rising   significantly faster  Even if they are, it remains true that markups are high  So with sufficient   competitive pressures, firms have room to absorb cost increases without fully passing them into   prices   Finally, I want to add my compliments to those of others to the Board’s staff for a very   interesting analysis of inflation dynamics and monetary policy  As I mentioned at our last meeting,   it may be unduly pessimistic to assume that the recent rise in inflation will be highly persistent    Over the past ten years, estimated reduced-form models suggest that core inflation generally returns   to its sample average after several quarters  Recently our staff examined persistence at a more   disaggregated level and found that the same general pattern also holds for each of the major   components of the core PCE price index, with price inflation for durables only slightly more   persistent than price inflation for nondurables and services  In the current situation, this suite of   September 20, 2006 43 of 132                                       regressive models indicates that core PCE inflation should fall to just below 2 percent by the middle   of next year  I am not quite as optimistic as these simple models, but on balance my concerns about   the inflation outlook have been slightly alleviated by recent developments    Thank you, Mr Chairman  It is still too early to know whether our current   policy stance will succeed in lowering inflation to an acceptable level over time, but the data since   our last meeting reassured me that our decision to step off the escalator was wise, and I think we   should remain on the sidelines today  Recent inflation readings have contained no adverse   surprises  Inflation expectations remain contained  I think the inflation outlook is slightly improved   because of the reduction in energy and commodity prices, and growth during the second half of the   year now appears quite likely to fall short of trend  I view the risks to the attainment of our   objectives as more balanced than they were in August, and I certainly judge the downside risks to   growth to have increased  Your discussion of nonlinearities, Mr Chairman, was interesting, and it   is important to be sensitive to that possibility  That said, I think that the upside risks to inflation still   outweigh the downside risks to growth  With inflation projected to remain uncomfortably high over   a sustained period and with the economy still likely operating beyond potential, I favor alternative B   and think it’s important that we do at least hint at an upward bias for fed funds rate changes   With respect to the language, I prefer alternative B to alternative B+ because the latter points   to a greater possibility of a near-term tightening  I am concerned, however, that markets appear to   think that the fed funds rate has peaked and that cuts seem very likely by next spring  I do not think   alternative B would shake that view in the market  In contrast, I find myself more in agreement   with the Greenbook baseline for the fed funds rate, suggesting that we’re likely to want to hold it   near its present level for some time to bring inflation down  Now, markets obviously may turn out   to be right  But if, as the months go by, developments raise our confidence in the Greenbook   baseline view, then I think it would be useful for us to think about ways to signal to markets—   possibly through some forward-looking language—an extended policy path in somewhat clearer   terms than any of the options in table 1 currently allow   September 20, 2006 108 of 132                         "
7800,2006-10-24,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I have a question for David, and it concerns   the Greenbook alternative scenarios and the morals we should draw from them concerning the   Committee’s ability to affect inflation  The Greenbook this time had two scenarios showing how   the forecast would be affected by shocks to aggregate demand  One was a stronger demand   scenario; the other a housing correction with spillovers  Demand, of course, is much weaker in   that second scenario  In both of them, unemployment by the end of 2008 deviates markedly   from baseline, but even so there is virtually no effect on core inflation  It falls just 01 percent by   the end of 2008 in the negative housing shock scenario, even though unemployment rises to   6 percent  When I actually took a magnifying glass to the panel on page I-21 to look at the core   inflation paths, the shocks appeared actually to have a perverse effect on core inflation  The   housing correction shock has a perverse effect on core inflation in mid-2007, with inflation   actually up in the weak demand scenario and down a bit in the case where demand strengthens     Now, I scratched my head and asked myself if I could I invent a reason that this might   occur  My thoughts went to possible repercussions on the exchange rate that might have an   inflationary effect  But my trusty staff told me that it might be something else entirely—namely,   the way inflation expectations are modeled in FRB/US  They told me that inflation expectations   October 24-25, 2006 13 of 203    in these simulations aren’t much affected by any movement in unemployment with shocks like   this because implicitly those forming inflation expectations take the shock to be transitory  But   expectations are perturbed, and perversely so, by the reaction of the Fed to the shocks  In other   words, the Taylor rule type response that’s embodied in the scenarios has the Fed lowering the   fed funds rate to address economic weakness following a downside housing shock  My staff tells   me that the Fed’s cut to address the weakness then raises expected inflation, which passes   through into inflation in these scenarios, and that’s why we get a stronger housing correction   perversely raising inflation     Would you comment generally on this?  Do I have the correct understanding of how it   works?  If I do, do these simulations give an unduly pessimistic assessment of the effect of   aggregate demand shocks both on inflation and on our Committee’s ability to affect inflation   through policy?  Is it plausible to assume in your view that easier monetary policy has this direct   effect on inflation expectations, even when all it’s doing is offsetting a demand shock?     Even when there are negative demand shocks and even though   unemployment is rising?    They would see unemployment rising    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Five weeks have passed since our last FOMC   meeting, and not surprisingly the outlook does not appear to have changed in any fundamental   way  Recent data bearing on the near-term situation point to noticeably slower growth in the   third quarter than we anticipated at our last meeting  However, the Greenbook has revised up its   projection for growth during the current and next few quarters so that the overall effect on slack   next year is roughly neutral  This forecast strikes me as plausible, but there are few data thus far   to bear it out  Meanwhile, measures of consumer price inflation remain uncomfortably high,   although the latest readings have been very slightly better   With regard to the pace of economic activity, there’s uncertainty in all directions  In fact,   we seem to have a bimodal economy with a couple of weak sectors, and the rest of the economy   doing just fine  Those two weak sectors are, of course, housing and domestic auto production    Autos seem likely to have only a short-lived effect  In the case of housing, we agree with the   Greenbook assessment of housing activity and find it quite consistent with the reports of our   contacts in this sector  Besides the falloff in activity, house-price increases have also slowed   markedly  The Case-Shiller house-price index has been flat in recent months, and futures on this   index show outright declines next year  However, equity valuations for homebuilders, as Cathy   mentioned, have risen moderately in the past couple of months, following large declines over the   previous year, and we interpret that as providing some indication that the expected future path of   October 24-25, 2006 49 of 203    home prices has at least stopped deteriorating  Of course, housing is a relatively small sector of   the economy, and its decline should be self-correcting  So the bigger danger is that weakness in   house prices could spread to overall consumption through wealth effects  This development   would deepen and extend economic weakness, potentially touching off a nonlinear type of   downward dynamic that could trigger a recession  But so far at least, there are no signs of such   spillovers  Consumption spending seems on track for healthy growth     Nonetheless, the growth estimate for the third quarter begins with a 1 and just barely    Any time a forecast is that low, it’s reasonable to consider the possibility that the economy could   enter recession  So for this reason, we, like the Board’s staff, took a careful look at various   approaches to assess this issue, including yield-curve-based models, past forecast errors, leading   indicator models, and surveys  Our bottom line is that we agree with the basic results reported in   Monday’s nonfinancial briefing  The highest probability of recession that we found, around   40 percent, was obtained from a model developed by a Board staff member  The model includes   the slope of the yield curve and the level of the funds rate  An issue with this result is that   long-term rates may currently be low, hence the yield curve inverted, for unusual and not very   well understood reasons having to do with the risk premium  Estimates from the other   approaches came in with lower probabilities  Finally, other financial developments that could   presage future economic performance, like stock market movements and risk spreads, suggest   some optimism on the part of financial market participants   So our sense is that, except for housing and autos, the economy appears to be doing quite   well  Indeed, the recent rather sharp drop in energy prices could boost consumption spending   even more than assumed in the Greenbook  While this is a possibility, it seems more likely to   October 24-25, 2006 50 of 203    me that households ran down their savings to fill their gas tanks when gas prices rose and are,   therefore, likely to use their recent savings at the pump to bolster their finances, at least partly   Overall, under the assumption of an unchanged funds rate, our forecast shows a beautiful   soft landing, with real GDP growing at a moderately below-trend pace for a few more quarters   and homing in near trend thereafter  But I must admit that we got this forecast essentially by   averaging the strong and weak sides of the economy  I think that way of proceeding is   reasonable, and I hope the landing happens that way  But I acknowledge there is plenty of risk    We may end up instead with either the strong or the weak side dominating the outcome  For   example, if the housing market decline does not spread significantly to consumption, we could   end up with a strong economy in fairly short order  However, if it does spread, the slowdown   could last quite a while  Scenarios like this are nicely spelled out in the alternative simulations in   the Greenbook   Which way things go is a key issue, given that we’re in the vicinity of full employment    The desired soft landing depends on growth remaining below trend long enough to offset the   moderate amount of excess demand that appears to be in the economy so that inflation can trend   gradually lower  The slight drop in unemployment, to 46 percent, in September did not help in   that regard, and I should note that recent comments by our head office directors almost uniformly   supported the idea that labor markets, especially for skilled workers, are tight  However, we do   expect the unemployment rate to edge higher over the next year in response to sluggish growth   Our forecast for core consumer inflation comes down a bit faster than foreseen by the   Greenbook  We have core PCE price inflation edging down from just under 2½ percent this year   to just over 2 percent in 2007 and see a good chance that it may fall a bit below 2 percent in the   following year  We see the relief on energy prices as helpful, although we keep trying to resist   October 24-25, 2006 51 of 203    any temptation to overestimate the extent to which past energy price pass-through has been   boosting core inflation  Inflation also may benefit from an unwinding of the earlier strong   pressures on rents  Finally, as in the discussion we had earlier about the alternative Greenbook   scenario, we think inflation may have become less persistent over the past decade, and this is one   reason that we’re a bit more optimistic than the Greenbook about the possible degree of   disinflation over the next couple of years  But on balance, I have to admit we don’t have a   perfect understanding of why inflation has been so high over the past few years, and so I try to   remain humble, as always, in my predictions   My bottom line is this  I see a non-negligible chance that the downside risks to the   economy, emanating especially from housing, could produce a recession in coming quarters, but   there’s a very good chance that the spillovers will be sufficiently modest that the economy will   avoid a recession  I also see a significant chance that growth could modestly exceed potential    In that sense, the overall risks to the outlook for real GDP growth could be characterized as   balanced  In addition, I see quite a bit of uncertainty about inflation going forward with the risks   to my forecast probably being a bit to the high side    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support keeping rates unchanged  On the   wording, I guess I lean slightly toward B+ over B, but it’s not a matter that I feel strongly about, and   I could certainly accept either alternative  I remain quite uncertain about how the various forces in   the economy are going to play out  As I said in the economic go-round, I think that, if we maintain   the current stance of policy, most likely we will get the desirable features of a soft landing with   inflation coming down gradually  But I do think there are substantial risks for output growth  I   guess they’re balanced around moderate growth, but I remain concerned about a downside that   would include a period of sustained and significant weakness  On the inflation front, I do think that   the risks remain tilted in the direction of higher inflation both because I’m uncertain just how the   inflation process is working and because, while I believe inflation will come down, I don’t have   confidence in the scenario underlying it  If we don’t get the play-out of the downside housing risks,   I think there is some probability that growth will actually be sufficiently strong that we’ll get some   upward pressure on inflation from the labor market  We’re going to learn a lot by December  A lot   of data are coming out that will bear on growth, inflation pressures, the labor market, and so forth    It clearly makes sense to wait   I guess I’m slightly attracted to B+ over B because I think the language more clearly   suggests an upward bias for future rate changes and that does reflect my view of the risks to   inflation and the likely path of policy  At a minimum, it seems to push back a bit against the   market’s view that we’re going to be unwinding rather quickly  But I take the arguments that have   been made around the table for B as opposed to B+  I’m not sure that there really is much to be   October 24-25, 2006 106 of 203    gained by changing the language we have in place on this, and leaving it alone may be the wiser   course at the end of the day  On section 2, I think that Governor Kohn made a good argument for   changing that language  Again, I could go either way  Finally, on section 3, I prefer the wording in   alternative A to that in alternative B  Referring to the high level of prices of energy and other   commodities, given that we’ve had a substantial decline in energy prices, really does seem a bit out   of date and a bit out of touch    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll address the major questions posed in   Vincent’s memo in the order presented  First, I support the enunciation of a long-run numerical   inflation objective  My views on the benefits and costs of enunciating publicly such an objective   October 24-25, 2006 168 of 203    have changed very little since we discussed this topic in January 2005  Beginning with the   benefits, I believe a numerical objective would focus our internal policy deliberations and   improve their coherence, particularly if the Committee does agree on a common objective  A   numerical objective appropriately communicated could also improve the public’s understanding   of our goals and the strategies for attaining them, thereby helping to align market perceptions   with those of the Committee  Solid anchoring of the public’s inflation expectations could aid us   in avoiding deflation in the vicinity of the zero bound on interest rates and could reduce the   potential for destabilizing inflation scares following adverse supply shocks, thus enhancing the   scope for monetary policy to respond to their real effects  Finally, the public enunciation of the   long-run inflation objective would enhance accountability and transparency in a way that I think   is appropriate  It’s a desirable goal in a democracy   Although I do perceive there to be net benefits from enunciating a numerical objective, I   do not think these gains are enormous relative to the status quo  The public already has a   reasonably good idea of the Committee’s inflation preferences, and inflation expectations are   now pretty well, if not perfectly, anchored  Moreover, the evidence, as I read it, suggests that a   central bank’s credibility on inflation depends more on its actual record of performance than on   its utterances about its objectives  So no dramatic improvement in the sacrifice ratio seems   likely   Interestingly, a recent survey that several of you have referred to, and I’m assuming most   people have seen, by our former colleague Larry Meyer finds that only a minority of the   respondents favored the Committee’s adoption of a numerical inflation objective  Market   participants appear far more interested in improved communication concerning our assessment   of the near-term outlook and prospects for monetary policy, and that suggests that as we go   October 24-25, 2006 169 of 203    forward we should place considerable emphasis, as Governor Mishkin emphasized, on enhancing   our forecasts in the context of the Monetary Policy Report    The enunciation of a numerical inflation objective could have costs as well as benefits    My main worry is the potential for de-emphasis on the other part of our mandate, namely   maximum sustainable employment  Such a de-emphasis could occur in the minds of the public,   and I could easily see how it could affect our own deliberations  I think the current situation   provides a case in point  If the structural Phillips curve has indeed become as flat as FRB/US   estimates, an optimal policy for lowering inflation to target brings it down exceptionally slowly   when equal weights are placed on the inflation and the output gaps in the loss function  You can   see that in the Bluebook simulations  With the public focused on a numerical inflation objective,   however, it is naturally tempting to seek more rapid convergence to a target  I think we feel   uncomfortable with the paths that we see in the Bluebook, and it would be easy to effectively   down-weight our emphasis on the employment objective  Interestingly, almost half of the   respondents to Meyer’s survey believe that the enunciation of a numerical inflation objective   would impair the FOMC’s ability to meet its maximum employment objective  Therefore,   enunciation of a numerical inflation goal, in my view, must occur in the context of a clear   statement concerning our commitment to the dual objectives  In this regard, I remain attracted to   our Chairman’s 2003 suggestion that we state the target inflation rate as a long-run objective   only and emphasize—again, to paraphrase our Chairman—that in deciding how quickly to move   toward the long-run inflation objective, the FOMC will always take into account the implications   for near-term economic and financial stability  Consideration of the horizon issue is mentioned   in the other question section of Vincent’s memo, and I, for one, take this issue to be crucial and   October 24-25, 2006 170 of 203    would be unable to support a numerical objective unless the horizon can be long enough and   flexible enough to respond appropriately to employment considerations   Now, I’d like to turn to the second major question, which deals with governance in   essence  Will the inflation objective be chosen by the Committee members or by the meeting   participants, and will it be chosen as a group decision or by summarizing our individual views?  I   think there are enormous advantages to reaching a joint Committee decision  This approach   would provide the clearest focus in our policy deliberations and Committee communications, and   it would probably work best in anchoring inflation expectations  It would also provide a   well-defined standard against which we could be held accountable  However, I, too, recognize   that it is probably wise to move in this direction cautiously  I would certainly support, as a first   step, Governor Mishkin’s proposal to report a consensus of responses to an annual survey   concerning long-run numerical inflation objectives of the participants  This approach would be a   measured stance, more measured than a Committee vote, and I think it would be less likely to be   divisive within the Committee and vis-à-vis the Congress  Such a survey respects the possible   diversity within the Committee, and the Congress might be less likely to object to the Committee   participants’ stating their individual interpretations of the monetary policy mandate than to the   formal adoption of an inflation objective  Of course, choosing to use a survey now would not   preclude us from voting as a Committee on a single objective later on   We could, as an alternative, communicate the Committee’s long-run inflation objective   through lengthening the horizon of our inflation forecasts  Such an approach, however, has   significant disadvantages in my view relative to a straightforward survey of opinions  Consider   the current situation  If the extended Greenbook forecast is accurate, adding just a year or two to   the forecast we prepare for the semiannual Monetary Policy Report would not work  In fact, to   October 24-25, 2006 171 of 203    convey our implicit inflation objectives, if we accept the optimal policy path in the Bluebook, we   might have to add five years or more to those forecasts  Moreover, if we extend the inflation   forecast, we will also need to extend forecasts, as Governor Mishkin noted, of real GDP and the   unemployment rate, and some members of the public and the Congress could misinterpret these   estimates as the Committee’s goals for these variables; at a minimum, such estimates could lead   to unproductive discussions about what the correct estimates of those key concepts are  That is   an exercise I would not relish   Finally, on the question of whether policy settings will be affected by a long-run inflation   objective  In some sense, the answer has to be “yes”  For example, I argued that the benefit of   having an inflation objective is that it would help to anchor public expectations of policy, and if   it did, it would affect bond rates and other financial variables and their responses, presumably in   constructive ways, and would therefore feed back onto policy   But the real issue is this  Will a publicly announced inflation objective affect the weights   that we put on the elements of our dual mandate?  Will it cause us to respond more strongly to   inflation and less strongly to employment?  As I said before, I am concerned that this could   happen, if only inadvertently  If we go this route, I myself would make every effort to prevent   such a distortion to the weights that I use in analyzing policy decisions   "
7824,2006-12-12,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I have to admit that this time around I found it   pretty challenging to read the tea leaves on economic activity  The data are providing distinctly   contradictory signals  For example, several key indicators of aggregate spending have come in   below expectations, and the Greenbook now sees real GDP growth this quarter and the next   averaging a mere 1½ percent  At the same time, the labor market continues to be strong and shows   no clear signs of weakening, as evidenced by the November employment report  The latest   information on inflation has been fairly favorable; but even with some signs of easing, the   underlying trend in core consumer price inflation remains above my comfort zone   The last time we met I described the situation as a bimodal economy with strength in most   sectors and weakness limited to just two sectors, housing and domestic auto production  This   description by and large remains apt  The correction in the housing sector has continued, even   sharpening somewhat compared with our expectations  Still, there are some encouraging signs that   the demand for housing may be stabilizing, probably assisted by recent declines in mortgage rates    After a precipitous fall, home sales appear to have leveled off  In addition, equity valuations for   homebuilders have continued to rise in the past couple of months, suggesting that the outlook for   these businesses may be improving  Finally, the gap between housing prices and fundamentals may   not be as large as some calculations suggest because real long-term interest rates have fallen quite a   bit recently, raising the fundamental value of housing  That said, the housing sector on balance is a   December 12, 2006 23 of 134         source of downside risk, and the risk could be magnified if mortgage rates were to rise again as   foreseen by the Greenbook   Outside residential investment, GDP growth has remained solid  Consumption has   continued to be strong; indeed, I think there are upside risks to consumer spending, given the   Greenbook’s forecast of a significant rise in the saving rate  But recent indicators of nonresidential   investment and activity in the manufacturing sector have come in below expectations  The key   question is whether these data hint at a crack in the economy’s armor that could widen  It’s   obviously too early to tell, but these weaknesses bear careful monitoring     Overall, the data on spending paint a clear picture of an economy growing well below trend,   but it seems as though the BEA hasn’t delivered this message to the BLS  [Laughter]  The very   latest data show payroll employment growing steadily  The household data are even more alarming    The unemployment rate has declined ½ percentage point over the past year and now stands at   4½ percent, ½ percentage point below our estimate of the NAIRU  My business contacts tell me the   same thing  Labor markets are tight, and jobs are hard to fill, especially for skilled positions  But   some other indicators suggest that labor markets may have softened a bit  In particular, the   Conference Board index of job market perceptions, based on a survey of households, declined in   both October and November  This index is historically very highly correlated with the   unemployment rate, but now it’s sending a different signal, suggesting that labor markets are   roughly in balance  Similarly, in November fewer firms reported openings that are hard to fill   The fall in the unemployment rate this year is hard to square with Okun’s law  Over the past   four quarters, GDP growth has averaged 3 percent, just 03 above the Board’s estimate of potential   GDP growth  A standard Okun’s law calculation suggests that this should have led to a decline in   the unemployment rate of only about 01 percentage point  In fact, however, it declined   December 12, 2006 24 of 134         05 percentage point  Of course, labor markets do adjust with a lag, so we may just need to be   patient and wait for Okun’s law to reassert itself as assumed in the Greenbook forecast  An   alternative possibility is that the output gap is more positive than assumed in the Greenbook because   of lower growth in potential output or more-rapid growth in actual output  In his presentation,   David noted the possibility that the growth rate of potential output may be lower than even the   downwardly revised estimate in the Greenbook  It is also possible—and, in fact, there are   indications—that actual output growth may have been faster than the pace reflected in measured   GDP  Growth in domestic income has outpaced GDP growth by ¾ percentage point over the past   year  Now I know that when someone mentions the statistical discrepancy, eyes start to glaze over    But I raise this issue because it could have important implications for the outlook  If the gross   domestic income measure ends up being more accurate, then the decline in the unemployment rate   this year would not be surprising  Going forward, more-rapid output growth would imply a lower   path for unemployment, potentially adding to inflation pressures   Turning to inflation itself, the news has been pretty good on balance since our last meeting    We expect core PCE price inflation to edge down from just under 2½ percent this year to about   2 percent in 2008  We came to this forecast balancing two main pieces of news  On the one hand,   recent labor market data point to a lower path for the unemployment rate than before, and all else   being equal, this boosts our inflation forecast a bit  Offsetting this effect, on the other hand, is the   huge downward revision in compensation per hour  When these data came out, I let out a big sigh   of relief  The revised data are more consistent with the indications we were getting from the   employment cost index and suggest that wage growth has remained contained  In contrast, my   contacts report intensifying wage pressures, resulting in part from more-frequent employee quits   and outside offers  Even so, my contacts do not report that these developments are exerting   December 12, 2006 25 of 134         significant pressure on their profit margins or prices, suggesting continued strong productivity   growth  But that, in turn, conflicts with the data on productivity growth in the nonfarm business   sector, which have been weak, not strong  Output per hour in the nonfarm business sector increased   only about 1½ percent over the past year, well below its trend  But there is reason to believe that   this decline may overstate the slowing in productivity growth, given continued strong growth in   productivity in the nonfinancial corporate sector  At least part of this discrepancy between   nonfinancial corporate and nonfarm productivity growth reflects the gap I mentioned before   between gross domestic income and gross domestic product  If the GDI numbers are, in fact, more   accurate, that alone could add nearly 1 percentage point to nonfarm business productivity growth,   perhaps reconciling the reports by my contacts of intensifying wage pressure along with an absence   of pressure on prices and margins   In summary, I continue to view a soft landing with moderating inflation as my best-guess   forecast, conditional on maintaining the current stance of policy  But there are sizable risks on both   sides to the outlook for growth, and the downside risks are now more palpable  There is, likewise, a   great deal of uncertainty about inflation going forward; in this case, the risks remain biased to the   high side    I read that as suggesting that the growth of actual output might be   understated  I suppose one could also contemplate the possibility that potential might be   understated but I was hypothesizing that actual output is understated, and hence the gap between   actual and potential may be larger than the Greenbook assumes   December 12, 2006 26 of 134          Thank you  [Laughter]    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I think the pause initiated back in August is   paying dividends  We’ve been able to gather valuable economic intelligence at no discernible cost   to FOMC credibility  Given the recent signs of weakness in economic activity, I do think the   downside risk to the outlook has intensified  A further rate increase at this time would   unnecessarily increase the odds of a much sharper and more-damaging economic slowdown  Even   though inflation has shown some signs of moderating, the risks to a gradual decline in inflation   remain clearly biased to the upside  Weighing these two risks, I still see inflation as the   predominant risk, and therefore, like Governor Kohn, I am comfortable with the risk assessment in   section 4 as it stands   I think we’re entering a critical phase for policy  Inflation may not come down as desired,   and a further rate increase may be needed or, hard as it is to imagine, market participants may end   up being right that the economy will slow much faster than we anticipate and call for rate cuts  We   need to be in a position to react quickly and flexibly to change, whatever the circumstances may be,   and I think alternative B accomplishes that because it accurately reaffirms our concern regarding   inflation while it leaves our options open   December 12, 2006 101 of 134         With respect to language, my first choice, like President Minehan’s, would be to use the   language for section 2 in alternative C  It omits any reference to recent data or to what we   anticipated and simply adds the word “substantial,” which I regard as a nod to recent data that   suggest a greater slowing in housing  My second choice for section 2 would be to use the substitute   language in the Christmas-colored exhibit 5  I also support President Minehan’s suggestion to omit   any reference to what was anticipated because I agree with her and with the point that President   Poole made before our meeting—that referring to differences from what was anticipated simply   raises the questions of who forms the anticipation, what the anticipation was, and when it was   formed  In addition, I think it’s a bit misleading because, although some recent data on the spending   side have been weaker than we may have anticipated, we’ve also had data from the labor markets   that have been stronger than we anticipated  So I fear that alternative B, section 2, leaves the false   impression that we have significantly revised downward both our view of the outlook for growth   and, accordingly, our estimate of inflation risks  "
7853,2007-01-30,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Recent data on economic activity have been   loaded with upside surprises for most spending categories and also for labor markets  Our response,   like the Greenbook, has been to boost our estimate of growth last quarter and our forecast for   growth this quarter  For 2007 as a whole, we have revised up our projection for real GDP growth   about ¼ percentage point, to about 2¾ percent, which is just a bit below our estimate of the trend,   which is a bit higher than the Greenbook  This performance continues to reflect the so-called   bimodal economy with weakness in housing and autos coupled with strength almost everywhere   else   Looking beyond the first quarter, we interpret recent data as suggesting that the drag from   both weak sectors is likely to diminish, providing impetus for an acceleration of activity later this   year  Even so, the Greenbook forecasts, and we agree, that other factors will likely offset this   January 30-31, 2007 35 of 255    acceleration so that GDP will grow slightly below trend in 2007  In particular, the Greenbook   hypothesizes that the growth of consumer spending will slow, with the saving rate rising from   minus ¾ percent at the end of last year to plus 1 percent at the end of next year  This forecast   strikes us as quite reasonable  House-price appreciation has slowed dramatically, and the impetus it   has given consumption should diminish over time  In addition, the Greenbook notes, and Larry   emphasized, that consumer spending has grown more rapidly than fundamentals can explain, and   it’s sensible to predict some unwinding of this pattern  Such an outcome, however, would represent   a noticeable change in the trend of the saving rate  So to me the possibility that the saving rate will   not, in fact, rebound to the extent anticipated in the Greenbook constitutes a serious upside risk to   the outlook  Of course, the staff has emphasized this   An alternative simulation in the Greenbook illustrates that if spending instead advances in   line with income, the unemployment rate would decline noticeably further from a level that is   already low  It is precisely because we are starting from a situation in which labor markets are   already arguably tight that the upward revisions to growth during the intermeeting period   particularly concern me  Some period of below-trend growth may ultimately be necessary to   address inflationary pressures emanating from the labor market     In December, I emphasized the puzzle presented by the combination of an apparently   sluggish economy and a robust job market  Upward revisions to estimated growth in the fourth and   first quarters resolve a portion of that discrepancy  Even so, Okun’s law still suggests that the   excess demand in labor markets as reflected in the low unemployment rate is abnormally large   relative to that in goods markets as reflected in estimates of the output gap  The current low   unemployment rate may turn out to have benign implications for inflation  For example, labor   market tightness may well diminish somewhat over time, given that the lags between output growth   January 30-31, 2007 36 of 255    and labor market adjustments can be quite variable  Another benign possibility is that the   unemployment rate may be overstating the tightness of labor markets  For example, some   indicators of labor market conditions, like the Conference Board index for job market perceptions,   suggest a bit of softening  Indeed, available indexes of labor compensation do not provide   compelling evidence of cost pressures emanating from the labor market  However, compensation   data are mixed, and I must admit that the signal from them is somewhat confusing   While I remain concerned about the risk that labor market pressures could boost inflation   over time, I’m still fairly optimistic about the outlook for inflation overall  Core inflation has come   down in recent months, which is welcome, although we must be careful not to overreact  Recent   favorable data could reflect the dissipation of pressures from energy prices and owners’ equivalent   rent; these sources of disinflation are inherently transitory, and once they are fully worked through   the system, we will be left with the influence of more-enduring factors, such as the extent of excess   demand or supply in labor and product markets  If these markets are, in fact, unduly tight, we could   eventually see rising inflation  Inflation expectations also matter for the inflation outlook, and I see   the stability of inflation expectations as contributing to a favorable inflation prognosis  As I   previously mentioned, my staff and other researchers find some evidence that inflation has become   less persistent over the past decade, a period during which inflation and inflation expectations have   been low and stable  Both survey and market-based estimates suggest that longer-term inflation   expectations remain stable and well anchored   So to sum up, I continue to view a soft landing with moderating inflation as my best-guess   forecast, conditional on maintaining the current stance of policy  We expect core PCE price   inflation to edge down from 2¼ percent last year to about 2 percent in 2007  While there are risks   on both sides of the outlook for growth, I’m a little more focused on the upside risks after the recent   January 30-31, 2007 37 of 255    spate of strong data  It’s encouraging that the recent inflation news has been good  However,   there’s a great deal of uncertainty about inflation going forward, and to me these risks remain biased   to the high side    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support Bluebook alternative B  I think we   should maintain the current stance of policy because it is likely to foster an economy that   gradually moves toward a soft landing  At the same time, the upward bias in the risk assessment   is consistent with my view that upside risks do predominate for both growth and inflation  My   best guess still is that this year’s growth will be slightly below trend with the current stance of   policy  But as I indicated yesterday, for me the risks have shifted more to the upside given   recent news  Housing remains a concern, but I think the prospects for a really serious housing   collapse that spreads to consumer spending have diminished substantially  I am focused, as I   said yesterday, on upside risks to activity, possibly coming from consumer spending  On the   inflation front, the news has been good, and I continue to think for a variety of reasons, including   my views on persistence, that core inflation will edge down over the year; but clearly it is too   January 30-31, 2007 104 of 255    soon to conclude that a new trend has set in  To me, the upside risk to inflation seems palpable,   especially because labor markets have tightened  Although I agree with President Plosser that   the Phillips curve has certainly appeared to flatten in recent years, most estimates that I have   seen of Phillips curves suggest that the relationship between changes in unemployment and   changes in inflation, even though it may have become smaller, is still significant  The lags may   be long so that its effect might not show up very much over the next couple of years, but it is a   significant source of long-term risk    I’m pleased with the language suggested for alternative B  I think it effectively updates   developments since our last meeting, and I favor keeping the same wording on the risk   assessment that we used last time  That wording still conveys a sense of upside bias  I don’t see   a compelling reason to change, and I think it still works     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I also want to begin by complimenting the staff   for a very thorough and thoughtful set of background materials  In recent years we have made   notable strides toward increasing transparency, and that has served to enhance public accountability   and to improve the efficacy of policymaking  At this point, further enhancements to our   communications are both possible and desirable, and I think our economic projections may be an   area with low-hanging fruit  Surveys suggest that market participants attach a very high priority to   improved information concerning the Committee’s outlook for the economy and monetary policy    In fact, 83 percent of the respondents to the Macroeconomic Advisers’ survey accorded higher   priority to this objective than to the adoption of a numerical inflation objective  So the provision of   more-detailed and more-timely information concerning the outlook would help market participants   form sensible expectations and possibly improve internal discourse  We have been publishing   forecasts for almost thirty years, so we’re a pioneer in this area  But I think we have fallen behind   January 30-31, 2007 153 of 255    state-of-the-art practice, and I think it would be useful now to make incremental improvements to   the governance structure, the content, and the procedures of this program   So now let me address each of the questions that Vince sent out in the memo  The first is   whether we should provide one forecast or many  My answer is many  We are too large and too   geographically dispersed to make a unified option practical  The Bank of England has a committee   a little less than half of our size  They seem to be the largest to produce a unified forecast, but the   process is reportedly time-consuming and contentious, and I fear that the attempt to arrive at a   single forecast could end up undermining our collegiality, not to mention our effectiveness  More   important than the practical side is that a unified forecast is not desirable  I think we hold a diversity   of views, and I believe that diversity should be respectfully represented in all aspects of our   communication  That diversity goes beyond conditioning assumptions, like the price of oil  Some   of us have divergent conceptions about the structure of the economy and the monetary policy   transmission mechanism  Given the diversity of views, it’s fair to say that in most meetings, no   unified forecast or forecast story even exists, and I don’t see how participants who fundamentally   disagree could, if we tried to produce a unified forecast, speak in public about the economy without   revealing those differences  The differences, on balance, are a source of strength  They reduce the   odds that we will become trapped in “group think” mentality, conforming for conformity’s sake,   and reduce the risk that we will miss important insights that could help us avoid errors  The   problem is that this divergence makes it challenging to articulate the type of unified Committee   views that I think markets really crave   The first question goes on to ask whether individual forecasts should be released in a   disaggregated format or presented in an aggregated way  I prefer the aggregated approach that we   use now with a range and central tendency  Most of the time we’ll end up with the center of gravity   January 30-31, 2007 154 of 255    for the forecasts that can be described in a useful way, even though there are divergent views  Also,   conveying how we interpret the body of forecasts will be more useful to the public than simply   releasing nineteen separate projection documents  In principle, the drawback of a central tendency   is that the results may not be entirely coherent because different forecasters get excluded for   different variables  Based on our past experience, this seems to me more a theoretical possibility   than an actual problem, but I was intrigued by the discussion in the R&S Division’s memo on how   it could be possible to identify an entire set of variables for an individual participant as an outlier   and exclude them  I think that’s worth thinking more about  Finally, besides distributing a central   tendency and range, providing a histogram showing the full frequency distribution of forecasts   could be useful   The second question asks whether we should base our forecasts on common assumptions   concerning the stance of policy and other factors or, alternatively, appropriate policy and opinions   about other factors  I’m certainly in the “appropriate policy” camp  I think the alternative is   problematic  Several times in the past we’ve discussed the possibility of adopting a common   assumption of a constant interest rate, but that approach could lead to forecasts that would not be   seen as desirable by Committee members  For example, since a constant interest rate may not be   the appropriate policy, it could produce a forecast with inflation that’s high and rising, and I think   that would be confusing to the public and not convey our sense of what would happen  The   problem can be especially pronounced as the forecast period is lengthened  A second issue is, as I   said, that participants differ on the structure of the economy, and any common policy assumption   may make sense in one model but not another  The same comment applies to all the conditions and   variables—even things like the value of the dollar and house prices are endogenous variables that   January 30-31, 2007 155 of 255    should be determined within the model being used  So imposing common assumptions with a   variety of models could lead to incoherent results     Now, the third and fourth questions concern whether a narrative description of the forecast   should be released and how it should be prepared  I think we should provide a minutes-style   narrative description of the forecasts  Experience suggests that there is commonly considerable   overlap among the FOMC participants regarding the factors that are critical in assessing economic   trends  For example, right now a majority of us are focusing on developments affecting housing   and motor vehicles, as well as the implications of tight labor markets for inflation over time, and   that was reflected in the Chairman’s summary yesterday  These factors are usually emphasized in   the portion of the minutes that describes participants’ assessment of economic conditions  The   minutes do a good job of describing the state of opinion and also briefly describe divergent views   concerning the economy, and the narrative should also describe the divergent views   Vincent’s background memo emphasizes the need for speed in releasing this information   because new data can make forecasts stale  In addition, the Chairman’s monetary policy testimony   and the issuance of the Monetary Policy Report typically occur before the release of the minutes   from the January and June meetings  So it may be desirable to devise a procedure that would allow   the forecasts and the forecast narrative to be released before the minutes themselves  We could   delegate the preparation and release of the narrative to the Chairman  It seems to me that he has   over the past several meetings provided an excellent summary of our discussions as soon as they   concluded, and that’s the type of thing that I would expect in the narrative  My preference,   however, would be for the Committee to agree on and approve the narrative  A Committee vote on   the forecast narrative would avoid the possible disagreement that might arise after the release of the   narrative but before the approval of the minutes  One way to expedite the preparation of the   January 30-31, 2007 156 of 255    narrative is for all of us before the meeting to share our individual forecasts along with a brief   written story explaining them  I thought Vice Chairman Geithner’s summary really is an excellent   template of the form that such a submission could take  Most of the time we would find that there is   an emerging majority view and a few alternative views  We could allow time toward the conclusion   of an FOMC meeting to discuss longer-run forecasts, and this would provide the staff with some   additional information concerning the Committee’s views  I would hope it would be feasible for the   staff then to prepare a minutes-style summary of views rapidly after the meeting, circulate it, and   allow a very limited time and very few iterations for comments and revisions so that the narrative   could be approved and released before the full minutes were approved   Now, I just want to turn to the technical questions that Vince posed  With regard to the   frequency of forecasts, the shelf life of projections generally is long enough to support a quarterly   production frequency  However, given that we want to provide forecasts for the Monetary Policy   Reports in January and June, it’s difficult to see how we could evenly distribute four forecasts over   the year  The problem is that we have only two meetings between January and June  It would be   possible to spread three forecasts evenly over the year in January, June, and October, and eight   might also work well, but I fear that there could be a staff insurrection  [Laughter]  In any event, on   the question of the forecast horizon, I’m fine with maintaining our current practice, but I would not   object to a small increase in the forecast period  All we really know about the more distant future is   what our ultimate goals are, and I would prefer that we provide that information in a more direct   way  The next question is which variables should be included  I’d prefer to continue to include   forecasts for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and some measure of consumer inflation,   depending on the interaction with what we may later decide about the inflation objective  I don’t   think any of the other central banks forecast nominal GDP  I would drop that, and I think   January 30-31, 2007 157 of 255    consideration should be given to providing information on the fed funds rate, perhaps the fourth-  quarter level for each year of the forecast or, alternatively, a qualitative statement about direction    The policy path is necessary for understanding and interpreting any forecast, and it was at the top of   Macroeconomic Advisers’ list for what the private sector wants to see  Large and widening error   bands around the central tendency would help stifle the potential for markets to interpret these   forecasts as commitments  Moreover, narrative comments on the forecasts could emphasize the   conditionality and data dependence of policy  We will obviously need to do at least one trial run in   producing forecasts before going public with the new system, and I would propose that we include a   numerical forecast and a discussion of the fed funds rate path in that trial just to see how it works   Of course, all these variables will be forecast with considerable uncertainty, and I think it   would be helpful to convey this fact clearly  One way to do it would be to put confidence bands   around the forecast numbers, and they could be derived by looking at the track records of the   FOMC, the CBO, the Blue Chip survey, the Survey of Professional Forecasters, and so forth  One   could imagine adjusting them a bit based on Committee discussions—for example, when   participants note that they see the risks as abnormally large or asymmetric  Information on forecast   accuracy could be presented in a table attached to the FOMC forecasts to justify our choice of   uncertainty bands  My staff has developed a mock-up of a graphical approach to representing the   forecast and forecast uncertainty bands, and I brought some copies of what that might look like for   you to take a look at  I thought I would just pass it around the table here5    So in summary, I’m in favor of enhancing the forecast information that we release  The key   point for me is that we should provide information on the diversity of opinion in the Committee   about the numbers and the stories, and I think procedures like the one I described to produce a                                                     5 Material distributed by President Yellen is appended to this transcript (appendix 5)   January 30-31, 2007 158 of 255    minutes-style discussion of our stories would be effective and permit this information to be released   in a sufficiently timely manner    Has this sheet come around to you?    If you look at this sheet—we might do this for all the variables—the bottom   right panel shows the federal funds rate  These are obviously made-up numbers  But we have the   history, and people would just add their own forecast for Q4 for the federal funds rate  We’d report   a central tendency, and we would develop error bands around it resulting in the type of display you   would see  So obviously it would be a range of opinions based on appropriate policies reported by   the individual members    Yes, the dark band in the center would be the central tendency of our   reports, and the thinner, longer lines would be bands generated by numbers we use for forecast   uncertainty    We would have to discuss how to produce that, but it might be based on, for   example, our FRB/US forecast errors that we would apply to the central tendency range    With respect to the story?    Well, we’re submitting numbers    Yes, exactly    Or our own forecasts    We don’t forecast the federal funds rate, but we do have data on our own   errors with respect to the other variables    No, I think that would not be a very useful procedure  "
7875,2007-03-20,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Recent data on economic activity have been   downbeat in many sectors, and I agree with the general tenor of the Greenbook that the near-term   outlook is weaker than before  Indeed, we have cut expected growth this year almost ½   percentage point, to 2¼ percent  This pace of growth is substantially below potential, and we   expect the unemployment rate to start to edge up fairly quickly  Even relative to this lower   baseline, I think the downside risks to the prospects for output growth have sharpened in the   intermeeting period  I’m especially concerned about two risks—broader retrenchment in   financial markets along the lines that we’re seeing in the subprime mortgage market and a further   hesitation and faltering of capital spending   As we discussed in detail two years ago, an asset price bubble inevitably leads to   unsustainable imbalances in the economy and a misallocation of resources  The extraordinary   run-up in house prices in recent years led to construction and sales booms that couldn’t last  So   far the adjustments to more-sustainable levels of housing starts and sales have been relatively   orderly  However, there is still an overhang of precarious financing from the past relaxed   mortgage-lending standards that has to be eliminated  For example, in 2005 and 2006 something   like 40 percent of first-time homebuyers put no money down with their purchase  The market is   beginning to recognize the size of this overhang and, with the recent deterioration in the   March 20-21, 2007 24 of 196    performance of subprime mortgages, is dramatically reassessing mortgage risk  Going forward,   we will have to closely monitor increases in mortgage-risk compensation and tightening of credit   standards  Such changes, especially if they go too fast or too far, could amplify the housing-  sector decline as has been recognized, pushing housing prices and activity down, and with   spillovers to consumer spending, they could prove to be a substantial drag on the overall   economy   Despite the recent turmoil in equity and mortgage markets, a reassessment of overall risk   has yet to occur  We are still in an environment of low long-term yields, ample liquidity, and   what appears to be a generally low level of compensation for risk  For example, I recently talked   with the principals of several major private-equity funds, who were not just amazed but also   appalled about the amount of money their industry has attracted  [Laughter]  One partner said   that he would have no difficulty immediately raising $1 billion  Indeed, one of his biggest   problems is would-be investors who get angry at him because he is unwilling to take their   money  This unwillingness reflects his difficulty in identifying deals that are likely to yield   adequate returns even though, for the buyout firms, debt also is available in what they depict as   very attractive so-called covenant-lite terms—perhaps too attractive given the vulnerability of   some of the highly leveraged yields  My contacts suggest that some private-equity firms with   similar assessments of the shortage of profit opportunities are less restrained and do take   additional money, partly because of the large upfront fees that are generated by these deals  So   just as we have seen in mortgage markets, the bubble in private equity, as my sources   characterize it, and the overabundance of liquidity more generally raise the risk of a sharp   retrenchment in credit and higher risk spreads with associated risks to economic growth and,   conceivably, even financial stability   March 20-21, 2007 25 of 196    A second, related risk concerns investment spending  It’s surprising that, despite the   ample financing available, firms have still been reluctant to ramp up their capital spending    Certainly, any precipitous tightening of financing could curtail investment  However, as noted in   one of the Greenbook alternative simulations, greater business pessimism about future returns to   new capital is also a significant risk  The recent pullback in orders and shipments for capital   goods has persisted and deepened more than any of us had anticipated  Even for high-tech   spending, which continues to expand, my contacts on the manufacturing side are not very   optimistic  Sales of PCs and related equipment were mildly disappointing in 2006, and our   contacts don’t see the introduction of the Microsoft Vista operating system in January as having   generated much enthusiasm among businesses   Turning to inflation, our outlook for core inflation, like that of the Greenbook, has   changed little since January  I continue to anticipate gradually moderating inflation with core   PCE price inflation edging down from 2¼ percent in 2006 to 2 percent this year  There are   certainly clear upside risks to this forecast, especially given the resumption of increases in   energy prices  These risks remain despite some weakening in the outlook for real activity  In   principle, the anticipated subpar growth should help relieve inflationary pressures  However, we   remain very uncertain about what par is  The continued low unemployment rate, coupled with   recent sluggish output growth, suggests via Okun’s law that potential output could be growing in   the vicinity of 2¼ percent  If, contrary to our assumption, that were the case, any labor market   tightness now boosting inflation might not diminish this year   More-favorable news is found in recent survey evidence on inflation expectations  As   many of you have commented in past meetings, inflation expectations are perhaps more   influential to the inflation outlook than is the unemployment rate  Their relative stability over   March 20-21, 2007 26 of 196    the past several years has probably been a key factor restraining the rise in inflation over the past   two years  However, what has not generally been noted is the importance of near-term inflation   expectations, those with a forecast horizon of a year or two  Both economic theory and empirical   evidence suggest that these near-term inflation expectations are as important as long-run   expectations for determining inflation dynamics  The latest Blue Chip and Professional   Forecasters surveys both show expectations of core inflation edging down next year  For   example, the SPF shows core PCE inflation dropping to 2 percent next year, exactly in line with   our own forecast  I also see the general downward tilt in inflation expectations over the next   couple of years as contributing to a favorable inflation prognosis    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support the Bluebook alternative B, both   leaving the federal funds rate unchanged and also the language basically as it stands  I think the   current stance of policy is likely to foster an economy that gradually moves toward a soft landing   of the type portrayed in the Greenbook forecast, but obviously I have become much more   focused on the downside risk to economic activity since we met in January  On the inflation   front, the news hasn’t much altered my view  I still think core inflation is likely to edge down   this year and next, but I certainly think it’s too soon to conclude that any new lower trend has set   in  And I do definitely see upside risks, given that labor markets are still somewhat tight, oil   prices have risen, and the dollar has fallen  So for me, the risks do seem more balanced in the   sense that there are downside risks to real activity and upside risks to inflation; and I think it is   appropriate—I agree with Cathy’s comments—to reflect that in the statement  For a minute I   contemplated supporting the language about the risk assessment in alternative A; but really, upon   further reflection, I like alternative B very much  The shift to “future policy adjustments” from   “firming” appropriately hints at downside risk, as we all recognized in our discussion yesterday    I agree with Vince that it creates greater policy flexibility for us and lets the market work in this   stabilizing manner  Even so, it does retain an asymmetric bias, which I think markets expect;   and I consider it reasonable because, on the whole, I do remain somewhat more concerned about   inflation risk, and it is wise for our message on that to be consistent over time    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I, too, want to thank the staff  They’ve done   a terrific job in helping us with this  I’m going to try to address the questions in Vincent’s memo   with a little variation in order  On the first question, I do believe that the FOMC should have a   numerical inflation objective  We’ve discussed this before  Briefly, I think it would improve   internal policy discussions  Importantly, I think it would allow for clearer communication with   the public, and the benefit of that is to help anchor inflation expectations and enhance the scope   for monetary policy to stabilize output  Additional transparency would also foster greater   accountability, which I think is important  All in all, I don’t think these gains would be   March 20-21, 2007 144 of 196    enormous  But they do come out in the plus column when I weigh them against the potential   costs  A cost I worry about and would not be prepared to pay is de-emphasis on the other part of   our dual mandate—maximum sustainable employment  I worry that such de-emphasis could   occur in the minds of the public and even affect our own decisions  So I think a numerical   inflation goal has to be enunciated in the context of clear and convincing statements about our   commitment to both objectives   Like Governor Mishkin, I thought it important to proceed out of order  I, too, would like   to turn to question 4 on the time frame because I think it’s extremely important to address that   first  I consider it critical that we define a numerical inflation objective as a long-run goal, not at   a fixed time horizon  I would find it very hard to support a numerical objective without a long-  run horizon to provide a lot of flexibility to respond to output and employment considerations  I   believe that a fixed time horizon is inconsistent with the dual mandate  The long-run nature of   the inflation objective would have to be clearly explained to the public in the context of the dual   mandate, and I think we would need to stress that we would always take the implications for   near-term economic and financial stability into account when deciding how to move toward our   inflation objective  I’ve said this on several previous occasions  I think our Chairman proposed   a brilliant formulation of this in his remarks in St Louis in 2003, and I’ve been long attracted to   the language and views that he put forward in that speech on how to express this   Now let me turn to questions of which index and what number  On these issues, I am   flexible  Over the long run, the various price measures appear fairly closely linked  On   methodological grounds, of course, I’m enamored with things like the market-based core PCE,   and the chain CPI certainly has its attractions  [Laughter]  A couple of years ago, after our first   discussion of this in 2005, I decided to enunciate in my own speeches a so-called comfort zone,   March 20-21, 2007 145 of 196    and I talked about it in terms of the PCE  But partly because of that experiment, I, too, have   come to appreciate the value of public familiarity  In my contact with the public when I start to   talk about the inflation rate and the price index for personal consumption expenditures, excluding   food and energy, I still see quite a few blank stares  [Laughter]  I don’t think it’s just me  The   FOMC has been providing PCE price inflation projections in our Monetary Policy Report since   February 2000  Many of us have been talking about our goals in terms of the PCE price index,   but the CPI is still entrenched in the minds of the public as the measure of inflation  That’s   probably why central banks around the globe define their inflation objectives in terms of the CPI    Like others, I’ve also found that the public is quite skeptical, probably rightly so, of measures   that exclude food and energy  Those are important out-of-pocket expenses  I agree with the   argument that, if we have a long-run goal, there is an advantage to using a total rather than a core   index  Of course, we can refer to the behavior of the core index in explaining what we see going   forward in our own internal deliberations  So at this point, I think I’ve changed my mind, and I   would agree that total CPI is probably now my preferred alternative  But, again, I don’t feel   strongly, and I could go along with core PCE   With regard to a point value for the inflation goal or a range, I found very interesting in   the IF paper that many central banks have both  The point serves as a focal point, and I think   that there are good reasons, particularly as Governor Mishkin emphasized, for having a focal   point  The range seems useful as a communication device to remind the public that inflation   control is not perfect and that inflation is going to vary  I’m comfortable with that approach  As   for a specific number, again, I think economic theory and empirical evidence—I agree with   Governor Mishkin—suggest that the welfare function is pretty flat over a range of possible   values  I don’t think we should aim at zero properly measured because some cushion against the   March 20-21, 2007 146 of 196    zero bound seems prudent  I also worry about an adverse interaction with downward nominal   wage rigidity  That hasn’t been important in recent years because productivity growth has been   high  But if productivity growth were to decline, I believe that could become pertinent    However, there is also nothing to be gained by setting a goal higher than where inflation   expectations are currently anchored  I remain comfortable with the goal that I enunciated some   time ago—a long-run inflation objective of 1½ percent for the core PCE inflation rate  I agree   with Governor Mishkin that we have to take transition costs into account  It’s a question of   weighing the gains from being at a better number against the transition costs, and I thought about   that tradeoff when I decided on 1½  I know we’re not there, and I guess I decided that the   tradeoff was worth making  I don’t in any way want to say that the case was compelling, but I   could certainly continue to live with that number  To cast it in terms of the overall CPI, I think a   comparable number, given the average measurement bias, would be about 2 percent  The very   first FOMC discussion of this topic that I participated in, which was in January 1996, came out   with a numerical inflation objective of exactly 2 percent, and I think we were referring to the CPI   at that time  As for my preferred target range for headline CPI, which is more volatile, I translate   the 1 to 2 percent for core PCE that I’ve been talking about into a 1 to 3 percent range  Again,   I’d emphasize the 2 percent goal for the CPI and stress that the FOMC would not be indifferent   among values inside the range   Let me now turn to questions about the formulation of an inflation goal as a group   decision and the communication of that goal  I’ve long thought the best way to make this   decision is to arrive at a consensus or general agreement among the full set of FOMC   participants  That is how we have traditionally decided on communication issues since we do all   have to live with the consequences  I favor that approach over a survey  I might support a   March 20-21, 2007 147 of 196    survey, but I really think this is a preferable approach by far  It would produce much less   muddled communication  Statement of a consensus view is probably preferable to a formal vote,   which in some sense might up the ante vis-à-vis the Congress  It might be appropriate for the   Committee to revisit the setting of this objective from time to time  Presumably, it would not   and should not change very often  There could be reasons at some point that it might change  I   hope it wouldn’t change very often, but perhaps it should be reaffirmed and reconsidered   annually  If we do reach a consensus on the numerical objective, I think it should be expressed   in the minutes   Turning to the forecast narrative, I very strongly support the proposed experiment  I   thought the staff summary of the January economic projections showed that a useful minutes-  style narrative could be produced, and I think that process is going to work even more efficiently   if we provide individual narratives of the type that are suggested for the trial run  On details, I   agree with the point that President Hoenig and, I believe, President Pianalto made about the   confidence intervals  I think we should examine the track records for a broader range of   forecasts, our own past projections, those of the CBO, and others and experiment with that  I   would also like to give some support to President Plosser’s suggestion that, at least in the   experiment, we might want to include the federal funds rate or our own individual projections for   the federal funds rate  "
7897,2007-05-09,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  My assessment of the economic outlook and the   risks to it is largely unchanged since our last meeting  The data since that meeting have been mixed    On the one hand, the very sluggish real GDP growth in the first quarter gives me pause concerning   potential downside risks  Much of the first-quarter weakness, of course, was due to housing, and I   really don’t see that sector starting to turn around at this point  My homebuilder and banking   May 9, 2007 22 of 130    contacts report stricter underwriting standards for all mortgages, not just subprime ones, so   residential investment could remain a significant drag on the economy over the near term as the   Greenbook now envisions  Indeed, whereas the Greenbook assumes that national house prices are   flat going forward, I am worried that they may actually fall  On the other hand, the improved   picture of auto inventories along with some positive glimmers on manufacturing and business   investment suggests that those sectors may prove to be less of a drag on the economy going   forward  With respect to inflation, the recent news has also been somewhat mixed with lower-than-  expected readings on core consumer prices and labor compensation offset by higher prices for   energy, other commodities, and imports   Taking a longer view, I anticipate real GDP growth over the next two and a half years of   about 26 percent, just a bit below my assessment of potential  My forecasts of both actual and   potential growth are a tenth or two stronger than the Greenbook forecasts; but the basic story is very   similar, and the underlying assumptions, including the path for the nominal funds rate, are   essentially the same  I view the stance of monetary policy as remaining somewhat restrictive   throughout the entire forecast period  The key factors shaping the longer-term outlook include   continued fallout from the housing sector, with housing wealth projected to be roughly flat through   2008  Given the reduced impetus from housing wealth, household spending should advance at a   more moderate pace going forward than over the past few years   This slowdown in consumption is reinforced by more-moderate gains in personal income, as   the unemployment rate gradually rises, reaching 5 percent in 2009  Although I anticipate that the   labor market will remain fairly tight over the next year, I do not expect faster compensation growth   to exert significant upward pressure on prices  I expect it instead to restrain profits, given that   labor’s share of income is now at an exceptionally low level  I also anticipate that various   May 9, 2007 23 of 130    temporary factors that have been boosting inflation, such as the run-up in owners’ equivalent rent   and the pass-through of energy prices, should dissipate, while inflation expectations remain well   anchored  Overall, I’m more optimistic regarding inflation than the Greenbook and anticipate that   core PCE price inflation will edge down below 2 percent after next year   One of the more interesting questions about the outlook, as David noted in the questions to   him, is how to reconcile the strong labor market performance with the weak growth in output or,   equivalently, how much of the recent slowdown in productivity growth is likely to persist  And that   is something that we have been thinking about, too  Over the four quarters of 2006, nonfarm   business productivity rose 16 percent, about half as fast as the average pace set from 2000 through   2005  Whether these recent lower numbers reflect a transitory drop in growth or a downshift in the   trend rate is an important issue  A lot of excellent research has been done on this topic by staff at   the Board and elsewhere in the System  My reading of the evidence at this point is that the recent   decline in productivity growth does largely reflect cyclical factors  I think productivity growth has   fallen significantly below trend because of labor hoarding and lags in the adjustment of employment   to output   We have also been giving close scrutiny to the behavior of the residential construction sector   and productivity in that sector  My staff has done some work on estimating what productivity   growth has been over the past year or so in residential investment and in the nonfarm business   sector outside residential investment  They estimate that essentially all of last year’s slowdown in   labor productivity growth is due to the behavior of productivity in residential construction  We   estimate that residential construction productivity dropped 10 to 15 percent in 2006, whereas   productivity in the nonfarm business sector outside residential investment was well maintained    Exactly why those lags exist, again, is a mystery to me as well as to David and others   May 9, 2007 24 of 130    But going forward, it seems to us that, as the adjustment lags work themselves out,   residential construction employment will likely post significant declines, and productivity in that   sector and the economy as a whole will rebound  That said, the pace of structural productivity   growth may also have declined slightly as the Greenbook hypothesizes  Relative to the second half   of the 1990s, both the pace of productivity growth in the IT sector and the pace of investment in   equipment and software have slowed, and these factors have probably depressed trend productivity   growth slightly in recent years and are likely to continue depressing it somewhat going forward    But the hypothesis that the recent decline in productivity growth is mainly structural does not seem   to me to square well with the broad range of available evidence  Recall that in the 1990s there was   a whole constellation of evidence—including a booming stock market, robust consumption, and   rapid business investment—that was consistent with a hypothesis of a lasting increase in the rate of   productivity growth  In contrast, over the past year or so, business investment in equipment has   been very sluggish and more so than seems warranted by the deceleration in business output  So   such weakness could reflect lower assessments by companies of their ability to improve   productivity through the installation of new capital, and that is, I think, consistent with the lower   trend of productivity growth  But you would think that a marked slowdown in secular productivity   growth would also result in downward revisions to the expected paths of future profits and real   wages, weakening equity market valuations and crimping consumption growth  I have seen no   signs over the past year that household perceptions of their future wealth accumulation have been   downgraded   In sum, the data seem consistent with the view that the recent slowdown in nonfarm   business productivity represents a temporary cyclical drop that is concentrated in residential   May 9, 2007 25 of 130    construction combined with a modest decline in the trend  So I remain optimistic that the   underlying productivity trend is at or only slightly below 2½ percent    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support the Bluebook’s alternative B, both   the policy and the language as it stands  With respect to the language, I strongly support the view   that you, Governor Kohn, and others expressed—that a change today would be a mistake, given the   significance that the markets would attach to it  I think the language is completely acceptable and   we should stick with it  If we were to move, I wouldn’t have a problem with the language in C   about inflation and uncertainty, but I would also want to add something about uncertainty with   respect to growth, and I see no need to make this change today  It seems to me that we do need   considerable flexibility at this point to respond to emerging data  The intermeeting developments   have strengthened the case for a soft landing, but there is significant risk on both sides with respect   to inflation and growth  I’m still comfortable stating that the predominant policy concern is the risk   that inflation will fail to moderate as expected  I am worried about labor markets that remain fairly   tight, oil and commodity prices that are higher, and the dollar, which has fallen  At the same time,   the recent favorable inflation data have reinforced my view that a substantial part of the uptick in   inflation last year was transitory  I think that the discussion we have had so far reinforces the point   that going forward we are going to have trouble crafting policy and a statement if we don’t clarify—  May 9, 2007 94 of 130    at least within the Committee, if not publicly—what our ultimate inflation objective is  I’m not   going to weigh in again at this point on the merits, but it is obvious that we will have increasing   difficulty  I am happy today to say that core inflation remains “somewhat elevated on balance”    But if we get more readings of core PCE inflation that are in the neighborhood of 2 percent and they   continue, we really will have to revisit the debate about what we want to achieve and how we can   reflect that decision in our statement  "
7922,2007-06-27,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Data relating to both economic   activity and inflation during the intermeeting period have been encouraging  Economic   indicators have strengthened considerably, and recent readings on core inflation have   been quite tame  Although a portion of the recent deceleration of core prices likely   reflects transitory influences, the underlying trend in core inflation is still quite favorable    I view the conditions for growth going forward as being reasonably solid  The main   June 27-28, 2007 35 of 261    negative factors are tied to housing  The latest data don’t point to an imminent recovery   in this sector, and I fear that the recent run-up in mortgage rates will only make matters   worse  In addition, housing prices are unlikely to rise over the next few years and,   indeed, may well fall, and the absence of the housing wealth gains realized in the past   should damp consumption spending  I agree with the Greenbook that the recent run-up in   bond and mortgage rates reflects primarily a shift in market expectations for the path of   policy and, therefore, implies only a small subtraction to my forecast for growth in 2008   In my view, the stance of monetary policy over the next few years should be   chosen to help move labor and product markets from being somewhat tight today to   exhibiting a modest degree of slack in order to help bring about a further gradual   reduction in inflation toward a level consistent with price stability  The stance of   monetary policy will need to remain modestly restrictive, along the lines assumed in the   Greenbook and by markets, in order to achieve that goal  My forecast is for growth to be   around 2½ percent in the second half of this year and in 2008, slightly below my estimate   of potential growth, and for the unemployment rate to edge up gradually, reaching nearly   5 percent by the end of next year   Under these conditions, core inflation should continue to recede gradually, with   the core PCE price index increasing 2 percent this year and 19 percent in 2008  This   forecast is predicated on continued well-anchored inflation expectations and the eventual   appearance of a small amount of labor market slack  In addition, special factors such as   rising energy prices and the sustained run-up in owners’ equivalent rent that have boosted   inflation should ebb over time, contributing a bit to the expected decline in core inflation     June 27-28, 2007 36 of 261    In terms of risks to the outlook for growth, I still feel the presence of a 600-pound   gorilla in the room, and that is the housing sector  The risk for further significant   deterioration in the housing market, with house prices falling and mortgage delinquencies   rising further, causes me appreciable angst  Indeed, the repercussions of falling house   prices are already playing out in some areas where past price rises were especially rapid   and subprime lending soared  For example, in the Sacramento metropolitan area east of   San Francisco, house prices shot up at an annual rate of more than 20 percent from 2002   to 2005  Since then, however, they have been falling at an annual rate of 3½ percent    Delinquencies on subprime mortgages rose sharply last year, putting Sacramento at the   top of the list of MSAs in terms of the changes in the rate of subprime delinquencies   Research by my staff examining metropolitan areas across the country indicates   that the experience of Sacramento reflects a more general pattern  They found that low   rates of house price appreciation, and especially house price decelerations, are associated   with increases in delinquency rates even after controlling for local economic conditions   such as employment growth and the unemployment rate  One possible explanation for   these findings is that subprime borrowers, especially those with very low equity stakes,   have less incentive to keep their mortgages current when housing no longer seems an   attractive investment, either because prices have decelerated sharply or interest rates have   risen  These results highlight the potential risks that rising defaults in subprime could   spread to other sectors of the mortgage market and could trigger a vicious cycle in which   a further deceleration in house prices increases foreclosures, in turn exacerbating   downside price movements   June 27-28, 2007 37 of 261    The risks to inflation are also significant  In addition to the upside risks   associated with continued tight labor markets, a slowdown in productivity growth could   add to cost pressures  Although recent productivity data have been disappointing, I   expressed some optimism at the last meeting about productivity growth on the grounds   that at least some of the slowdown appeared to reflect labor hoarding and lags in the   adjustment of employment to output, especially in the construction industry  Data since   that meeting have reinforced my optimism concerning trend productivity growth  In   particular, new data in the recently released Business Employment Dynamics report   suggest that productivity growth may have been stronger than we have been thinking    This report, which includes data that will be used in the rebenchmarking of the payroll   survey in January, shows a much smaller increase in employment in the third quarter of   2006 than is reported in the payroll survey; it, therefore, implies a larger increase in   output per worker   A second risk to inflation is slippage in the market’s perceptions of our inflation   objective  Although inflation compensation over the next five years is essentially   unchanged since our last meeting, long-run breakeven inflation rates implied by the   difference between nominal and indexed Treasury securities are up about 20 basis points    However, our analysis suggests that this increase reflects in good part an elevation in risk   premiums or the influence of various—let me call them “idiosyncratic”—factors of the   type that Bill Dudley mentioned, such as a possible shift in the demand by foreign central   banks for Treasuries or special factors affecting the demand for inflation-indexed   securities and not an increase in long-run inflation expectations  We base this conclusion   on the fact that long-run breakeven inflation rates have also climbed in the United   June 27-28, 2007 38 of 261    Kingdom—a country where inflation expectations have been remarkably well anchored   over the past decade and where inflation has been trending downward  The fact that   breakeven inflation rates rose in both countries, despite their different monetary policy   regimes, suggests that a common explanation is needed rather than one specific to the   United States  I think this conclusion is supported by the Board staff model that   attributes about half of the movement in breakeven inflation to risk premiums  That said,   our understanding and estimates of risk premiums are imprecise, so we must continue to   monitor inflation expectations very carefully—of course, along with everything else    [Laughter]    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I certainly agree that policy is well   positioned, and we should leave it exactly where it is  Markets have come around to our   view, and I think our objective in the statement should be to keep market expectations   aligned with our view and not to change them   In terms of the statement, I think that the current draft is very much improved   relative to the Bluebook, and I have no problem in supporting the current language  I like   Governor Kohn’s proposal; I think that it is a worthwhile change  I do, however, share   many of President Plosser’s concerns and think that we will have a lot of difficulty going   forward  Markets are wondering what our long-run inflation objective is  They will   certainly note the omission of the term “somewhat elevated”  It will raise a question   about whether, if core inflation were to stabilize at 2 percent, we would be satisfied with   that or we would want to see it move lower  This statement is very cleverly crafted, and I   June 27-28, 2007 114 of 261    think it succeeds in finessing that issue for today  I don’t have a problem, really, with   finessing it for today     My own proposal was designed to say to markets something that I thought we   could say without actually coming to full agreement, even within the Committee, about   whether we have a single long-run inflation objective  Even if we don’t go announce a   numerical inflation objective, our statements need to be consistent with the projections   that we will be issuing publicly  President Plosser pointed out that we will be issuing a   two-year projection that does show inflation coming down  It seemed to me that we   could therefore remove the term “elevated” and still say, as our projections in a couple   weeks will confirm, that the Committee expects underlying inflation to come down   further without saying exactly how far  But I don’t feel strongly about such language,   and I think alternative B does a good job of resolving the problem for today  We will   wait until another day, when we will have to face this again    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I strongly support the proposals that   you have laid out  I appreciate your doing so  They have helped focus this discussion    Besides agreeing with the proposals, I also agree with the reasoning that you have set out   as to why this is the right step and why it is an important step  It doesn’t go all the way to   having a single agreed-upon inflation objective, but I do think it’s a major step in that   direction  Given the political realities and sensitivities and the differences of opinion and   comfort level with moving wholly in that direction, I think this is a very constructive   step  It moves us forward, and it doesn’t preclude other measured steps later on  It   would worry me to take this step if there were a huge difference among us about the   quantitative definition of an appropriate price stability objective  But it is clear that the   range of difference is not very broad; 1½ to 2 in the grand scheme of things seems to me   to be very minor  Certainly, at this point going out to a third year, it seems to me, will be   very informative to the public     I really like the idea that, having talked about our individual comfort zones, we   will be able to get out of the current phase of being very reluctant to talk about this topic   at all  It would be good to express in our own speeches something that reflects a   Committee objective  I think that 1½ to 2 as a range of what we think of as price stability   is adequate and will be useful  It will let us clearly explain our objectives and our   strategy for using monetary policy to achieve them, which is something we really haven’t   done much of, and I think that’s a good thing to do   June 27-28, 2007 181 of 261    I am really torn about your proposal about whether or not we should go beyond   three years  We are lucky at this point that we are awfully close to the range that we   think we would like to be in  But if at some future date we were a lot further from the   objective, I could easily imagine—given my own view of the tradeoffs between the   employment and inflation goals—that three years would be an insufficient period for you   to look at my projection and see what my view of price stability was  So at some future   date, having a range as short as that could be problematic  However, going from three to   five years has a disadvantage in that we will, in effect, be laying out something that the   Congress is likely to view as an employment goal or an unemployment goal, and I am   worried about taking that step  So I am really torn about it   Just a bit on a few specifics—I think that four times a year is appropriate  I like   our sharing our projections among the Committee members; it has been helpful in   understanding what other people think and in facilitating our own discussion  I think the   staff has done a wonderful job of producing the narrative  A major thing that we can   provide to the public is to lay out our reasoning about the economy  It is being nicely   done, and I think we really have that in good shape  I like the idea of a total inflation   number  I like the CPI because of its familiarity but could certainly live with the PCE as   well  I like “appropriate policy”  There have been a lot of concerns in the Committee   about projecting the fed funds rate  In the past I have been where President Plosser is   now in terms of wanting to reveal that to the public, but many good reasons have been   advanced in our discussions about why we shouldn’t do that, at least for now  With   respect to the concern that, if we are very specific in our own submissions, it will   eventually become public, my own feeling is that, in this round, just asking people “Do   June 27-28, 2007 182 of 261    you agree with Greenbook?” or “Are there any significant differences?” has been quite   informative and is sufficient   I like the treatment of uncertainty in this round  Asking people to put down their   own numbers was false precision—I really didn’t like that  Providing some table of   model-based or forecast-based historical averages is very helpful if combined with some   qualitative discussion  I am a little worried about the histograms  They are nice   graphical devices  But are they really informative about something we want to inform   the public about?  I share some of the concerns that have been expressed about outliers   and whether or not we want to focus attention on them  With respect to timing of the   forecasts, I really think we should not be adding information in those projections that   goes beyond what we had at the meeting  It will be very confusing if we try to do so  I   feel that we should have the projections finalized either on the day of the FOMC meeting   or shortly thereafter but not based on any additional information     With respect to publication, I agree with President Moskow’s thoughts that   putting the projections out as an appendix to the minutes is desirable, though we will   have to be careful about what we say in the discussion  We can then also include them in   the Monetary Policy Report  I do like the idea of expediting the minutes, especially if we   figure out a way to be able to read them on our Blackberrys  We ought to be able to do   that—most of the compression in time to cut it down to two and a half weeks comes in   terms of our own response time  I think that we can respond quickly, especially if we can   get them while we’re traveling  I like the idea of being able to use the minutes in our   speeches  We have not yet talked about the statement, but I think getting the minutes out   more quickly will also take a little pressure off the statement  If the staff can find a way   June 27-28, 2007 183 of 261    to write the first part of the minutes and we can present it as the staff’s information that   they brought into the meeting, that will also take a burden off the minutes, and I hope it   will take some burden off the staff     Well, thank you, Mr Chairman  I think the statement is just about   right  I like the current length and structure  I would not want to see a great deal more detail   June 27-28, 2007 207 of 261    in it about our assessment of the economy  I think that should wait for the minutes, but I   don’t think there’s anything that’s in the statement now that we should cut  The statement   has evolved; and we have in practice avoided doing something formulaic in terms of the   balance of risks  We do not have the same language all the time  We sometimes use   forward-looking policy language and sometimes we don’t  That’s good  I think we should   avoid anything formulaic and just do what’s appropriate in the given conditions  When we   were on a path of raising the fed funds rate from 1 percent, and we had every expectation   that we would be involved in a series of steps over time, it would have been highly artificial   to avoid indicating in the statement that this was our expectation  It was important to signal   it using forward-looking language  So I wouldn’t want to take forward-looking language off   the table  It doesn’t seem too important now when our own expectation is for a flat path  So   I think the statement is working well  I’m really amazed at how well the process of drafting   the statement is working too     Initially when we started getting into circulating ideas about it   before the meeting, I thought, “Oh, this is going to be chaotic and spin out of control”  I’ve   been amazed at how thoroughly constructive it has been—that by the time we walk in here   and have the statement, it has actually evolved a fair amount  I think it has always been an   improvement, and we have been able to have drafting sessions, and they have worked out   surprisingly well   On the governance, I think this thing has accidentally fallen into a governance hole,   and it needs to be cleaned up  The Committee should vote on the whole statement  That’s   what the outside world thinks now; they just haven’t noticed that we don’t   June 27-28, 2007 208 of 261   "
7946,2007-08-07,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Data on inflation during the intermeeting   period have continued to be encouraging, but the prospects for economic activity have become   dicier  The results for GDP in the second quarter as a whole actually took on a positive tone,   August 7, 2007 30 of 136    with final sales mainly accounting for the healthy growth rate  But the quarter ended on a weak   note, with disappointing data for housing consumption and for orders of core capital goods  Of   course, the big developments since our last meeting were in financial markets  I read them as   pointing to weaker growth going forward and greater downside risk  The market for mortgage-  backed securities is now highly illiquid, and there are indications that credit problems are spilling   beyond the subprime sector  It thus seems likely that lending standards will tighten for a broader   class of borrowers in the mortgage market     The drop in equity prices and rising rates on most risky corporate debt are further   negatives for growth  There are some offsets to these negative factors, including the decline in   the dollar and, most important, the steep reduction we have seen in risk-free rates  On balance,   however, I expect these offsets to be only partial, providing a cushion against future weakness,   because I interpret the decline in Treasury rates during the intermeeting period primarily as a   reflection of weaker growth expectations and a correspondingly lower path for the expected   future fed funds rate and not a consequence of the fall of the term premium  The jump in oil   prices since our last meeting is a further factor weighing on aggregate demand  As a result of   these considerations, I have lowered my growth forecast for the second half of this year   ½ percentage point, to just over 2 percent  This rate is moderately below my estimate of   potential growth, which I now put at about 2½ percent   Going beyond this year, the outlook depends on one’s assumption concerning appropriate   monetary policy  I consider it appropriate for policy to aim at holding growth just slightly below   potential to produce enough slack in labor and credit markets to help bring about a further   gradual reduction in inflation toward a level consistent with price stability  Barring a more   serious and prolonged tightening of credit market conditions or a general liquidity squeeze, I   August 7, 2007 31 of 136    would keep the fed funds rate modestly above its equilibrium level to accomplish this goal    However, I now see the fed funds rate as well above the neutral level  So I think it likely that the   fed funds rate will need to fall appreciably over the next few years  My assessment of the neutral   federal funds rate declined during the intermeeting period for two main reasons—first, because   of the tightening in financial conditions associated with the reassessment of risk now taking   place and, second, because of the NIPA revisions, which suggest slower structural productivity   growth and, in all likelihood, correspondingly slower growth in aggregate demand  I thus think   that a larger decline in the fed funds rate will be needed over time than in the Greenbook baseline   to achieve a soft landing   A key development during the intermeeting period was the downward revision of real   GDP growth over the 2004-06 period  This adjustment reinforces the work of productivity   experts at the Board and elsewhere who had previously found evidence of a slowdown in   underlying productivity growth  The revision in actual productivity was big enough to lead us to   lower our estimate of growth in both structural productivity and potential output, although our   estimates remain above those in the Greenbook  In addition to tighter financial conditions, lower   structural productivity growth was the reason that we lowered our forecast for real GDP growth   to 2¼ percent in 2008  As a result, the unemployment rate edges up in our forecast, reaching   nearly 5 percent by the end of next year  The modest amount of slack that this entails should   help bring about the desired gradual reduction of inflation in the future   Readings on core PCE prices have been quite tame for some time now, rising only   01 percent in each of the past four months  Although a portion of the recent deceleration in core   prices likely reflects transitory influences, the underlying trend in core inflation still appears   favorable  We anticipate that the core PCE price index will rise 2 percent this year and that core   August 7, 2007 32 of 136    inflation will gradually ebb to around 18 percent over the forecast period  This forecast is   predicated on continued well-anchored inflation expectations and the eventual appearance of a   small amount of labor market slack, as I just mentioned   For some time now, I’ve thought an argument could be made that the NAIRU was a bit   lower than assumed in the Greenbook, and the new evidence that structural productivity growth   has been lower than we thought for more than three years reinforces this view  It means that the   relatively good inflation performance over this period occurred despite the upward pressure that   must have been operating because of the deceleration in structural productivity  In any event, I   also expect to see modest downward pressure on inflation in the next couple of years from the   ebbing of the upward effects of special factors, including the decline in structural productivity,   energy and commodity prices, and owners’ equivalent rent   In terms of risk to the outlook for growth, the housing sector obviously remains a serious   concern  We seem to be repeatedly surprised with the depth and duration of the deterioration in   these markets; and the financial fallout from developments in the subprime markets, which I now   perceive to be spreading beyond that sector, is a source of appreciable angst  Of course,   financial conditions have deteriorated in markets well beyond those connected with subprime   instruments or even residential real estate more generally  It appears that participants are   questioning structured credit products in general, the risk assessments of the rating agencies, and   the extent of due diligence by originators who package and sell loans but no longer hold a very   sizable fraction of these originations on their own balance sheets  The Greenbook has long   highlighted, and we have long worried about, the possibility and potential consequences of a   broader shift in risk perceptions  With risk premiums having been so low by historical standards,   it would hardly be surprising to see them rise, making financial conditions tighter for any given   August 7, 2007 33 of 136    stance of monetary policy  While it remains possible that financial markets will stabilize or even   reverse course in the days and weeks ahead, the possibility that the financial markets are now   shifting to a historically more typical pattern of risk pricing is very much on my radar screen    Should this pattern persist and possibly intensify, it will have very important implications for   policy    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I think the inflation news has continued to be   encouraging, but the risks remain on the upside  With respect to growth, the prospects have   worsened, and I think there is greater downside risk for the reasons that we have discussed  I   think the market response to these events is not inappropriate  They perceive a greater likelihood   that we will need to cut the fed funds rate sooner and more deeply than seemed likely only a few   weeks ago, and I think we should essentially try to leave those expectations in place today to   indicate that we intend not to respond to asset prices or to the problems of particular dealers or   financial institutions directly but to assess the economic consequences of the turmoil   So the question is, What is the right language to do that?  The alternative B language that   is proposed is trying to achieve exactly what I think is appropriate  So I agree with the goal of   alternative B  I’m simply concerned about some of the actual language that is proposed    Particularly I worry about the language in paragraph 4  When you say “although the downside   risks to growth have increased somewhat, the Committee’s predominant policy concern remains   the risk that inflation will fail to moderate,” that’s like saying—perhaps because I respond so   strongly to the word “predominant”—that, yes, we see greater downside risk, but we don’t care;   we remain totally focused on inflation  [Laughter]  That bothers me  That’s how it comes across   to me  I don’t think the intention is to make it that way     So I would make two proposals to soften it  I think what we need to do is dial it down,   but I do think that inflation risk remains to the upside  I would second two suggestions that have   already been made  I would second President Fisher’s suggestion that we remove the word   “predominant” from paragraph 4  We might say, “The Committee remains concerned about the   risk that inflation will fail to moderate as expected”  Now, I do think the downside risk has   increased on the growth side  I’m not sure it is actually necessary to say so explicitly, and I think   August 7, 2007 95 of 136    dialing down paragraph 4 by simply removing “predominant,” along with the additional   language that is proposed in line 2, might be sufficient  But I think that we actually do agree that   downside risks have increased  If we want to express that, I would endorse President Poole’s   suggestion that we move the language about downside risks to paragraph 2, saying something   after “for some households and businesses, and the housing correction is ongoing”  We could   then say, “Although the downside risks to growth have increased somewhat, nevertheless the   economy seems likely to continue to expand at a moderate pace”  So we would get it in there    Basically we would say that we see it, but nevertheless we think most likely the economy will   grow at a moderate pace  If financial turbulence diminishes and markets stabilize, not having   downside risks to growth in paragraph 4 and continuing to express some asymmetric bias, some   worry about inflation, we’ll be comfortable living with that going forward, and it is a good   summary of where we are  So those are my suggestions  "
7975,2007-08-16,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I want to say that I strongly support the   proposal that you’ve made, both the changes to the primary credit program, and also I would   strongly endorse the statement that you just recommended that the Federal Open Market Committee   put out  I’ve been doing my best to follow developments in financial markets in recent days, and it   seems very clear that we have a situation of almost complete illiquidity in the asset-backed   commercial paper market and in asset-backed markets more broadly  Although I agree with   President Plosser that the proposed changes to the operation of the discount window and the cut in   the discount rate are not certain to succeed in regenerating the functioning of these markets, I think   this is a very well reasoned, thoughtful, creative program that has as good a chance to succeed as   anything that certainly I could dream up  So I strongly support it  I could go along with a larger cut   in the discount rate, but I understand the reasons that you’ve given for making it a 50 basis point cut    So I strongly support that    I also think it is highly appropriate for the FOMC to issue this statement that you have   suggested  First of all, it is just straightforward that the outlook has deteriorated  We’ve developed   a credit crunch  If liquidity isn’t quickly restored in these markets, we are looking at a credit   crunch—signs of it are everywhere  Just to see that, Countrywide itself is 20 percent of the market,   and it announced that it is tightening credit standards  Every day we hear about companies that are   trying to finance prime quality jumbo mortgages and cannot get the financing to do that and are   tightening standards  Although we may not have yet seen data suggesting that these changes in   August 16, 2007 18 of 37    financial conditions are having an effect on economic growth, I think any forward-looking   assessment would suggest that tighter credit conditions have to have that effect  So I certainly   support the recognition of that, and I can easily imagine that we will be cutting the federal funds rate   in the not-too-distant future  "
7999,2007-09-18,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Readings on core inflation during the   intermeeting period have continued to be encouraging, and the downward trend has persisted long   enough that I’ve lowered my inflation forecast slightly  With the weaker outlook for growth, I also   see less upside inflation risk emanating from cyclical pressures  With respect to economic activity,   I’ve downgraded my forecast for growth in the fourth quarter by about the same amount as   September 18, 2007 50 of 188    Greenbook and lowered it only marginally, a bit less than Greenbook, in 2008  The downside risks   to this forecast are substantial and worrisome  The downward revision to my forecast reflects three   factors  first, incoming data bearing on the outlook; second, my assessment of the likely impact of   the financial shock that’s been unfolding since mid-July; third, the offsetting effect of the policy   changes I consider appropriate in response to the first two forces  My forecast assumes that the fed   funds rate will fall to about 4½ percent in the fourth quarter  In other words, my forecast is   premised on timely actions by the Committee to mitigate much of the potential damage   Let me begin by commenting on the economic data that we have received since early   August  Some has certainly been positive  Growth in the second quarter was revised upward,   suggesting more momentum heading into the current quarter, and most indicators of consumer   spending and business fixed investment were also robust  Like most observers, I’ve concluded that   these data taken together support a small upward revision in my estimate of third-quarter growth    However, recent data on housing and forward-looking indicators relating to this sector suggest even   greater weakness in residential investment than we previously anticipated  Manufacturing activity   recently turned down, and importantly to me, the August employment report showed a marked   deceleration in payroll employment growth over the past three months, suggesting that the financial   shock hit an economy possessing quite a bit less momentum than I had factored into my previous   forecast  Moreover, survey measures of consumer confidence are down, and these results probably   do incorporate early effects from the recent financial shock   Of course, the most important factor shaping the forecast for the fourth quarter and beyond   is the earthquake that began roiling financial markets in mid-July  Our contacts located at the   epicenter—those, for example, in the private equity and mortgage markets—report utter   devastation  Anecdotal reports from those nearby—for example, our contacts in banking, housing   September 18, 2007 51 of 188    construction, and housing-related businesses—suggest significant damage from the temblor  For   example, a large furniture retailer with stores in Utah and Nevada has seen sales fall off, and he has   tightened credit terms for his customers and has already frozen his hiring and investment plans  In   contrast, our business contacts operating further from the epicenter appear remarkably unfazed    Luckily for them and for us, the financial quake has thus far produced at most minor tremors in their   businesses  This is not surprising  It is still too early to expect the ripple effects to be noticed by our   contacts or to show up in the spending data   We could take a wait-and-see approach to the financial shock, incorporating its impact on   our growth forecasts only after we observe its imprint in the spending data  But such an approach   would be misguided and fraught with hazard because it would deprive us of the opportunity to act in   time to forestall the likely damage  This means we must do our best to assess the likely effect of the   shock  The simplest approach is to rely on our usual forecasting models  However, as David   emphasized in his remarks, the shock has not affected to any great extent the financial variables that   are typically included in our macro models  Since we last met, there have been only small net   changes in broad equity indexes and the dollar  Of course, risk spreads in credit markets are up   across a broad range of instruments and for most borrowers, both corporate and households  But   there has been an offsetting drop in Treasury rates so that key rates appearing in our models—the   interest rate on conforming mortgages and the interest rate facing prime corporate borrowers—are   little changed or even slightly lower  It is riskier corporate borrowers and households seeking   nonconforming mortgage loans, including jumbos, that have seen their borrowing rates rise over the   past few months  But importantly, it is the drop in Treasury yields, about 50 to 100 basis points   since early July, that has thus far shielded so many borrowers from higher interest rates, and of   course, this drop reflects the market’s expectations that the Committee will ease the stance of   September 18, 2007 52 of 188    monetary policy rather substantially  As I noted, my forecast assumes that we will plan to ease by   around 75 basis points by year-end in line with market expectations  Even under this assumption, I   see movements in interest rates alone as adding to a modest tightening of financial conditions   But, of course, an evaluation of the likely economic impact from the financial shock must   also take into account changes in credit availability and lending terms even though these variables   rarely appear explicitly in forecasting models  It is apparent that the availability of lending of some   types, including subprime and alt-A mortgages, has diminished substantially or disappeared   entirely  Moreover, banks and other financial institutions are imposing tighter terms and conditions   across a broad range of corporate and household lending programs  For example, FICO cutoffs   have been raised and maximum loan-to-value ratios lowered in many mortgage programs according   to our contacts  In part, these changes reflect the pressures that banks and other financial   intermediaries are experiencing in the context of severe illiquidity in secondary markets for   nonconforming mortgages and other asset-backed securities, asset-backed commercial paper, and   term loans in the interbank market    Many of the liquidity problems now afflicting banks and other financial market participants   will presumably be resolved at least eventually, but it’s hard to believe that markets will return to   business as usual as defined by conditions in the first half of this year even after that occurs  For   one thing, many of the structured credit products that became so widely used may prove to be too   complex to be viable going forward, and this would more or less permanently reduce the quantity of   credit available to many risky borrowers  Moreover, if the financial intermediation that was   routinely conducted via asset securitization and off-balance-sheet financing vehicles ultimately   migrates back onto the books of the banks, borrowing spreads and lending terms are likely to   remain tighter given current limitations on bank capital and the higher costs of conducting   September 18, 2007 53 of 188    intermediation through the banking sector  Most important, the recent widening of spreads appears   to reflect a return to more-realistic pricing of risk throughout the economy; this development may be   positive for the long run, but it will be contractionary in the short run   Similar to the Greenbook, we’ve incorporated these financial developments into our   projection by revising down our forecast for residential construction and home prices  But as we all   know, housing is a small sector, so a major question is to what extent the financial shock will spread   to other parts of the economy  We see a large drop in house prices as quite likely to adversely affect   consumption spending over time through a number of different channels, including wealth effects,   collateral effects, and negative effects on spending through the interest rate resets  A big worry is   that a significant drop in house prices might occur in the context of job losses, and this could lead to   a vicious spiral of foreclosures, further weakness in housing markets, and further reductions in   consumer spending  Several alternative simulations in the Greenbook illustrate some of the   unpleasant scenarios that could develop  A final concern is that the uncertainty associated with   turbulent financial markets could make households and businesses more cautious about spending,   causing some investment plans to be put on hold and some planned purchases of houses and   consumer durables to be deferred  So at this point I am concerned that the potential effects of the   developing credit crunch could be substantial  I recognize that there’s a tremendous amount of   uncertainty around any estimate  But I see the skew in the distribution to be primarily to the   downside, reflecting possible adverse spillovers from housing to consumption and business   investment    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I strongly support the Bluebook alternative B  I   think a 50 basis point cut right away is appropriate, and I like the language  My reasons for   supporting this action are, first, that inflation has been quite well behaved  I’m pretty sanguine   about the future  Second, I think the available economic data that preceded the financial shock are   separate from it and support a fed funds rate cut entirely on their own  You can see that just by   looking at the backward-looking Taylor rules in the Bluebook, which suggest that the fed funds rate   in the third and fourth quarters should be well below where it is now  In part, inflation has come   down, and as President Hoenig and others have pointed out, that’s raised the real fed funds rate—so   a real rate of 3¼ percent now  I think the stance of policy is unnecessarily restrictive, and that is   before recent developments  Third, of course, is that the financial shock has made financial   conditions more restrictive  Even if things sort themselves out, I think the conditions will remain   September 18, 2007 111 of 188    more restrictive  I thought the Bluebook gave us a good method for seeing how much more in   showing that the Greenbook implicit equilibrium funds rate has declined 50 basis points since   August; that says to me that a 50 basis point cut is not too much to try to neutralize the shock and try   to forestall it from damaging the economy  As I contemplate the issue of 50 today or 25 with the   presumption that we would do 25 more in October, I find myself strongly favoring 50 today  I think   we should be taking a forward-looking approach and trying to forestall damage   I agree with Governor Mishkin that, should developments later on call for us to reverse what   we have done, we should not hesitate to do it  I really don’t like the message that a 25 basis point   cut would essentially send to markets  It would seem to say, “Well, why did we do 25 basis points   today?  It’s because we want to wait and monitor incoming data and see what effect the shock has”    I think that’s an unwise message to send  First, it says that the policy is reactive rather than forward   looking, and I hope we’re going to be coming out with a communication package that sends a rather   different message  Also, I really don’t think we’re going to see that much in the spending data over   the next six weeks that’s going to be convincing  I am also very concerned about the asymmetric   nature of the risks that we face and the possibility of the type of nonlinear, negative dynamics that   Governors Mishkin and Kohn and you, Mr Chairman, have mentioned   I like the language in the statement  I think it’s very well crafted  I like the idea of   discussing forestalling negative effects and our hope and sort of optimism that we’ll be able to do it   by sufficient action today  I don’t like the idea of putting out a statement today that says there are   continuing asymmetric downside risks  It leaves us open to the question, “If you think that, then   why didn’t you do more?”  I agree with Governor Kohn  I like the risk assessment because I   honestly don’t know exactly what the risks are  I like the approach that we’re going to watch and   September 18, 2007 112 of 188    do what is appropriate as events unwind in the future, and I don’t want to have to say that I now feel   the downside risks are essentially balanced with other risks to inflation  I don’t know that    Thank you, Mr Chairman I also want to congratulate the staff  This is a   very clever and targeted intervention, and it’s a very nicely put together proposal  I’m supportive I   think it’s something that’s good to have available  I’m glad that we’re not planning to put it in place   instantly  It does have the potential to address the stigma issues that banks have coming to the   discount window  Really, the spike in the spread between term and overnight loans in the interbank   market has been quite sizable, and it’s obvious that that has been complicating the difficulties that   banks have had in managing liquidity   I have also been concerned, given how many other borrowing rates are linked to LIBOR,   that if the spread remains elevated, it has the potential to spill over into the rates that a lot of   borrowers pay I think this has a chance in succeeding and reducing that spread and bringing   LIBOR down, but it’s not 100 percent obvious to me that it will succeed  I think it does depend on   your interpretation of exactly what that spread represents, whether it’s credit risk or liquidity risk   As I read the proposal, I thought it really didn’t make the case in a powerful way to me that   the inability of banks to fund at term was creating systemic risk  It seems to me that, given a   proposal of this magnitude that involves coordinating central bank intervention and has a chance of   not succeeding, we ought to be doing it to address something that we regard as an important   systemic risk The comments that Governors Kohn and Warsh made have convinced me, as we     have discussed this, that there could very well be systemic risks here and that we might, if things get   worse again, want to put this into place  So I found that discussion very useful  It seemed to me   that the case that was actually made in the document in a sense was more a monetary policy case   that banks facing these funding pressures would likely raise rates and that would have   macroeconomic consequences  That then suggests to me, Well, why don’t we use the federal funds   rate more?  It is a more general tool to remove those pressures   I share the concern that we will be perceived as bailing out a small set of weak institutions,   including Washington Mutual, Countrywide, and others that may be associated with the crisis    Especially if we’re using this overnight index swap rate  It has been sitting here, I guess, around   480, 476, or something like that, which if we had had this facility in effect would be below the   funds rate and would raise questions about why we were lending so cheaply  One way or another, I   would certainly be happy to approve a swap agreement with the European Central Bank and the   Swiss National Bank to provide them with dollar funding whether we go ahead or not, if that’s   desirable  "
8023,2007-10-30,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Over the past week or so, we have been   following the devastating fires in Southern California  They have burned over 500,000 acres,   destroyed nearly 2,000 homes, and inflicted seven deaths and sixty injuries  These were large   fires, even by California standards, but they were by no means the largest in recent memory; and,   of course, the loss of life and economic costs pale compared with Katrina  While the fires have   October 30-31, 2007 36 of 162    seriously affected the lives of many individuals, they do not seem likely to show up in the   macroeconomic data   Turning to the national economy, developments since we met six years—six weeks   ago—actually, it seems like just two weeks ago—[laughter] generally have been favorable and   the risks to the outlook for growth have eased somewhat  But I think it is too early to say that we   are out of the woods  The inflation news has continued to be favorable, but some upside risks   have become more prominent  With respect to economic activity, we have raised our forecast   for growth in both the third and the fourth quarters in response to incoming data, even though the   pace of deterioration in the housing sector has been more severe than we expected and the   problems associated with housing finance seem far from resolution  We agree with Greenbook   that residential investment is likely to continue its severe contraction for at least a few more   quarters  We also agree with Greenbook that the rest of the economy has held up reasonably   well, at least so far  Exports have been strong, and while business fixed investment seems to be   slowing, it should still make a robust contribution to growth in the second half of this year   With respect to consumer spending, most aggregate data suggest only a modest   deceleration so far  Such readings help to allay our concerns about potential spillovers from   housing to consumption, but they don’t completely assuage them  Survey measures of consumer   confidence are down sharply since the financial turmoil began, and most indexes of house prices   show outright declines  Given the current state of the housing and mortgage markets, bigger   declines going forward are a distinct possibility  Indeed, the Case-Shiller futures data for house   prices point to larger declines in the months ahead  A sharp drop in house prices would likely   crimp consumer spending over time through wealth and collateral effects  Some of my directors   and other contacts are also raising warning flags about consumer demand  For example, the   October 30-31, 2007 37 of 162    CEO of a large well-known high-end retailer said that the company’s sales are softening and that   the company is having to work diligently to control inventories  In his view, the consumer has   pulled back  The CEO of a Southern California bank observed a number of his clients talking   about a drop in discretionary consumer purchases  The bottom line is that consumption spending   seems to be all right for the time being, but there is a real risk that households may cut back on   spending more than expected in response to higher oil prices, a slower economy, and economic   uncertainty   I agree with President Rosengren’s assessment of financial markets  Strains appear to   have eased a bit on balance since our September meeting, with interbank lending markets   showing some improvement and spreads on asset-backed commercial paper declining  But   structured credits related to mortgages remain quite troublesome, and liquidity conditions and   Treasury bill markets are still at times strained  My impression is that, despite having moved in   a positive direction over the past six weeks, these markets remain vulnerable to shocks, and so   the economy remains at risk from further financial disruptions  Both survey evidence and   anecdotal evidence have confirmed that banks are tightening lending standards across the board    Tighter terms and conditions are being applied to a range of business lending, including   commercial real estate, and on most household lending from prime and nonprime mortgages to   auto and home equity loans   The main financial variables that are commonly included in formal macroeconometric   models appear to have changed since the onset of the financial shock—say, in late June—in   ways that should have roughly offsetting effects  Oil prices are markedly higher, which should   restrain consumer spending, and the stock market is roughly unchanged since June in spite of the   financial turmoil  A weaker dollar should have a positive influence on growth  Mortgages rates   October 30-31, 2007 38 of 162    on jumbo loans and the rates facing the riskiest corporate borrowers are higher, but many private   borrowing rates are down because of the decline in Treasury yields  Of course, the current levels   of Treasury yields, as well as the stock market and dollar, reflect at least in part the market’s   expectation that the Committee will ease the stance of monetary policy at this meeting   Underlying our forecast is the policy assumption that the Committee will cut the funds   rate another 25 basis points at this meeting  In assessing the appropriate path of the stance of   policy, I took a number of considerations into account  First, core consumer inflation currently is   at a level that I consider consistent with price stability  Second, unemployment is very near my   best estimate of the full employment rate  In the context of a Taylor-type rule, these   considerations imply that the real funds rate should be near its neutral level  In fact, any version   of the Taylor rule you prefer, with whatever rates you want to put on inflation versus the gap,   will give you the same recommendation because all the terms are zero and drop out, except for   one—the equilibrium real rate  Of course, we cannot know the level of the real equilibrium rate   with certainty  Defined in terms of the PCE price index, our best estimate is in the range of 2 to   2½ percent, which is well below the current real rate of about 3 percent     I would like to highlight two additional points here  First, the actual real rate has been   boosted over the past six months or so by declines in short-term inflation expectations, whether   one measures them by lagged inflation, by surveys of expected inflation over the next year or so,   or by forecasts of inflation including the Greenbook forecast  Second, one important aspect of   the financial turmoil is that it probably represents in part a movement toward a more reasonable   pricing of risk, as seen in the rise in risk spreads  This development tends to push the   equilibrium real funds rate down toward the lower portion of the range I just cited   October 30-31, 2007 39 of 162    The bottom line is that in my view, even without the contractionary effects of recent   financial developments, an appropriate stance of monetary policy would involve further declines   in the fed funds rate  I have assumed that the funds rate drops to 4½ percent by the end of this   year and to 4¼ by the end of next year  My assumed path ends in the same place and embodies   the same medium-term assumption concerning neutral as FRB/US, on which the extended   Greenbook forecast relies  The only difference concerns timing  We assume a more rapid path   to the long run than the Greenbook does  Our forecast shows real GDP growth gradually picking   up to around 2½ percent, our estimate of potential, by the end of next year  However, given that   the financial shock is not yet resolved, I think the downside risks to this forecast predominate   With regard to inflation, I expect core PCE inflation to remain around 1¾ percent over   the next several years  The probable appearance of a small amount of labor market slack is   likely to help hold down inflation  In addition, I expect that, with inflation remaining below   2 percent, inflation expectations will edge down as well, reinforcing our success  I hope that this   result will be aided by the release of our extended forecasts and the greater awareness of where   we would like to see inflation settle down  I see the risk to my inflation forecast as moderate and   mainly to the upside in view of recent increases in oil and food prices, declines in the dollar, and   a slower rate of structural productivity growth     So, in summary, I think the most likely outcome is that the economy will move forward   toward a soft landing  I see downside risks to economic activity and some upside risks to   inflation  But in view of continuing questions about the effects of the financial market shock, I   am more concerned about the activity side of things right now     Not the asymmetry of the risk, but it will be described    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I found the choice between alternatives A and B   to be a tough call  I’ve struggled with this over the past week, and in the end I find the arguments   for alternative A for a 25 basis point rate cut more persuasive  I have several reasons for this   judgment   October 30-31, 2007 103 of 162    First, as I argued yesterday, further action to my mind is appropriate, even leaving aside the   recent financial shock  With output near potential and inflation near my objective, the stance of   policy should be close to neutral, and while we can debate exactly what the equilibrium real interest   rate is—that’s an important discussion to me—it appears that, even after our action in September,   policy is somewhat restrictive  I agree with President Plosser’s view that we need to maintain some   consistency in our thinking over time, and I would say that I expressed this identical view at our last   meeting and said at that time that I did envision a 75 basis point cut during 2007  So my views   haven’t changed, and the data that we have seen in the intermeeting period haven’t suddenly pushed   me in the direction of this move—instead, if anything, slightly away from it, but I regard those data   as largely uninformative  So my views really haven’t changed about this, but it seems to me that the   argument that we should be moving toward neutral does allow for quite a bit of flexibility in the   timing of an additional rate cut  It doesn’t have to be something that we do in October  We could   do it in December, or it could wait until January  So that argument in and of itself doesn’t   completely persuade me that we have to do it today   But I do think it would be prudent to act today for a couple of reasons  The first has to do   with the effects of the financial shock of the summer  When we came into the meeting last month,   we faced credit conditions that were quite restrictive, and our goal was to offset that shock to avoid   a significant economic slowdown  I think the favorable inflation results over the previous six   months did give us the flexibility to take strong action, which we did  My judgment is that we have   had some success so far  Financial conditions appear to be easier than they were in September, and   arguably, as I said yesterday, I think we may have roughly neutralized the shock  But an important   element in our success has been the decline in Treasury rates along with the further decline we’ve   seen in the dollar and the increase in equity prices since we last met  Those changes are supported   October 30-31, 2007 104 of 162    by the market’s expectations that we will ease further at this meeting and beyond  In other words, if   we don’t ease today as the market expects, then rates may move up, and that raises concern to my   mind about whether we will have accomplished the goal of offsetting the restrictive effects of the   recent financial shock  A second reason for easing today is the asymmetric nature of the risks we   face in achieving our goals  I do see some upside risk to inflation although I have not read the   recent increase in five-to-ten-year inflation compensation as really reflecting a market perception of   a deterioration in long-term inflation expectations  In my view, the more serious risk is the one that   our Chairman discussed yesterday of unleashing negative nonlinear dynamics in the real and   financial economy that could be difficult to reverse  Conditions in housing markets and their   possible implications for housing prices and, in turn, consumption are at the center of these   concerns  In addition, although liquidity in financial markets has improved, I think the markets are   still rather fragile and subject to further sudden disruptions   I’m comfortable with the wording in alternative A, including the balance of risk assessment    Through the fed funds rate being 25 basis points lower, I do see the upside risk to inflation as being   roughly balanced with the downside risk to growth  I think the statement does give us sufficient   flexibility to respond in whatever way we need to, and that includes the possibility of taking back   some of this easing should there be upside surprises  I do think that it’s important to signal to   markets that this is not yet another step in a planned series of continuing rate cuts  "
8046,2007-12-06,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support the swap arrangement, and I can   also support the TAF  In thinking about the TAF, I tried to weight the potential costs and   benefits of the program  It hasn’t been an easy task given the uncertainty about what’s   responsible for the run-up in term funding spreads  So I thought about potential costs  I   certainly don’t see them as particularly large  It is true that it may not have the desired effects,   and one could argue that the Fed’s reputation would be tarnished by a failure to succeed, but I   didn’t find this compelling  On the contrary, it seems to me that taking an innovative and   proactive approach does a much better job of enhancing our reputation  The greater threat is not   being willing to cope with what clearly is a very difficult and disturbed situation in money   December 6, 2007 32 of 51    markets  I congratulate the staff  I think this does represent innovative thinking  On the cost   side also, the TAF would subsidize probably low-quality borrowers, but I think that’s a side   effect that any intervention that’s aimed at improving liquidity will have, and that’s an   acceptable price to pay   On the benefit side, though, I guess I’m concerned that the benefits won’t be particularly   large  I agree with the comments that have been made  I don’t quite see how the TAF solves the   stigma problem  I think there will be stigma as long as the equilibrium rate ends up being a   penalty rate, and I think that’s likely to deter bidding  So I guess I don’t really see that this is   very advantageous—the TAF relative to changing the spread of the discount rate and the funds   rate—but I do see the merit in the arguments that you’ve made about the predictability of the   quantity of discount window lending and the desirability of international cooperation   I would say that to my mind the principal risk in introducing the TAF is that it may be   seen by the Committee as a substitute for standard monetary policy action since I see it as   essentially a kind of sterilized intervention that may have some but not a huge effect  I’m also   concerned that it won’t change the cost of funding at the margin, as President Poole argued  I   don’t expect the TAF to have large effects on financial conditions, and so it’s not going to affect   my own views very much on what the appropriate policy measures are to take when we meet   next week  "
8069,2007-12-11,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  At the time of our last meeting, I held out   hope that the financial turmoil would gradually ebb and the economy might escape without   serious damage  Subsequent developments have severely shaken that belief  The bad news since   our last meeting has grown steadier and louder, as strains in financial markets have resurfaced   and intensified and as the economy has shown clear signs of faltering  In addition, the downside   threats to growth that then seemed to be tail events now appear to be much closer to the center of   the distribution  I found little to console me in the Greenbook  Like the Board staff, I have   significantly marked down my growth forecast  The possibilities of a credit crunch developing   and of the economy slipping into a recession seem all too real   Conditions in financial markets have worsened  Rates on a wide array of loans and   securities have increased significantly since our last meeting, including those on term   commercial paper, term LIBOR, prime jumbo mortgages, and high-yield corporate bonds  CDS   spreads from major financial institutions with significant mortgage exposure, including Freddie   and Fannie, have risen appreciably  In addition, broad stock indexes are down nearly 5 percent    At the same time, measures of implied volatility in equity, bond, and foreign exchange markets   have all moved up, reflecting the greater uncertainty about the economy’s direction    The most recent data on spending have been discouraging as well  Data on house sales,   prices, and construction have been downbeat, and foreclosures on subprime loans have moved   even higher  Even with efforts such as those facilitated by the Administration to freeze subprime   rates, foreclosures look to rise sharply next year, which may dump a large number of houses on a   market already swamped with supply  This will exacerbate the downward pressure on house   prices and new home construction from already elevated home inventories  Indeed, the ten-city   December 11, 2007 32 of 138    Case-Shiller home-price index has declined more than 5 percent over the past year through   September, and futures contracts point to another sizable decline over the next twelve months   I am particularly concerned that we may now be seeing the first signs of spillovers from   the housing and financial sectors to the broader economy  Although the job market has remained   reasonably healthy so far, real consumer spending in September and October was dead in the   water, and households are growing more pessimistic about future prospects  The December   reading of consumer sentiment showed another decline, and the cumulative falloff in this   measure is becoming alarming  Gains in disposable income have been weakened  With   consumer sentiment in the doldrums, house prices on the skids, and energy prices on the rise,   consumer spending looks to be quite subdued for some time  This view is echoed by the CEO of   a national high-end clothing retailer on our board, who recently emphasized to us that the   positive chain store sales data in November were in fact artificially boosted by the Thanksgiving   calendar shift and that the underlying trend for his business has worsened notably   My modal forecast foresees the economy barely managing to avoid recession, with   growth essentially zero this quarter and about 1 percent next quarter  I expect growth to remain   below potential throughout next year, causing the unemployment rate to rise to about 5 percent,   much like in the Greenbook  This forecast assumes a 50 basis point decline in the federal funds   rate in the near future, placing the real funds rate near the center of the range of estimates of the   neutral rate reported in the Bluebook  I should emphasize that I do not place a lot of confidence   in this forecast, and, in particular, I fear that we are in danger of sliding into a credit crunch    Such an outcome is illustrated by the credit crunch alternative simulation in the Greenbook    Although I don’t foresee conditions in the banking sector getting as bleak as during the credit   crunch of the early 1990s, the parallels to those events are striking  Back then, we saw a large   December 11, 2007 33 of 138    number of bank failures in the contraction of the savings and loan sector  In the current   situation, most banks are still in pretty good shape  Instead, it is the shadow banking sector—  that is, the set of markets in which a variety of securitized assets are financed by the issuance of   commercial paper—that is where the failures have occurred  This sector is all but shut for new   business     But bank capital is also an issue  Until the securitization of nonconforming mortgage   lending reemerges, financing will depend on the willingness and ability of banks, thrifts, and the   GSEs to step in to fill the breach  To the extent they do, that will put further pressure on their   capital, which is already under some pressure from write-downs on existing loans and holdings   of assets  Banks are showing increasing concern that their capital ratios will become binding and   are tightening credit terms and conditions  Several developments suggest to me that this   situation could worsen  In addition to the problems plaguing the adjustable-rate subprime   mortgages, delinquencies have recently started to move up more broadly—on credit card and   auto loans, adjustable-rate prime mortgages, and fixed-rate subprime mortgages  My contacts at   large District banks tell me that, because the economy continues to be reasonably healthy and   people have jobs, things are still under control  But if house prices and the stock market fall   further and the economy appears to be weakening, then they will further tighten the lending   conditions and terms on consumer loans to avoid problems down the road, and these fears could   be self-fulfilling  If banks only partially replace the collapsed shadow banks or, worse, if they   cut back their lending in anticipation of a worsening economy, then the resulting credit crunch   could push us into recession  This possibility is presumably increasingly reflected in CDS and   low-grade corporate bond spreads  Thus, the risk of recession no longer seems remote,   especially since the economy may well already have begun contracting in the current quarter    December 11, 2007 34 of 138    Indeed, the December Blue Chip consensus puts the odds of a recession at about 40 percent    This estimate is within the range of recession probabilities computed by my staff using models   based on the yield curve and other variables     Turning to inflation, data on the core measure continues to be favorable  Wage growth   remains moderate, and the recent downward revisions to hourly compensation have relieved   some worries there  Inflation expectations remain contained  As I mentioned, I expect some   labor market slack to develop, and this should offset any, in my view, modest inflationary   pressures from past increases in energy and import prices and help keep core PCE price inflation   below 2 percent  Continued increases in energy and import prices pose some upside risk to the   inflation outlook, but there are also downside risks to inflation associated with a weakening   economy and rising unemployment     To sum up, I believe that the most likely outcome is for the economy to slow   significantly in the near term, flirting with recession, and I view the risk to that scenario as being   weighted significantly to the downside  In contrast, I expect inflation to remain well contained,   and I view those risks as fairly balanced    Thank you, Mr Chairman  With respect to policy, I also favor   alternative A, a 50 basis point rate cut  Let me explain my reasoning  Otherwise I certainly agree   with what President Rosengren said  First, I think the equilibrium real rate of interest is low relative   to its long-run average  The range of medium-run measures of r* reported in the Bluebook is   between 18 and 23 percent, and this range includes the Greenbook-consistent measure and the   December 11, 2007 96 of 138    staff’s Kalman filter model estimate of 21 percent  Market perceptions of future real interest rates   are also very low, with yields on five-year Treasury inflation-indexed bonds now below 1¼ percent    I think the headwinds from financial market turmoil and the more general reassessment of risks that   is taking place in global markets are good reasons why the equilibrium real rate may be low in the   current situation  We do have historical precedence for this  For example, Kalman filter estimates   of r* fell noticeably during the credit crunch of the early 1990s   Given the current state of the economy with inflation near a level consistent with price   stability and resource utilization near its equilibrium level, policy should be close to neutral, which   implies a nominal funds rate of 4 to 4¼ percent  The forecast and risk assessment must also enter   the analysis  With an assumed 25 basis point cut at this meeting, the Greenbook foresees the   economy barely skirting a recession, so any more bad news could put us over the edge; and the   possibility of getting bad news—in particular, a significant credit crunch—seems far from remote     To my mind, the risk to the forecast and the risk of a vicious cycle, in which deteriorating financial   conditions and a weakening economy and house prices feed on each other, argue for adopting a   risk-management strategy that, at the very minimum, moves our policy stance to the low end of   neutral—namely, a cut of 50 basis points—and I think it argues for doing so now rather than taking   a “wait and see” approach and lowering it only grudgingly  This may not be enough to avoid a   recession—we may soon need outright accommodation—but it would at least help cushion the blow   and lessen the risk of a prolonged downturn  I should also say that my recommendation assumes   that the implementation of the TAF, even if it succeeds in improving liquidity in the money market,   will not appreciably alleviate macroeconomic conditions   Regardless of the policy actions taken at this meeting, I think we need to be very careful in   these unsettled conditions about how we communicate our assessment of risks and likely future   December 11, 2007 97 of 138    policy actions  We should maintain maximum flexibility so that our future actions can, in Governor   Kohn’s well-chosen words, be nimble  If the Committee chooses to cut the funds rate 50 points, I   would favor the assessment of risks from section 4, alternative B, in table 1  This appropriately   leaves open what the future policy will be and stresses that it depends on developments  If the   Committee goes with the 25 basis point cut, then I would support using the assessment of risks from   section 4, alternative C, which states clearly that the predominant concern is the downside risk to   growth  Otherwise I fear that market participants may mark up their expected path for policy over   the next year, leading to further erosion in financial conditions  Finally, I would suggest that, given   the long period of time between today and the next FOMC meeting, we be open to the possibility of   a special intermeeting videoconference to assess economic and financial developments, and this   meeting could also benefit from an assessment of the effects of the TAF once it’s in place    I just have a question  With respect to the implementation of the TAF,   could you clarify what we need to ask our boards of directors to do and when?    Do we have those?  We have a meeting on Thursday morning    But you are not circulating them to us?    That would be nice [Laughter]    But general counsels normally don’t participate in this process    No, he didn’t speak to me    "
8089,2008-01-09,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I agree with both the concerns that you   expressed and the analysis that you offered  Based on the data we now have in hand, I support a   50 basis point reduction in the federal funds rate in the near future  I think a very good case can   be made for moving down 25 basis points today, and it would be my preference  According to   what Bill Dudley said, markets apparently do attach some probability to a move of that   magnitude before the January meeting  I could also support a 50 basis point move today, but I   am concerned that it might be taken as a sign of panic by the Committee and somehow wrongly   indicate that we have inside information showing that things are even worse than markets already   think or, alternatively, be seen as an overreaction to the employment report  But if we don’t   move today, I do think we need to take decisive action in January, and I hope you will give a   strong signal that we will do so in your speech    I agree with the staff’s assessment that the outlook for economic growth has weakened   since December, and I also see the downside risks to the forecast as having increased since then    We have revised down our 2008 forecast also because of the sharp increase in energy prices and   the deterioration we have seen in financial conditions just since December  It is good that   conditions in money markets have improved somewhat, but equity prices have fallen very   substantially—I guess around 6 percent since our last meeting  Credit spreads are up, and   borrowing rates for many borrowers are higher in spite of a decline in Treasury yields  I also   find the labor market developments worrisome  I try not to put too much weight on any single   monthly observation, but I find it entirely believable and consistent with everything else we are   January 9, 2008 22 of 60    seeing that we have entered, at best, a period of slow employment growth  It is something that   we have been expecting all along  It helps to resolve some of the puzzles we have been   discussing about why labor markets have been so strong relative to goods markets   It is true that consumer spending has been amazingly robust so far, but I find it   unimaginable that it can continue when slow growth in disposable income is added to everything   else that is weighing on households, particularly rising energy prices, accelerating declines in   house prices, and falling stock prices  It seems to me that, with the stagnant or contracting labor   market, the odds of a recession—and, as you argued, a potentially very nasty one—have risen  I   am also very worried about the possibility of a credit crunch if higher job losses begins to make   lenders pull back credit  It is true that on the inflation front the recent news hasn’t been   particularly good  It certainly is true that there are upside risks  But I do take comfort from the   fact that inflation compensation has remained well behaved and that we already have slack in the   labor market and more seems likely to develop   I support a significant rate cut not only because of the downgrade to the economic   forecast since December but also because I think the stance of policy even now with the actions   we have taken—I agree with you—is still within the neutral range  Given current prospects and   the asymmetric nature of the risks, particularly the high tail risk associated with the credit   crunch, I believe that policy should be clearly accommodative  So having revised down my   forecast, I would support a significant funds rate cut as a way to catch up with where policy   should be  "
8107,2008-01-21,"  Thank you  I strongly support your proposal for a 75 basis point funds   rate cut today, and I like the proposed wording of the statement  The outlook has deteriorated,   not only since December but since our conference call  The downside risks have clearly   increased  I think the risk of a severe recession and credit crisis is unacceptably high, and it is   being clearly priced now into not only domestic but also global markets  Even so, I put the   stance, as best I can judge it, of monetary policy within the neutral range  Policy should be   January 21, 2008 11 of 32    clearly accommodative  We also need a cushion against severe downside risks  We need strong   action, and your speech has prepared the markets for actions of this sort  At this point, they are   expecting at our next meeting more than 50 percent odds of a 75 basis point cut  An   intermeeting move will be a surprise, but I think it will show that we get it and we recognize we   have been behind the curve  I think it will be assumed with this statement and action today that   we will move somewhat further as well at our next meeting  That is something we should   recognize—the statement creates that expectation  "
8139,2008-01-29,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I broadly agree with the Greenbook forecast   for economic growth this year and with the assessment that the downside risks to that forecast   are considerable  The severe and prolonged housing downturn and financial shock have put the   economy at, if not beyond, the brink of recession  My forecast incorporates fiscal stimulus of the   same magnitude as the Greenbook and monetary stimulus that is somewhat larger  I have   assumed a 50 basis point cut at this meeting and an additional 25 basis point cut during the first   half  My forecast shows growth of 1½ percent in 2008, like the Greenbook, but it has a more   pronounced acceleration in 2009 as the monetary and fiscal stimulus kickstarts the economy    The unemployment rate edges up this year to 5¼ percent before dropping gradually next year   toward the natural rate of 4¾  I am especially concerned about the outlook for consumer   January 29–30, 2008 51 of 249    spending  The combined hits to equity and housing wealth will extract a considerable toll, and   consumer spending will be further depressed by slower growth in disposable income due to   weaker employment growth  Delinquencies and charge-offs on most forms of consumer debt   have already risen, and slower job growth seems likely to exacerbate this trend, prompting   financial institutions to further tighten credit standards and terms  In my forecast, such   developments reverberate back negatively onto economic activity   Like the Greenbook, I downgraded my economic outlook substantially since our last in-  person meeting  The December employment report was probably the single most shocking piece   of real side news prompting this revision  But knowing that it is unwise to put too much weight   on any single piece of data, I have been examining the question of whether that report was more   signal or noise  The drop in initial UI claims to relatively low levels in recent weeks makes such   an assessment important  Because the behavior of both series may have been affected by   seasonal factors near year-end, it seems worthwhile to examine a broad range of data bearing on   the labor market  My conclusion is that the labor market has indeed been weakening since   mid-2007, and the extent of weakening, while relatively modest thus far, is quite typical of   patterns seen when the economy is tipping into recession   Independent evidence of a weakening in the labor market comes from the household   survey  Even when adjusted for definitional and measurement differences from the payroll   survey, the household survey shows a fairly smooth trend of declining employment growth   during 2007  The drop in payroll employment in December helped bring the establishment data   into closer alignment with the household employment data  In the payroll survey, the slowdown   is concentrated in construction and finance  In the household series, higher unemployment is   actually widespread across sectors  The household survey also contains other signs of a   January 29–30, 2008 52 of 249    weakening job market  a 25 percent increase in the unemployment rate for job losers, which   accounts for the lion’s share of the overall increase in aggregate unemployment; an increase in   the number of newly unemployed job losers, which can be thought of as a broader measure than   UI claims of inflows into unemployment; and an increase of 5 to 10 percent in the estimated   expected completed duration of an unemployment spell, suggesting a reduced pace of outflows   from unemployment  The labor force participation rate of men and women of age 16 to 24 years   has also fallen notably in recent months  Labor force participation rates for this group have been   edging down since the last recession, but the decline accelerated in 2007, and historically this   group is among the first to respond to weakening labor market conditions   Data from the JOLTS survey, which we discussed in the Q&A round, confirm the   weakness revealed elsewhere  The job openings, or vacancy, rate is down, consistent with the   reduced pace of outflows from unemployment, as reflected in continuing UI claims and   unemployment durations, and layoffs and discharges are up sharply  Other data cited in the   Greenbook, Part 2, such as net hiring plans for Manpower, and NFIB and survey measures of job   availability and unemployment expectations further corroborate a slowdown  With the aggregate   unemployment rate now up only 06 percentage point off its low, I would describe the   deterioration in the labor market thus far as modest, but it is noteworthy that an increase in   unemployment of this magnitude, in the space of 12 months, has occurred only twice since 1948   outside of recessions   While my modal scenario contains a near-term slowdown rather than a contraction, it is   actually pretty rosy compared with what I fear might happen  My contacts have turned decidedly   negative in the past six to eight weeks, and further financial turmoil may still ensue  On   consumer spending, two large retailers report very subdued expectations going forward   January 29–30, 2008 53 of 249    following the weak holiday season, which involved a lot of discounting  On hiring and capital   spending, my contacts have emphasized restraint in their plans due to fears that the economy will   continue to slow  A serious issue is whether the tightening of credit standards that is under way    will deepen into a full-blown credit crunch  The new Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey shows   a noticeable tightening in lending standards, and this is confirmed by my contacts  For example,   senior officers of a large bank in my District recently described a variety of new steps they are   taking to protect against credit losses  They are tightening underwriting practices across the   entire consumer lending and small business loan portfolio  A recent strategy has involved   classifying MSAs according to whether their real estate markets are stable, soft, distressed, or   severely distressed, using both historical and prospective views of property values  Based on   these designations, the company has reduced permissible combined loan-to-value ratios in their   home equity portfolio, and going forward they intend to apply them across the entire consumer   portfolio  On the positive side, though, they note that lower interest rates have spurred a surge in   applications for mortgage refinancing, and a recent analysis shows that the reduction in the prime   rate is having a significant impact on ARM reset expectations, shifting a large number from   increases to reductions at reset  In fact, an analysis conducted before our most recent rate cut   that assumed a 7 percent prime rate in February 2008—and it is now at 6½—estimates that   two-thirds of the subprime ARM portfolio would now experience a decrease in their monthly   payments at reset  This is a sharp contrast from an analysis in June 2007 with a prime rate of 8   percent   Now let me turn briefly to inflation and inflation expectations  I project that inflation will   decline over the forecast period to around 1¾ percent, and I see the risks around that forecast as   balanced  Admittedly, though, the recent data on inflation have been worrisome, and they raise   January 29–30, 2008 54 of 249    the issue of whether or not we can afford to cut rates as much as needed to fight a recession   without seriously risking a persistently higher rate of inflation and inflation expectations  I tend   to think this risk is manageable, largely because of the credibility we have built  It appears to me   that this credibility has reduced the response of inflation to all the factors thought to influence it,   including energy prices, the exchange rate, and business cycle conditions  Thus I consider it less   likely that rising energy prices are going to push up core inflation very much or that the pass-  through that does occur will easily get built into inflation expectations  So I view inflation as   less persistent now than it once was, tending to revert fairly quickly to the public’s view of our   inflation objective  I do hope that our long-run inflation forecast will help people identify what   that objective is  But even if inflation expectations turn out to be less well anchored than I think,   I still see the inflation risk going forward as roughly balanced  With less well anchored inflation   expectations, there is greater risk that higher energy and import prices will pass through into core   inflation and inflation expectations  By the same token, there is also a greater likelihood that   inflation will decline should a recession occur  We looked at the behavior of core and total   inflation in the first three years following recessions from 1960 to the last one in 2001, and   inflation declined in most of these episodes  The exception is 2001, when core inflation   remained essentially unchanged—which seems consistent with my view that inflation has   become less responsive to the business cycle over the past decade or so as we have acquired   more credibility    We assumed 50 at this meeting    We assumed an additional 25, which would be held in place through   2009Q1, and then a gradual rise    The “why”?    A larger amount?  I wouldn’t attach too much significance to the precise   figure—it’s somewhat more     I’ll see you and up you  [Laughter]      Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support alternative B in the Bluebook  If we   cut the federal funds rate a further 50 basis points today, we will have done a lot in just a week and a   half, but I think these actions do represent an appropriate response to a substantial deterioration in   economic conditions  As I said in my comments on the economic situation, I basically agree with   the Greenbook forecast for this year and perceive the risks to be to the downside  With the fiscal   package, a funds rate of 3 percent will likely promote growth in the second half of this year that’s   moderate after a brush with recession in the first half  I’m comfortable with this action because I   believe our inflation objective is credible, and I do have confidence that we will be able to reverse   the accommodation we’re putting in place when it’s appropriate to do so  But our discussion does   highlight the important point that alternative B seems to be appropriate monetary policy in the   context of the modal forecast  It just brings the real funds rate down to the Greenbook estimate of   January 29–30, 2008 129 of 249    neutral, around 1 percent  If the economy were to go into a recession, additional easing would be   needed and would be appropriate  Also, as Governor Kohn and others have emphasized,   alternative B still doesn’t seem to incorporate much of anything for insurance against recession  So,   indeed, there is a case for doing more than B  There is a case for A, but I wouldn’t go there today  I   think we can wait, and I think we can watch as developments unfold and monitor data   With respect to language, the skew in the risks toward a downside surprise and the possible   need for insurance against that possibility, especially if we see some further deterioration in   financial conditions—that strongly inclines me toward the assessment of risk sentences in   alternative B with their asymmetry toward ease  We need to be absolutely clear, to state clearly   today, that we recognize the continued existence of downside risk and communicate that we stand   ready to cut further if necessary  Therefore, I would definitely retain the sentence in alternative B,   paragraph 4, that states, “However, downside risks to growth remain”  However, I could see a case,   following President Plosser’s suggestion, to substitute the wording from the last sentence of the   December 11 statement to the wording in the last line in alternative B  That is, we could substitute   the words “will act as needed to foster price stability and sustainable economic growth” for the   words “will act in a timely manner as needed to address those risks”  This seems to me to be a   small change that would, taken together with the new first sentence in paragraph 4, slightly dial   down the perceived odds of further cuts relative to the proposed wording in B  Even without the   change that President Plosser suggested, though, the fact that we have added the new first sentence   in paragraph 4 does seem to me to change the wording of the assessment of risk enough relative to   our intermeeting statement to communicate to markets that we will view future policy moves after   the one today somewhat differently going forward  Today’s move and the intermeeting move are   January 29–30, 2008 130 of 249    essentially catch-up, to put us where we think we need to be, and moves going forward will respond   to the evolution that we see in the markets    That’s correct  I was suggesting changing only the very last sentence    He proposed, as I recall, changing two sentences, eliminating the one that   referred to downside risks and also changing the last sentence  I would not want to see the   downside risk sentence eliminated; I would change only the very last sentence   January 29–30, 2008 146 of 249     I wanted to support President Poole’s comment  I remember very well back   at Jackson Hole in 2005 that Raghuram Rajan presented a paper in which he emphasized the   January 29–30, 2008 163 of 249    misalignment of incentives between investors and managers and the fact that almost everyone down   the line right up to the investors themselves should have had incentives here  I don’t know what   they were thinking, but everybody was rewarded for the quantity and not the quality of originations    He warned us before any of this happened that this could come to no good, and I think he did have   some suggestions about compensation practices  These were not popular suggestions  So I think   this is worth some thought  I don’t know what the answer is in terms of changing these practices    Maybe the market will attend to them, but it seems to me that we have had an awful lot of booms   and busts in which this type of incentive played a role  Your presentation and the paper started from   the fact that you note the deterioration in underwriting, but we should go one step backward  I   suppose another issue here is what we saw in our supervision and whether we acted appropriately   given what we saw  That raises a number of issues that I won’t go into at the moment but that I   think we need to be sensitive to  "
8158,2008-03-10,"  No, I don’t have a question    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I strongly support the proposed term securities   lending facility  I certainly agree that we face a situation in which systemic risk is large, and it’s   escalating very quickly  A dangerous dynamic has set in  Bill, Don, and all the memos did a great   job in describing it  I think financial stability is truly at stake here, and although there are financial   and reputational risks in pursuing this approach, it is a creative and well-targeted approach, and it is   worth taking these risks to try to arrest the downward spiral in market conditions  Our monetary   policy efforts have been seriously thwarted by the spread-widening that’s taking place, and the rapid   escalation we’re seeing in these spreads—large increases in a matter of just the past couple of days   in the absence of significant news that relates to the real creditworthiness of borrowers—suggests to   me that the spread increases are, indeed, related to deteriorating liquidity conditions and not   primarily to higher underlying credit risk  I think it is absolutely right to worry that liquidity   problems are escalating into solvency problems  So as with the TAF, I am not 100 percent   convinced that this is going to work, but I definitely think it is a good idea to move ahead and to do   so quickly  "
8180,2008-03-18,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Since we met at the end of January, there has   been an utter dearth of good news concerning both the real and the financial sides of the   March 18, 2008 29 of 127    economy  On the real side, I just can’t recall any intermeeting period in which nearly every   single data point was dismal  On the financial side, there have been occasional good days, but   the net changes over the intermeeting period have been negative across the board in both the   equity and the credit markets, so financial conditions have unambiguously tightened  These   developments are familiar to all of us, and I won’t take up time to review the specifics   My overall sense at this point is that the effects of the severe and prolonged housing   downturn, the financial market implosion, and the price increases for oil and other commodities   have now spread to most corners of the economy, including the major segments of consumption   and business fixed investment  Exports represent about the only source of strength, and while   that is welcome, I must say that the economy is pretty clearly in trouble when the contribution to   real GDP growth from exports exceeds overall real GDP growth, as may well happen this year    The bottom line is that, like nearly everyone else, I have downgraded my economic outlook   substantially  Assuming that the stance of policy is eased substantially at this meeting and   additionally by midyear, I see the economy as essentially in recession during the first half before   picking up somewhat in the second because of the effects of monetary and fiscal policy   However, I certainly see large downside risks to my forecast, and I think the Greenbook’s   view that recessionary nonlinearities have already set in seems to me to be within a reasonable   range of outcomes  In fact, we have also been looking at monthly data on coincident business   cycle indicators, and that examination suggests to us that the NBER may well date the beginning   of the recession to last November   The prospect of this outcome has been made more palpable for me by the rather sudden   increase in the frequency and intensity of pretty dire comments I am hearing from my contacts    First, I have heard widespread reports of reductions in capital spending plans due to caution or   March 18, 2008 30 of 127    pessimism regarding economic growth  For example, a large manufacturer and retailer of   outdoor sports equipment reported that technology and infrastructure spending has been cut by at   least a third in 2008  In another example, a large player in commercial real estate in the San   Francisco Bay area described how projects are being canceled because the financing spigot has   been shut  Indeed, nonresidential construction is one sector where I think the Greenbook may be   too optimistic  I envision growing weakness there   Second, my retail contacts suggest that spending has softened further in the wake of a   weak holiday season, and expectations are for continued weakness at least through spring  For   example, the CEO of a large high-end national retail operation reports that for January and   February he has seen declines in sales that haven’t been experienced for almost fifteen years    These declines have created tremendous pressure on inventory levels requiring large markdowns   with negative effects on profits  Vendors are reeling from the cancellation of orders, the return   of goods, and sharp reductions in new orders   Third, a number of contacts have provided comments reinforcing the view that a   significant credit crunch is under way  Slightly more than half of the comments received on this   topic indicate that credit standards have tightened significantly in recent months  In one   example, the CEO of a bank in my District reports that several of the nation’s largest mortgage   lenders have suspended withdrawals from open home equity lines out of concern that borrowers   could now owe more than their homes are worth  As a final anecdote, a banker in my District   who lends to wineries noted that high-end boutique producers face a distinctly softening market   for their products, although sales of cheap wine are soaring  [Laughter]    Now let me turn to inflation and inflation expectations  Of course, much of the recent   data have been disappointing, having been pushed up by rising energy and other commodity   March 18, 2008 31 of 127    prices  Though I was heartened by Friday’s CPI report, this one observation hasn’t changed my   overall impression that prospects for core inflation this year have worsened a bit since we met in   January, and I have raised my projection for core PCE inflation about ¼ percent in 2008, to   2¼ percent  These data raise the issue of whether cutting rates as much as needed to fight a   recession may risk persistently higher inflation and inflation expectations  But I tend to think   this risk is manageable     First, as I have said before, I view inflation as less persistent now than it once was,   tending to revert fairly quickly to its longer-run trend  We have recently reviewed and updated   our econometric evidence for this and found it to be even more convincing now than it was a   couple of years ago  Of course, it is important to remember that the current lack of persistence   presumably is due to our enhanced credibility, so we do have to be careful to maintain it  Recent   increases in inflation compensation in Treasury markets highlight the risk that our attempts to   deal with problems in the real economy possibly could lead to higher inflation expectations and   an erosion of our inflation credibility  But inflation compensation is just one indicator of   inflation expectations  I very much like the Board staff’s approach, which is in the current   Bluebook, of combining the information from a wide variety of indicators into a principal-  component-type model  I found it reassuring that the resulting index of inflation expectations   and uncertainty is still within the range of variation that we have seen over the past decade or so   Second, I tend to think that developments in labor compensation are an important part of   the transmission process for monetary policy to inflation  Before we get into too much trouble   with inflation and inflation expectations, I would expect to see labor compensation begin to rise   more rapidly  I find it reassuring that both our broad measures of compensation have expanded   March 18, 2008 32 of 127    quite moderately over the past year, and productivity growth has been fairly robust  So after   incorporating its effects, unit labor costs are up less than 1 percent over the past four quarters   Finally, the more pronounced slowdown that I expect for economic activity is likely to   put somewhat greater downward pressure on inflation going forward  Overall, I expect core PCE   inflation to fall below 2 percent next year under an assumed leveling out of energy and other   commodity prices and the projected weakening of labor and product markets     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support your proposal for a 75 basis point cut   and the language that’s proposed for alternative A  As I said in my comments, I’m very concerned   about economic growth and agree basically with the Greenbook perspective  I think we are into an   adverse feedback loop, and I agree with the Bluebook assessment that the equilibrium real funds   March 18, 2008 91 of 127    rate has dropped substantially, maybe into negative territory  I don’t believe in gradualism in   circumstances like these  I think the argument for more-aggressive action now is similar to when   inflation is very low and we face the zero bound for nominal interest rates  I agree with Governor   Mishkin’s comments about the lessons of Japan  I think that the sooner appropriate stimulus is put   in place, the less likely it is that policy will end up facing very unpleasant consequences of   essentially reaching the zero bound in this case because of a prolonged and severe recession  So I’d   like to see the funds rate moved down to where it needs to go sooner rather than later   I think the appropriate level of the funds rate is one that would provide some insurance   against really bad outcomes for the economy, and I don’t see this move as taking us into insurance   territory yet  So I understand the constraints that you have weighed into this decision having to do   with the psychology of inflation expectations and the dollar, and probably this is as far as we can go   sensibly today, but I think it is important to move as much as we can   If the moves prove unnecessary, I think we can reverse the stance of policy quickly, with a   good chance of avoiding inflationary problems  I agree with Governor Mishkin’s views on risk-  management policy in the face of financial shocks  We had an interesting discussion last time about   the possibility that a quick reversal might mean that we don’t have much stimulative effect on   spending now because we may not lower long-term interest rates enough, and I think that was good   food for thought  But having spent some time thinking about it, I think that a lower funds rate will   actually lower long-term rates, in part because, by reducing the probability of a financial crisis, we   will bring risk premiums down, which will lower long-term rates  A lower funds rate will also be   stimulative because a good deal depends on short- and intermediate-term rates  I think there are   also a number of other ways in which short rates matter to spending through channels like raising   March 18, 2008 92 of 127    firms’ profitability and cash flow and lowering the stress from ARM resets  So I strongly support   the action that you recommend  "
8206,2008-04-29,"  Are you asking voters only?    Thank you, Mr Chairman  In looking at the latest Blue Chip forecasts for   GDP growth, I noted that the range between the highest and lowest is among the largest on record    The 10 most optimistic forecasters are predicting over 2½ percentage points faster Q4-over-Q4   growth than the 10 most pessimistic ones  Such forecast dispersion is indicative of the unusually   high degree of uncertainty that we are facing     The Greenbook presents one of the most pessimistic economic forecasts; yet I find its   recessionary projection quite plausible and see downside risks that could take the economy well   below that forecast  Although I found it especially difficult this time to decide on the most likely   outcome for the economy, I ended up submitting a forecast that shows somewhat more growth in   2008 than the Greenbook, even though we shared the same assumption concerning monetary policy   this year  My forecast projects 2008 growth of ¾ percent  This averages no growth in the first half   and 1½ percent growth in the second  The unemployment rate increases to just over 5½ percent by   the end of this year, a bit lower than the Greenbook  In one critical area—namely, the adverse   effects of financial sector developments on the real economy—I remain just as pessimistic as the   Greenbook  Although the likelihood of a severe financial panic has diminished, the risks are by no   means behind us  Moreover, credit conditions have turned quite restrictive  This credit crunch   April 29–30, 2008 47 of 266    reflects the drying up of financing both for markets that were important sources of business and   consumer credit and from banks that are contending with capital-depleting losses and illiquid assets   Among banks, the latest Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey noted a clear tightening of   lending standards, and my own discussions with bankers confirmed this point  They say they are   carefully reassessing and significantly curtailing existing home equity lines of credit as well as   unsecured consumer loans of all sorts  Banks are also clamping down on the provision of revolving   business credit, even to very creditworthy customers  For example, the treasurer of Chevron, a   highly rated oil company that, as you can guess given energy prices, has a very strong profit   outlook, recently complained to me that banks were reluctant to extend even its credit line  Such   reluctance is also evident for lending to students, consumers, and other businesses  The risk of a   deepening credit crunch remains as a weak economy—especially with further sharp declines in   housing prices—escalates credit losses, harms financial institution balance sheets, and causes them   to scale back lending even further  My sense from our business contacts is that their perception of   reduced access to credit is causing them to manage their firm’s liquidity more carefully and is   leading to some deferrals in capital spending projects as a precautionary measure  Certainly the   mood is decidedly more pessimistic and cautious   Amid the gloom of the credit crunch, I do see a possible silver lining in that it may amplify   the effects of the fiscal stimulus package, and this is part of the reason that my forecasted downturn   is a little milder than the Greenbook’s  In particular, because of the credit and liquidity   considerations, the latest fiscal package could well provide a bigger bang for the buck than the tax   rebates in 2001  First, the current tax rebates are more directly targeted at lower-income   households, which are more likely to be credit constrained and to spend the cash once it’s in hand    Second, given the current tightening of credit availability, households will likely spend an even   April 29–30, 2008 48 of 266    greater fraction of the tax rebates than they did in 2001  Of course, there is considerable uncertainty   about assessing the potential size of these effects  But over the next few months as the checks go   out and the retail sales reports come in, we should get a pretty quick preliminary read on how things   are shaping up   Regarding inflation, the most worrying developments since we met in March have been the   price surges for a wide variety of raw materials and commodities, especially the jump in the price of   crude oil  From the US perspective, this run-up in prices represents mainly a classic supply shock,   which could threaten both parts of our dual mandate, although the decline in the dollar has slightly   exacerbated the severity of the impact  Like the Greenbook, my forecast for inflation does take   commodity price futures at face value and foresees a leveling-out of prices going forward    Although I must say, after four years of being wrong, I am beginning to feel like Charlie Brown   trying to kick that football  The most recent core consumer price data have shown some   improvement, and like the Greenbook, I’m optimistic that core inflation will subside to around 1¾   percent over the forecast period, assuming that the commodity prices do finally level off and   compensation remains well behaved   An interesting analysis by Bart Hobijn of the New York Fed as well as my own staff implies   that, in an accounting sense, pass-through from the run-up in oil and crop prices may have boosted   core inflation as much as 03 percentage point over the past two years  So a leveling-off of these   prices could lower not only headline but also core inflation  My core PCE inflation forecast is a   tenth or two lower than the Greenbook this year and next also because we assume lower pass-  through of the dollar depreciation to non-oil import prices  We have been reexamining the data on   this issue and find the evidence quite convincing that pass-through has been quite low recently—  lower, for example, than embodied in the FRB/US model   April 29–30, 2008 49 of 266    With respect to inflation expectations, market-based measures have now edged down  We   took little comfort from this fact, however, because we had viewed the uptick in inflation   compensation in recent months mainly as a reflection of a higher inflation risk premium and not a   reflection of higher inflation expectations  I am also somewhat concerned that the median   expectation for inflation over the next five to ten years in the Michigan survey has ticked up    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I favor alternative B with the wording that   has been proposed  But I do appreciate that there is a case for alternative C as well, and I   understand and appreciate the arguments that have been made in favor of it  On the pure   economic merits, I definitely support a 25 basis point cut  As I noted in my comments on the   economic situation, it appears that the economy has stalled and may have fallen into a recession    I share the same concerns as Governor Kohn and President Stern  My forecast is close to the   Greenbook  I think a further easing in financial conditions is needed to counter the credit crunch,   and I believe that a cut in the federal funds rate will be efficacious in easing financial conditions   April 29–30, 2008 120 of 266    Although the real federal funds rate is accommodative by any usual measure of it, I   completely agree with Governor Kohn’s discussion of this topic  This is a situation in which   spreads have increased so much and credit availability has diminished so much that looking at   the real federal funds rate is just a very misleading way of assessing the overall tightness of   financial conditions  I consider them, on balance, to be notably tighter than they were in the   beginning of August  I don’t agree that further cuts in the federal funds rate will be ineffective in   helping us achieve our employment goal or counterproductive to the attainment of price stability   over the medium term  Given that a 25 basis point cut is what the markets are now   anticipating—it is built in—I would not expect this action, coupled with the language in   alternative B, to touch off further declines in the dollar or to exacerbate inflationary expectations   That said, I did see arguments in favor of alternative C as well  I can see some advantage   in doing a little less today than markets are expecting as long as we reaffirm that we do retain the   flexibility to respond quickly to further negative news with additional cuts  A case that could be   made for pausing is that we will soon get information relating to GDP in the second quarter and   get a better read on just how serious the downturn is  With respect to market and inflationary   psychology, I also can see a case for doing less than markets expect  It is true that some   measures of inflation expectations have edged up a bit, and I would agree with President Fisher   that perhaps a pause would counter any impression that we have become more tolerant of   inflation in the long run  But I don’t think we have become more tolerant of inflation in the long   run, and I did see today’s reading on the employment cost index as further confirmation that at   this point nothing is built into labor markets that suggests that we are developing a wage–price   spiral of the type that was of such concern and really propelling the problems in the 1970s  On   the other hand, I agree with President Plosser, too  Wages aren’t a leading indicator  We have to   April 29–30, 2008 121 of 266    watch inflationary expectations  So I don’t think that is definitive  Nevertheless, I do find it   quite reassuring that nothing is going on there at this point   I think doing nothing today might mitigate the risk of a flight from dollar assets, which   could exacerbate financial turmoil  So there are arguments in favor of alternative C, and I   recognize them  But, on balance, I believe that the stronger case is for B    I have a comment, not a question    Thank you  First, I do really appreciate all the excellent work the staff   has done on this topic  I really learned a lot from these papers  I thought they were very clear   and very comprehensive  I have just a couple of comments on the questions that Bill and Brian   raised in the memo  The first one has to do with whether or not we agree with the objectives,   and I do have a couple of issues     First, I think that the stated objective of reducing the burdens and dead weight losses   associated with the current reserve tax is too narrowly framed in the paper  My starting point is,   about burden, that to cover a given program of government spending, the Treasury has to obtain   revenue from some source, and nondistortionary lump-sum taxes are not one of the available   options  So the real question from the public finance standpoint is what to tax and how much    That means, to my mind, that the issue here is how the magnitude of the welfare gains that would   come from lowering the dead weight loss due to the implicit tax on reserves compares with   April 29–30, 2008 177 of 266    additional dead weight losses that would result from the alternative taxes that would have to be   raised to make up for this lost revenue  Now the answer depends in part on the interest elasticity   of demand for reserves, I believe  I think it is the case that, if the interest elasticity is relatively   small, the dead weight loss from the reserve tax is relatively small, and the net welfare gain,   taking into account the burdens of raising other taxes to make up for the lost seigniorage, in   effect, could easily turn out to be negative   Let me give you an example of where this comes into play  There is a well-known paper   by Martin Feldstein in which he looks at the benefits of moving to price stability, zero inflation,   which he favors  He looks at this issue in that context, and he concludes that there would be net   social losses, not gains, from the reduction in seigniorage that would be associated with a move   to zero inflation from positive inflation because the dead weight loss due to the shoe-leather cost,   also known as the Bailey effect, is smaller than the dead weight losses that would be associated   with alternative taxes  In his analysis they are taxes on labor supply and saving  I actually think   that this is a serious problem with the framing of the objectives in this paper  It is, in effect,   saying, “We think we should give a tax cut  We think we should give it to banks, and we think   that, because there is a welfare loss—a Harberger triangle—associated with that, this is clear   welfare gain”  Now, I am not pretending to know exactly how this would come out, but I do   think that’s the issue  If it were to come out that this is a net loss, not a gain, a possible   implication is that if there were a fallback to option 1—I’m not saying that I favor option 1—  there could be a case for paying no interest on required reserves rather than paying interest at the   federal funds rate but paying interest on excess reserves at some rate that we would determine   April 29–30, 2008 178 of 266    There are administrative costs with having voluntary target balances, and it seems to me   that the paper, as we come out with it, ought to try to at least estimate what the administrative   burdens associated with options 2 and 5 would be   Another comment on the issue of objectives  If we are coming out with a white paper, it   seems to me that the objective that everybody is now discussing and that was just discussed—  namely, that paying interest on reserves would enable us to expand the size of our balance sheet   in times of financial crisis, like now, and perhaps greatly enhance the scope for liquidity-altering   interventions that would be possible without having to push the federal funds rate to zero—is a   real improvement in the tool kit that is available to us to address market disruptions  I would see   it as an advantage of paying interest on reserves  If you are discussing this right now with the   Congress and it is much discussed in the press, I think it is kind of odd to come out with a paper   that doesn’t even mention it  Maybe there are disadvantages and not just advantages  But it   seems to me it should be there   Also, I would just say on the question of options 2 and 5 versus options 3 and 4, an   advantage that the paper attaches to having voluntary targets is the ability to moderate the   volatility in the federal funds rate  So it does seem to me that—I understand it may be   difficult—the possibility of intervening multiple times during the day as an alternative, if it were   possible to change the procedures so that there could be multiple interventions to reduce   volatility, would mean that 3 and 4 could be on the table, and there might be less burden   associated with those  So I think that possibility deserves at least careful consideration  "
8233,2008-06-24,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  The intermeeting period has been full of   surprises  Real-side data came in considerably stronger than I anticipated, so like the Greenbook   I have adjusted up my forecast for growth in the current quarter  At the same time, the adverse   fundamentals that will weigh on household and business spending going forward have grown   somewhat heavier overall, and that has prompted me to revise down my growth forecast for the   second half  On the inflation front, readings on core inflation surprised to the downside    Nonetheless, given that the prices of many commodities have continued to rise more rapidly than   I anticipated and that some measures of inflation expectations have turned up, I have adjusted up   my inflation forecast for 2008, considerably up for headline inflation and modestly up for core   inflation   The strong incoming data on spending eased my fears that we are in or are approaching a   recession regime of the sort embedded in the last two Greenbooks  However, given the   numerous large and worsening drags on spending, a couple of months of data aren’t enough to   convince me that we are on a solid trajectory  Moreover, the spending data may well fail to   reflect the real underlying strength of consumer demand because of the effects of the tax rebates    Spending patterns could easily be distorted by small differences between what we projected that   households would spend each month out of rebate checks and what they actually spent  In   monthly spending data, a swing of just a few billion dollars looks enormous  Perhaps   households who were already paying through the nose for food and gas and are increasingly   credit constrained have put their rebate checks to work a bit early this time  After all, households   June 24–25, 2008 35 of 253    knew in advance that the checks were going out  For example, Google searches related to tax   rebates peaked in April  We actually kept track of the data on that  So I will be closely watching   the data over the next few months, hoping to get a cleaner read on the underlying state of   consumer demand   As I said, the adverse fundamentals are still with us and in some part are worsening    Evidence that the credit crunch is ongoing is all too clear  Bank asset quality continues to   deteriorate  Banks continue to deleverage, and they are tightening lending standards as they do   so  The market for private-label securitized mortgages of even the highest quality remains   moribund  Spreads on agency-backed mortgage-backed securities have risen during the   intermeeting period, which are likely to spill over to the primary mortgage market with a lag    Anecdotal reports suggest that the constraints on household borrowing continue to tighten  For   example, two of my most senior bank supervisors—both with FICO scores in the stratosphere—  have had their home equity lines slashed  One has deferred a planned home renovation project   as a consequence  If that is happening to them, I can only imagine how hard it must be to get a   loan if you have a merely average credit rating   Housing prices have also fallen at a somewhat faster rate than the Greenbook previously   anticipated  Given the overhang of homes for sale, the recent rise in mortgage rates, and the fact   that the homeownership rate is likely to continue trending lower, I think the downward pressure   on home prices and construction will persist, as the Greenbook suggests  The Greenbook is   actually at the conservative end in its estimates of the wealth effect  It assumes a marginal   propensity to consume out of housing wealth of about 3½ cents on the dollar  In contrast, a   number of recent estimates in the literature are in the 6 cent to 9 cent range  There is a clear risk,   June 24–25, 2008 36 of 253    then, that the combination of declining housing wealth and tightening credit could lead   households to restrict spending more, and more persistently, than anticipated     But the big adverse shock since the last meeting is oil prices, which are up $25 a barrel   from the already elevated April levels  Empirically, since the mid-1980s, the estimated   responses to relatively exogenous increases in the relative price of oil have tended to look   qualitatively like the simulations in the Bluebook and the Board staff’s special memo on oil   prices, in which we are credible in our commitment to long-term price stability  Most notably,   the empirical estimates suggest at most a modest effect on core inflation  Nominal wages barely   respond; by some estimates they even fall slightly   The model results suggest that the outcomes we have seen in the actual data are crucially   dependent on our having credibility  With substantial target drift, workers demand higher wages,   which firms pay and then pass on  Fortunately, the anecdotes I hear are more consistent with   credibility than with an upward wage–price spiral  In particular, my contacts uniformly report   that they see no signs of wage pressure  There also is no evidence of real wage rigidity in   response to energy prices  When energy prices have risen, real wages—in product as well as   consumption terms—have generally fallen  In other words, real wages have been depressed in   the 2000s, at least in part reflecting rising energy prices  But there is no sign that workers have   over a number of years tried to recoup these losses at the bargaining table  Given the importance   of credibility, the substantial increase in expected inflation in the Michigan survey is concerning   but not yet alarming  I discount these readings somewhat because of analysis by my staff that   suggests that, at either the one-year or the five-to-ten-year horizon, consumers have always   tended to react strongly to contemporaneous inflation data   June 24–25, 2008 37 of 253    Changes in credibility are fundamentally about changes in the process by which people   form expectations  But as far as consumer expectations are concerned, that process appears   remarkably stable  For example, if you use data through the early 2000s to estimate equations   that link inflation expectations to contemporaneous inflation, you will find that those   relationships fit remarkably well out of sample  They don’t show the systematic underprediction   of inflation expectations one might expect if the Fed had suffered a significant loss of credibility   at this point  The dependence of consumer inflation expectations on recent data also leads me to   believe that they will fall if, in fact, headline inflation comes down as we are predicting as   commodity prices level off     Furthermore, I don’t think that households’ elevated expectations will make it harder to   achieve our projections  Earlier research suggested that surveys did, in fact, provide useful   information about future inflation  But during the past 15 or 20 years, the actual inflation   process has become much less persistent even though households appear to assume otherwise    There is, thus, a notable divergence between the actual inflation process and the one that is   embodied in consumers’ inflation forecasts  As a result, inflation forecasts incorporating   consumer expectations have been a lot less than stellar over this recent period  So it does not   appear unreasonable to believe that the effects of recent commodity price shocks will wear off   faster than consumers are expecting  An unresolved question is, Whose expectations matter for   the dynamics of inflation?  I take some solace from the fact that 10-year inflation expectations in   the Survey of Professional Forecasters have been relatively stable since the late 1990s and from   the fact that five-to-ten-year breakeven rates on TIPS are below their peaks from earlier in the   year     June 24–25, 2008 38 of 253    Taken all together, I think inflation expectations remain reasonably well anchored  The   oil price increases have led me to raise my projections for overall PCE inflation sharply  Cost   pressures are likely to push core inflation up a bit, though I see less pass-through than the   Greenbook does  Higher oil prices and interest rates and lower housing prices have led me to   modestly reduce my forecast of growth in the second half of this year and next year  My forecast   is predicated on fed funds rate increases that begin in December of this year, gradually bringing   the funds rate to 4¼ percent in 2010   Briefly, on the issue of long-term economic projections, I welcome greater transparency   about our long-term objectives  I think that would be beneficial, and there is a good reason, as   you have articulated, to try to do that now, given that for many of us—certainly for me—2010 is   not long enough for me to project that the economy will have converged to a steady state  My   preference is to provide projections of the average values for output growth, unemployment, and   total inflation that are expected, say, five to ten years out  I think that these values can   communicate the necessary steady-state information without burdening us with forecasting every   year of the transition to the steady state  Also, I would favor conducting a trial in October    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I favor alternative B with the proposed   wording  Given the forecast and the risks around it, our next move on the funds rate is likely to be   up, and the question is when  Assuming that the data on growth and inflation come in roughly as I   and the Greenbook expect, I would envision beginning to remove policy accommodation toward the   June 24–25, 2008 110 of 253    end of this year, similar to the assumption in the Greenbook  As I mentioned, I’m not very   confident that the outlook for growth and employment has improved as much as the Greenbook   assumes  I’m concerned that households and firms are in a python squeeze of an intensifying credit   crunch and a continuing decline in housing wealth as well as pressures from surging food and   energy prices  I think the economy has shown resilience so far, and that’s reassuring, but I don’t   think it’s assured for the future  The aggressive policy actions that we have put in place since   January are actually working to cushion the blow, and that’s part of the reason that we haven’t seen   a greater unraveling so far   I mentioned yesterday that, with respect to inflation, the behavior of both core inflation and   wages thus far makes me optimistic that headline inflation will come down if commodity prices   finally level off  But I think there’s no doubt that the risks with respect to inflation are not   symmetrical at this point, and they have definitely increased  I still see inflation expectations as   reasonably well anchored, but there’s no doubt that a wage–price spiral could develop, and dealing   with it would be a very difficult and very painful problem for the Committee  So while I feel that   we are essentially credible now, I wouldn’t want to take absolutely for granted that this is something   that we can count on going forward   At this point, the federal funds rate remains well below the recommendations of most   versions of the Taylor rule  I have viewed this as appropriate, not largely as insurance against   downside risk but simply in refection of the unusually severe pressures from collapsing wealth and   tight credit and financial constraints  But it does seem to me to be appropriate going forward to at   least take out some insurance against the development of a wage–price spiral mentality, and that   could take the form of gradually removing that discrepancy from what, for example, a Taylor rule   June 24–25, 2008 111 of 253    recommends  But before we begin to do that, it does seem to me that we should wait to get a   somewhat clearer picture of where the real side is going    I will be very brief, Mr Chairman  I do want to say, with respect to the   short-term issues, that I fully support the plan that you laid out  I certainly favor keeping these   facilities in place beyond September  Even if their use diminishes, I agree with the point that it   doesn’t necessarily indicate that they are not playing a tremendously important role  The   ramping up of our oversight of these institutions in the agreement with the SEC is a very   important part of continuing these facilities   On the long-run issues, it is a wonderful list of questions  I don’t know the answers to the   questions  I think we really need to dig in very rapidly and do serious work on them  They are   fundamental  President Rosengren raised a list of issues about this, the same ones that have been   very much in my mind  What institutions?  It is not obvious to me that the right list of   systemically important institutions is the primary dealers  I think someone—maybe President   Rosengren—raised the issue of Countrywide, a huge mortgage company  I certainly worried last   summer that it had created systemic risk, and it is not just the primary dealer there  I also think   there is an issue with respect to hedge funds, similar to those that arose with Long-Term Capital   June 24–25, 2008 176 of 253    Management  This raises very troubling issues to me about our trying to identify and take on   supervision of all systemically important institutions  This is a very tough issue that I don’t   know the answer to     But also, what is going on raises fundamental issues about how we conduct consolidated   supervision  Even if all the systemically important institutions were primary dealers or mortgage   companies within bank holding companies that currently we do have umbrella supervision over,   I am not at all convinced that the way we are carrying out supervision now would have prevented   a Bear Stearns-type of episode within an institution that is currently solidly under our   supervision  Last summer I was pleased in some ways that we had lost direct supervision of   Countrywide to the OTS  But it might well have been in our domain—six months earlier it   would have been—and it could have created a systemically important problem if it had failed    So just the nature of how we carry out this Fed-lite approach, is that really the right way?  I see   us as very focused on process in our supervision of holding companies  We don’t do a lot of   transaction testing  Obviously, this raises very fundamental issues, even within our existing   domain, about how we carry out comprehensive umbrella supervision  I don’t have any answers,   but we clearly need to get on it quickly  "
8255,2008-07-24,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support extending the TSLF along with the   PDCF, and I am also supportive of the proposal to auction options on TSLF draws  I think we   do continue to have money market stress, particularly at quarter-end, and it strikes me as a well-  targeted program that might have some success in addressing the strains   On the proposal to extend the term of the TAF loans to 84 days, I do have some qualms,   and they have been heightened by our own recent experience with a failing bank and my sense   that the most recent bank failure is not going to be our last  I definitely understand the   motivation for extending the term of the loans, and I am not saying that I am, on balance,   July 24, 2008 22 of 50    opposed to it  But I do think that the program entails credit risk for Reserve Banks and may   actually create complications in facilitating least-cost resolution of troubled banks   My anxiety about this has been heightened by our own recent experience with IndyMac    If you will indulge me for a second, I will tell you the story of what happened there and why I   am concerned  IndyMac was closed on July 11  On June 26, just two weeks earlier, the   information provided to us by the OTS indicated that IndyMac was a CAMELS 2–rated   institution  We monitored Call Report data that showed it to be well capitalized  On the   morning of June 26, we approved a loan for $1 billion under primary credit  IndyMac didn’t   participate in TAF auctions, but it was eligible to do so  If the new 84-day facility had been in   operation, it would hypothetically have been eligible to be covered under that  It could have had   an 84-day TAF loan   My staff consulted with me on the IndyMac request on that morning of June 26 because it   represented a significant escalation in borrowing, and our own monitoring suggested that the   institution had been deteriorating  We had informal hints of some concerns at the OTS  It was   unknown to us, but in point of fact the OTS had already informed the institution that it had   actually been downgraded to a 3  Even so, even if we had known that, it still would have been   eligible for primary credit and participation in a TAF auction   Now, the memo we got points out that we can disqualify an institution from participation   in a TAF auction on the grounds that we judge it to be in unsound financial condition or that we   can on such a judgment move an institution to secondary credit  But we thought that would be a   drastic action, and it probably would have been seen as arbitrary  It would have entailed a   supervisory judgment that was in conflict with that of the institution’s supervisor  We didn’t   think we had an adequate database to make such a judgment, and we couldn’t have done it   July 24, 2008 23 of 50    without making a formal communication to the institution that we had made such a judgment,   which we would have been concerned about  Now, with respect to collateral, we thought we   were very much overcollateralized  The institution had pledged collateral with us amounting to   around $4 billion  We applied standard haircuts and assigned a lendable value of $32 billion, so   our credit risk appeared to be very well covered by the collateral, and we approved the loan   On that very afternoon of June 26, it became public that Senator Schumer had written a   letter to the FDIC and the OTS expressing concern about the institution, and that very evening   we learned that the OTS had downgraded the institution to a 5, and that, as of June 30, the OTS   expected to declare it to be significantly undercapitalized  We also learned that the FDIC was   planning to close the institution within a few weeks  We moved it to secondary credit  We took   an additional 10 percent haircut on the collateral  That brought IndyMac’s borrowing capacity   down to $28 billion  But we took the precaution of sending our most senior mortgage specialist   from Banking Supervision and Regulation (BS&R) down to the bank to gather information to   refine our assessment of the true market value of the collateral, based on that institution’s profile   and more detail about the collateral than we had had from applying the standard haircuts  He   concluded that the haircuts we were taking were drastically too low and advised us to reduce the   lendable value of the collateral down to $11 billion  We reserved $100 million for non-Fedwire   payment system exposure, leaving us with a $1 billion loan and $1 billion of now-assigned,   lendable value of the collateral  So, in retrospect, it turns out that we actually did make a $1   billion loan under primary credit to a troubled institution that was undercapitalized under   FDICIA guidelines and on the verge of closure  And we did it based on collateral we should   have valued at $11 billion rather than $32 billion   July 24, 2008 24 of 50    So we did have significant credit exposure, and I think we are lucky we lent only   overnight and were paid the next day rather than having an 84-day loan  With the TAF, if we   had an 84-day loan outstanding on June 26, we would have had no further capacity to assist in   the bank’s final days in moving toward what we deemed an FDIC-led least-cost resolution  The   bank had lost all access to brokered deposits and also to Federal Home Loan Bank loans after it   was downgraded, and our inability to lend any further would almost surely have precipitated a   liquidity crisis and a failure well before the FDIC finally closed that institution on July 11   So let me draw a few morals from this shaggy dog tale  First, troubled banks can be   downgraded and fail very rapidly  They may be deemed eligible to borrow under primary credit   and participate in TAF auctions when in reality they are near failure  Second, it is true we have   discretion to judge whether or not to allow an institution to participate in auctions and can   exclude an institution that we don’t consider in sound financial condition  But, in reality, we   deal with hundreds and potentially thousands of banks at the discount window and can’t monitor   and make independent judgments on the health of all those institutions on an ongoing basis  We   do have to rely on primary supervisors for assessments  If we act on our own hunches, we are   substituting our judgment for that of primary supervisors  If we decided we wanted to do so, we   would be truly taxing the resources of our colleagues in BS&R beyond their capacity to deal with   these institutions  Third, we may think that we are overcollateralized, but that judgment can be   highly flawed in the case of a troubled institution  Finally, while we may, in principle, demand   immediate repayment of any discount window loan, including a TAF term credit, in a failing-  bank situation such an action can cause the institution’s immediate failure, making an orderly   least-cost resolution impossible  Now, I know that this applies, we hope, to a handful of   institutions and not to most of them; but I don’t think that IndyMac is going to be the last failing   July 24, 2008 25 of 50    bank  I do think that this would have worked very badly in that case, and so it does give me   qualms about the proposal    They initially told us that they would take up to the face value of the   collateral, and we quickly determined that that is not consistent with Federal Reserve policy  In   point of fact, it is not consistent with the written agreement that the Reserve Banks have with the   FDIC, which actually states that the FDIC will compensate us for the market value of the   collateral  So I think that the FDIC here faces a sequence of failures and wants our cooperation    They did compensate us—we had $500 million outstanding to IndyMac at the moment it failed,   and we were immediately compensated  But our agreement with the FDIC is that they   compensate us only up to the market value of the collateral, which we deemed to be close to   $1 billion, rather than our haircutted value based on a standard haircut, which was over   $3 billion    Well, I guess we would have had that  Had they taken the loan out   earlier, when they were still rated 2 or 3, I think it would have substituted for borrowings that   July 24, 2008 26 of 50    they could have had at that time from the Federal Home Loan Bank  They might have had a   motive to take out a long-term loan from us rather than to tap their Federal Home Loan Bank   access  They would have pledged a huge amount of collateral to the Federal Home Loan Bank,   which was not accessible to us, had we wanted to lend more because the Federal Home Loan   Bank has blanket authority over a large class of collateral  So if we had, in fact, extended that   loan, we could have called it in; but that would have precipitated a failure  And we wouldn’t   have had the ability to augment the collateral  So our hands would have been tied when the   FDIC came to us and said, “Please assist us in lending  This institution is experiencing deposit   outruns  We want to get it through to a close that we think will be least-cost, and it is going to   take us another week and a half”  There would have been no more collateral to be had  We   would have been, then, up against the limit of what we could lend    There was about $1 billion of uninsured deposits out of roughly $30 billion   of total liabilities, and some fled  I don’t know exactly what proportion fled  Maybe at the end   there was something like $700 million of uninsured deposits, and we certainly worried about that in   thinking about whether the FDIC’s approach was consistent with least-cost resolution  I guess we   came to be convinced that, in the absence of our lending, there would have had to be a fire sale of   assets and that great losses would have been taken in selling assets on that time frame to cover   withdrawals  On balance we accepted the idea that the FDIC was going to close it within a two-  week time frame, and we’re reasonably satisfied that it was consistent with least-cost resolution    If we had not lent, they would have been unable to meet withdrawals, and I   think that there would have had to be an earlier closure  It would have been a midweek closure    The firm probably would have had fire sales of the assets  The closure would probably have been   very disorderly    No, that’s fine   July 24, 2008 29 of 50     Yes  Well, while I expressed some qualms, I’m comfortable with the   proposal and can support it  I think I prefer having the two options of 28 and 84, but I’m   comfortable with the proposal  "
8280,2008-08-05,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Developments during the intermeeting   period have heightened my concern about downside risks to economic growth and slightly   August 5, 2008 52 of 145    allayed my concern about upside risks to inflation  Let me begin with growth  The moderate   growth rate registered in the second quarter was disappointing, especially because it benefited   from the temporary effects of the fiscal stimulus package  Moreover, the pattern of consumer   spending during the quarter, with weakness in June, is worrisome  With all the publicity   surrounding the rebate checks, households may have put them to work earlier than usual,   especially since they were facing significantly higher prices for food and gasoline  This   interpretation does not bode well for activity in the current quarter  Assuming no change in the   funds rate this year, we have lowered our forecast for real GDP growth for the second half of the   year about ⅓ percentage point, to just ¾ percent, and project a correspondingly higher   unemployment rate     Our forecast for weak second-half growth reflects not only the unwinding of fiscal   stimulus but also adverse financial sector developments  The credit crunch appears to have   intensified since we last met  Evidence of tighter financial conditions abound  Risk spreads and   the interest rates charged on a variety of private loans, including mortgages, are up noticeably,   and lending standards have tightened further  Credit losses have risen not only on mortgages but   also on auto loans, credit cards, and home equity lines of credit  As a consequence, the list of   troubled depository institutions is growing longer  IndyMac and First National will not be the   last banks in our region to fail  Indeed, the decline in broad stock market indexes is partly a   reflection of the market’s concerns about the health of the financial sector  Many financial   institutions are deleveraging their balance sheets and reducing loan originations  For example, a   large bank in my District has begun now in earnest to cancel or cap outstanding home equity   loans and lines of credit, despite an ongoing concern about alienating consumers  Tighter credit   is affecting demand  Anecdotal reports suggest that the plunge in July car sales partly reflects a   August 5, 2008 53 of 145    tightening of credit standards for auto loans and leases  A large bank reports a substantial drop   in demand for mortgage credit in response to the recent rise in mortgage interest rates, and the   anecdotal reports that we hear support the Greenbook’s negative view of the effect of credit   conditions on investment in nonresidential structures   The housing sector is of considerable concern  House prices have continued to fall at a   rapid rate, and futures prices suggest a further decline of around 10 percent over the next 12   months  This forecast seems reasonable given the overhang of homes for sale, the recent rise in   mortgage rates, and the tightening of credit  Unfortunately, the risk of an adverse feedback loop   from tighter credit to higher unemployment, to rising foreclosures, to escalating financial sector   losses, to yet tighter credit remains alive and well, in my opinion  Indeed, stress tests conducted   by some of the large financial institutions in our District reveal an exceptionally high sensitivity   of credit losses to both home-price movements and unemployment  The “severe financial stress”   simulation in the Greenbook illustrates my concern  It is not my modal forecast, but it certainly   seems well within a reasonable range of outcomes  The probability of such a scenario has risen,   in my view, since we met in June   One partially mitigating factor that should help to support consumer spending is the drop   in the price of oil since our last meeting  But to the extent that the decline in oil prices partly   reflects reduced expectations for global growth, the net impetus from stronger domestic spending   will be offset by weaker export growth  Continued declines or even stabilization in oil prices   will, however, be good for inflation  We have revised down slightly our forecast for core   inflation as a consequence  Moreover, the fact that we were not once again surprised on the   upside by oil prices has had a small favorable effect on my perception of inflation risks going   forward  That said, inflation risks obviously remain  Even with the recent decline, energy prices   August 5, 2008 54 of 145    are well above year-ago levels and are not only pushing up headline inflation but also spilling, to   some extent, into core  Higher headline inflation could undermine our credibility and raise   inflation expectations  If the public concludes that our implicit inflation objective has drifted up,   workers may demand higher compensation, setting off a wage–price dynamic that would be   costly to unwind   Fortunately, the reports I hear are consistent with the view that no such dynamic has   taken hold  My contacts uniformly report that they see no signs of wage pressures  They note   that high unemployment is suppressing wage gains  Growth in our two broad measures of labor   compensation are low and stable; and taking productivity growth into account, unit labor costs   have risen only modestly  I tend to think of the chain of causation in a wage–price spiral running   from wages to prices, but it is certainly possible that the causation also, or instead, runs in the   opposite direction  Either way, though, faster wage growth is an inherent part of the process by   which underlying inflation drifts up, and at present we see not the slightest inkling of emerging   wage pressures     Growth in unit labor costs also remains at exceptionally low levels  I would also note   that I have looked for evidence of some increase in the NAIRU due to sectoral reallocation by   examining the Beveridge curve, thinking that if there were sectoral reallocation we might see an   outward shift in the Beveridge curve  I have detected no evidence of such an outward shift    These facts provide me with some comfort  Moreover, various measures of longer-term inflation   expectations suggest that they remain relatively well contained  When we met in June, the   Michigan survey of inflation expectations five to ten years ahead had recently jumped a couple   tenths of a percentage point  I argued then that the respondents to that survey typically   overrespond to contemporaneous headline inflation  Since that meeting, oil prices have come   August 5, 2008 55 of 145    down a bit, and so have the Michigan survey measures  Assuming that the funds rate is raised   from 2 percent to 3 percent in 2009, my forecast shows both headline and core PCE inflation   falling to about 2 percent in that year  So, in summary, during the intermeeting period, my   forecast for economic growth has weakened, and that for inflation has edged down slightly  I   consider the risks to our two policy objectives pretty evenly balanced at the present time    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I favor alternative A—no change in the funds   rate and a balanced assessment of risks designed to leave market expectations concerning the   path of the funds rate roughly unchanged  Oops, I made a mistake, there is no A  [Laughter]  So   August 5, 2008 104 of 145    I propose to create it by changing the wording of the first sentence of alternative B, paragraph 4,   to read, “Both downside risks to growth and upside risks to inflation are of significant concern to   the Committee”  As it is currently worded, B(4) downplays the downside risks to growth, which   have intensified since our last meeting as the credit crunch has worsened and emphasizes   inflation risks, which have moderated slightly as oil prices have fallen  The assessment of risks   in alternative B, as it stands, is unbalanced and—as Brian just pointed out and the Bluebook does   also—is more hawkish than the primary dealers and most market participants generally expect    So it is likely to shift the fed funds futures path and other interest rates upward   I see no case, at this juncture, for signaling that we are likely to adjust policy upward   before the end of the year  Indeed, there is a non-negligible probability, to my mind, that the   next move will be down and not up  There is already significant slack in the labor market, and   with the economy expected to grow at a near-recessionary pace in the latter half of this year, the   unemployment rate is poised to rise further  This growing slack is working to contain   inflationary pressures as evidenced by the stability and low level of wage growth  I expect that   growing slack will continue holding down wage inflation going forward  Long-term inflation   expectations seem relatively well contained, and core inflation has been stable for the past   several years  Finally, a major component of the surge in headline inflation—oil price   increases—has finally started to show some sign of reversing direction  Although the real funds   rate remains quite accommodative by the usual metrics, we are clearly not in a business-as-usual   situation  We are in the midst of a serious credit crunch that has, again, worsened during the   intermeeting period, as exemplified by the developments at Freddie and Fannie and the other   things that many of you have pointed to in our last round  We are likely seeing only the start of   what will be a series of bank failures that could make matters much worse  Given these financial   August 5, 2008 105 of 145    headwinds, it is not clear to me that we are accommodative at all; I agree, Mr Chairman, with   the comments you just made on this matter   Given my preference for an inflation target of around 1¾ percent and equal welfare   weights on the inflation and unemployment gaps, I view the Greenbook policy path and forecast   as a roughly optimal trajectory to the attainment of our goals  Although core inflation exceeds   the level I consider consistent with price stability, unemployment also exceeds the level   consistent with full employment  Given our dual mandate and a forecast that envisions a   growing unemployment gap, coupled with declining inflation under the Greenbook funds rate   path, I see no case for jolting expectations in such a way as to, in effect, tighten policy now  I   feel especially strongly about this in view of the major downside risks to the economy from an   intensifying credit crunch  "
8303,2008-09-16,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  During the past several weeks, my head   office and Branch directors have become decidedly more pessimistic about the economic   outlook  My own assessment of incoming data coincides with theirs  My contacts also report   that their businesses are still raising prices in response to past increases in commodity and import   prices that boosted their costs  I expect as a consequence that core inflation will remain   uncomfortably high for a while longer, but the marked decline in commodity prices since June   reinforces my conviction that there is light at the end of this inflation tunnel   With respect to growth, our forecast is similar to the Greenbook’s, with a little more   weakness in the second half of this year and a little more strength in 2009  I think the risks to   this forecast are decidedly skewed to the downside  I agree with the Greenbook’s assessment   that the strength we saw in the upwardly revised real GDP growth in the second quarter will not   hold up  Despite the tax rebates, real personal consumption expenditures declined in both June   and July, and retail sales were down in August  My contacts report that cutbacks in spending are   September 16, 2008 32 of 108    widespread, especially for discretionary items  For example, East Bay plastic surgeons and   dentists note that patients are deferring elective procedures  [Laughter]  Reservations are no   longer necessary at many high-end restaurants  And the Silicon Valley Country Club, with a   $250,000 entrance fee and seven-to-eight-year waiting list, has seen the number of would-be new   members shrink to a mere thirteen  [Laughter]   Exports were a huge source of strength in the second quarter, but I am concerned that we   cannot count on very large contributions to growth from exports going forward, now that the   dollar has begun to rise and economic growth abroad has slowed, even turning negative in some   important trade partners  Indeed, the growing weakness of the global outlook appears to be an   important explanation for the reversion in commodity prices, and this adds a dimension of gloom   to what would otherwise be a decided plus for both inflation and demand   Recent data also suggest that labor markets are weakening across the board—a   development that will cast a pall on household income and spending  The interaction of higher   unemployment with the housing and financial markets raises the potential for even worse   news—namely, an intensification of the adverse feedback loop we have long worried about and   are now experiencing  Indeed, delinquencies have risen substantially across the spectrum of   consumer loans, and credit availability continues to decline  One ray of hope is that the changes   at Fannie and Freddie have caused a notable drop in mortgage rates  Another is that the decline   in home prices has become somewhat less steep, and we have seen an outright improvement in   home inventories relative to sales  But my contacts are very pessimistic about the prospects for   nonresidential construction  They note that construction is continuing on projects in the pipeline   with committed funding, but new projects are all but impossible to finance   September 16, 2008 33 of 108    Turning to inflation, I have long anticipated and still expect that inflation will fall to   more-reasonable levels in 2009  However, developments since our August meeting diminish the   upside risks to this projection  The drop in oil and other commodity prices, along with the   appreciation of the dollar, should work to moderate the current inflation bulge and diminish the   potential for a wage–price spiral to develop  Import inflation has already begun to ease    Furthermore, we have seen a remarkable decline in inflation compensation for the next five years   in the TIPS market  I would not rely heavily on this decline to support my view, but I do have to   say that the decline is a lot more reassuring than the alternative  I was also encouraged by the   30 basis point drop in long-term inflation expectations in the most recent Michigan survey  I   anticipate that the recent jump in the unemployment rate will place some additional downward   pressure on growth in labor compensation, which has been quite low, and in core inflation    Although the jump in the unemployment rate probably partly reflects the extension of   unemployment insurance coverage, a back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that the upper   bound on this effect is just a few tenths of a percent  I would agree with the Greenbook   estimates  We have also examined the possibility that the increase in unemployment reflects a   rise in the NAIRU due to sectoral employment shifts out of construction and finance and into   other industries  Ned Phelps has argued that the sectoral shift story implies a sizable dispersion   of employment growth across industries and states  But we looked at these data and found no   significant increase, so I don’t find this Phelps argument particularly convincing  Considering   all of these factors, I expect both headline and core PCE price inflation to fall to about 2 percent   for 2009 as a whole, and I see the risks to this projection as roughly balanced     With respect to policy, I would be inclined to keep the funds rate target at 2 percent   today  For now, it seems to me that the additional liquidity measures that have been put in place   September 16, 2008 34 of 108    are an appropriate response to the turmoil  I am fine with the wording of alternative B and   would support President Lockhart’s suggestion for change  That would seem fine to me, too  In   view of the intensified financial stress and the potential for more turmoil, obviously I think we   will need to be flexible in setting policy going forward, and I am very concerned about downside   risks to the real economy and think that inflation risk is diminished  "
8315,2008-09-29,"  Fine, thank you  "
8337,2008-10-07,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I strongly support your proposal to cut the   federal funds rate by 50 basis points today and the wording of the statement  I’m pleased that the   FOMC will take this step as part of a coordinated program with other central banks  In my opinion,   a larger action could easily be justified and is ultimately likely to prove necessary  We’re   witnessing a complete breakdown in the functioning of credit markets, and it is affecting every class   of borrowers  The financial developments are dangerous and are having a pronounced impact on   the economic outlook  The outlook has deteriorated very sharply, and even so, I still see the risks to   the downside  Moreover, recent data on consumer and capital spending and on housing confirm   that a sharp contraction in domestic demand is under way  As far as I’m concerned, for the reasons   you gave, inflation risks have diminished markedly  Indeed, in a contraction as severe as that which   is now on the horizon, I anticipate that inflation will decline noticeably below my own estimate of   price stability  I think the Board has taken a wide array of creative and massive actions to provide   liquidity to the credit markets  I think these are very appropriate and necessary  I hope we will do   October 7, 2008 16 of 30    more, but they are not completely a substitute for cutting the federal funds rate  I think that’s an   important complement to the liquidity actions  "
8363,2008-10-28,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  In the run-up to Halloween, we have had a   witch’s brew of news  Sorry  [Laughter]  The downward trajectory of economic data has been   hair-raising—with employment, consumer sentiment, spending and orders for capital goods, and   homebuilding all contracting—and conditions in financial and credit markets have taken a   ghastly turn for the worse  It is becoming abundantly clear that we are in the midst of a serious   global meltdown  Like the Board staff, I have slashed my forecast for economic activity and   now foresee a recession with four straight quarters of negative growth starting last quarter  I   October 28–29, 2008 68 of 206    wish that I could claim that I place a lot of confidence in the sobering forecast, but I am sorry to   say I can’t  In fact, I think we will be lucky if the adverse feedback loop that is under way   doesn’t wrench us into a much more pronounced and more protracted downturn  The outlook for   inflation has shifted markedly, too, with the days of heightened upside inflation risks behind us    In fact, I am concerned that beyond next year we run the risk of inflation falling below the level   consistent with price stability   Even before the extraordinary deterioration in financial market conditions over the past   few weeks, there were numerous signs that the economy had weakened dramatically  I won’t   recite the litany of disappointing data but instead try to touch upon some high, or I guess I should   say low, notes based on what my contacts tell me  They are consistent with President Fisher’s   observations  Consumer purchases of durable goods, especially motor vehicles, have been   particularly hard hit by the one–two punch of tight credit and reeling consumer confidence  The   mood on showroom floors is downright grim  One auto dealer in my District reports that he is   now experiencing the worst period in his thirty-plus years in the business  A home appliance   retailer adds that he has never seen more uncertainty and gloom from both the retailers and the   vendors  This sentiment is echoed by a large retailer who says simply, “The holiday shopping   season is going to stink”   Businesses are under siege from weak demand, high costs of borrowing, curtailed credit   availability, and pervasive uncertainty about how long such conditions will last  Our contacts   report that bank lines of credit are more difficult to negotiate  Many have become more cautious   in managing liquidity and in committing to capital spending projects that can be deferred  They   are even cutting back trade credit to customers  Even firms that are currently in good shape   report that they are hunkering down, cutting back on all but essential spending, and preparing for   October 28–29, 2008 69 of 206    the worst  Our venture capital and private equity contacts tell us that they are instructing their   portfolio companies to cut costs, put expansion plans on hold, and draw down existing credit   lines  The market for commercial mortgage-backed securities has all but dried up, and lenders   have also become less willing to extend funding  With financing unavailable, I am hearing talk   about substantial cutbacks on new projects and planned improvements on existing buildings, as   well as the potential for distress sales of properties whose owners will be unable to roll over debt   as it matures  The deterioration in overall financial conditions since the September FOMC   meeting is truly shocking  Even with today’s 900-point increase in the Dow, broad indexes are   still down about 20 percent, and the latest data suggest house prices in a freefall  Baa corporate   bonds are up about 200 basis points since our last meeting, low-grade corporate bonds are up a   staggering 700 basis points, and to top it all, the dollar has appreciated nearly 10 percent against   the currencies of our trading partners  The sharp deterioration in financial and credit conditions   will weigh heavily on economic activity for some time  In addition, prospects for the one   remaining cylinder in the engine of growth—namely, net exports—are bleak owing to the   slowdown in global demand and the appreciation of the dollar   We now expect real GDP to decline at an annual rate of 1¼ percent in the second half of   this year and to register two more negative quarters in the first half of next year  That forecast is   predicated on cutting the funds rate to ½ percent by January, as assumed in the Greenbook, and   also is premised on another fiscal package  An absolutely critical pre-condition for the economy   to recover next year is for the financial system to get back on its feet  In that regard, I have been   greatly heartened by the important actions that the Treasury, the FDIC, the Fed, foreign   governments, and other central banks have taken in recent weeks to improve liquidity and inject   capital into the financial systems  But we are fighting an uphill battle against falling home   October 28–29, 2008 70 of 206    prices, an economy in recession, and collapsing confidence  It is not clear whether these steps   will reopen credit flows to households and businesses, especially those with less than sterling   credit  Under the Greenbook forecast we will see further large declines in housing prices over   the next two years  Banks and other financial institutions will likely suffer larger losses than   many had anticipated, and that will mute the impact of recent capital injections  The interaction   of higher unemployment and rising delinquencies raises the potential for even greater losses by   banks and other financial institutions and for an intensification of the adverse feedback loop we   have worried about and are now experiencing  Such a sequence of events plausibly could lead to   outcomes described in the “more financial fallout” alternative scenario in the Greenbook     There are considerable downside risks to the near-term outlook as well  As I mentioned,   the most recent economic data have consistently surprised on the downside, and I see a real risk   that the data may continue to come in weaker in the near term than the Greenbook has assumed    For example, a dynamic factor model that my staff regularly uses is much more pessimistic in   the near term than is the Greenbook  This model aggregates the information contained in more   than 140 data series  Based on the most recent economic and financial data available, this model   predicts that real GDP will fall 2½ percent in the fourth quarter  The model’s pessimism reflects   the combination of the recent weak data releases for the month of September, followed by the   abysmal data that we have available so far for October, including financial market prices,   regional business surveys, and consumer sentiment   Turning to inflation, the most recent data have been encouraging  Looking forward, the   sharp decline in commodity prices, especially oil prices, will bring headline inflation down   relatively quickly  More fundamentally, the considerable slack in labor and product markets will   put downward pressure on the underlying rate of inflation over the next few years  A number of   October 28–29, 2008 71 of 206    my contacts already report that their businesses are working on lower margins in the more   challenging economic environment  I expect headline PCE price inflation to decline to about   1½ percent in 2009 and core PCE price inflation to be 1¾ percent next year  I expect both   inflation rates to edge down to 1¼ percent in 2010  Given the sizable downside risk to the   forecast for growth, the risks to the inflation forecast are likewise weighted to the downside   In conclusion, I think the present situation obviously calls for an easing of policy, as I   assumed in my forecast  Given the seriousness of the situation, I believe that we should put as   much stimulus into the system as we can as soon as we can    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I favor alternative A, a 50 basis point cut in   the funds rate  This action, and even more, is justified by the dramatic developments since our   last meeting—a deepening of the recessionary outlook worldwide, the near meltdown of the   global financial system, and the abatement of inflationary pressures  Frankly, it is time for all   hands on deck when it comes to our policy tools, and the fed funds rate should be no exception    Although we cut the funds rate 50 basis points a few weeks ago, the Greenbook inflation   projection was revised down more than that, so the ex ante real funds rate actually edged up over   the intermeeting period   October 28–29, 2008 121 of 206    We need to do much more and the sooner, the better  One might argue against such a   policy move in favor of a wait-and-see approach to better gauge if the recent flurry of policy   initiatives will turn things around  In normal times, I would have some sympathy for this   argument, but these are about as far from normal times as we can get  We are in the midst of a   global economic and financial freefall, and the confidence of households, businesses, and   investors is in shambles  The adverse feedback loop is playing out with a vengeance  Lenders   continue to ratchet up terms and standards, sapping the ability of households and businesses to   spend  As the economy weakens, further loan defaults will mushroom   I think strong, clear action is needed  Historical precedents, such as the case of Japan,   teach us that it is a mistake to act cautiously as the economy unravels  I think the clear lesson   from both economic theory and real-world experience is to lower rates as quickly as possible to   avoid a deeper and more protracted recession, not to keep our powder dry or to wait to use tools   until later if they are available to us now  The more medicine we give and the sooner we give it,   the better  The Bluebook optimal policy simulations tell us that, absent the zero bound, the funds   rate should be lowered well below zero next year  Since that is not an option, we should do the   most with what we’ve got and cut the funds rate aggressively now  "
8391,2008-12-15,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  This is an extremely important discussion,   and I am glad that you have arranged a special session  I very much appreciate the   comprehensive and outstanding memos from the staff  At our October meeting, we agreed to   take whatever steps were necessary to support the recovery of the economy, and that principle   guides my thinking on monetary policy at the zero bound  In most circumstances, I see few   December 15–16, 2008 42 of 284    advantages to gradualism, and certainly whenever we approach the zero bound, I think the funds   rate target should be quickly reduced toward zero   As to the level of the lower bound, my default position is that we should move the target   funds rate all the way to zero because that would provide the most macroeconomic stimulus  For   example, every 25 basis point cut in the target typically takes about 25 basis points off the prime   rate and associated borrowing rates  The institutional concerns about Treasury fails and   Treasury-only money market funds merit consideration, but I don’t consider them serious   enough to ban lowering the target to a very low level  Still, the surprising results we obtained   from paying interest on reserves should make us chary about predicting the reactions of financial   markets to new circumstances, so there may be some benefits from allowing the funds rate to   trade between zero and, say, 25 basis points   Let me now turn to the third set of questions on communication strategies  Looking   ahead, I believe that there could be significant benefits to communicating effectively the   FOMC’s intentions to hold the target funds rate at a very low level  The Japanese experience at   the zero bound suggests that this is one channel that can work, and the evidence suggests that our   own guidance that began in 2003 similarly influenced longer-term rates  We learned then,   though, that it is hard to convey the conditionality of such intentions and the multiple influences   on the optimal setting of the funds rate  Still, I favor trying to include forward-looking   communication on policy expectations in future FOMC statements   We could also consider using the FOMC minutes to provide quantitative information on   our expectations  For example, we could reveal the funds rate projections that implicitly   accompany our quarterly economic projections, publishing ranges and central tendencies of the   federal funds rate along with those for GDP growth, unemployment, and inflation  The   December 15–16, 2008 43 of 284    advantage of this approach is that it would provide a clear future path to the funds rate that is   conditional on the economic environment pertaining to output and inflation relative to our goals    We did discuss this approach before, and I remember that a number of you were uncomfortable   with it  But circumstances have changed, and there could be particular value now in adding the   federal funds rate to our projections, and in fact, we could consider a trial run   I believe that, in addition to providing guidance on the likely path of future interest rates,   we should become more communicative about our longer-term inflation objective to avoid a   decline in inflation expectations as inflation drops over the next few years below desirable levels    One way to accomplish this is to include quantitative information on our longer-term projections   in the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), as the Subcommittee on Communications has   recommended  We could go even further to endorse a Committee-wide long-term inflation   objective, although that is something that we would have to further consider carefully  We could   supplement including longer-term projections in the SEP with language in the FOMC statement   that is akin to that used in 2003, when the Committee referred to an unwelcome decline in   inflation  Alternative B does take a step in that direction   The bracketed language in alternative A goes further by specifying a medium-term   Committee inflation target  This is a big step, and one that deserves thorough debate  There are   theoretical papers demonstrating the potential benefits in a liquidity trap of committing to an   inflation rate after the economy recovers that is higher than we would actually want ex post   because raising inflation expectations lowers real rates, thereby stimulating the economy  In   theory, by committing to more inflation than we actually want later on, we could generate extra   stimulus now  But this strategy requires a strong commitment device because the Committee   will have an incentive to renege later on when the economy has recovered  I do understand the   December 15–16, 2008 44 of 284    attractions of such a strategy in theory, but I am not at all convinced that the benefits would   exceed the costs in practice  It would be enormously difficult to explain and could harm the   Fed’s overall credibility as an institution  Moreover, it is not only real rates but also nominal   rates that influence housing demand, and any increase in longer-term nominal rates triggered by   higher inflation expectations could adversely affect this key sector   Let me now turn to the nonstandard policy tools that the FOMC and the Board have   authorized  I wholeheartedly support the many actions that have been taken to increase liquidity   in the financial system, as well as those designed to increase credit availability and lower   borrowing costs  Going forward, I support both the purchase of agency debt and MBS by the   System Open Market Account and purchases of long-term Treasury debt  Both existing evidence   and the market response we just saw to the recent announcements and comments concerning   such programs suggest to me that such purchases can push longer-term borrowing rates down    Other new programs—for example, to improve credit market functioning in A2/P2 commercial   paper and in commercial and private-label residential-mortgage-backed securities—are well   worthy of consideration  Naturally, the potential benefits and costs of each new facility or   program need to be assessed before adoption  Formulating the guidance from the FOMC to the   Desk regarding how these new programs should be described remains a challenge  I think a   possible formulation could have the FOMC setting some objectives for levels or movements in   Treasury yields or MBS spreads, but those open up thorny issues, and I think that this is   something we really have to study further   With respect to the FOMC’s operating regime going forward, I oppose switching from a   regime based on targeting of the fed funds rate to one based on a quantitative target for the   monetary base, excess reserves, or the overall size of our balance sheet  The Board or the FOMC   December 15–16, 2008 45 of 284    or both, in my view, should consider the merits of each program on its own, without any   presumption of PAYGO  Most of you probably recall that PAYGO was a budget device   employed by the Congress to constrain the federal deficit to a target level  In our case, an   overarching decision by the FOMC about the size of our balance sheet or the monetary base   would force tradeoffs among our various programs to hit that total, similar to PAYGO   Imagine, however, that the commercial paper market were to revive, allowing us to   terminate the CPFF  Excess reserves would decline, but that decline would have no negative   effect on economic activity, so there should be no presumption that some other program should   be expanded to restore the monetary base to its previous level  Theory suggests that when the   monetary base is increased by purchasing conventional SOMA assets, its expansion should have   little or no effect on the behavior of banks or asset prices more generally after the zero bound has   been reached  Abstracting from expectational effects, the evidence generally supports this view    While the quantity of money is surely linked to the price level in the very long run, most   evidence suggests that variations in the base have only insignificant economic effects in the short   or medium term under liquidity trap conditions  This makes the base an inappropriate operating   instrument for monetary policy in a zero bound regime  As Japan found during its quantitative   easing program, increasing the size of the monetary base above levels needed to provide ample   liquidity to the banking system had no discernible economic effects aside from those associated   with communicating the Bank of Japan’s commitment to the zero interest rate policy  I think my   views on this mirror those that you expressed in your opening comments, Mr Chairman   With respect to the directive, the version proposed in the current Bluebook specifies the   types and amounts of mortgage-related assets that the Desk should buy and the objective of these   purchases—namely, to boost activity in the mortgage and housing markets  Language of this   December 15–16, 2008 46 of 284    type is consistent with the policy approach I support, in which each credit facility program and   asset purchase decision is judged on its own merits, according to whether it improves the   availability of credit or lowers its cost, thus stimulating the economy  I support this approach to   drafting the directive going forward  It is one way in which the Committee communicates the   logic of monetary policy  But I think we do need to go further—as you emphasized, Mr   Chairman—in providing clear explanations to the public about the objectives of the various   facilities, how they work, and why they are part of a coherent monetary policy strategy   With respect to governance, I endorse the suggestion that you made, Mr Chairman, about   how we should proceed—that is, to work together collectively to forge and communicate a   consensus view of the entire Committee to the public, while adhering to the particular   responsibilities that the Board and the FOMC each have according to our governing legal   document, which is the Federal Reserve Act    Thank you, Mr Chairman  In my view, cumulative recessionary dynamics   are deeply entrenched, with mounting job losses leading to weaker consumer spending, tighter   credit, more job losses, and so on; and this nasty set of economic linkages is gaining momentum    Like the Greenbook, I anticipate a long period of decline, and in fact, the consensus forecast is that   we’re now in the longest and one of the deepest postwar recessions   I hope that a recovery will begin in the middle of next year, but the risks seem skewed to the   downside for several reasons  First, compared with the average recession, we face unusually   difficult financial conditions  My contacts complain bitterly that even firms with sterling credit   ratings have difficulty securing credit  Some banks appear reluctant to lend because financial   markets are skeptical about the quality of their assets and their reported net worth  An accounting   joke concerning the balance sheets of many financial institutions is now making the rounds, and it   summarizes the situation as follows  On the left-hand side, nothing is right; and on the right-hand   side, nothing is left  [Laughter]  The second factor skewing risk to the downside is the unusually   fearful and pessimistic psychology that’s developed  One director, who heads a national department   chain, predicts carnage in the retail sector after year-end, as stores close after trying to hold on   through the holidays  Although some stores have been able to keep sales up to reasonable levels,   heavy price discounting will translate into huge losses  Businesses have also generally turned very   December 15–16, 2008 140 of 284    cautious, hoarding cash and slashing capital spending  A third factor that worries me is that, in   contrast to many past recessions, this one is global in nature, and the fact that it’s a worldwide   slowdown—while lowering commodity prices, which is good—is also going to make it harder for   us to pull out   Turning just very briefly to the labor market, the Beveridge curve chart that Stephanie   presented during her briefing suggests that we have seen an unusually large increase in the   unemployment rate recently in comparison with the decline in job openings, at least in the JOLTS   data  I think one interpretation might be that the unemployment rate has risen in part because we   have had an unusual rise in labor force participation during this recession  Labor force participation   has been higher than would be expected, particularly for three demographic groups  young adults,   married women, and older workers nearing retirement  Analysis by my staff estimates that this rise   in participation could reflect behavioral responses to unusual credit constraints and wealth declines    Specifically, young adults aged 20 to 24 years appear to be entering the labor force in unusual   numbers, and that might reflect diminished access to student loans  Similarly, more married women   are entering the labor force, and that’s a possible reflection of diminished access to home equity and   credit card loans  Finally, an unusually large number of older workers are in the labor market, and   that may reflect the negative wealth shock associated with the collapse of housing values and the   plummeting stock market  All in all, I expect the anomalous increase in labor force participation to   put continued upward pressure on the unemployment rate   With respect to inflation, developments since our October meeting have again lowered the   outlook  I’m particularly concerned about the disinflationary effect of actual and prospective   economic slack  During the postwar period, core PCE inflation has actually fallen at least ¾   percentage point in every single year in which unemployment has averaged 7½ percent or more    December 15–16, 2008 141 of 284    Given that in each of the next two years the unemployment rate is predicted to average at least 8   percent, it seems quite likely that by the end of 2010 core inflation will have fallen at least 1½   percentage points  That creates a very real risk of deflation  So under these circumstances, I   definitely believe that we should do everything in our power to stimulate aggregate demand    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I think, at the end of the day, alternatives A   and B really amount to the same thing in terms of policy  So I could live with either, but on   communication grounds, my own strong preference would be for B  I think it is important at this   juncture for the FOMC to state very clearly what it wants the federal funds rate to be, that we   want it to remain close to zero, and I think we best do that by specifying explicitly a rate or, as it   is, a range  Both A and B eliminate the gap we have had between the target and the reality of   where the funds rate is actually trading, but B eliminates that gap by embracing the current   reality as desirable     In contrast, it seems to me that A is saying that the Committee is all but helpless to affect   the funds rate, so, after all, it would be a charade to set a target  Then it kind of acknowledges,   well, but, you know, the funds rate trading near zero is really not such a bad thing, given the   December 15–16, 2008 185 of 284    weakness in the economy  I think we have greater command over the funds rate’s destiny than   alternative A suggests  If the Board and the FOMC really wanted to push the effective funds rate   up above zero, say to 50 or to 100 basis points, the Board could choose to raise the rates paid on   reserves and the discount rate, and we could get it up, even though we have all of this enormous   quantity of excess reserves and even though interest on reserves isn’t working in quite the way   we expected  I agree that it would be a bit odd to be setting the interest on reserves and discount   rates above our target for the federal funds rate  But it seems to me it could be done, and we are   not powerless to accomplish it  So I don’t like the suggestion that we are just helpless to move   the funds rate  I think we should say that we don’t want to move the funds rate up  I don’t want   it to trade above the 0 to 25 basis point errange  I certainly don’t want that  I think the forecast   is grim  I think we should go as low as we can as fast as we can without harming the functioning   of money markets, so keeping the funds rate trading in the 0 to 25 range is desirable  If it were   to be the case, following President Lacker’s earlier question, that we suddenly saw the interest on   reserves floor working better and fed funds started trading above 25—the funds rate could, for   example, move up to 50 or so—I would hope that the Board would actually lower the interest   rate paid on reserves to hold the funds rate in the 0 to 25 range  So I think we should go down   and do it decisively in one step today     On the other matters, in alternative B, paragraph 3, I favor including the bracketed   language suggesting that we expect and are not happy to see inflation declining below levels we   consider consistent with price stability  I agree with President Evans on the merits of doing that    I like the forward-looking language from A that has been added in bold to B concerning the odds   that we will keep the funds rate low for some time  On the Treasuries, I am worried about   making an announcement or giving a hint that we are not going to follow through on them pretty   December 15–16, 2008 186 of 284    quickly  I am personally in favor of and support buying longer-term Treasuries, and I haven’t   heard a lot of opposition to it  If we really are going to do it and do it pretty soon, I have no   problem with including language to that effect  But I don’t think we should throw a hint out   there unless we intend to follow through  With respect to the wording of the directive, I am   happy with it  With respect to the issue about the monetary base and increasing the size of our   balance sheet, I would endorse Governor Kohn’s remarks on that topic   "
8409,2009-01-16," Thank you, Mr Chairman  This topic, as we have seen in previous   discussion, is bedeviled by difficult issues But in the spirit of the pragmatic responses that we   have taken throughout these challenging times, I would like to take a straightforward approach  I   am going to organize my remarks around two questions  First, what is the communication   problem we now face regarding inflation and inflation expectations?  Second, is there a solution   that we can implement quickly and readily?  I agree with the characterization that you offered,   Mr Chairman  The main communication problem we now face is that most of us anticipate a   period that may be quite extended in which inflation will be below the mandate-consistent rate,   even with monetary policy pulling out all the stops, especially given that we are at the zero   bound That can result in a pernicious increase in real interest rates  So we do need to   communicate very clearly that such a decline in inflation is both unwelcome and undesirable and           January 16, 2009 19 of 69  that we will do everything possible to return inflation over time toward higher levels consistent   with the dual mandate   But I also agree with your remark that a second problem has developed, and we need to   address it, too There is growing concern that the Fed is printing money with abandon to   stimulate the economy, and the combination of trillion dollar deficits and trillions of dollars of   money creation can have only one outcome in the long run, which is high inflation that debases   the currency  Now, I think this reasoning is completely misguided, but it is out there, and I think   we need to consider it because it is dangerous for our credibility as an institution  So I also think   we have to say that we are not willing to tolerate very high inflation   I think uncertainty about what our inflation goals are could be reduced by clear   communication about our expected path for the economy and especially inflation  Greater   transparency about how we think the future will likely unfold could help anchor inflationary   expectations and reduce their dispersion, which is now very large  But our existing FOMC   projections, which have the three-year forecast horizon, obviously aren’t up to the task  Given   the enormous negative shocks to the economy over the past year, our forecast for inflation over   the next three years falls quite low, and that may support the deflationary fears of some  In   addition, those who are worried about an inflationary surge may argue that a three-year horizon   is too short to display the full extent of inflationary consequences of our balance sheet policies    The obvious solution to this problem is to provide economic projections with a longer horizon,   and that is exactly what the Subcommittee on Communications recommended in December    Based on the trial run we conducted, these projections, especially with the rich narrative that   accompanies them, appear to be useful in conveying important information about the   Committee’s goals and the strategies for achieving them over time  Especially under current                       January 16, 2009 20 of 69  circumstances, I think there are clear benefits from that approach, and I hope that we can decide   to implement the subcommittee’s recommendation   The enunciation of an explicit numerical inflation objective is certainly another   possibility It is one I have long been in favor of doing, but I don’t expect the associated gains   from transparency and better anchoring of inflation expectations to be a lot larger than those that   we would achieve just from extending the forecast horizon  I am concerned that there are a   number of subtle issues in setting a numerical objective that I would not be eager to rush through   or just sweep aside in the interest of getting this done quickly  Most important, I wouldn’t want   consideration of those issues to delay us from implementing the extended projections that we had   recommended  For example, among the issues I am concerned with, the issue of time horizon   for an explicit numerical objective—Brian asked about this—is not straightforward to answer    Brian’s questions were all cast in terms of a medium-term objective, whereas in the past this   Committee’s discussions have always been cast in terms of a long-term goal   I think that the distinction between long term and medium term is not semantic—it is   substantive From macroanalysis, I consider short term as referring to less than, say, a year or   two, medium term as ranging from around two to six years, and long term as anything beyond   around six Articulating a long-term inflation objective would be consistent with our past policy   behavior and with, for example, the kind of optimal policy scenarios in recent Bluebooks that   show convergence only after around a decade In contrast, I would interpret a medium-term   inflation objective as one that we would be committed to hitting within several years  Even   during normal circumstances, this would often require deemphasizing the employment part of   our dual mandate  At this time, though, with such a huge adverse shock to navigate through, I   don’t think a medium-term inflation objective is necessarily even attainable           January 16, 2009 21 of 69  There is a view among some economists that stating a medium-term inflation objective   would go a long way toward achieving it, but I am not so confident in the power of our words  I   think that the inflationary psychology that exists right now is especially delicate and doesn’t   correspond well to our theoretical models For example, my sense is that, in present   circumstances, many people are really relieved by the recent fall in consumer prices, which has   translated into a boost to real wages, after several years of being battered by ever-higher energy   and food costs That makes me skeptical about the desirability of right away setting a   temporarily high medium-term objective for inflation  In contrast, if falling prices and wages   became entrenched, as in the Great Depression, I believe the psychology would change a lot, and   a promise of higher inflation or a price-level target could prove useful  It is something I   wouldn’t want to see taken off the table In today’s situation, though, I think an approach like   that would be confusing and counterproductive  Even if we agree on a long-term horizon for a   numerical inflation objective, a lot of important issues remain regarding its formulation and   communication   My preference is now, as it has been for some time, that we have a long-term inflation   objective specified in terms of the total PCE price index  We have had success with that in our   Monetary Policy Report  As we have discussed previously, I prefer a total measure to a core   measure  With respect to a specific number, I think the welfare function is pretty flat over a   range of values, but I think an inflation buffer is appropriate because of potential adverse effects   of downward nominal wage rigidity, especially in situations with low productivity growth  Now   that we have had a couple of brushes with deflation, all in all I have concluded that a long-term   numerical inflation objective of 2 percent for the PCE price index would be preferable        January 16, 2009 22 of 69  There are process issues about choosing a long-run inflation objective  I believe that we   should try, as a group, to arrive at consensus or general agreement among the full set of FOMC   participants, not just by a formal vote of the members, which was in essence the decisionmaking   process that was proposed in the last Bluebook where this was raised  Consensus among   participants is the way in which we usually decide communication issues, because everyone has   to live with the consequences If we do adopt an inflation objective, I think we should revisit it   on an annual basis Of course, if we do reach consensus on a numerical inflation objective,   communication of that consensus is very important  I think the objective needs to be announced   in the context of a clear and convincing statement of our commitment to both parts of our dual   mandate  A single sentence in an FOMC statement, which was what the last Bluebook   contained, doesn’t seem sufficient to me  I think we would need a special press release, and I   think the long-term nature of the inflation objective would have to be clearly explained to the   public in the context of the dual mandate  I think we should stress that the implications for near-  term economic and financial stability would always be taken into account in deciding how to   move toward our inflation objective   So let me summarize what I see as the way forward  Essentially, I am hopeful that   extended projections along the lines recommended by the subcommittee can accomplish most of   what we need right now in terms of better anchoring inflation expectations, and I believe that is   something we can implement this month  Ideally, sometime perhaps further in the future, we   could also formulate an explicit long-term inflation objective to accompany our extended   forecasts, and then the forecasts would naturally illuminate the path from the present to our long-  run goals But I wouldn’t want to postpone implementing what the subcommittee proposed,   which is four-fifths of a loaf, which is our extended projections  I wouldn’t want to postpone                 January 16, 2009 23 of 69  that to potentially get a whole loaf with an inflation objective down the road  Finally, I have said   in the past, and would say again, that I think guidance on the path of future short-term interest   rates that implicitly accompany our quarterly economic projections could be quite helpful in the   current circumstances  The market at this point has priced in a fairly steep upward trajectory to   the path of the funds rate, at least relative to the Greenbook  So I think there would be value in   conducting a trial run on this issue to get a sense of whether that is workable  "
8435,2009-01-27," Second   Thank you A lot of ground has been covered, and I do not want to   rehash things that have already been said In general, I would just associate myself with   President Rosengren’s remarks and say that, with respect to choices that we have to make, I very   much agree with the idea that a focus on mortgage-backed security markets is something that can   be effective, is working, and deserves priority  I also want to support the point that Bill Dudley              January 27–28, 2009 72 of 267  and others have made about commercial-mortgage-backed securities and the notion that this is   something that was announced in connection with the TALF, that we were studying the   possibility of extending this facility to commercial-mortgage-backed securities  We have been   following this quite closely, and I would like to agree with the points that Bill made about this   This seems to me like something that could be the next very serious problem for the   banking system and for property prices in general  There is huge rollover risk here, where we   have hundreds of billions of dollars of loans that are coming due on commercial properties for   which the underwriting was originally pretty solid  I am very concerned that the underlying   economics is now deteriorating largely because of the economy, and banks obviously have very   high concentrations A lot of banks in this area are very loath to lend  The commercial-  mortgage-backed securities market seems to be completely dead  I am really very concerned   that, without the ability to refinance these loans, we are going to have properties dumped on the   market and we will begin to see exactly the same thing happen with commercial real estate that   we are seeing with housing  It could lead to a further wave of unnecessary bank failures  So   although I am sensitive to the idea that, yes, we are making decisions about what sectors are   deserving or are of priority in terms of credit allocations and there are counterarguments against   our doing that, we do have choices to make, and I would focus a lot of serious attention on   proceeding in that area   Thank you, Mr Chairman  We are in the midst of a very deep and   protracted downturn, and I have to squint really hard to see any light at the end of the tunnel  It   is a sad commentary that the one glimmer of light during this intermeeting period has been that   economic developments have been roughly in line with our expectations  In other words, we   were braced for the bad news we received For example, we had expected a dreadful holiday   retail season, and that is precisely what we got  One of my directors, the head of a national   department store chain, reported that his company posted its worst season since it was founded in   1901 We had anticipated severe hemorrhaging in jobs and a sizable jump in the unemployment   rate, and that, too, is what we got  Many of my business contacts are reporting layoffs and wage   freezes One unpleasant surprise among the economic data was last week’s 15 percent drop in   housing starts The residential housing sector has now shrunk so much that the only real   assurance that it will ever stabilize seems to be the fact that construction spending cannot go   negative This is just about the only zero lower bound that is working on our side  [Laughter]   Turning to financial markets, it is comforting that lending terms eased in a few markets,   notably money and mortgage markets  But equity markets continue to sink, and credit spreads   remain breathtakingly large  Another of my directors, the chairman of a large, well-known   apparel company, reported that his company, which is rated BB, looked hard for additional   financing and the best they could come up with was a loan rate of 18 percent  We have also   heard many reports concerning the tightening of trade credit  Indeed, a particularly severe     January 27–28, 2009 125 of 267  shortage of credit to finance international trade flows may conceivably help explain why both   exports and imports are shrinking by abnormally large amounts relative to the decline in GDP   Looking ahead, I expect that, as in the Greenbook, high borrowing costs and the   continuing credit crunch will help prolong the recession for at least a couple more quarters    Accordingly, I project that real GDP will decline ½ percent this year, and the unemployment rate   will rise to 8½ percent  However, I am hopeful that a large and timely fiscal stimulus will help   kick-start a recovery by the end of the year  In particular, based partly on our situation in   California, I think the Greenbook’s assessment of the impetus provided by the proposed federal   fiscal stimulus directed toward state and local governments is on the pessimistic side  The   Greenbook assumes that such spending will roll out slowly over the next several years, providing   little near-term stimulus  However, my contacts told me that in California a lack of funds has   already halted construction on a number of public infrastructure projects, and these projects   could be quickly restarted if federal funds help the state close its huge budget gap  Outside   California, the data suggest that most of the country is facing near-term cuts in state spending in   areas ranging from education to construction, and it appears that the fiscal stimulus will allocate   money largely to those states that could most use it to avoid immediate spending cuts and finance   shovel-ready infrastructure projects  Still, even with a large fiscal stimulus, it will take many   years before the economy returns to potential and economic slack is eliminated   Unfortunately, over the intermeeting period, I have become much more pessimistic about   the downside risk to my modal growth forecast owing to the rapidly deteriorating condition of   the banking system  For much of the past year, it was the financial sector that was constricting   the real economy, but now the slowing economy is returning the favor  The sharp decline in   equity prices and increases in CDS spreads for bank holding companies since our last meeting        January 27–28, 2009 126 of 267  presumably reflect the market’s concern about the likely magnitude of losses that will hit the   banking sector These losses now reflect a broad-based deterioration in performance across the   whole spectrum of consumer and corporate lending  As I mentioned yesterday, I share President   Hoenig’s concern about commercial real estate over the next few years  I fear a cycle in which   rising vacancies and falling valuations make it impossible for owners to refinance loans that will   be coming due, leading to forced selling and intensifying downward price pressures  Such a   development may undermine the soundness of many regional and community banks, whose   exposures to this asset class are substantial   Let me conclude with some discussion of the outlook for inflation, for which there are   also sizable risks I expect core PCE price inflation to come in at about 1 percent this year and   then edge down a bit more in 2010 and 2011  Given the sizable downside risks to the forecast   for economic growth, the risks to inflation also appear tilted to the downside  As in several of   the Greenbook alternative scenarios, it is not hard to imagine a situation with excessive declines   in inflation and a long-lasting deflationary trap, much like Japan’s experience and perhaps even   complete with zombie banks  Of course, I am reminded that the last time we were concerned   about the possibility of deflation in 2003 we were head-faked  The deceleration in prices during   that period was not sustained, and it was actually concentrated in a few categories of goods,   particularly used cars with very flexible prices and owners’ equivalent rent   My staff has taken a first look at the current episode in order to see how widespread   deflationary pressures are across various categories of goods and services  Given the available   data, they find in this preliminary look that the recent deflationary pressures are more prevalent   now than during the 2003 deflationary scare  Just as in 2003, some recent price declines are in   categories of goods with highly flexible prices, like used cars and apparel, where price cuts could     January 27–28, 2009 127 of 267  reflect a temporary response by retailers to sell off excess inventory  However, disinflationary   pressures are somewhat more prevalent now than in 2003 in categories of goods and services   characterized by sticky prices  We will be analyzing these data in greater depth going forward   and monitoring them, but we think they raise the risk that we could see a prolonged period in   which inflation falls well below the level consistent with our dual goals of price stability and   maximum sustainable employment  That leads me, especially now, to favor going ahead with   the publication of our longer-term projections, especially given that inflation over the next three   years, our standard horizon, looks as though it is unlikely to converge to the levels that we think   most desirable in the longer term  I think it makes going ahead with the extended forecast   particularly appropriate now   Thank you, Mr Chairman  I favor alternative B  I think it’s important to   reiterate that we will likely maintain our target range of 0 to ¼ percent for some time  I am   certainly open to the idea of buying longer-term Treasuries, but I would not go forward with   such a policy today, and I like the wording in B concerning our attitude toward that  I am   certainly also very open to the idea of expanding our purchases of mortgage-backed securities   and supportive of President Rosengren’s views on this  I think I would not go forward with it   today, however, given that we have only just begun to buy these securities  We have a long way   to go before we ramp up to anything close to our commitment, and right now it makes sense to   wait to see what the Administration puts forward in terms of their program to support the   banking system, to see if they are willing to collaborate with us in expanding the TALF facility,   and in what directions they plan to go and in what ways they may proceed to support the housing   market  So just in terms of the timing of a further commitment there, I think I would be tempted   to wait   The one suggestion I would make concerning alternative B is that I would like to add to it   the sentence from the end of paragraph 3 in alternative A that concerns the inflation risk   assessment  The additional sentence reads, “Moreover, the Committee sees some risk that   inflation could persist for a time below rates that best foster economic growth and price stability   in the longer term”  I would add that to B because I think it is an accurate assessment of the   situation, and commenting on the risk makes our discussion of inflation comparable to our   discussion of growth, where we also comment on the risks        January 27–28, 2009 175 of 267  It is in our longer-term forecasts   I have certainly said it in speeches  "
8481,2009-03-17," Thank you, Mr Chairman  I have two questions The first one follows   up on President Evans’s earlier question  It’s one for Spence I have been somewhat concerned   about exit strategies I think it’s probably going to be quite a while before we have to worry   about it, but I think I’d feel better about expanding some of these programs if we did have that   worked out When I read the balance sheet scenarios, I was comforted at first to see that it’s   going to be a very long time before we need to deal with this at all  But then I looked at it a little   bit more carefully  I thought maybe there was something in the scenario you laid out that was   inconsistent, because it was based on the March Greenbook forecast, but that assumed no   additional unconventional policies Then, in your baseline you added $500 billion in purchases   of MBS, which, in the staff memos on that program, has quite a bit of macro impact  It seemed   to me that, with the likely impact of a $500 billion program, we would have a stronger economy   than in the baseline We would probably want to be raising rates in 2012 rather than 2014  I   guess that would be about the same time that the TALF was building up and might be difficult to   unwind So my question is Have I misunderstood that, or have I taken too sanguine a message   from your scenario about exit strategies?   My second question is for Bill, and it concerns the extension of the TALF from newly   originated asset-backed securities to legacy assets  As I recall, there were just a couple of   paragraphs in the memo on that  But it seems to me to be a very big step, and I’m not sure I   really understood it Is this considered the PPIF program?   Thank you, Mr Chairman  I have a few brief comments on the various   issues Starting with the swaps, I support the staff recommendation  I think it’s a prudent step    There were two possible draft resolutions  I think I would favor the greater transparency of A,   but I don’t feel strongly about it and could support either   Then just a brief comment on the banking system  I think it’s essential to fix the banking   system for exactly the reason that President Hoenig and others emphasized  I think we will not   get recovery until we have a strong, healthy banking system with good banks that can attract   capital I would really love to see this done in the most transparent and straightforward way,   namely, creating a good bank–bad bank type of framework  I agree fully with President   Rosengren’s comments—I would not make this a matter of optional sales of some portfolios of   assets by banks that wanted to do it into a facility  I would go in and much more aggressively, as   he suggested, force write-downs on the value of these assets  We have a great opportunity to do   it after the stress test is over, and I would push these institutions into spinning off their   operations, in the cases where it is needed, into a good bank–bad bank structure  If we had   legislation that allowed for the resolution of systemically important financial firms that aren’t   banks, that would be much easier—to give us the power to push firms without necessarily having   to put them into a conservatorship, but to take those steps  So that’s what I think would be ideal,   and I think it’s important for economic recovery  I understand it’s expensive, and I understand                    March 17–18, 2009 92 of 266  it’s hard to go to the Congress to get the amount of capital that’s needed  I think the FDIC   facility is a move in the right direction  I prefer it to what we’re doing now  It’s not ideal, but I   think it’s a step in the right direction   On the legacy TALF, I have issues similar to those that President Stern enunciated  I’m   not dead set against it, but I do have qualms about our becoming involved in that business   On the purchase options, I certainly see the benefits of additional purchases of MBS,   especially given that there’s going to be a step-up in issuance over the next couple of months in   connection with refinancing of mortgages  The spreads are still high, although they’ve come   down, and it seems to me that the expansion of that program could have a beneficial effect on the   housing market and the economy and on bringing long-term yields down more generally, since   other long-term assets are substitutes for mortgage-backed securities  I worry a little bit that   they’re harder to unwind than Treasuries, but, still, it’s something that I would be very   supportive of going ahead with now  Bill mentioned a number much higher than I had   envisioned I don’t know what the right number is, so I’m quite open on that  I would be   supportive of going ahead with purchases of Treasuries at this point, as well, on various grounds    One is that the economy is just a disaster area  The economic outlook is utterly dreadful, and we   have said we stand ready to do absolutely everything that’s needed to support the economy  We   have let some time pass without doing anything, and in light of the outlook I would want to do   everything we can I thought the staff memos made a good case for the idea that the Treasuries   and MBS purchases would have favorable macro effects, and I understand the concern about   “what are we doing monetizing the debt?”  That’s quite a legitimate concern, but, on balance, I   come out in the same place as President Stern—I don’t think we’ve lost our independence, I   think people realize these are unusual and exigent circumstances, and taking a step like that now           March 17–18, 2009 93 of 266  is a favorable thing for the economy  So I am supportive of A and am very open-minded about   magnitudes   Thank you, Mr Chairman  The economic and financial news has been   grim  Things are now so bad that I actually open the Greenbook with greater trepidation than my   401(k) [Laughter] The awful employment and spending data have not been much of a surprise,   but they do dispel remaining hopes that we might see a turnaround any time soon  This   conclusion is reinforced by what I’m hearing from my business contacts  Their already sour   mood is taking another sharp turn for the worse  One director reported that businesses were so   shaken that it would take a sustained period of positive data, on the order of six to nine months,   before they would begin to consider expanding production and employment  Another disturbing   sign of how tough things are getting is that people appear to be breaking into their piggybanks to   make ends meet—the Cash Product Office reports huge increases in the amount of coins being   brought into our inventory  [Laughter] The December inventories of quarters and dollar coins   were up more than 50 percent from 2007, and even pennies were up nearly 25 percent   Looking ahead, some more-optimistic forecasters have argued that we’re likely to see a   rapid V-shaped recovery similar to the ones that followed several past severe postwar recessions    The case for such an outcome is that housing construction and purchases of durable goods,   especially cars, have been running way below trend for some time  Over time, these capital   stocks will fall well below desired levels, and eventually investment must rise to bring stocks   back in line with fundamentals  The resulting pent-up demand may lead to a surge in spending   once the financial system regains its health and uncertainty is diminished   But my fear is that we may not even get a modest U-shaped recovery, much less a V-  shaped one I have three reasons for this pessimism  First, the global nature of the recession   means we can’t rely on foreign demand to provide support for our economy  Instead, a sharp        March 17–18, 2009 135 of 266  downturn abroad and recent dollar appreciation have driven down our exports and exacerbated   our downturn Indeed, given the high degree of synchronization among all of the major   economies of the world, this is the first truly global recession since the Depression  Furthermore,   as the downturn has spread to more countries, new cracks have developed in the already strained   banking system  Steve discussed the situation in Eastern Europe, and we share his concerns    These countries have an estimated $1½ trillion of debt to Western European banks, and it’s   fortunate that US banks have little exposure in this region  But loans from Austrian banks to   Eastern Europe exceed 80 percent of Austria’s GDP, and the exposure of banks in Sweden and   Belgium exceeds 30 percent of GDP  Severe losses on these loans do pose significant threats to   the banking systems in these countries   My second concern is that, despite our best efforts at using both traditional and   nontraditional monetary tools, the stance of credit market conditions has only improved   modestly In past recessions, the Fed has been able to fuel a turnaround rapidly by stepping on   the accelerator through sharp rate cuts But in the current crisis, it feels more like we are   desperately trying to power a bicycle uphill rather than pressing an accelerator on a high-  powered sports car This conclusion is supported by work by my staff that aims to gauge the   stance of credit market conditions  In particular, we use principal components analysis on a set   of private sector interest rates to construct a metric of credit conditions that in normal times   moves very closely with the real federal funds rate  According to this metric, we were basically   treading water during much of the last year, with our policy actions roughly neutralizing the   effects of the credit crisis on private rates  Since September and the introduction of more   aggressive policy actions by the Fed, the FDIC, and the Treasury, this metric of credit market   conditions has improved somewhat and is now at a level consistent with a modest degree of           March 17–18, 2009 136 of 266  accommodation, but nowhere near as much accommodation as implied by the level of the real   fed funds rate or called for by the stance of the economy  And, of course, this analysis abstracts   from non-price terms of credit, and those continue to tighten as well  We see that in the Senior   Loan Officer Opinion Survey  And one community banker on my board mentioned that he finds   it now difficult to summon the emotional energy to make loans to anybody at all   A third reason to doubt that we will enjoy a V-shaped recovery is the huge damage that   has been done to balance sheets Household wealth has plummeted  It fell more than $5 trillion   in the fourth quarter alone Unfortunately, households were not well positioned for such a shot   to wealth Instead, many had leveraged up to the hilt, and the combination of the dramatic loss   in wealth and the massive household debt overhang portends years of subdued spending as   households go through an extended period of deleveraging  I see worrisome parallels to the   Japanese corporate sector during the 1990s  In that case, the attempt of firms to pay down debt   produced a decade of weak investment  The downward pressure on household leverage will   come both from lenders and from households  Lenders are likely to demand more collateral for   loans going forward, and that collateral has been devastated by the collapse of housing and other   wealth; and households are likely to recognize the benefits of stronger balance sheets for   precautionary reasons and meeting longer-term goals, such as down-payment requirements and   retirement  As one of my directors quipped, people may come to realize that they don’t need   three cars—they can get by with two and maybe even just one    The outlook for inflation is worrisome as well I think it’s fair to say it is no longer a risk   that inflation will persist for a time below the preferred rate—instead, it’s our expectation    What’s more, the probability of outright deflation is significant  In that regard, I’m closely   monitoring wage developments, as I view the outbreak of sizable wage cuts to be a crucial step           March 17–18, 2009 137 of 266  leading to sustained deflation I have heard scattered reports of such cuts, but so far the majority   of my directors say they’re reluctant to cut wages for fear that it would undermine employee   morale Nonetheless, many of them cautioned that if the economy continues to deteriorate, they   will have no choice but to cut wages and salaries  So, to summarize, I don’t see forces at work   that will propel our economy into sustained robust recovery any time soon  Even though the   Greenbook forecast is hardly upbeat, I see substantial downside risk to that forecast, both for   economic activity and inflation   Thank you, Mr Chairman  As I said, I think we’re in the midst of a very   severe recession—it’s unlikely to end any time soon  The optimal policy simulations would take   the fed funds rate to negative 6 percent if it could, and because it can’t, I think we have to do   everything we possibly can to use our other tools to compensate  With respect to what we should           March 17–18, 2009 202 of 266  do today, my preference is for the combined alternative that would combine $750 billion of   mortgage-backed securities, $100 billion of extra agency debt, and the $300 billion of Treasuries   I certainly support the MBS purchases  I think they’re likely to have a very positive   effect on the housing market, particularly now, and I certainly agree with President Rosengren’s   suggestion that we should front-load the purchases for the reasons he gave  I said yesterday that   I would also support purchases of Treasuries I think it would be useful to begin that now  I   favor diversification of what we do, given the uncertainties about the impacts of any of these   programs  There’s a principle elucidated by William Brainard 30 years ago that, when policy   actions have uncertain effects, you should simultaneously use all of your instruments, and I think   that’s a worthwhile principle for us now   A couple of things on language One of the differences between A and B concerns the   characterization of how long we plan to keep the fed funds rate low  A states “for an extended   period,” while B uses the phrase “for some time”  The fed funds futures market at this point   seems to expect rate hikes next year  That’s not our own expectation, and to try to align market   expectations better with ours, I would like to see the switch to “an extended period” as in A    With respect to A or A′—that issue of what goes first—I could certainly accept either  I was   positively inclined toward A′ on the principle that it makes sense—and we’ve always done this—   to state right away what the policy decisions are  Now the focus is not on the fed funds rate, so it   makes sense to state that we’ve decided to do such-and-such with respect to programs But I   think that Governor Kohn has made an excellent point, raising the question, “What will we do if   we don’t have any action on a particular day?”  It may be difficult; we don’t want to keep   shifting from one thing to another if we can’t envision how we’re going to write that on the day   we don’t do anything new I guess I would agree that it’s better to stick with the A formulation           March 17–18, 2009 203 of 266  With respect to alternative B′′ that Presidents Bullard and Plosser proposed, I really   thought it was a very worthwhile and constructive idea  There are aspects of it that I liked and   that I thought were quite sensible, such as suggesting some conditionality of what we might do   relating to economic and financial conditions and having some flexibility in the composition of   what we do I thought that was very interesting and useful  But I would emphasize that I don’t   agree with the underlying theory that says that there is a relationship between the size of the   monetary base and our impact on the economy, and I would associate myself with the comments   of President Rosengren and Governor Kohn on this  So I don’t like the language that suggests an   emphasis on the size of our balance sheet and the size of the base  I think we have a real   theoretical disagreement among ourselves as to exactly how our policy works, and I just   wouldn’t endorse going in that direction  "
8507,2009-04-28," Just a quick comment  I’ve also been worried about the leverage ratio   issue and whether or not it might mean that our long-term asset purchases have a perverse effect    Looking at leverage ratios for various large banking organizations, they don’t seem very close to   the regulatory minimums  On the other hand, I thought you had reported to us that the major   reason that interest on reserves had failed to provide a floor for the federal funds rate—after all,         April 28–29, 2009 41 of 201  the question is why banking organizations don’t borrow at the federal funds rate and then hold   them and earn a higher return by keeping it in their accounts and earning interest on reserves—   was concern about leverage ratios and leverage ratios beginning to bind I thought that perhaps   you mentioned—I can’t recall where I heard this—that large banks have been asked why they   aren’t doing that If I’m right that concerns about leverage was their answer, then it gives me   greater concern about this issue   Why can’t the large banks borrow in the funds market from the GSEs   and hold the proceeds in their account and arbitrage that out?  I understand that the GSEs can’t   earn interest on reserves, but it seems like a pure arbitrage opportunity   And that’s what’s feeding my concern about this leverage issue   Thank you, Mr Chairman  It is a welcome relief to say for the first time   in recent memory that the economic data since our last meeting have not been uniformly   disappointing The pace of contraction in aggregate spending appears to have slowed    Consumer spending and housing show welcome signs of stabilization  Overall, financial   conditions have improved, and I have seen no indication that a dangerous deflationary dynamic   has thus far taken hold These are encouraging signs, but we should be careful not to overreact   to developments that may yet prove to be will-o’-the-wisps   The economic outlook remains fraught with peril  I am particularly concerned about the   labor market, where the data are appalling  Not only has the unemployment rate risen   17 percentage points over the past four months, but recent readings on initial claims point to   another dismal labor report for April  What is worse, the unemployment rate appears to   understate the true magnitude of the labor market deterioration  For one thing, the incidence of   permanent, as opposed to temporary, layoffs is high in comparison with past downturns         April 28–29, 2009 58 of 201  Another, and probably more important, point is that there has been an unprecedented increase in   involuntary part-time work  It far exceeds what would be expected given the rise in   unemployment  My staff’s analysis of CPS data confirms what we hear from our business   contacts The use of furloughs is widespread, and the surge in part-time work for economic   reasons is broadly based across occupations  The associated reduction in hours is nontrivial    Our expectation is that the underemployment rate—a broad measure that adds individuals   working part-time for economic reasons to those unemployed—will top the level reached in   1982 by year-end We expect it to climb from its current rate of about 14½ percent to over   16 percent   Turning to growth, my forecast is similar to that in the Greenbook  I expect the   unemployment rate to peak at 96 percent late this year, a tad higher than the Greenbook,   reflecting in part a somewhat more optimistic view of potential output growth compared with the   Board staff’s view And, like the Greenbook, I anticipate a slow recovery in subsequent years,   not the rapid V-shaped recovery we have frequently seen following deep recessions in the past   Several factors underlie my view that the recovery will be slow  First, as I mentioned at   our March meeting, I anticipate that the process of balance sheet repair that households are   undergoing will result in subdued consumer spending for an extended period  Second, monetary   policy both here and abroad is severely constrained by the zero lower bound on interest rates    Indeed, the optimal policy simulation indicates that we should lower the funds rate to negative   7½ percent, if that were feasible  Of course, it isn’t, so we have turned to unconventional   monetary policy tools, but these are imperfect substitutes for standard monetary policy    According to the Bluebook simulations, even if we more than double the large-scale asset   purchases we have put into motion, we are nowhere near the desirable outcome in terms of        April 28–29, 2009 59 of 201  unemployment and inflation, which might be within reach if the zero bound were not   constraining policy In addition, the slow start of the TALF program raises doubts about whether   this tool will provide a great deal of lift to the economy     Third, I am concerned that the banking system is not really strong enough to expand   credit in the manner that is required for a rapid economic rebound  The new capital that is slated   for injection following the stress test should be helpful, but I think it will likely prove   insufficient Thanks to the Herculean efforts of staff members across the Federal Reserve   System and other agencies, we now have a much clearer picture of the potential losses   confronting our major banks  My personal interpretation of the data—and I think my assessment   is consistent with market views as revealed in CDS spreads and the prices of bank shares—is that   there remains a nontrivial probability that the existing common shareholders of a number of the   major banks will be wiped out in an adverse economic scenario  This possibility diminishes their   incentive to raise new capital to support additional lending  The problem is that the benefits of   the extra capital would accrue disproportionately to debt holders and preferred shareholders,   including the US government, who are more senior in the capital structure  A separate problem   is that banks with government capital appear heavily focused on getting out from the restrictions   and stigma associated with the TARP  They insist that it is impossible to raise new private   equity when it will sit side by side with money from the government, and this creates an   incentive for them to devote their earnings to pay off TARP capital rather than to use the retained   earnings to support increased lending   I have enumerated several reasons why I project a sluggish recovery  Additionally, I   remain concerned about downside risks  I am particularly concerned that another shoe may drop    Confidence in global financial markets is extremely fragile, and more bad news could trigger           April 28–29, 2009 60 of 201  another panic and run on the financial system  Unfortunately, the road ahead is littered with   headlines of defaults, bankruptcies, and rising unemployment  While a big chunk of the losses   associated with residential mortgages may have been realized already, we are only at the   beginning of that process for consumer and commercial real estate loans, and the magnitude of   the likely losses has risen dramatically as the economy has deteriorated  European banks face a   similar situation with mounting losses and a sizable exposure to Eastern Europe  If another shoe   drops, risk premiums are likely to spike again, and a further pullback in lending and spending   seems likely  My staff has been examining the effects of tighter lending standards and measures   of uncertainty on consumer spending They find that these two factors explain a sizable share of   the weakness in consumption growth in the second half of last year  In our baseline forecast,   these negative influences are expected to dissipate over the next year, contributing to a revival of   consumer spending  But a real risk is that further bad news could reverse this process  The false   dawn scenario in the Greenbook illustrates one potential outcome   Let me, finally, comment on inflation  I have been struck by the resilience in wages and   core inflation despite sharply declining commodity prices and a dramatic increase in slack in the   labor and goods markets  Measures of long-run inflation expectations have also been reasonably   stable, and that is very reassuring Looking forward, I expect inflation expectations to remain   well anchored I expect core inflation to dip down to 1½ percent this year and 1 percent next   year, about ¼ percentage point above the Greenbook forecast and similar to the well-anchored   expectations scenario reported in the Greenbook  Of course, given the very somber outlook for   the global economy and the downside risks to this forecast, there is considerable chance of a   more sizable fall in inflation, and such a scenario represents another downside risk to the outlook   for economic activity as well     April 28–29, 2009 61 of 201  In summary, despite the recent bits of good news, the economy remains in very bad   shape I expect at best a gradual recovery starting late this year, with core inflation remaining   below my preferred 2 percent rate for the next few years, and I see substantial downside risk to   that forecast for both economic activity and inflation   Thank you, Mr Chairman  I favor alternative A  The Greenbook   projection, with which I broadly concur, assumes no change from our announced asset   purchases It foresees unemployment remaining above 9 percent through the end of 2010 and        April 28–29, 2009 121 of 201  inflation well below our preferred rate for even longer  I consider this unacceptable in light of   our mandates  I think we need to do more to get the economy moving forward   I think our actions at the last meeting provided compelling evidence that purchases of   longer-term Treasury securities worked to bring down borrowing rates and improved financial   conditions more broadly Now that we’ve tested the waters, it’s time to wade in by substantially   increasing our purchases of Treasury securities  In fact, I could support increasing the amount   beyond $750 billion and would consider including securities of durations down to one year  The   latter step would be aimed at bringing down one-year and two-year rates that are well above   those consistent with our expectations for the future path of policy  Now, we could wait until   our June meeting to take this step, but the question to my mind is why we would wait  As with   the funds rate, I don’t see a reason to keep our powder dry  So I prefer to take appropriate, bold   action to stimulate the economy sooner rather than later   Regarding the best way to communicate our asset purchases to the public, I strongly   support the approach that we have taken so far and see no reason to change it  Our statements   provide clear information on the expected size and duration of each of our asset purchase   programs  Economic theory suggests that it is the size of the cumulative asset purchase relative   to the size of the market that affects the yield and, therefore, the stance of monetary policy  In   other words, it is aggregate purchases, not the growth rate, that matters  This is an important   point because it implies that our communications should focus on levels or, alternatively, on the   shares of the outstanding stock that we hold and not on changes or growth rates  A focus on   growth rates or changes would confuse our message, and I therefore would consider it a mistake    I also think it’s important to report the various types of asset purchases separately rather than as a   sum because their effects on financial conditions and the economy may differ              April 28–29, 2009 122 of 201  Our statements do leave open the question of what we will do once the announced   purchases have been completed, but this ambiguity is appropriate given the high degree of   uncertainty about the outlook and the effectiveness of the asset purchases  Indeed, we’re already   far clearer about our projections of asset purchases than we have ever been about the future path   of the funds rate So perhaps the change we should be considering is how to better communicate   the funds rate path we think is most likely  "
8547,2009-06-23," Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll try to be brief and confine my remarks to   the three things that you asked about  With respect to the credit and liquidity facilities and the   timing of trimming them back, I thought that Brian and the staff put forward a very well thought   out proposal, and it’s a proposal I completely support  I think it is important to include language   of the type that you read from the draft that you’re preparing  I’ll say this again in the policy   round, but I want to emphasize that we have to be very careful not to signal an early end to   policy stimulus, and while I see a good reason to withdraw the facilities in the manner that you        June 23–24, 2009 80 of 261  set out, I think it’s very important to put in place language that leans against the idea that we’re   looking for an early end to policy stimulus So I support the proposal and the language you read   On exit strategies, I do think you indicated that you might discuss this in detail in the   Humphrey-Hawkins testimony  I think that’s absolutely the right place to do it, and I think it’s   important to indicate that we have complete confidence in our ability to withdraw stimulus when   we need to do so, that we have the tools to do it, and that when the time comes, which is not now   or soon, that we will proceed to do it   The wording for monetary policy alternative B has been changed, but the phrasing in the   original draft of B is the type of thing I think we have to be very careful to avoid  It suggests that   we’re not sure if we have the ability to exit and, therefore, we will carefully consider whether we   should expand our balance sheet further  I believe we do have the tools  I thought the staff did a   wonderful job of preparing the memo on exit strategies  It convinced me that, if the only thing   we had to work with was interest on reserves, it probably would be sufficient  I thought this idea   of strengthening it through collateralized accounts was really clever, was implementable, and   was almost foolproof  And I would love to see the staff do the further work that would be   necessary to confirm that that is a foolproof technique, adding to the arsenal of tools, such as   triparty reverse repos, and making sure that that is entirely workable  To me, it seems that   package, if we do nothing else, is sufficient for us to assert confidently that we can do what is   needed when the time comes  But that time is not now   On the LSAPs, they obviously do get into policy issues, and let me try to leave some of   the policy issues around this until tomorrow  Initially I was an enthusiast for long-term Treasury   purchases I thought the purpose of it was not only to improve liquidity and market functioning,   but also to influence yields to push them down  Now, I didn’t see it as a commitment to a           June 23–24, 2009 81 of 261  particular rate, which would be very dangerous; but, other things equal, and depending on our   assessment of overall financial conditions and the outlook, I saw it as an attempt to push rates   lower than they would otherwise be On theoretical grounds, I believe there’s a very strong case   that they should have some effect, but it has been awfully hard to identify exactly what that   effect is, and I think that we’re beginning to run into costs of pursuing that further  I think our   reputation for independence is suffering, and the public is obviously concerned that we’re   monetizing the debt and that it’s going to lead to an outbreak of inflation  I have to say that I   completely disagree with these views, but I can’t say they’re not prevalent  I encounter them day   in and day out So at the present time, I would say the benefits don’t merit the costs, but I   wouldn’t want to see Treasuries taken off the table if conditions were to deteriorate and attitudes   were to change   I think our communications around this have really been a problem, and as I consider the   concrete proposals the staff put forward in their memo, it seems to me that improving our   communications is important  The thing that most concerns me is the autumn expiration date for   our long-term Treasury purchase program  That’s coming up quickly  We either have to decide   now or we’ll have to decide in August There will be a lot of market speculation  In the   meantime if we could do something at this meeting to clarify rather than keep the market   guessing, I think it would be desirable This brings me to the suggestion—which is a policy   decision, but to my mind, in some sense, a relatively small one—to add a sentence that says   something like “to align the end dates (or the timing) of the three asset purchase programs, we’ve   extended the current pace of Treasury purchases through the end of the year, bringing the total   size of the program to $450 billion”  That would say they are all aligned at the end of the year              June 23–24, 2009 82 of 261  and that we’re going to decide what to do with these programs  I would like to see us take that   off the table   Quickly, on other issues, I could see some merit in flexibility in terms of the allocation of   our purchases between MBS and Treasuries We didn’t have a concrete proposal, but assuming   that we’re not going to expand the overall level of our Treasury purchases, except perhaps   extending the program at the current pace to the end of the year, then I agree that this isn’t the   right time to go in that direction   The idea of leaning against the wind—I could see some merit in it, but it will be   incredibly complicated to reach agreement and communicate to the Desk or to the outside world   what we’re doing, and I wouldn’t go there now at all  I’d just maintain steady as you go   I do think the idea of adding hybrid ARMs to the program is very constructive, given   what’s happening in the housing market and given that mortgage rates have backed up so much,   so if that’s a viable, practical possibility, I would move in that direction, too   Thank you, Mr Chairman  At our meeting in late April, we had begun   to see hopeful signs of impending economic recovery, and subsequent economic and financial   developments have strengthened the view that the economy is bottoming out  Even so, the   outlook over the next several years remains disturbing  My modal forecast shows economic   growth resuming next quarter, but I expect the recovery to be quite gradual  The output and   employment gaps are, at a minimum, quite large, so it will take a long time to regain full   employment under current monetary and fiscal policy settings  Although downside risks have   diminished, I remain concerned that the recovery is still fragile   The news on housing has been good A broad array of data shows signs of stabilization,   but the recent sharp rise in mortgage rates makes me worry about the future  Several of my   directors and advisory council members who are connected with the housing sector stress that the   improved outlook for housing remains precariously tied to mortgage rates   Recent data on consumer sentiment and spending show improvement due in part to the   fiscal stimulus  Even so, I continue to hear a flood of downbeat anecdotes on household buying   patterns My contacts tell me that demand remains weak and that firms are cutting prices to   generate sales, putting profit margins under tremendous pressure  They note that consumers are   continuing to shift from higher-cost discretionary items to lower-cost necessities  A major   discount retailer reports that for the first time in his memory consumers are passing up bulk        June 23–24, 2009 138 of 261  purchases of food and other staples at discount prices in favor of smaller packages with higher   unit prices, because they can’t come up with the money to carry the associated inventory  This   suggests very tight liquidity constraints Consumers seem particularly concerned about the   tightening of credit card limits   And, of course, labor markets continue to deteriorate badly  It’s a sign of how bad things   really are that near euphoria broke out with the announcement of 345,000 nonfarm jobs lost in   May The unemployment rate is soaring month by month, and, even worse, it appears to   understate the true extent of the deterioration, given the unusually high incidence of permanent,   as opposed to temporary, layoffs, and the unprecedented increase in involuntary part-time work   On the bright side, overall financial conditions have certainly improved since we last met    That bodes well for recovery It’s encouraging that so many banks have been able to raise   private capital, and in many respects market stress has subsided The combination of falling risk   spreads on bonds, higher stock prices, higher Treasury rates, and a lower dollar seems consistent   with a greater appetite for risk, probably stemming from the positive tone of emerging economic   data This development should be constructive for growth overall, but, as I said, I hope that the   associated rise in mortgage interest rates doesn’t reverberate too strongly  With foreclosures on   the rise, and house prices still falling, higher borrowing costs could stall the emerging rebound in   residential construction, further impairing financial institutions and markets and, thereby,   hampering the recovery more broadly   My forecasts for output and employment are similar to the Greenbook’s, so I won’t go   into the details  I do want to emphasize that I anticipate a rather sluggish recovery, not the rapid   V-shaped recovery we have frequently seen following deep recessions in the past  The process   of balance sheet repair that households and financial institutions are undergoing will result in        June 23–24, 2009 139 of 261  subdued spending for an extended period, and monetary policies here and abroad are not able to   play as big a role as usual in promoting recovery because of the constraint of the zero lower   bound on short-term interest rates   Given the uncertainties in the outlook, I very much appreciated the range of well-  designed alternative simulations presented in the Greenbook  I noticed that even under the   typical recovery simulation, which has much stronger growth than in the baseline, the   unemployment rate remains well above the 5 percent NAIRU by the end of 2011, and inflation   hovers around 1 percent This outcome reflects the large unemployment and GDP gaps   estimated for the first quarter  With a GDP gap of about 5½ percent, the economy is in a deep   hole, and it will take a long time to climb out, even if growth is rapid  This is a key   consideration in designing optimal policy   My forecast contains an estimate of the output gap similar to the Greenbook’s, but I’m   well aware that the size of the gap is uncertain and sensitive to the precise methodology that’s   used So for this forecast round, we assessed the level of the gap from a variety of different   perspectives to see if any central tendency emerged  The analysis that we carried out turns out to   be very close to what Mike Kiley described in yesterday’s briefing and what the Board heard in   the briefings that you had on Monday Obviously, great minds think alike, and I know President   Evans and his staff in Chicago were doing exactly the same things that we did and the Board did    So I won’t go into all of the details  I’ll just say we reverse engineered wage and price Phillips   curves to estimate the level of the GDP gap that would produce the inflation rates now being   observed We used a variety of wage and price measures to assess sensitivity  We investigated   whether a possible decline in the efficiency of the job-matching process might be raising the   NAIRU by comparing cross-industry dispersion of employment growth in this cycle with earlier           June 23–24, 2009 140 of 261  ones And we, too, assessed the evidence relating to the Beveridge curve and possible shifts  I   simply want to second or third the conclusions that Board staff reached and that President Evans   described It is possible to find reasonable methodologies that would lead to a short-run NAIRU   higher than that used by the Board, or to output gaps that are somewhat smaller than those that   are embodied in the Greenbook or in our forecast  But no matter what methodology is used, in   every case we find very substantial slack in labor and product markets   I’d like to discuss briefly one thing that we did  We looked at whether the financial crisis   and the large sectoral reallocations away from housing finance and autos may have slowed   underlying total factor productivity growth and thereby the pace of potential output growth  If   so, our forecast of output growth going forward could be too large  Although measured TFP has   declined over the past year or so, which is typical of past recessions, we find that, adjusted for   the utilization of labor and capital, it has actually risen strongly during the recession  The   conclusion that underlying productivity growth has remained on or actually above trend is   confirmed using an alternative approach of estimating permanent technology shocks from the   productivity data   So, to conclude, if the recovery is as slow as the Greenbook and I expect, it will take   quite a number of years to get back to potential output  As a result, I expect core inflation to drift   lower over the next few years, falling below the 2 percent rate that seems best to me   Thank you, Mr Chairman  I can support alternative B, although on   purely policy grounds I think that a strong case exists for further monetary stimulus  The   economy appears to be stabilizing and downside risk has declined, but it will be many years   before the economy is close to operating at full employment  Not surprisingly, the Bluebook   optimal policy simulation shows that the stance of policy is not even close to the optimal degree   of accommodation As the Bluebook points out, unemployment is anticipated to run around   1½ percentage points higher on the constrained path than on the unconstrained path for the next   three to four years, and this translates into a cumulative loss on the order of 10 percent of GDP,   or $1½ trillion, and creates a very strong case for doing everything possible to stimulate the   economy  The problem is that the obvious remaining tool, large-scale Treasury purchases, may   be less effective than hoped and may entail a variety of unquantifiable costs, as we have   discussed I wouldn’t want to take an expansion of this program off the table if the economy   were to worsen, but I wouldn’t push for an expansion now   The bottom line for me is that we likely will need to maintain the current stance of policy   for a very long time to get back to full employment, and my main concern is that markets will   anticipate and we may be tempted to withdraw our accommodation too soon, thereby aborting   the recovery  Christina Romer recently wrote a pertinent essay for The Economist on “The   Lessons of 1937” that you may have read  As many of you know, in that year, following two   years of robust recovery, the Federal Reserve tightened policy too soon because it was worried   about large quantities of excess reserves in the banking system  The economy plunged back into   depression, and I believe that a parallel can be found in Japan’s experience of the 1990s as well        June 23–24, 2009 176 of 261  So I think we need to do all that we can to avoid creating the impression that we intend to   raise the federal funds rate any time soon  For this reason I definitely prefer to drop the final   sentence in brackets in B concerning exit strategy  By bringing this issue up in the policy   statement, I am afraid we will reinforce the market’s impression that we may begin to tighten   policy sooner rather than later  I think discussions of exit strategy would be better handled in   testimony or speeches by the Chairman  In the event that a reference is included in this   statement, I have a very small wording change to propose  Currently the statement refers to   taking “careful account of the necessity of ensuring that policy accommodation can ultimately be   withdrawn” The phrase “can ultimately be withdrawn” sounds to me like we’re not sure we can   do it or that we may refrain from easing policy in particular ways later on because of our concern   about our ability to withdraw So if it is included, I would prefer a more confident wording,   namely, “ensuring that policy accommodation is ultimately withdrawn smoothly and at the   appropriate time”  So I would essentially change “can be” to “is”   I also have a wording suggestion to make in paragraph 1 concerning the outlook, and my   objective here, again, is to make the statement slightly less optimistic, slightly less able to be   interpreted as saying that we are anywhere close to withdrawing stimulus, and, in my view,   slightly more balanced  I propose adding to a sentence in paragraph 1 of B to recognize that   even though financial conditions have improved on balance, which is a net positive for the   outlook, the increase in mortgage rates we have seen has the potential to impede recovery in the   housing market  In particular, I would propose the following language  “Conditions in financial   markets have generally improved in recent months, although the sharp rise in mortgage rates has   the potential to impede recovery in the housing market  Indicators of consumer and business   sentiment…” and so on        June 23–24, 2009 177 of 261  I think the increase in mortgage rates has been substantial  It is one of the most important   and most discussed developments since our last meeting, and it does create a risk to the outlook    I think it deserves mention in the statement as a negative factor that partially offsets what is a net   improvement  I also would argue for including it for the sake of balance  I think it parallels our   discussion in the very next sentence that says that there are some factors restraining household   spending, and again, in the inflation section where we mention increases in the prices of energy   and commodities as an offset to our view that inflation will remain generally subdued  So that’s   a concrete suggestion   Yes  "
8574,2009-08-11," I just wanted to comment on President Lacker’s question and Brian’s   response and say that our staff also undertook independent analysis of this issue and estimated an   econometric model trying to assess how distorted the ARM and fixed-rate mortgage spreads are   relative to their benchmarks  That included more than the slope of the yield curve  It was a        August 11–12, 2009 23 of 165  principal-component analysis that implicitly included levels and other things  And it supports   the conclusion that Brian drew based on the exercise that he undertook  In fact, our staff   concluded that the fixed-rate mortgage rate relative to its benchmark is now reasonably normal   and the ARM rate is on the order of 150 basis points higher than you would expect, given the   entire constellation of rates   Another thing that they did was to estimate an econometric model using individual data   from the McDash data set to try to get a sense of how the existing differentials are affecting   choice between conventional and adjustable-rate mortgages, and they found that the essentially   no-issuance, no take-up on adjustable-rate mortgages is precisely what you would expect based   on the current constellation of rates   Finally, they tried to estimate what the likely responsiveness would be if we were able to   push the differential down about 150 basis points or other magnitudes to more-normal levels by   entering this market  They tried to look at those borrowers who were currently in the mortgage   market because historically you have had subprime borrowers with very low FICO scores who   aren’t in the mortgage market now  So they controlled for a lot of borrower characteristics and   tried to compute what the response would be of borrowers who were in the market as of early   2009, and they found a very high interest-elasticity  In fact, they computed that, if we could   drive that rate down 150 basis points, you should see the share of ARMs versus fixed-rate   mortgages rise to about 35 percent I offer that just as a clarifying comment    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Winston Churchill once remarked that   nothing in life is so exhilarating as to be shot at without result  [Laughter] Well, exhilaration   may be an exaggeration, but I am at least hugely relieved that our financial system appears to   have survived a near-death experience And I am optimistic that you will not be the Chairman   who presided over the second Great Depression  [Laughter] Most, though not all, of the recent   economic data suggest that the economy is bottoming out and the worst is over  Although the   labor market is still struggling, auto sales have rebounded in part because of government rebates,   and the bleeding has subsided in the housing market  My directors and advisory council   members take the view that the economy looks to have survived a very sharp drop  It is now   starting to brush itself off and climb out of the deep hole that it’s in   I expect that the current quarter will mark the end of the recession  Looking ahead,   however, I foresee a slow recovery over the next several years with stubbornly high   unemployment and very low price inflation, not the sharp rebound that typically follows deep   recessions In particular, I don’t think that we can look to consumer spending as a strong engine   of recovery In addition to factors such as continuing job losses, heightened job insecurity, tight   credit conditions, and the need to rebuild lost wealth and deleverage household balance sheets,   all of which are weighing on consumption, I have been struck by the recent very weak labor   income growth, driven in part by stagnating nominal wages  Wages have posted some of the           August 11–12, 2009 79 of 165  smallest gains ever recorded  Furthermore, my contacts report widespread reductions in pension   contributions, medical coverage, and other benefits   It seems equally unlikely that investment spending will propel a robust recovery with an   overhang of excess capacity serving as a headwind  President Fisher provided some lovely   examples of that  This excess capacity, or gap effect, is evident in the housing market, where a   sizable inventory of unsold homes is holding down new residential investment  It is also likely   to stifle capital spending in manufacturing, where utilization stands at its lowest level of the past   60 years Even after adjusting for factories that will never reopen, this huge overhang of   industrial capacity sets a high hurdle rate for new business equipment outlays   I share the Greenbook’s pessimism about nonresidential construction  My contacts   uniformly expect commercial real estate conditions to deteriorate further, with rising foreclosures   as loans come due that cannot be supported by falling rents and lower appraisals  Moreover, the   shortage of credit to this sector may cause property prices to decline quite dramatically   State and local budgets are another factor likely to depress growth in overall final   demand  California is the poster child in this regard, but most states face entrenched, structural,   fiscal problems  Despite all the press coverage, these problems actually have been tempered   recently by the federal fiscal stimulus and by drawdowns from states’ rainy day funds  Going   forward, the pain may worsen with further revenue shortfalls and spending cutbacks acting as a   drag on the whole economy   Although I do not anticipate a strong recovery, I now see the risks around my modal   forecast for a gradual recovery to be more balanced than before  My greatest worry on the   downside relates to commercial real estate and the potential for deteriorating conditions to cause   many community and midsized banks to fail  But with the improvement that we have seen in        August 11–12, 2009 80 of 165  broader financial conditions, there is now some appreciable upside risk as well  Even if we are   lucky enough to get sustained, robust GDP growth of, say, 4 to 5 percent for the next two years,   we are still likely to fall short of our full employment goal, given the size of the output gap and   the pace at which potential output appears to be growing  Like President Evans’s contacts, my   directors report they are intensely focused on cost-cutting measures, and recent readings on   productivity and earnings suggest that these efforts are paying off  With such healthy   productivity growth, we’re likely to see yet another jobless recovery   Turning to inflation, I have two separate concerns  On the one hand, I am worried about   the increasing degree of public alarm regarding the longer-term inflation outlook, and at the   same time I am worried that the intense downward wage pressure reported by my contacts could   result in disinflation over the next few years that is more severe than in the Greenbook forecast    Both of these separate concerns are apparent among forecasters participating in the survey of   professional forecasters Over the past six to nine months, the lowest quartile of forecasters has   become increasingly concerned with disinflation over the next five years  In contrast, the top   quartile of forecasters has become increasingly concerned with rising inflation five to ten years   out These shifts in the distribution of forecasts suggest a very different skew to the inflation   risks we face over the next five years versus the longer horizon     The fear of higher long-term inflation reflects to a large degree a loss of confidence that   the Federal Reserve will be able to attain price stability in the face of unsustainable federal   budget deficits This fear is real, growing, and disruptive  To assuage this concern, it is   important for us to emphasize and defend our independence, to express confidence in our ability   to tighten monetary conditions when the right time comes, and to stress our determination to   maintain price stability             August 11–12, 2009 81 of 165  These inflation fears notwithstanding, the main threat to the attainment of our price   stability goal over the next several years stems from the disinflationary forces that have been   unleashed by the enormous slack in the economy  The 1980s provides a useful historical   comparison along several dimensions  Remember that during the 1980s fears about burgeoning   federal deficits in an unsustainable fiscal situation were widespread, as they are today   Moreover, the Federal Reserve was under significant political pressure, and there were concerns   about its independence  Even so, with unemployment hitting 108 percent in 1982 and   plummeting oil prices, core PCE inflation fell about 6 percentage points during the first half of   the 1980s   Inflation expectations appear to be more firmly anchored now than in the 1980s, and I   expect that to help avoid a calamitous disinflation  But I am mindful there is a lot we don’t know   about how these expectations affect actual inflation and how to measure the expectations that are   relevant for price setting  It is sobering to recall that, from 1981 to 1986, professional forecasters   consistently overestimated year-ahead inflation, but these expectations did not stop inflation   from falling quite rapidly  So while I would not quibble with the Greenbook projection of only   1 percentage point or so of disinflation, I think we should remain attentive to downside risks   Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support the revised version of alternative B    I do want to emphasize, though, that I believe a strong case exists for further monetary stimulus    This case is amply demonstrated by the unconstrained optimal policy path in the Bluebook,        August 11–12, 2009 133 of 165  which shows the nominal federal funds rate continuing to ease over the next four quarters and   reaching negative 6 percent  Moreover, even in the unlikely circumstance that we are lucky   enough to get robust economic growth over the next few years, it will still be a long time before   the economy is operating close to full employment  And I found it striking that in none of the   alternative scenarios in the Greenbook, even including the most optimistic one, would the   Committee need to raise interest rates this year or in 2010   With regard to asset purchases, I would not argue for expanding our Treasury purchases    I think it would be unwise at this time  The bang for the buck from these purchases is probably   pretty small, and our program has had some unfortunate costs  It appears to be contributing to   the growing concern about high long-term inflation  Even though I don’t favor raising our   current target for Treasury purchases now, I consider it important that we avoid completely   closing the door on future Treasury purchases I would associate myself with Governor Kohn’s   comment that there could certainly come a time when the economic outlook worsens   considerably We shouldn’t rule out that possibility, and further long-term Treasury purchases   could, in that type of scenario, be needed to stimulate the economy, so we shouldn’t rule out the   use of that policy tool The revised version of alternative B keeps the option open  I think the   wording of the original version of B would be likely to be read as closing the door to future   purchases, and I don’t think we need the more explicit language in alternative B′ that says that   we are prepared to consider resuming purchases   With respect to MBS and agency purchases, I am in favor of preserving our optionality,   waiting to decide until closer to when the program comes to a conclusion in the same way that   we did with Treasuries Again, I wouldn’t want to take anything off the table at this point  If we   were to announce today either scaling back on the amounts we expect to purchase or announce           August 11–12, 2009 134 of 165  that we intend to end those programs, I think it would surprise markets and ratify expectations   that it won’t be too long before we start raising the funds rate  "
8599,2009-09-22," We could cut the interest rate we pay on reserves, and then it would be less likely   to lie fallow   Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’m much more optimistic about the nascent   recovery than I have been in a long while, and I no longer see the risks around my modal forecast   as asymmetrically skewed to the downside  Over the last few months, conditions in a wide   variety of financial markets have improved, and the economic news has been generally   encouraging Consumer spending appears to have bottomed out, and the inventory cycle, which   is typically a key element in the transition dynamics from contraction to expansion, is now   providing considerable impetus to activity  Even the housing and manufacturing sectors, which   were hardest hit during the recession, are finally showing signs of life  To my surprise, house   prices now appear to be reestablishing an upward trend  Like the Greenbook, we have revised up   our expectation for their future paths   The more positive outlook for home prices improves my confidence in the recovery for   several reasons First, the associated boost in housing wealth should have a favorable impact on   consumer spending  Second, stabilization in house prices will help put a floor on the value of   housing-related securities, which, in turn, should bring more clarity to the balance sheets of   banks and other financial institutions  And, finally, a positive trajectory in future home prices is   an essential element in changing the economics and the psychology of the housing market    Homeowners who were underwater, or close to it, are more likely to put off default and avoid   foreclosure if they have some renewed prospect for house-price appreciation  And potential   buyers who have been holding off waiting for the bottom in house prices may finally be coaxed   into the market  In effect, the feedback loop from financial conditions to the real economy may   finally be switching directions, supporting growth and even creating some upside risk        September 22–23, 2009 96 of 212  That said, there are also downside risks  In addition to all of the risks surrounding   commercial real estate, I’m concerned that some, and possibly a lot, of the improvement we’ve   seen in the housing sector may result from policy supports that are about to unwind; in particular   the first-time homebuyer tax credit, which is set to expire at the end of November, likely boosted   activity, although perhaps at the cost of pulling demand from future quarters  And our MBS   purchase program does appear to have lowered mortgage rates significantly  I was struck by the   survey evidence from the Desk of 60 basis points  Our own estimates are a full percentage point    There’s obviously a lot of uncertainty about what will happen when the program ends, but I   certainly found it sobering to see that the dealers surveyed by the Desk anticipate that the impact   of this program on mortgage rates will be fully reversed within six months   Even though I now believe that a recovery has taken hold and is likely to be sustained   into 2010, my perspective on policy is importantly influenced by my expectation that it will be   tepid by historical standards, leaving unemployment unacceptably high for a long time to come    Consistent with experiences around the world following recessions caused by financial crises, I   anticipate that it will take quite a while for the financial system to heal to the point that   something like normal credit flows can be restored  In addition, even if the saving rate stabilizes   and consumer spending again grows, we are not apt, given damaged household balance sheets   and weak labor markets, to see the exuberant spending growth that characterized the years   preceding the crisis  Moreover, I see a substantial chance that the saving rate will head higher   than in the Greenbook baseline Finally, I foresee a jobless recovery with weak employment   growth and persistently high unemployment  My business contacts uniformly report that they   have implemented productivity improvements in the downturn that will permit them to hold   down hiring until the recovery is very well entrenched     September 22–23, 2009 97 of 212  Turning to inflation, it will surprise no one around the table that I anticipate that the   prospect of high unemployment for years to come is a key factor shaping the outlook  We must,   of course, be attentive to the possibility that the NAIRU has changed, and, as I’ve noted in past   meetings, I do think there is some evidence that the NAIRU has increased  This round, the   Greenbook edged up the staff’s NAIRU estimate to 5¼ percent on a temporary basis, in light of   the large number of permanent layoffs taking place and a possible shift in the Beveridge curve  I   could quibble with these adjustments, but any fraction of a percentage point increase in the level   of the NAIRU pales in size relative to the 5 percentage point jump in the unemployment rate   over the past two years Under any reasonable interpretation of the evidence, both labor and   product markets have a considerable amount of slack  And the existence of a causal link   between slack and resource utilization and wage and price inflation is not only theoretically   sensible, it’s also consistent with both anecdotal and econometric evidence   To collect some anecdotal evidence, we asked all of our head office and branch directors   during the intermeeting period to provide us with their assessments of the extent of slack in their   industry or geographic area, and to tell us what, if any, effect such slack and other factors are   having and will have on their costs and output prices going forward  Not surprisingly, our   directors uniformly report that qualified job applicants are plentiful, that voluntary quits have   plummeted, and that workers are thankful to have jobs and are readily accepting lower wage   increases and even wage cuts On the price side, the directors report pervasive price-discounting    Almost uniformly they are badgering every supplier and vendor for price reductions, and these   negotiations are generally successful, with average price discounts on the order of 10 to   15 percent                 September 22–23, 2009 98 of 212  With respect to econometric evidence, my staff has kept our computers running overtime   estimating Phillips curves  They find that, so far in this recession, out-of-sample forecasts from a   simple backward-looking Phillips curve have been right on track in predicting the decline we   have seen in core PCE inflation over the past year  This model notably outperforms a random   walk or other empirical specifications that include inflation expectations and/or lagged inflation   but exclude slack It is not that the Phillips curve is perfect—far from it—and, at best, a slack   variable can account for only about 30 percent of the fluctuations in core inflation  But as Jim   Stock, Mark Watson, and other researchers have shown, it is the best empirical inflation   forecasting framework that we have   With respect to my inflation forecast, the basic empirical Phillips curve model predicts   substantial further disinflation In contrast, the Greenbook projects very modest disinflation in   core prices, under the assumption that inflation expectations will play an important role in   anchoring inflation around 2 percent  I, too, hope that inflation will not move much lower  But   there’s a lot we don’t know about how inflation expectations affect actual inflation and about   how to measure the expectations that are relevant for price setting  For example, our estimated   finance models indicate that many of the recent fluctuations in the break-even inflation rate   reflect movements in the inflation risk premiums and that inflation expectations have actually   drifted down over the past year We should, therefore, remain attentive to downside inflationary   risks   I understand that at our December meeting we will have an in-depth discussion of   inflation modeling and forecasting, and I look forward to that  At our last meeting, President   Stern aptly described the use of a Phillips curve to forecast inflation  He said, “It takes a model   to beat a model, and I don’t think we have another model in the short run”  And I agree     September 22–23, 2009 99 of 212  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I can support alternative B today, but I do so   reluctantly I think our asset purchases, especially our MBS purchases, have been successful in   lowering longer-term borrowing costs and supporting the housing sector and the broader   economy  In addition, I believe our toolkit to remove accommodation when the time comes is   ample  That said, I agree that further expansion of our MBS program entails some risks and   possible costs along with the benefits   Given the improvement in the economic outlook and in financial conditions since our last   meeting, I’m not prepared to argue for an expansion of the program today  But I strongly agree   with Vice Chairman Dudley and President Rosengren that we need to complete the full   $1¼ trillion in MBS purchases that markets now anticipate, and I’d like to do so in a manner that   is least disruptive to the mortgage market  I, therefore, favor striking the words “up to” in   alternative B Curtailing our purchases at this late stage in the program would likely push up   mortgage rates, and I believe it would be taken as a signal of an earlier exit from near-zero   interest rates than markets now consider likely                 September 22–23, 2009 149 of 212  In addition to removing the words “up to,” I would like to soften some of the language   concerning the timing and completion of the program  And, following President Rosengren’s   suggestion, I think we don’t need to announce a definite end date for the program at all, and I   would support his suggestion This would give added flexibility, I think, to the Desk in gearing   the timing of the phasedown to evolving marketing conditions  If we do end up giving a time   frame—Q1 or Q2—I would like to propose that we substitute the word “executed” for   “completed” in paragraph 3 of alternative B, in other words, to say that we anticipate that they   will be executed by, say, the end of the first quarter, or however that’s decided  I think that   substitution subtly distinguishes our characterization of the Treasury program, where we use the   term “completed,” from our MBS purchases  I believe that leaves the door slightly more open to   ramping up the pace of our purchases again, if the recovery does end up suffering a significant   setback and we face—Governor Tarullo, what was the name you gave the scenario?—   —a relapse scenario In that event, the balance of costs and benefits of   further MBS purchases could reverse So I do not want further expansion of MBS purchases or   other initiatives to be entirely off the table     Although I can agree to leave the size of our MBS program at $1¼ trillion today, I see a   strong case on policy grounds for further monetary stimulus  Core inflation is currently below   my price stability goal of about 2 percent, and the unemployment rate is well above my full   employment goal of about 5 percent  I anticipate a tepid recovery, but even if the recovery is   somewhat more robust, this situation will persist for many years   I am pretty sure that, if it were possible, we would at this point have taken the federal   funds rate into negative territory That would be consistent with our historical behavior, with        September 22–23, 2009 150 of 212  optimal policy calculations, such as those reported in the Bluebook, and with the guidance of   most policy rules Unfortunately, so far this year, the nominal funds rate has been fixed near   zero while core inflation has fallen So the real funds rate has risen  In this sense, monetary   policy has actually tightened this year, although circumstances—namely, the increase in   unemployment and decline in core inflation—seem to call for more monetary stimulus  Even   taking account of our large-scale asset purchases, I think the effective degree of easing, given the   dislocation in financial markets, likely has been modest relative to past recessions   I agree with President Plosser that communications are a logical device to use, and I think   the most obvious way to provide additional stimulus without further balance sheet expansion is   to use language designed to bring market expectations of the funds rate path into closer   alignment with the Greenbook path, thereby lowering medium-term rates  Market expectations   concerning the likely path of the funds rate have come down over the intermeeting period, but   there is still a gap between market expectations and the Greenbook path, which coincides with   my own preferred path To help narrow that gap, I propose replacing the language in paragraph   3 of alternative B with the language in paragraph 3 of alternative A  Specifically, I would   replace the vague phase “Economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of   the federal funds rate for an extended period” with the alternative phrasing stating that “The   Committee anticipates that low resource utilization and subdued inflation are likely to warrant   exceptionally low levels…”  This language would indicate to markets that the FOMC will not   raise rates merely on the basis of strong economic growth if, in fact, we are nowhere near   maximum sustainable levels of employment and activity and if inflation is subdued  It would   provide a conditional statement that would usefully inform the expectations of financial market   participants  I know that this phrasing will not appeal to those members of the Committee who              September 22–23, 2009 151 of 212  reject the notion that slack influences inflation  But it is consistent with the language of B that   already embraces the logic of such a linkage  "
8627,2009-11-03," Yes I just wanted to support that point  We were discussing this, and I   agree with President Rosengren’s comments I do think we should think about, if we stigmatize   this larger group of countries, what their response might be  For example, they might not feel so   happy about having unfettered capital flows or having subsidiaries or branches of US or   European-based multilateral banks in their countries  They might change the way in which they   supervise and regulate those operations, if they thought it was not automatic that they would get   access to dollar liquidity in the same way they did in this crisis   If I could just—this is the only thing I want to comment on—respond to President   Plosser’s comment on this, that ideally they have large stocks of reserves and we should want to   encourage them to use those reserves first before drawing on us  I am not sure that is actually   true I think that the distinction here is similar to the old one between inside and outside money    The reserves that they hold are equivalent to inside money  When they sell dollar reserves they   have in a crisis situation to provide liquidity to their banks, it is a propagation mechanism for   causing exchange rate movements and international transmission of the disturbances that they are   suffering In contrast, when we provide liquidity, we are printing money  We are adding to the   stock of outside money, and we circumvent those repercussions  So, in a crisis, the dynamics   aren’t the same  There is a good reason to have this kind of facility   You know, I don’t know what the right answer is, but I am worried about   restricting it to these four  President Bullard mentioned this concern as well, and I think   President Rosengren is suggesting one way to use criteria to maybe broaden the group  But I am   quite concerned about singling out these four and not making it larger  I understand there are   political issues around that and boundary problems and so forth  But I am concerned about   limiting it to these four  And there could be economic consequences  If you take a country like   Korea and you say, “Well, we are not putting you in the same category as before,” beyond what   they might do with our banks, they may decide they need an even larger war chest  They may be   more reluctant to have current account adjustments  It could have implications for—   Right   Thank you, Mr Chairman  I have been encouraged by the positive tone   of recent economic data and continued signs of healing in the financial system  Improvements in     November 3–4, 2009 84 of 201  the housing sector are particularly welcome because they contribute both to economic growth   and to mitigating the strains on the financial system  In the corporate bond market, risk spreads   have come down, and that should support business investment for those corporations with access   to market financing     However, these encouraging signs are marred by the persistently weak labor market and   stagnating wage income  In addition, my business contacts, too, report that bank credit   conditions remain tight, and most have reined in capital spending, limiting expenditures to   essential projects and those that promise immediate efficiency improvements  Finally, some of   the recent strength in housing and auto purchases results from temporary government programs    Overall, the recovery is shaping up as a long, difficult slog for several reasons, including the   extraordinary depth of the recession, the pressure on financial firms and households to repair   their balance sheets, and the zero bound’s considerable constraint on monetary policy   I find myself in agreement with the Greenbook’s assessment of the outlook for the   economy, but this is not an outcome that I find at all satisfactory, not with unemployment rising   to 10 percent this year and remaining above 8 percent through 2011 and inflation below desired   levels as far as the eye can see  That said, the most frightening downside risks to this forecast   have receded, and I now view the risks to the outlook as roughly balanced  Nevertheless, those   risks are considerable    On the upside, it is possible that consumers and businesses may be better able and more   willing to spend than I have given them credit for  Over the past several months, we have seen   improvements in a number of factors that pulled down consumer spending over the past year    These include uncertainty, consumer confidence, wealth, and credit availability  My staff has   estimated consumption-forecasting models that include these variables, and their preferred     November 3–4, 2009 85 of 201  specification generates a forecast for PCE growth over the next four quarters of around 5 percent   due to the improvement in those factors  Because the model misses other forces that are   restraining consumer spending, I haven’t adjusted my own baseline forecast up to nearly this   extent, but this analysis does highlight for me a potential upside risk to the outlook similar to the   V-shaped recovery discussed in the Greenbook   Counterbalancing this upside risk are some significant downside risks  Some of the most   worrisome ones also relate to consumer spending  In particular, the still-parlous state of   household balance sheets could restrain consumption more than is incorporated in the   Greenbook In the past, I have highlighted the potential drag on consumer spending that we may   see if households, to rebuild wealth and reduce leverage, boost their saving beyond the rather   modest rebound incorporated in the Greenbook forecast  The United States was one of many   countries to experience a massive increase in debt-to-income ratios followed by a severe housing   bust and a retrenchment in consumption  Interestingly, cross-country evidence reveals a   remarkably strong correlation between the increase of debt to income before the crisis and the   decline in real consumption once the crisis began  I recognize that correlation does not   necessarily imply causation, but this evidence provides a cautionary note that we may see   abnormally low consumer spending for some time   Another downside risk relates to the effect on the banking sector of further deterioration   in the commercial real estate market  As many of you have mentioned, the prospects for   commercial real estate have continued to deteriorate  We estimate that a significant share of   banks in our District will fail over the next five years as a consequence  In fact, we are   concerned that we now have a large number of already economically insolvent zombie banks   whose troubles may have seriously impaired their ability to extend credit to the businesses in           November 3–4, 2009 86 of 201  their communities  In addition, lenders are commonly asking borrowers either to repay loans or   to provide more equity to offset the erosion of real estate values  And given the very weak   conditions in commercial real estate, this situation sets the stage for further increases in   delinquencies and foreclosures This process could generate an adverse feedback loop akin to   that associated with residential real estate   So in summary, the economic outlook remains very uncertain, but I think the tail risks   and their associated costs have receded to the point that the risks for growth are now balanced   Turning to inflation, the basic story has not changed much since our last meeting  I   expect substantial slack in labor and goods markets to reduce core PCE price inflation from   about 1½ percent this year to 1 percent in 2010 and 2011  The risks to this forecast are roughly   balanced as well, but I am very concerned by the sharp deceleration we have seen in wages over   the past year, and that is a development that is echoed by comments from my directors  They   report that wages are flat or even slightly down, with no increases in sight   Against this backdrop of substantial slack, a key factor putting a floor on the decline in   the inflation rate is the public’s confidence that we will do whatever it takes to bring the   economy back from recession and keep inflation from falling too low  If we waiver from that   pledge and tighten too soon, confidence in our commitment to economic recovery and price   stability could be undermined, and that could be a recipe for an extended episode of disinflation   or even deflation like the one Japan suffered through  A commitment to low and stable inflation   involves defending the inflation objective on both the upside and the downside     A concern in this regard is the fact that implied forward rates from fed funds futures   contracts now suggest that market participants expect us to start raising rates as early as next   spring This assessment, however, depends critically on the assumption that term premiums and                      November 3–4, 2009 87 of 201  fed funds futures contracts are very low by historical standards—about 1 basis point per month    This assumption seems questionable, given evidence that historically these term premiums   appear to have varied considerably, and estimated risks and term premiums on a wide range of   assets are now quite elevated   My staff just recently completed the development of a new model of the term structure of   Treasury yields and has used it to back out estimates of expected future short rates and the term   premium on fed funds futures  They find that the term premium on fed funds futures has risen   substantially and is currently much higher than 1 basis point per month  The implication, in   contrast to the usual interpretation from futures, is that market participants currently expect a   relatively shallow path for the funds rate similar to that in the Desk’s primary dealer survey    These expectations exceed but are closer to my own views concerning the appropriate course of   policy given what we now know Of course, our policy decisions must depend on how economic   developments actually unfold  But if we signal a tightening of policy before it is justified by the   evolution of inflation and economic slack in the economy, perhaps partly out of concern that   market participants see us as getting behind the curve, we could upset confidence in our policies,   cause longer-term rates to rise, and end up in a more dangerous deflationary situation   I think the order of magnitude is about 3 or 4 basis points a month over   the next year or two    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I favor alternative B  With the funds rate   effectively constrained at zero and our large-scale asset-purchase programs nearing completion,   communication relating to the future path of policy is the main tool now available to shape market   expectations, influence longer-term interest rates, and thereby affect the overall degree of monetary   accommodation  For this reason, I think it’s important that we clearly communicate our goals and   policy strategy, and I very much like alternative B’s clear portrayal of the key factors that will guide   our future policy decisions consistent with our own past behavior—namely, resource utilization,   inflation trends, and inflation expectations  That’s not to rule out the possibility that some other   factors could play a role, but these have been the prime drivers in the past, and I think should and                 November 3–4, 2009 147 of 201  will be the prime drivers going forward  It is because I expect resource utilization—namely,   unemployment—to remain far above the NAIRU for a long time, for core inflation to be below my   preferred 2 percent objective, and inflation expectations to remain anchored that my own policy   expectations accord with the assumptions in the Greenbook and the constrained optimal policy path   in the Bluebook  Of course, we are in wait-and-see mode now  But at this critical juncture we need   to be very careful not to add to market confusion about what the main determinants will be of policy   going forward, and I fear that, if we are confusing, we may hinder recovery and the attainment of   price stability   I was pleased to see the additional language relating to our decision on agency debt in the   revised version of B  I think it’s very important to avoid leaving market participants with the   impression that our decision not to go up to the maximum of $200 billion reflects a shift in our   intended monetary policy path  And I would support President Rosengren’s suggestion that, if there   is an informal way to convey to market participants that this was a technical decision rather than a   policy decision, doing so would be useful   On the issue of asset sales, I also agree with Presidents Bullard and Lacker that we should   consider using asset sales as part of an exit strategy, especially if we think that the market for MBS   is beginning to normalize and function more effectively  I think, as we taper down our purchases   over the next couple of months, we’re going to get a much better sense of that  But if that’s a   properly functioning market, I also think it may make sense to begin to actually sell assets when—   this is a long way off—we finally exit  I would not necessarily assume that we’re only going to let   those run off our portfolio rather than sell them  "
8656,2009-12-15," Thank you, Mr Chairman  Since the last meeting I’ve made relatively   minor changes to my forecast for economic growth, unemployment, and inflation  I expect the   economy to grow only modestly over the next couple of years, with unemployment remaining   inordinately high and inflation running below my preferred rate for a very long time  Though   I’m not satisfied with this outlook, my concerns about the downside risks going forward have   continued to diminish since we met in November  A wide range of indicators shows   improvement interest rates have come down and equity prices have risen; consumer spending   has picked up; home sales have risen smartly; and the global recovery has gained traction   The positive signs we have seen are welcome, as economic activity has fallen so far   below where it ought to be There is, of course, some range of opinion on the extent of slack in   the economy  Some of my directors characterize it as very large  Others insist it is so massive   that we will end up with a lost generation of people whose skills and labor market attachment   atrophy from disuse In this context, the November employment report was clearly good news,              December 15–16, 2009 67 of 247  and it now seems quite likely that employment growth will soon head into positive territory  The   workweek and temporary employment, both harbingers of future job creation, have risen,   although as David noted, the JOLTS data suggest that hiring rates remain at an exceptionally low   level   It is sobering to realize, however, that we need an extended string of strong employment   reports for unemployment to fall in line with the Greenbook projection  In the Greenbook,   nonfarm payroll gains average about 260,000 jobs per month over 2010 and 2011, and this is still   enough only to lower the unemployment rate to a still elevated 8¼ percent by the end of 2011    As if the attainment of such gains weren’t enough of a challenge, we might need even larger job   creation to bring the unemployment rate down under a reasonable alternative to the Greenbook’s   assumption about labor force participation  The participation rate has fallen about a percentage   point since the recession began, and the Greenbook assumes that participation will fall a bit   more Historically, however, participation has been strongly cyclical, and if over the next year   the participation rate were to rebound by even half a percentage point, then we would need   another 12 million jobs, 100,000 more per month, just to achieve the same slow decline in the   unemployment rate   Last week I showed a forecast much like the Greenbook’s to my directors  Frankly, they   were incredulous Every single one of them thought we were overly optimistic about   employment  My contacts are more likely to be considering continued layoffs rather than any   substantial hiring Indeed, one of them said, “It’s become fashionable not to be hiring”    Businesses think that for the foreseeable future they can continue to meet sales demands with   productivity improvements  For the foreseeable future, their planning horizon appears very   short They remain shell-shocked and traumatized from recent events  A couple of them        December 15–16, 2009 68 of 247  emphasize that they’re making plans based on what they see over the next three to six months,   since they have little confidence looking beyond that horizon  So, even though my contacts   consistently see signs that demand is starting to recover, uncertainty remains high  They remain   focused on ensuring their survival and are hesitant to hire or invest beyond replacing essential   equipment   For smaller businesses especially, financing conditions also remain an impediment to   expansion Credit is available, but nonprice terms, including collateral requirements, are viewed   as onerous and unattractive This is yet another reflection of the pervasive fear that businesses   feel about making commitments that could come back to haunt them  Moreover, even with the   thawing we have seen in credit markets, events during the crisis have made firms keenly aware   that they can’t rely on financial market functioning  So at least some of my contacts plan to keep   more cash on their balance sheet permanently rather than deploying it   Of course, there are limits to the efficiency improvements that have boosted the aggregate   productivity figures so spectacularly, limits to how much firms can expand production without   adding employees or capital  So when businesses become more confident about the future, they   will eventually begin hiring in earnest and ramp up capital expenditures  The question is how   long it will be before this important element of confidence returns to our economy   The high degree of slack in labor markets is also making it harder to achieve what I view   as a desirable inflation rate of 2 percent for core PCE prices  We’ll talk much more about   inflation dynamics later in this meeting, but one theme of the papers prepared for that discussion   is how slack pushes down marginal cost, and we’ve certainly seen that in the data  According to   the employment cost index, compensation gains this year have been anemic, running   2 percentage points or so below their pre-recession rates, and the strength in productivity has           December 15–16, 2009 69 of 247  caused unit labor costs to fall markedly over the past year  These disinflationary forces working   through slack are at least partially offset by inflation expectations  According to most available   measures, inflationary expectations are reasonably stable at present   My staff regularly estimates a model that allows them to decompose the break-even   inflation rate from TIPS into inflation expectations and an inflation risk premium  Their   model-implied expectations for inflation have fluctuated in a relatively narrow range during the   last six months, although they are down noticeably at all horizons since the beginning of 2009    Inflation risk premiums, in contrast, have risen since the beginning of the year and are now in the   somewhat elevated range  These estimates are consistent with the anecdotes we hear concerning   the unusually large dispersion of opinion about the longer-term inflation outlook   All told, I agree with the Greenbook that the most likely outcome for prices is some   further disinflation  If this forecast proves accurate, I would expect uncertainty about the   inflation outlook to decline and the inflation risk premium to recede  The bottom line is that we   are faced with a situation in which inflation is undesirably low, and, even with large monthly   employment gains, the level of resource slack will remain high for an extended period  In my   forecast, the zero bound and the limits on unconventional policy constrain us from pursuing a   more desirable and more expansionary policy for some time to come   Thank you, Mr Chairman  I favor alternative B, but I would like to   emphasize something that I’ve said in the past  I continue to see a persuasive case for further   policy easing We are far below maximum sustainable employment, inflation is undesirably low,   and almost any version of the Taylor Rule, as well as the Bluebook’s optimal policy simulation,   recommends a negative setting for the federal funds rate at the present time  We need to remind   ourselves of this fact to counteract the very natural instinct to tighten policy as the economy   recovers It’s true that, if we had been free to lower the federal funds rate into negative territory,   it would probably be appropriate to start tightening in the not-too-distant future  But we were   constrained on the way down by the zero bound, and, in the face of that bound, systematic policy   calls for us to hold the federal funds rate near zero for a long time to come   Alternative B includes a paragraph addressing our special liquidity facilities  I do not   consider the proposed language very controversial, with one exception  I’m concerned about   phasing out TALF support for newly issued CMBS  I think it’s too soon to announce the   termination of that support  Outside of CRE lending, financial conditions have improved     December 15–16, 2009 105 of 247  considerably, and it’s appropriate to allow the other facilities to expire as scheduled  The   reaction should be minimal because few observers expect them to continue   In contrast, our decisions relating to the LSAP programs are important from a policy   perspective The question of whether or not to reinvest SOMA holdings as they mature is an   aspect of a broader policy decision concerning these programs  I do see some advantage to   allowing our agency-related holdings to run off  This is a mechanistic strategy, but it creates a   self-liquidating feature for our MBS portfolio—an exit strategy that shrinks our holdings over   time in a manner that will be predictable to markets, minimizing the possibility of abrupt   movements in yields that could result from further discretionary asset purchases or sales and   ongoing market speculation about our plans   I’m encouraged by the staff assessment that allowing our MBS holdings to run off is   likely to raise mortgage rates by only a few basis points  If so, I think the benefits of increased   predictability and a well-defined exit strategy will likely outweigh the small, albeit undesirable,   contractionary effects of permitting our MBS holdings to contract before we would ideally   withdraw stimulus My bigger concern is that we just don’t know what will happen to MBS   spreads and mortgage rates as we wind down our purchases over the next several months  Many   market participants expect rates to spike up considerably  And if that happens when the   economy is still very weak, and the housing markets remain fragile, I think we may need to   resume purchases    I agree with President Bullard that it’s important to preserve the flexibility to tailor LSAP   purchases and sales to emerging economic and financial conditions The final line in paragraph   3 states that our purchases are conditional on evolving conditions, and I consider that line to be   more than mere boilerplate  We will need to take that proviso seriously during the next few     December 15–16, 2009 106 of 247  meetings as we gain a better idea of how winding down our programs is affecting spreads and   yields In the meantime, it’s worth strategizing about whether there is any way for us to gear the   pace of purchases or sales to evolving conditions without targeting a specific mortgage rate and   without creating undue uncertainty and excess volatility in the markets   Actually, I was talking about paragraph 3  The same applies here  It’s   just that the time for putting together these deals is so long that to wait until anything close to   June to say “the facility is still available” is problematic   Thank you, Mr Chairman  I want first to thank the authors and   presenters for raising a host of important issues about inflation dynamics  Uncertainty about the   longer-run inflation outlook is quite high right now, and the extent of disagreement among   forecasters is quite large  Even so, as I read the papers I was asking myself if there were some   morals here for current policy  I identified three that emerged from the staff contributions and   the broader literature, and I just wanted to take a minute to highlight what I thought the policy   conclusions are   First, the papers and broader literature suggest a very strong theoretical rationale, and I   see significant empirical evidence, for the view that the level of economic activity matters to   inflation The general principle that very low levels of economic activity—whether they’re   measured by marginal costs as they are in the New Keynesian model, or by output gaps, capacity   utilization, or unemployment—cause inflation to fall is a common thread across a broad set of   macro models used for monetary policy analysis  As Jeff Fuhrer noted, without some connection   between real activity and inflation, these models just have no linkage between monetary policy   and inflation As Jeff noted, models with slack fit the inflation data reasonably well, and over   the past year Phillips curve type models do a pretty good job of explaining the decline we’ve   seen in core inflation This is a point that I made and President Evans made as well a couple of   meetings ago  Going forward, with marginal costs obviously very depressed and considerable              December 15–16, 2009 167 of 247  slack in evidence by any measure, these models predict continuing downward pressure on   inflation   A second clear policy takeaway from the literature and presentations is that, without   question, inflation expectations are an important determinant of inflation  And, as with slack,   there is considerable uncertainty about how to measure those expectations and about what   forecast horizon is relevant  But in the current situation, a wide range of inflation expectations   has been holding fairly steady, and I think the presentations suggest that well-anchored inflation   expectations should help to counter the disinflationary pressures arising from very low levels of   economic activity over the next couple of years  This is something that makes me less worried   that I otherwise would be about outright deflationary outcomes   The third policy conclusion to my mind is the one I want to emphasize the most  There is   obviously a great deal of uncertainty about the exact nature of the inflation process, and I   conclude that that’s something we have to take account of as we formulate monetary policy    There’s a large literature on optimal monetary policy under uncertainty, and it lays out several   key principles   The first is that there are relatively simple policies, and Taylor-type rules are a class of   them, an excellent example  These policies are robust in the sense that they work well across a   range of different models and degrees of difficulty in measuring gaps, and there is a very large   literature documenting this  As we know, the policy choices of this Committee have come   reasonably close to the predictions of some variant of the Taylor rule for the last several decades,   and, as the Bluebook indicates, most variants of Taylor-type rules currently indicate, as I said   before, that the funds rate should stay near zero for a long time        December 15–16, 2009 168 of 247  A second principle of optimal policy under uncertainty is that policy should be   formulated to guard against particularly undesirable outcomes, and this principle to my mind   suggests we should stay at the zero bound for an extended period because we can easily raise   rates, but it’s hard to lower them   A third principle is that policy responses to different economic indicators should depend   on the quality of the signals they are sending about the state of the economy  And in the current   situation, the level of unemployment and the degree of slack in the labor market that we see is so   enormously large by every measure that it is sending a strong signal now, and that’s something   that we should be responding to  "
8684,2010-01-26,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Let me begin with the discount rate  I   support the staff recommendation for normalizing terms on primary credit as well as the TAF   proposals  My main concern is that the message of liquidity normalization could be   misinterpreted as a message of monetary tightening, so I think it is critical that we be clear that   this is an action that is essentially a technical adjustment reflecting better market functioning  I   strongly urge you to proceed as you indicated you would in floating this in testimony  If you   have multiple occasions to do it, that’s good   In terms of timing, to me what would be natural is for the Board to take this action at our   next meeting and to make it part of our next statement  But I could support doing it at an earlier,   January 26–27, 2010 50 of 260    intermeeting, time  I would hope that all of the Reserve Banks would recommend this action   because I think, if we all did it together, it would be clearer that the move is intended as a   normalization of the operation of the window   Okay  Next, let me turn to the seven questions on exit strategy, and I am sorry, I   probably won’t be as brief as you would like  [Laughter]    So I apologize for that  I just want to comment briefly on the last   question, number 7 first—it has to do with long-run strategy—because I think, as my remarks on   the other questions will indicate, some of our decisions on our exit strategy should depend on our   longer-run operating framework  I think we still have time to debate that framework, but it   would be helpful to reach consensus before we begin raising our short-term interest rate target   That said, let me summarize my views on asset sales and reserve-draining operations  I   will begin with questions 1 and 2 on asset sales  My preference there is for option 3,   redemptions only, lasting for a period that would probably take us until the end of this year  My   strong preference is for a mechanistic strategy to shrink our holdings over time  I think a   mechanistic approach provides predictability to markets, minimizing ongoing speculation about   our plans and the possibility that abrupt yield movements could result from discretionary asset   purchases or sales  A decision to shed assets in a predictable way would not preclude some   future adjustments in the pace of runoff, as long as we don’t revisit our decisions too frequently    We might reconsider this issue, say, on an annual basis   If we do adjust the path later on, I see some merit in switching to option 2, a gradual and   predictable schedule of sales, and we do that only when we are confident that the recovery is   well established and the MBS market is functioning normally  I see no great urgency for us to   January 26–27, 2010 51 of 260    shrink our balance sheet very quickly, but the pure runoff strategy does saddle us with a very   large balance sheet and very substantial MBS holdings for an awfully long time  A more rapid   pace of convergence has its attractions   On the alternative strategy of a state-contingent path of asset purchases and sales, I want   to say that President Bullard’s memo made a very logical case for that approach, and there are   some distinct attractions  Adding a new policy lever to our toolkit has a lot of appeal  In the   final analysis, though, I think the risks of using asset purchases and sales for fine-tuning   purposes outweigh the rewards  We are uncertain of the effects of all our policy actions on the   economy; but in the case of asset sales and purchases, the uncertainty is tremendous  That makes   it hard for us to develop a sensible state-contingent rule and an order of magnitude harder yet for   markets to understand how we will respond to incoming data  The potential for misinterpretation   and disruption is, therefore, quite large     In addition, my response to question 5 is that I don’t favor including holdings of either   MBS or agency debt in the SOMA portfolio in the long run because of the political risks relating   to our involvement in the housing market and the associated dangers of using our portfolio   allocation to influence the supply of credit to the housing sector  So the bottom line is that I   view our MBS and agency debt program as akin to the liquidity facilities that we started up in the   time of crisis to address market dislocation and the exceptional policy constraints associated with   the zero bound  We have phased those facilities out as market function has normalized, and I   think we should do the same with our MBS and agency debt program—phase it out when we can   do so without creating economic disruption  Now, I have previously argued that we should keep   our options open for further purchases if the outlook worsens or if market functioning   January 26–27, 2010 52 of 260    deteriorates noticeably when our purchases cease in March  But as with the liquidity facilities, I   believe the bar for further purchases should be quite high   Question 2 concerns the specifics of redemption strategies, and my view here is that I   would redeem all agency and MBS holdings, but I might be inclined to roll over the Treasuries,   because the market expects it and we are currently below steady-state levels   Turning to question 3 on reserve draining, I am actually not particularly drawn to any of   the strategies that were presented by the staff for consideration  Their main purpose is to make   sure that the Desk can achieve a Committee-determined funds rate target and to push the funds   rate up, so that trading is at or slightly above the IOER rate  But I am just not convinced that this   really matters for the monetary transmission mechanism or that it is crucial to building market   confidence that we can withdraw monetary accommodation  I continue to believe that an   increase in the IOER rate will suffice to tighten financial conditions, and this will be true   whether the funds trade below or above the IOER rate  I see no particular reason why it matters   a lot if the Desk can hit a precise funds rate target although, admittedly, we won’t look very   competent if the Desk proves itself unable to carry out the FOMC’s instructions  So we do need   to avoid that situation, and one way would be for the Committee to retain a target range for the   federal funds rate as we raise the IOER rate and withdraw accommodation   For example, when tightening begins, we could raise the IOER rate to ½ percent and set a   target range for the funds rate from, say, ¼ to ½ percent  We could publicly explain that we   expect the funds rate to trade persistently below the IOER rate and that, given the idiosyncrasies   of that market in the presence of such large reserve balances, the fund rate has become less   indicative of short-term money market conditions overall  I prefer this approach to the three staff   alternatives  Our decisions on this issue will be easier if we can decide on a longer-term   January 26–27, 2010 53 of 260    operating strategy reasonably soon  If we decide on a longer-run operating strategy that   deemphasizes the funds rate as a target, there will be a lot less reason to worry about the need to   drain reserves now to improve the Desk’s control of it   I read the international evidence as indicating that many central banks use alternative   short rates as targets, and some, like the Bank of England, employ a policy rate similar to our   IOER rate to communicate the stance of policy  Most appear to operate a corridor system with   large reserves quite successfully  So jumping ahead to question 6, my answer is that I am not   wed to the funds rate as a target, and I see merit in replacing it with a policy rate like the IOER   instead of a market rate  Governance issues, though, do give me some pause, because it is not   FOMC-determined  If we decide to move in that direction, the case for draining reserves   through reverse repurchase agreements and term deposits does not seem very persuasive  If we   instead decide to stick with the key role for the fed funds rate in our longer-run operating   strategy, the benefits of draining reserves may be larger  But there are also costs, and the main   one relates to communications, and this is Governor Kohn’s point  I think it will be very   challenging to communicate that a large draining operation, which is what we need, is merely   technical and does not mark the beginning of an exit from policy accommodation  That will be   especially true if it succeeds in pushing up the federal funds rate toward IOER   So if we do drain reserves, I would be inclined to wait until we are almost ready to raise   short-term rates, perhaps when we change the “extended period” language  Those actions would   then jointly signal that a tightening is imminent  An alternative would be to begin draining soon   and communicate that the purpose is technical, emphasizing that it doesn’t mark the beginning of   an exit from accommodation  But I think such communications will be very challenging,   January 26–27, 2010 54 of 260    especially if the operations are large and push up the fed funds rate  And I think that’s a much   more dangerous approach    Thank you, Mr Chairman  My views on the outlook have changed   remarkably little during the intermeeting period in spite of incoming data prompting us to revise   up substantially our estimate of last quarter’s GDP growth  As the Greenbook emphasizes, that   upward revision mainly reflects a dramatic reduction in the pace of inventory liquidation  While   it’s heartening that inventory overhangs are no longer such a major drag on the economy, I   would be more reassured if the surprise had reflected unexpected strength in final sales  Instead,   both my retail contacts and the incoming data suggest that the holiday shopping season was   lackluster, even though tight inventory management made it far more profitable than 2008    Moreover, businesses are still very cautious about capital spending   Going forward, we anticipate moderate growth in the first half of this year, similar to the   Greenbook, and see this forecast as consistent with recent data  I expect real GDP growth to   January 26–27, 2010 136 of 260    strengthen over time, rising from about 3½ percent this year to about 4½ percent in 2011 and   2012  This forecast is predicated on strong private demand coming on line as the impetus to   growth from fiscal stimulus fades away later this year  Private demand seems likely to pick up   as financial conditions ease further with higher equity prices, narrower risk spreads, and   improved bank credit supply   The risks to this forecast appear fairly evenly balanced  On the upside, it is possible that   history will repeat itself  Every previous deep postwar recession has been followed by faster   growth than I expect this time  Post-recession booms commonly reflect a spurt of pent-up   demand, and we could see such a snapback if, for example, households and businesses postponed   spending during the period of greatest economic uncertainty and now feel more secure and ready   to open their wallets  So far such a scenario doesn’t square with information from my contacts,   but it remains a plausible risk  On the downside, although my economic growth forecast is   similar to the Greenbook, it’s strikingly optimistic relative to most private-sector forecasters    About 90 percent of private-sector growth projections, including those in the Blue Chip sample,   predict weaker growth than I do  My optimism may not be justified if, for example, credit   constraints are more persistent than expected, perhaps fed by mounting commercial real estate   losses at banks  Also, the fallout on households from foreclosures could be more severe than I   anticipate   Turning to the labor market, I expect unemployment to remain painfully high for years,   edging down to 9½ percent by the end of this year and 8¼ percent by the end of 2011  However,   if last year is any guide, then this forecast is especially uncertain because the big surprise in 2009   was the steep rise in the unemployment rate  For example, the median FOMC projection for last   January was a very accurate guide to real GDP growth and core and overall inflation in 2009    January 26–27, 2010 137 of 260    For these three variables, our median forecast error was inside the one standard-error bands that   we published based on past projection errors  The fly in the ointment was the median FOMC   forecast for the 2009 unemployment rate, which was off by 1½ percentage points, an error of   three standard deviations  A three-sigma annual forecast error should come along about once   every 400 years    Clearly, something went seriously off track  What went off track last   year was Okun’s law, the usually reliable empirical relationship between output and the   unemployment rate that underlies most macroeconomic forecasts  Based on actual real GDP   growth in 2009, Okun’s law would have predicted an unemployment rate of just over 8 percent   by the end of last year, much lower than the 10 percent we got   So how can Okun’s law be reconciled with the output and unemployment data for 2009?    First, the NAIRU may have risen, as President Plosser suggested, so that the currently reported   unemployment rate is essentially too high  This is also the Greenbook’s solution to the puzzle    The Greenbook assumes that extended unemployment benefits are temporarily boosting the   effective NAIRU to 6¼ percent, and certainly a higher NAIRU could be part of the story  But   my staff continues to find little underlying evidence that the NAIRU has jumped up enough to   close the gap  For example, exit rates from long-duration unemployment have behaved much as   they typically do over the business cycle  The same is true for other labor variables, such as   labor force participation and hours per worker  Indeed, the fact that labor force participation was   not elevated last year is hard to square with the notion that large numbers of people are staying in   the labor force just to get extended unemployment benefits   January 26–27, 2010 138 of 260    Instead, the lion’s share of the deviation from Okun’s law in 2009 reflects a surge in   labor productivity  Higher productivity allowed output to stay flat last year while employment   dropped and the unemployment rate shot well up past our forecasts  It is always difficult to   discern to what extent movements in productivity over a single year are temporary or permanent    However, some evidence supports the view that a significant portion of this jump in productivity   growth may be permanent  If so, then potential output last year grew much faster than typically   estimated as, for example, in the Greenbook and the chart that Dan distributed to us   Faster growth in potential last year and the resulting wider output gap would help   reconcile Okun’s law with the data  This resolution of the puzzle is hard to square with historical   evidence suggesting that financial crises commonly lower the equilibrium level of output   because adverse shocks to financial intermediation require significant real adjustments in the   economy that can lower the equilibrium level of output  However, the hypothesis that the   breakdown of Okun’s law reflects a higher level of potential and a wider output gap is consistent   with labor and productivity data  I also consider it consistent with the anecdotal reports from my   contacts  They uniformly think that the productivity gains they have put in place are permanent   and not the result of an unsustainable spurt of effort  Furthermore, although the low-hanging   fruit of productivity improvements seems to have been picked, there is widespread optimism for   further gains, albeit at a slower pace  Indeed, with opportunities for increasing output through   productivity gains going forward, many businesses remain very cautious about hiring   Finally, let me note that my resolution of the Okun’s law puzzle has implications for my   inflation forecast  The breakdown in Okun’s law reflects the difference between the labor-side   and the product-side measures of economic slack, with the labor measures suggesting more slack   than the output measures  Essentially, I see a rise in the effective level of potential output as at   January 26–27, 2010 139 of 260    least as important a factor in reconciling Okun’s law as a rise in the effective NAIRU  This puts   the effective amount of slack in the economy higher than in the Greenbook and may argue for   lower inflation going forward  Indeed, my forecast for core inflation runs a bit below the   Greenbook over the next few years    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I favor alternative B  As I’ve said in the   past, I’d be very surprised if we need to start tightening policy this year  So “extended period”   still seems appropriate to me  The economy is clearly operating far below maximum sustainable   employment, and inflation is undesirably low  The Bluebook policy simulation shows that it will   be well into 2011 before policy would optimally be tightened   On the issue in alternative B of whether to refer to securities holdings or purchases, my   strong preference, too, is for purchases  A switch to holdings now, while we are still purchasing   securities, would certainly suggest that we are contemplating sales, and I consider that quite   premature  As I indicated yesterday, I could eventually envision a program of gradual sales, but   that would occur once the recovery is well established and we are finally ready to start tightening   policy  "
8707,2010-03-16,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  My answers to the four questions reflect my   overriding conviction that there’s no case at present to tighten monetary policy, and for this   reason I don’t favor redeeming Treasuries at this time  I could eventually see doing that  I see   Treasury redemptions as a modest tightening of policy in two respects  First, an announcement   of Treasury redemptions would likely be perceived by markets as an indication that we’re close   to raising the policy rate, and I think we saw just such a communication hazard with the   March 16, 2010 28 of 146    renormalization of the discount rate  Second, any direct effect from our asset purchases that   lowered Treasury yields would presumably be reversed through redemptions  Indeed, I think a   case could be made for maintaining the status quo, which would preserve the current duration of   the SOMA portfolio and provide the maximum downward pull on longer-term yields and   mortgage rates  But that said, I think there are benefits to reducing SOMA interest rate risk  So I   could certainly support option 3 which would involve reinvestment into bills and two- or three-  year notes  I also support the current approach of not reinvesting agency securities  Of course,   that is also a marginal tightening of policy, but it is offset by the benefit of moving us more   rapidly towards the Treasury-only portfolio   On the reserve collateral accounts, I think the staff has done a lot of good work, but I   have to say I share some of the concerns that have been expressed by others here  I am worried   about introducing a facility that’s geared solely to overcoming legislative restrictions on the   GSEs’ ability to earn interest, and I share the concern that, by expanding to such a great extent   trading reserves outside the brokered fed funds market, we can end up undermining the   functioning of the brokered fed funds market  I think that, especially when reserves are so large,   the consequences for the behavior and volatility of the effective fed funds rate really concern me    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll organize my remarks on the current   economic situation around the three explicit qualifiers we’ve used to condition the “extended   period” language for  our policy statement, namely, low rates of resource utilization, subdued   inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations   Beginning with resource utilization, my assessment of both the current situation and the   likely future path has changed very little during the intermeeting period  I continue to anticipate   only moderate economic growth and an extended period of substantial underutilization of   resources  The boost from the inventory cycle appears largely over, and the growth contribution   from fiscal stimulus is waning, but improvements in exports, consumer spending, and business   investment should support moderate real GDP growth this year  Given the extraordinary depth   of the recession, I expect it will be a very long time before the economy returns to its potential,   and my own economic growth forecast exceeds the pace my business contacts consider plausible   in light of the pervasive caution about spending that they see among their customers and business   associates  The latest labor market reports have been a bit more favorable than expected,   especially given the unseasonably bad weather; but even so, as I stressed at the January meeting,   labor market readings paint an even bleaker picture of underutilization than product-side   measures   During the intermeeting period, the housing sector has emerged anew as an area of   concern  It now appears to be bumping along the bottom, which is consistent with our   March 16, 2010 56 of 146    expectation that residential investment will not play its traditional key role in moving the   economy during the early stages of recovery  This stalling out of the hoped-for recovery in   residential real estate is disappointing, and my concern is compounded by the continued   deterioration we’re seeing in the performance of residential mortgages, suggesting that   foreclosures will weigh on prices going forward  The good news is that mortgages issued in   2009 are now performing relatively well as they age in comparison with previous vintages  But   older vintages continue to perform very poorly due to past declines in house prices and high   levels of unemployment   Some observers have been heartened by the fact that the share of mortgages 30 to 89 days   past due has declined recently  Unfortunately, analysis by my staff of loan-level data reveals this   decline actually represents a worsening of mortgage market conditions  The decline in 30- to 89-  day delinquencies does not reflect an increase in the “cure rate,” which is the fraction of   delinquent borrowers becoming current  Instead, it reflects a faster transition of delinquent   mortgages to even poorer performance status  The data for January of this year appear to   confirm that conditions are continuing to worsen  I, therefore, anticipate that the share of loans   that is seriously delinquent will keep moving higher, generating further increases in the pace of   foreclosures  I fear, too, that we have had a temporary reprieve in new foreclosures due to the   ramping up of the government’s trial modifications, but only a small share of these modifications   will stick  All in all, the prospects of further additions to the already very large inventory of   vacant homes represents downside risk to home prices and new home construction   Let me now turn to the second economic condition underlying the policy guidance, a   subdued inflation trend  Since the start of the recession, core PCE price inflation has fallen   12 percentage points  In joint work with staff at the New York Fed—and I see that Bill has   March 16, 2010 57 of 146    distributed a picture that my staff has also been working on—they find that this decline reflects   diffusion across many categories of spending  I won’t go into too much detail, because I think   Bill is going to talk about this  But one point I wanted to make is that, while the deceleration in   shelter costs certainly has contributed to the disinflation, that deceleration is not entirely due to   rents and the imputed costs of owner-occupied housing  An important reason for it is that there   has been a sharp decline in lodging away from home, and that reflects something quite different,   which is a real contraction of tourism and travel  I think, as Bill is going to discuss, what we see   here is broad disinflation across many categories of spending  Furthermore, with various   measures of utilization still showing significant margins of slack, I expect the downward trend in   inflation to continue   The third economic condition in our “extended period” statement—namely, that of stable   expectations—is probably the most challenging to assess, and many measures of inflation   provide somewhat mixed signals  I think if we look at measures over the next five years, almost   all measures have fallen on balance since the start of the recession  However, for the five-year   forecast horizon five years ahead, I think survey measures have edged up a bit  Break-even   inflation rates, in contrast, are about where they were two years ago, and my staff’s finance   model, which accounts for shifts in inflation risk premiums, puts inflation expectations well   below their pre-recession levels  So when I take everything together, I would judge that inflation   expectations remain reasonably well anchored, despite considerable turmoil and uncertainty that   has afflicted our economy over the recent past   All in all, my bottom line is that the three economic conditions we have explicitly   attached to our “extended period” statement are still satisfied, and when we get to the policy go-  March 16, 2010 58 of 146    around, naturally I’m going to conclude that the economic outlook continues to support the use   of that language for a forward-looking policy guide    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I favor alternative B, and I would exclude the   bracketed sentence which is arguably redundant, given the last sentence of paragraph 2  The   economy is clearly operating far below maximum sustainable employment, and inflation is   undesirably low  Under these circumstances, I see no case now for tightening monetary policy,   and this includes any additional language that would trigger changes in market expectations   about the pace of tightening  I found it striking that none of the alternative scenarios in the   Greenbook have an increase in the funds rate this year  Furthermore, I believe that the risks   associated with tightening prematurely still exceed those resulting from tightening too late   I think we’ve been quite clear that the promise of low rates is not unconditional or   calendar-dependent  Rather it depends on explicit economic conditions, including “low rates of   resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations,” conditions that   still prevail  I think this guidance does not bind future policy to the mast  Rather it helps inform   our passengers of the likely direction of the journey, and that type of communication facilitates   the transmission of policy   It’s true that the “extended period” statement isn’t explicitly conditioned on   developments in asset and credit markets, and I agree with President Hoenig and with the   March 16, 2010 95 of 146    comments of the Chairman and Governor Tarullo that we should be considering the possibility   that our monetary policy could foster the emergence of new financial imbalances, and that we   should be monitoring financial markets closely  But I would just say at this point that I, too, do   not see evidence that excessive investor risk-taking has developed  As supervisors, we have   potent regulatory tools at our disposal to address these risks, and I believe that we need to use   them to ensure that financial imbalances do not emerge   At this point in the cycle, with exceptionally high unemployment and very low inflation, I   believe our policy actions should focus squarely on our mandate for price stability and full   employment  "
8731,2010-04-27,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  The issues of asset sales and Treasury   redemptions present the Committee with difficult policy and communications issues  I found the   Board’s staff memos also very helpful in clarifying the key issues and quantifying the potential   effects of the various options   I want to emphasize at the outset that, like President Rosengren, I feel, given the outlook   for economic activity and inflation, that there is no case at present to tighten monetary policy,   and asset sales and even the announcement of future asset sales will entail some policy   tightening  The Board memo shows this clearly  For this reason I don’t share the urgency to   initiate asset sales any time soon  I’m not at all convinced that the size of our balance sheet   creates unacceptable inflation risks through an impact on inflation expectations, and I don’t see a   compelling need to shift the composition of our portfolio back toward Treasuries-only on an   extremely rapid time table   Nonetheless, I do recognize the concerns around this table about our balance sheet, and   for that reason, I’m open to strategies involving asset sales and Treasury redemptions to shrink   our balance sheet more rapidly than the staff’s option 1 and to shift its composition more quickly   toward Treasuries if we can do that without having a significant negative impact on macro   performance   If we do plan to sell assets, I think the memo makes a compelling case for conditionality   as in options 2 and 3, namely, waiting to initiate any asset sales until after the time arrives when   April 27–28, 2010 29 of 206                   we want to remove monetary policy accommodation  Between these I strongly favor option 2,   although I’ll admit that, on paper, option 3 is the more attractive of the two strategies  By   initiating policy tightening through asset sales rather than an increase in the IOER rate, option 3   brings down our MBS portfolio more rapidly  Conditioning the pace of future sales on economic   and financial developments and allowing future purchases if economic conditions deteriorate   creates the possibility of improved macro performance, especially if downside risks materialize   But, in practice, I’m fearful that the implementation of option 3 presents insurmountable   communications challenges  First of all, logically, a decision to sell off assets before we raise   the IOER rate implies an even longer period of exceptionally low rates and a more gradual pace   of tightening once the IOER rate is raised than markets now anticipate  I worry that an   announcement now of the intent to sell assets prior to raising short-term rates would have exactly   the opposite impact on market expectations  Second, we would have to communicate that we are   entirely open to further purchases when many Committee members are actively voicing concerns   about our holdings, and even those who are supportive have indicated that the bar for further   purchases would be very high  With respect to interest rates, there’s a long track record upon   which the public can base expectations, but for asset sales we have no such track record, and   market participants would be constantly guessing about our new asset sales reaction function  I   fear that such an approach would create greater market volatility and uncertainty as markets   react—and almost invariably overreact—to every word we say  So unfortunately, I think these   communications problems outweigh the potential benefits of this approach   Although I do not see an economic case to tighten policy now—and the announcement of   future asset sales will tighten policy—I could still support a plan to sell assets structured along   the lines of option 2  If we agree to this plan, our communications could be either in the minutes   April 27–28, 2010 30 of 206                   or in the FOMC statement, and I’m open to both approaches  If we were to decide to include it   in the statement, the illustrative language in the staff memo for option 2 provides a way to do it,   but I would be quite concerned about including as much detail about quantities and timing  I   think that’s quite premature, and intervening economic developments could cause us to change   our plans about quantities and timing  So I would be inclined, if we include something in the   statement, to say only something like this  “The Committee anticipates that some time after   raising its interest rate target it will initiate gradual sales of agency debt and MBS,” and then go   on to say that “the Committee will adjust the timing and sequencing of these steps as necessary   to promote economic recovery and price stability”   On the issue of redeeming Treasuries, I see this potentially as another way to address   concerns around the table about the size of our balance sheet, and for that reason I could support   a decision to redeem Treasuries  It would, I think, demonstrate to markets that the FOMC is   committed to shrinking our balance sheet over time, and it would mitigate some of the interest   rate risk we face   But I also have concerns about a decision to redeem Treasuries, and I see no urgency at   all to move on this today or tomorrow  I said at our last meeting that I view Treasury   redemptions as a modest tightening of policy in terms of its effects on interest rates  More   important, it would be an unexpected shift in policy, and it could move forward market   expectations about the timing of asset sales and an increase in the target funds rate  Redeeming   Treasuries doesn’t help move the composition of the SOMA away from agencies, it’s unlikely to   obviate the need to deploy reserve-draining tools, and it probably isn’t the strategy we would   adopt if we wanted to rebalance the duration structure of our Treasury holdings    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I, too, have been heartened by recent data   indicating that the recovery has picked up steam and that the labor market may finally have   turned the corner  These are very welcome signs that make me more comfortable with my   forecast of a moderate recovery  In contrast, the very low recent readings on core inflation raise   the worrisome prospect of continued disinflation   My outlook is similar to the Greenbook’s  The continuing improvement in financial   conditions, the rebuilding of household and business confidence, and recovery abroad, especially   in Asia, should contribute to solid economic growth over the next few years  I expect real GDP   to increase about 3½ percent this year, and roughly 4½ percent next year  My forecast hasn’t   changed much since January, with upside surprises about offsetting those to the downside    Consumer spending and business investment in equipment and software have rebounded more   quickly than I had anticipated  Indeed, the Tech Pulse Index compiled at the San Francisco Fed,   which measures activity in the IT sector, grew at a blistering 35 percent annual rate in the first   quarter, after racking up a 32 percent gain in the fourth quarter of last year   But the worsening of already severe budget problems at the federal, state, and local levels   implies less support for growth from government going forward  Conditions in commercial real   estate have deteriorated more than expected, and, of course, the situation in Europe poses   significant downside risks  Labor markets also remain depressed, and the pace of recovery will   not return the economy to full employment for several years  I expect the unemployment rate   will end this year about 9¼ percent, and next year at about 8 percent   I see the risks to my forecast for economic activity as balanced  On the downside, I   continue to worry that the household debt overhang could crimp spending more than I or the   Greenbook have assumed  Admittedly, the recent retail sales data do suggest that the much-  April 27–28, 2010 107 of 206                   heralded rediscovery of thrift may have had a pretty short run  [Laughter]  But this spending   surge might also reflect a transitory burst of pent-up demand rather than a sustained upward shift   in the pace of consumer spending  My business contacts report that consumers remain focused   on necessities and are trading down based on price  The household debt overhang could weigh   on consumers for some time, as in the weaker consumption alternative scenario reported in the   Greenbook  And in that scenario, the unemployment rate doesn’t fall below 9 percent until 2012   On the upside, overall financial conditions have improved dramatically over the past   year  If this trend continues, we could see a much more rapid recovery than I expect  The stock   market is up more than 40 percent in the past year  And, despite the severity of the recession,   spreads on corporate debt relative to Treasuries have narrowed to levels seen after the much   more modest 2001 recession  Favorable terms have buoyed bond issuance in both the   investment-grade and high-yield categories   Yet, despite the substantial improvements in stock and bond markets, overall financial   conditions are not particularly conducive to growth  For example, despite the huge rebound in   stock prices, the S&P 500 price-to-earnings ratio is only about 20, below its longer-run average    Other measures of asset prices and market conditions are generally within normal ranges    Financial conditions indexes that attempt to aggregate a broad array of factors indicate that,   overall, recent conditions have been only slightly positive  These financial measures contrast   starkly with the stance of monetary policy as measured by the real federal funds rate, which is in   negative territory   Importantly, loans remain hard to get and expensive for businesses, which hits borrowers   who don’t have access to bond and equity markets particularly hard  My business contacts   continue to complain that banks apply stringent credit standards, depress loan-to-value ratios,   April 27–28, 2010 108 of 206                   and impose high collateral requirements  One contact pointed out that because smaller   businesses frequently use real estate as collateral for loans, the fall in commercial property   values is depressing loan commitment amounts  Although my banker contacts adamantly deny   they are tightening standards per se, they admit they are scrutinizing loans more closely and   refusing to make exceptions to their standards, which effectively makes it harder for businesses   to get loans  One banker described it as a “trust but verify” approach  You will recall that that   was how Ronald Reagan described his arms control policy toward the Soviet Union  These   statements are consistent with the evidence from the April Senior Loan Officer Opinion survey   that indicates that, although banks are not ratcheting standards tighter, they’re also not yet   unwinding the tightened standards they have put into place over the past few years   My staff has been examining the terms that banks are setting on loans using data from the   Federal Reserve’s Survey of Terms of Business Lending  The main finding is that, for loans   with repricing intervals of less than one year, lending rate spreads over the fed funds rate were   about 50 basis points above normal in the first quarter of this year  This analysis controls for   loan characteristics, including borrowers’ credit risk and lender fixed effects  Interestingly, loan   spreads were about 25 basis points below normal from 2005 through mid-2007  Banks’ financial   conditions, including loan portfolio quality and supervisory rating, were found to influence loan   pricing, suggesting that these spreads may remain elevated for some time   In summary, although overall financial conditions have improved and are no longer a   sizable drag on the economy, they are also not an impetus for robust growth  Favorable   conditions in money and bond markets are being offset by tight terms and conditions on bank   loans  Of course, these developments need to be followed closely both in terms of how they   affect the outlook and for signs of imbalances that could threaten financial stability   April 27–28, 2010 109 of 206                   Turning to inflation, the very low recent readings on core measures of inflation are   disconcerting  Based on the Greenbook estimate, core PCE prices rose 13 percent over the   12 months through March, and the most recent data show a marked downward trend  As I   mentioned at our last meeting, these declines in core inflation are broad-based, with weakness in   housing costs accounting for only about a half a percentage point of the roughly 1½ percentage   point decline in core PCE price inflation we’ve seen since the peak in 2008  I expect core PCE   prices to rise a little less than 1 percent this year, and to rise 1 percent next year  Measures of   labor compensation are very weak, and the economy’s substantial slack will continue to weigh   on inflation  Fortunately, inflation expectations remain well anchored, which should temper any   further fall in inflation  Nonetheless, given all of the prevailing uncertainties, I am not that   confident in this forecast and see both upside and downside risks along the lines of the   alternative scenarios in the Greenbook    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I favor alternative B  While it’s good news   that economic growth is picking up, we’re climbing out of a very deep hole  The economy is   operating far below maximum sustainable employment, and inflation is undesirably low  Like   the Greenbook, I expect both sets of circumstances to persist for several years  It does not make   sense to tighten just because we are beginning to move in the right direction  Policy must take   into account the enormous gap that exists between where we are and where we ought to be    These gaps explain why the Bluebook’s optimal policy path and, as you noted, Mr Chairman,   rule-based recommendations almost without exception call for the funds rate to remain at zero   for quite a long time   April 27–28, 2010 144 of 206                   There is one exception in the rule-based recommendations, and that is the difference rule,   which, according to the Bluebook, would raise rates in response to more rapid economic growth    But the computation reported in the Bluebook takes no account of the fact that we have been   constrained from cutting rates in line with the rule as conditions deteriorated  Taking the zero-  bound constraint into account, even a difference rule would recommend that the time to   withdraw stimulus remains a long way off  Because I see no case for tightening monetary policy   soon, I support maintaining the “extended period” language   In my view, the risks associated with tightening policy prematurely far exceed any risks   from tightening policy too late  That owes to the zero bound on interest rates  The Greenbook   alternative simulations illustrate the point  In the scenarios that feature weaker economic   growth, or lower inflation, the zero bound constrains the ability of policy to react  In contrast, in   those scenarios where economic growth is stronger, or inflation is higher, there is no   corresponding constraint on raising rates  Thus, the inherent uncertainty about the outlook,   coupled with the asymmetric nature of the zero bound, creates an option value to waiting and   argues for greater patience in raising rates   I believe, with respect to our “extended period” language, that we have sent the message   loud and clear that this does not imply an unconditional commitment to a zero interest rate for   any fixed calendar period  This is apparent in conversations I’m having with market participants,   and it’s consistent with the market responses that we see to news concerning economic   conditions  For example, the implied probability of an increase in the funds rate at an eight-  month horizon clearly responds to economic surprises  We see strong upward movements in   response to positive surprises, particularly those concerning unemployment  So I remain   comfortable with the “extended period” language   April 27–28, 2010 145 of 206                   On the issue of Treasury redemptions, Mr Chairman, I support your suggestion  I have   an open mind on this issue, as I indicated yesterday, about what we ultimately do, but I’d like to   wait and see further staff analysis  On asset sales, I think the minutes will and should contain a   complete treatment of our discussion on this, and I wouldn’t include anything in the statement on   it  "
8755,2010-05-09,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’m very strongly supportive of giving you   the discretion to enter into these swap arrangements  I think this is an incredibly perilous   moment and that it’s essential that we participate in a forceful, coordinated global effort to   contain the risks to the global financial system and economy at this point  I think it’s clearly the   right thing for us to do for the sake of the global economy and the US economy     We’ve had a very good discussion, I think, and very helpful suggestions in this go-around   about the political and communications challenges  And I’m very supportive of the comments   that you’ve heard about the need to manage the communications and the potential political   fallout  "
8782,2010-06-22,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’d like to associate myself particularly with   the comments of President Rosengren and Governor Kohn  I agree with everything they’ve said    To me, a key issue is that the macroeconomic outlook is weak, and, since our last meeting, I   think it has deteriorated  So I think macroeconomic considerations continue to call for   accommodative policy and, ideally, even more accommodative policy than we have now  I   wouldn’t do anything now that could be interpreted in any way as a tightening of policy or   undertake anything that could, because of the communications difficulties associated with it, lead   markets to believe that we are likely to tighten policy any sooner than they now think   On asset sales, I feel we’ve had an excellent discussion  I think every possible issue has   surfaced  I was certainly in the majority at the last meeting  My views on this haven’t changed   at all  I think it is a sound decision to sell assets, but to do so only after we’ve made a decision to   tighten monetary policy, and to start that off with an increase in our target for a short-term   interest rate   On issues like President Lacker’s suggestion—selling off MBS and replacing them with   Treasuries within a constant size balance sheet—I certainly agree that eventually we want to get   back to a portfolio that’s Treasury-only  That’s a principle I don’t have any trouble endorsing    But I don’t see a compelling reason to get out of MBS and to get into Treasuries at a very rapid   June 22–23, 2010 42 of 213             rate that would necessitate the kind of strategy that President Lacker has proposed  I don’t see   any enormous distortion that the composition of our portfolio is causing at this point that makes   me see a compelling reason for doing this quickly   On Treasuries, I would see anything other than option 1 today as some tightening in   policy, and certainly there are communications challenges associated especially with option 4,   but also even with option 2  I do, like others, see a good reason to proceed eventually to shorten   the maturity of our portfolio, to reduce interest rate risk  So option 2 is attractive, but I wouldn’t   move on that today   With respect to the coupon swap issue, I would proceed precisely as Brian proposed and   replace the 55s with 45s    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I, too, want to thank the staff for the   excellent financial stability memos—they were very helpful  I also want to say how much I like   the Tealbook  I don’t know about the name—it’s hard to get used to—but I liked the book     That’s true  Economic data releases since our April meeting have been   consistent with the moderate recovery, but the turmoil in Europe with resulting deterioration in   financial conditions during the intermeeting period pose substantial risks to economic growth   and global financial stability going forward  The timing could hardly be worse  Monetary   accommodation is stretched to the limit  Fiscal policy is likely to turn more restrictive in many   countries, and inflation is undesirably low and trending lower  Like the Tealbook, I’ve lowered   my projection for economic growth  The most recent data suggest some slowdown in consumer   June 22–23, 2010 89 of 213             spending, and the moderation evident in the aggregate data accords with reports I’m receiving   from my business contacts  Major retailers with whom we have spoken during the past month   typically report that spending is flat or growing at only a very modest pace  They hypothesize   that the spending spurt that occurred earlier in the year reflected catch-up purchases by   individuals who deferred buying discretionary items in 2009 due to uncertainty about their   employment prospects  With layoffs abating, those who are still employed apparently are less   fearful about job loss   Looking ahead, both the deterioration in domestic financial conditions and the reduction   in the outlook for foreign growth have caused me to trim my forecast for the second half of this   year and next year  I now expect real GDP to increase about 3½ percent this year and a touch   under 4 percent next year  The prospect of subpar growth is likely to make the labor market   recovery even more agonizingly slow that I previously expected  I now anticipate that the   unemployment rate will end this year at about 9½ percent, declining only to 8½ percent at the   end of 2011 and will take a couple of additional years to return to full employment  As Bill   Wascher emphasized, long-term unemployment has now risen from its pre-recession level of   about 1 percent to over 4 percent, and, as of May, 46 percent of the unemployed had been   without a job for at least 27 weeks  This is an extremely disconcerting situation, one that   translates into tremendous hardship for families and that has potentially serious adverse long-  term consequences   Turning to inflation, the very low recent readings on core consumer price inflation are   worrisome  I expect core PCE prices to rise about ¾ percent this year and a little below   1 percent next year  Both figures are a touch below my April forecasts, reflecting the greater   slack in labor and product markets I now expect and the effects of the stronger dollar  Labor   June 22–23, 2010 90 of 213             compensation growth remains anemic  Indeed, my business contacts report no sign of labor cost   pressures outside of health and unemployment insurance  The economy’s substantial slack will   continue to weigh on inflation, and the recent appreciation of the dollar should put some further   downward pressure on prices  Nonetheless, inflation expectations remain well anchored, which   should put a floor on disinflation   Recent events in Europe have put to rest any thought I had that the risks to the outlook   were diminishing to normal levels  The very scary Tealbook simulation of the severe European   sovereign debt crisis illustrates the scope of the potential downside dangers  Another risk that   concerns me, albeit a far less dramatic one, is that the underlying trend in productivity growth   may be significantly stronger than either the Board staff or I have assumed  The Tealbook   forecast assumes that labor productivity growth will slow sharply from its recent rapid pace to a   little above 1 percent this year and next  This is well below the Board staff’s estimate of   structural productivity growth of 2 percent, and it reflects some payback from the extraordinary   productivity gains of 2009 and early this year resulting from the reversal of strains on workers—  strains that will not prove sustainable   But such a productivity slowdown would represent a marked departure from the pattern   of past recoveries  Historically, labor productivity nearly always grows rapidly during the first   two years of an expansion  This is because measured productivity typically rises as firms   increase the intensity with which they use capital and labor  The sharply rising rate of capacity   utilization expected over the next few years should, if anything, boost productivity growth, in   contrast to the forecast in the Tealbook  The prediction of slow productivity growth also appears   inconsistent with what I have been hearing from my business contacts  They tell me that recent   productivity improvements, although born out of necessity, have become the new normal and   June 22–23, 2010 91 of 213             reflect permanent changes in the way they do business  To the extent that they’re right, the level   of structural productivity may be significantly higher than assumed in the Tealbook, and   productivity growth over the next few years may be higher as well  Such a situation is illustrated   by the jobless recovery alternative simulation in the Tealbook that assumes that productivity   growth will be about 2½ percent this year and next, rather than 1 percent  Of course, faster   productivity growth is a good thing to the extent that it implies greater capacity to produce goods   and services  But the alternative simulation also shows that a stronger productivity trend would   lead to significantly higher unemployment and lower inflation, outcomes that move us further   away from our dual mandate goals   In summary, I still ascribe to the view that the economy is on a recovery path of moderate   growth and very low inflation, but significant downside risks to the outlook have once again   materialized and that implies that we should avoid altering policy in any way that could impede a   fragile recovery    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I favor alternative B and approval of the   coupon swap as proposed by the staff  The economy is operating far below maximum   sustainable employment, and inflation is undesirably low—conditions that are likely to persist   for several years  Indeed, the outlook has deteriorated since our April meeting, and the time for   policy tightening has, if anything, moved further off  At this point, I see the risks associated with   tightening policy prematurely as extremely high, owing to the zero bound on interest rates and   the fact that inflation is already so low  This is not merely a theoretical point  As highlighted by   June 22–23, 2010 135 of 213             the Board staff analysis, the fallout from Europe poses significant risk for the US economy, and   we need monetary policy to be as well-positioned as possible if this or other major downside   risks materialize  I strongly support maintaining the “extended period” language  It continues to   serve us well in shaping market expectations of future policy, especially as market participants   have consistently demonstrated that they understand its conditionality   A case can be made for further accommodation as in A, but I would not argue for it now    I agree that we should think carefully, though, about what we will do if the outlook deteriorates    That said, I agree with you that the bar for further steps should be reasonably high  We must be   attentive, too, to the possibility that an extended period of near-zero rates could lead to the   emergence of dangerous financial imbalances  It remains to my mind unclear just how important   low short-term rates, as opposed to other factors, were in sowing the seeds of the financial crisis;   but recognizing and evaluating financial risks and vulnerabilities should be at the center of our   efforts to ramp up macro prudential surveillance  So far, as the financial stability staff memos   document, there are no signs of such excessive leverage or speculation  In fact, over the   intermeeting period, the appetite for risk has retreated in reaction to events in Europe  So this   leaves me comfortable with our current policy stance and alternative B   "
8807,2010-08-10,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  All summer long we have had a fairly steady   drumbeat of disappointing economic news  Consumer spending and sentiment have soured, and   the housing and labor markets continue to struggle  Like the Tealbook, I have substantially   marked down my forecast for real GDP growth over the next few quarters and foresee an even   bleaker path for the unemployment rate  The downshift in my outlook in part mirrors the greater   caution and even pessimism that I hear from my business contacts  A few months ago they were   debating whether the recovery was more likely to be U-shaped or V-shaped  Now they worry   about a W-shaped outcome—a double-dip recession   My own view is that a double-dip recession with negative GDP growth is very unlikely    To me, a more relevant benchmark is whether growth during the next few quarters will fall   below potential  Such a shortfall could signal that the recovery is too anemic to sustain itself on   an ongoing basis  A self-sustaining recovery crucially depends on the private sector stepping up   as the impetus to growth from the fiscal stimulus and inventory dynamics ends   The accommodative stance of monetary policy is providing considerable support to   private sector spending  Nonetheless, that stimulus may ultimately prove insufficient to   overcome a daunting list of headwinds, including tight credit, impaired household balance   sheets, a housing overhang, state and local budget crises, and heightened uncertainty  A number   of people around the table this morning have commented on this heightened uncertainty, and it is   a factor slowing the recovery that many of my own business contacts also constantly stress     August 10, 2010 43 of 160             Of course, the business environment is always fraught with uncertainty to some degree    But, as you noted in your congressional testimony, Mr Chairman, the outlook now seems   unusually uncertain  This matters importantly to the outlook for a reason you articulated in your   PhD thesis, namely, that it induces businesses and consumers to defer commitments to long-  lived investments, whether in plant and equipment, the workforce, or durable consumer goods    This logic is leading many of my business contacts to postpone new projects, to defer hiring, and   to build up cash reserves  They are simply too uncertain about whether the recovery will gain   traction  One national survey of small business owners reported that 75 percent believe that the   economy is likely to slip into another recession before it fully recovers  And consumers may   also be postponing purchases of big-ticket durables, such as cars, due to an amplified sense of   job and income insecurity  So my outlook, like yours, Mr Chairman, is unusually uncertain   The recent slowing in spending may simply represent a temporary cooling off, but it may   presage something more ominous, like the weaker recovery scenario in the Tealbook  Various   statistical factor forecasting models that my staff tracks all started flashing red during the   intermeeting period and now project economic growth well below potential for the rest of this   year  However, even if the probabilities associated with upside and downside forecast scenarios   were evenly balanced, the costs associated with these outcomes are most definitely not    Continued weak growth would be a very grim scenario, given the constrained set of options   available for further monetary and fiscal stimulus  I worry that growth below potential and a   deteriorating jobs outlook could trigger adverse feedbacks on consumer and business confidence,   further stunting the economy’s forward momentum   Turning briefly to inflation, I think the past two years have been quite kind to the view   that the extent of slack in the economy helps predict disinflation  The unemployment rate   August 10, 2010 44 of 160             reached 6 percent in the middle of 2008, and since then core PCE and CPI inflation have fallen   by 1¼ and 1½ percentage points, respectively  I don’t find such disinflation surprising, given the   stories about downward wage pressure that I hear  One manufacturing executive recently   described the swarm of job applicants who showed up for a single warehouse opening  That   prompted his company to drop the position’s base wage by 15 percent  At the same time, we see   no evidence that the doubling of our balance sheet has triggered any rise in inflation expectations   and inflation  The latest inflation data indicate that weakness in prices remains widespread   among both goods and services  It is more pronounced in market-based prices than in imputed   prices  Based on the apparent stability of inflation expectations, the Tealbook projects that   inflation will stop falling and hold steady at about 1 percent for the next few years   I, too, hope that the long disinflationary trend of the past two years will end, and I think a   further disinflation seems unlikely  However, the evidence suggests that prices and wages react   with a considerable lag to shifts in output and employment, and Japan provides a useful   cautionary example  Japan’s deflation didn’t begin until the mid-1990s, a half-decade after the   collapse of Japanese real estate and equity prices  Furthermore, during the early years of   deflation, Japanese long-run inflation expectations remained well anchored, averaging about   1½ percent as measured by consensus forecasts  So, unfortunately, a Japan-style deflation   remains a relevant worst-case scenario for us going forward    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support alternative B  Given the tenuous   state of business and consumer confidence, I consider it critical at this juncture that this   Committee not be perceived as falling behind the curve, being unwilling to act, or being out of   touch with the mounting concerns we see in the markets and on Main Street  The data show a   considerable slowing of the economy during the summer, and the near-term outlook has been   marked down appreciably  With respect to language, I think paragraph 1 of alternative B best   captures the recent economic deceleration   I strongly favor reinvesting the runoff in our agency portfolio  The anticipated runoff   over the next two years in our agency portfolio due to prepayments has been revised up very   significantly since our last meeting  So a continuation of our practice of redeeming agency debt   and MBS now entails a much more substantial removal of policy accommodation  Such an   acceleration in the extent of passive policy tightening is unwarranted in our current   circumstances  At the present time, MBS–Treasury spreads are quite narrow, so I can support   rollovers into Treasuries  But I would not want to preclude future rollovers into MBS under   different market conditions   August 10, 2010 100 of 160             I think we should also be considering the options available for further accommodation,   and I would be strongly inclined in that direction if the forecast is downgraded to the point where   we project that unemployment will be edging up rather than down  Our quiver has fewer arrows   than I’d like  I’m not certain just how effective the remaining arrows will be, but a renewal of   asset purchases, either Treasuries or potentially MBS, is the most potent arrow remaining  We   can all imagine scenarios of a double-dip recession or grinding deflation in which we may have   to start expanding our balance sheet partly by buying more Treasuries or MBS  An advantage of   ceasing redemptions now is that it signals our openness to moving in this direction, while at the   same time indicating that we need not take this step if the outlook improves   On other aspects of alternative B, I support the inclusion of the bracketed language in   paragraph two  This statement is consistent with the June FOMC forecasts, and it’s a powerful   signal about our unwillingness to tolerate continued downward-drifting inflation   I thought quite a bit about the proposed language in the original version of B1, paragraph   3, and in alternative B relating to “extended period”  Given the time pressures at this meeting, I   think it’s wise to table action on this matter for today  Market participants don’t expect such a   change, and they’ve already pushed out their expectations considerably concerning the length of   time that we will hold the funds rate target near zero, as the outlook has been weakened  It might   be desirable to reinforce and possibly strengthen these market expectations  My concern,   though, is that the language we would logically use in such a statement to condition the length of   “extended period” and to describe the triggers for ending it depends importantly on the particular   monetary policy strategy and forecast this Committee uses  The differences in timing and   triggers across various policy rules, for example, and forecasts turn out to be very large  These   are matters on which the Committee has not yet found consensus, and I think we need to analyze   August 10, 2010 101 of 160             this further  There are other options available to strengthen our forward-looking language, and I   very much appreciated the thoughtful staff memos describing possible options to enhance   forward-looking guidance  I think these deserve serious consideration going forward  "
8829,2010-09-21,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Last spring this Committee was hardly   optimistic about the pace of recovery  The central tendency of our April projections, for   example, showed a persistent failure to achieve anything close to our dual mandate  The   anticipated shortfalls vis-à-vis our employment and inflation objectives both widened in the June   projections  Unfortunately, the disappointing news this summer—lackluster employment,   deteriorating sentiment, anemic retail sales, decelerating investment, and further price   disinflation—has pushed the attainment of our policy objectives off even further into the future    The long slog we had been expecting in the spring now looks even longer and more painful   Furthermore, I think it’s clear that a shortfall in aggregate demand is the main culprit   behind this bleak outlook  We’re recovering from the worst global and economic financial   meltdown since the Great Depression  Households, businesses, and banks continue to struggle   under debt burdens  So the adverse headwinds holding back aggregate demand remain fierce   Of course, a negative shock to aggregate supply is also partly to blame, and we could   improve our failing grade on our full employment mandate by grading on a curve, that is, by   substantially raising the NAIRU  President Kocherlakota noted last time that recent estimates of   the Beveridge curve relating unemployment to job openings showed an outward shift relative to   the 2000s, suggesting that the labor market is experiencing significant disruptions  The outward   shift seems undeniable, but I want to argue that, even so, it’s inappropriate to gauge changes in   the NAIRU from Beveridge curve shifts alone  In the first place, the Beveridge curve is only one   relationship involved in determining equilibrium unemployment  Mathematically, after all, it’s   one equation and two variables, unemployment and vacancies  Thus, you also need to   understand the movement of vacancies to pin down where you are on the Beveridge curve  Most   September 21, 2010 45 of 151             models of frictional unemployment implicitly or explicitly have a second upward-sloping job-  creation relationship  Then horizontal shifts in the Beveridge curve typically result in less than a   one-for-one increase in the NAIRU  Consistent with the theory, the Beveridge curve has   empirically shifted in and out over history by far more than we think the NAIRU has moved    Indeed, the outward shift in recent quarters is well within the historical range of previous   business cycle recoveries   A second point to emphasize is that shifts in the Beveridge curve may result from either   structural or transitory factors  Structural shifts could reflect greater mismatch But the curve   would also be expected to shift out if the pace of layoffs rises, as it did when the economy   entered a tailspin  A shift in the Beveridge curve for this reason would likely prove transitory or   cyclical   Ultimately, then, it’s an empirical task to figure out how much of the recent movements   in the Beveridge curve reflect cyclical factors related to the weak economy and weak aggregate   demand and how much reflects more permanent changes affecting the NAIRU  My staff has   examined this issue using a variety of approaches  These include analyzing data on vacancies   and job-finding rates, asking all of our directors during the intermeeting period about their ability   to find qualified workers, and estimating time-varying Phillips curve models  Taking all of these   analyses together, we arrive at a medium-term NAIRU of 575 percent, identical to the Tealbook    My staff also estimates that the extended unemployment insurance programs add about three-  quarters of a percentage point more, bringing the current effective NAIRU to about 65 percent    Thus, our best estimate is that there is about 3 percentage points of excess unemployment,   considerably more than at this stage of the recoveries in 1975 and 1983, for example    September 21, 2010 46 of 151             Furthermore, over the next few years, as extended UI programs expire and mismatch is reduced,   the NAIRU falls  So there will be considerable slack remaining for years   My contacts confirm the conclusion that mismatch is a problem only for small,   specialized jobs, and, without exception, they report that it is now easier to identify applicants for   such specialized skilled jobs than before the recession  If anything, they see an abundance of   qualified workers, not a shortage  As one contact put it, “Sure, we see mismatch  We see many   more applicants now who are overqualified relative to job requirements”  Indeed, with an   abundance of qualified applicants and a lack of sales, firms may well see some option value in   holding vacancies open longer as they search for the really exceptional candidate   Of course, this considerable resource slack is also holding down wages and prices  My   contacts expect to raise nominal wages modestly, at best, and they don’t think they can raise their   prices much, if at all  Recently, they seem increasingly worried about deflation, not about high   inflation  I tried to reassure my contacts that deflation is unlikely  That said, I’m not reassured   by the Tealbook’s inflation confidence intervals, which imply as much as one chance in three   that core inflation will be less than 05 percent in 2012, and work by my staff, which finds that   yields on nominal and inflation-protected Treasuries price in about one chance in six that   cumulative CPI inflation over the next three years will be negative  No matter how you look at   it, the probability distribution of future inflation outcomes is too low  In sum, there is enormous   resource slack, which I expect will persist for years, and inflation is running below desired   levels    Thank you, Mr Chairman  The economic case for one of the A   alternatives is compelling  We are far below maximum sustainable employment, and inflation is   too low  Not only are we failing on both of our legislated mandates now, but, given current   projections, we will continue to fail on both goals for far too long  I don’t believe that we are   following an optimal policy, and I think this dire situation requires us to act  But we do face a   difficult challenge in communicating what we’re doing and why, and we do need to prepare the   ground  So at this meeting I support alternative B  It acknowledges the reality that the outlook   for employment and inflation is unacceptable, and that the situation has on balance gotten worse    It sets the stage for future action unless the situation improves markedly   Why should we take action now if we did not earlier in the year?  As you laid out clearly   in your Jackson Hole speech, Mr Chairman, further action has both benefits and costs  Since the   spring, the benefits have gone up as the outlook has deteriorated substantially  But, even more   importantly, the costs of acting have come down  When we were expanding our purchases of   longer-term assets last year and early this year, there were some fears that the unprecedented   expansion of our balance sheet might have inflationary consequences or that inflation   expectations might come unhinged  Markets have now digested the notion that the Federal   September 21, 2010 86 of 151             Reserve can expand its balance sheet without dire inflationary consequences  Indeed, by most   measures, inflation expectations are lower today than they were in the spring  Surveys of   inflation expectations are lower, and inflation compensation from TIPS is lower; even the   number of searches on Google for the term “inflation” has been trending down for months    [Laughter]  “Deflation” is also headed up  We’ve also done a lot of important work in preparing   and communicating our eventual exit strategy  So the case for A is clear  We’re failing in our   mandates, and we have the tools to do better   It is not that monetary policy is the main problem facing businesses, as many of you have   pointed out  But I do think policy can contribute to the solution, even if it isn’t a panacea for   what ails businesses these days  And I think that, in addition to lowering the term premium and   longer-term rates, it is important that there are channels working through, perhaps, a lower dollar   and higher equity prices   In terms of the various A alternatives, there are a number of choices to make  In   principle, I understand the advantages of the second option for A2, paragraph 5, where we use   asset purchases as an additional lever that we can move up or down  And I would support this   approach if I thought that a $500 billion initial purchase would put us at neutral, that is, a   position where the odds were similar that our next move would be to ease or to tighten    However, I think that we will still be behind the curve with a $500 billion injection, so that   purchases beyond that are more likely than sales  That makes me uncomfortable with the   alternative language in paragraph 5 of A2  We might not accomplish much on longer-term rates,   because our message would be that we might buy $500 billion, but we will reassess at the next   meeting and might end up buying less  Such a message could add uncertainty to financial   markets and gain us little on the term premium  I’m attracted by the reaction function approach,   September 21, 2010 87 of 151             but it makes more sense to me to wait to introduce it until we have a truly symmetric bias on our   desired LSAP stock   On paragraph 2 of the A options, I prefer A1, where we’re explicit about our numerical   objective  Because it is more explicit, it should be more effective at anchoring inflation   expectations  The value of anchoring expectations to keep them from going too low outweighs   the usual concerns that we’re putting too much quantitative emphasis on just the inflation half of   our dual mandate   Regarding President Evans’ proposal for a state-contingent price level target, I support its   goal of increasing inflation and inflation expectations to a level more consistent with our   mandate  I also support its willingness to entertain aggressive policies to escape the constraints   of the zero bound  However, it seems to me to be a challenging policy to communicate  In   addition, I am concerned that the policy might not work as the theory says it should if the policy   is not communicated extremely clearly and if agents in the economy form expectations in a way   that is not perfectly rational or forward-looking  One concern I have in particular is that an   announced increase in our medium-term inflation objective to, say, 3 percent would raise   nominal mortgage rates, which do matter for liquidity-constrained homebuyers, and, thereby,   would undermine any rejuvenation in the moribund housing market  However, I am certainly   open to further analysis and study of this option   On balance, then, my preference would be for alternative A1, where we commit to   pursuing the dual mandate aggressively, where we state a numerical inflation objective, and   where we pursue policies that signal the strength of our resolve  And I think they can achieve   some of the same benefits as a price level target with fewer potential costs    Sure  Whatever you want  "
8849,2010-10-15,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I, too, want to express my appreciation for the   excellent memos, including those from Cleveland and Dallas  Let me take the questions in order    On question 1, my preference is for option 2  I would make the Committee’s objective for inflation   and our assessment of the unemployment rate corresponding to maximum employment quantitative   and explicit  I think this would improve the public’s understanding of our goals, helping to combat   any tendency that could develop for inflation expectations to decline over time, which would   exacerbate the zero-bound problem and impede recovery  It would also help contain the risk that, as   our balance sheet expands, inflation expectations could become unhinged on the upside  But if we   quantify our inflation objective, I consider it essential to do so in a way that emphasizes our   balanced commitment to both parts of the dual mandate  So I see the proposed statement that also   includes unemployment as a way of achieving the needed balance   Including the Committee’s quantitative assessments represents in some ways a relatively   small communication step, because we already regularly publish participants’ longer-term   assessments of these variables in the Summary of Economic Projections  But taking this step is still   consequential  If we set sail in this direction, we will probably end up tying ourselves to the mast,   in the sense that such numerical assessments will become a permanent feature of our   communications framework   On the inflation objective, I don’t think we need to seek Committee agreement on a single   specific inflation target at this point  To say it is “about 2 percent,” or “2 percent or a bit less,”   strikes me as an accurate characterization of our SEP responses  But should a day come when our   preferred longer-run inflation objectives don’t cluster in a narrow range, the Committee would have   to agree on a single objective  That would be a more significant step, I think, requiring consultation   with the Congress  While I prefer numerical objectives, I could also support the qualitative dual   October 15, 2010 46 of 62             mandate approach embodied in statement 1  The Committee’s objectives are already pretty well   understood by markets, so they’ll probably get the message without the numbers  I would not   pursue either price level targeting or nominal GDP targeting at this time, although I understand the   attractions  The staff memo shows that, with forward-looking expectations and a high degree of   credibility, a price level targeting strategy could be extremely effective  However, these strategies   entail very significant risks, so I would not pursue them at this point   Turning to question 2, which concerns the form that accommodation would take, my   preference would be to provide additional policy accommodation via further purchases of longer-  term securities rather than by setting interest rate targets  There is substantial uncertainty about their   effects, but I am persuaded by the staff analysis that further purchases will have a meaningful   impact on aggregate demand  And I agree with President Dudley that we are probably right now   seeing the impact that such purchases would have, given the heightened market anticipation that   they will occur  Interest rate targets also have some appeal, though; and the approach described in   the staff memo, where we would cap rates at the front end of the yield curve to signal our policy   intentions, is a strategy I would hold in reserve if further stimulus proves necessary and if we see   market expectations concerning the length of “extended period” diverge significantly from the   Committee’s own views   Turning to question 3, on the method of adjustment, President Bullard has won me over to   the continuous approach  If we implement and communicate it properly, I think it will be seen by   markets as an extension of our long-standing strategy for adjusting the federal funds rate  As Jim   has emphasized, it will be important to communicate a reaction function, so that markets understand   how our policy moves will be calibrated to changes in the outlook  If we succeed in communicating   such a reaction function, market responses to incoming data will anticipate our eventual policy   October 15, 2010 47 of 62             actions, thereby enhancing and speeding the transmission mechanism  On the issue of calibration, I   would choose a number like $200 billion or $250 billion as the size of our basic step, the equivalent   of our 25 basis point step for changing the federal funds rate, and I would look for a way to   communicate this calibration to markets  We do sometimes move the federal funds rate by 50 basis   points, or even more, so I think we should be open to this possibility if we resume purchases  My   own view is that we’re behind the curve, so a move equivalent to 50 basis points would certainly   make sense to me at the outset, and I would not consider this “shock and awe”   More generally, if we pursue the continuous strategy, I think it is important for the   Committee to issue some forward-looking guidance in the statement; in other words, we need to   enunciate a policy bias or tilt with respect to future LSAPs, just as we have done in the past with the   federal funds rate  The market effect of our actions will depend on the entire expected path of   future policy actions, and we’ll undercut the effects of our purchases if we suggest that further   moves in either direction are equally likely—that is, if we convey right away that we’re at neutral   when the odds instead are far more heavily weighted in one direction  The options in paragraph 5 of   draft statement 1 offer constructive suggestions for communicating such a bias  My final point on   this topic is that I think we need in every FOMC statement to state the intended size of the SOMA   portfolio in addition to the time period over which we plan to reach that target  Theory suggests it is   our stock of longer-term assets, and not the flow of purchases, that matters to market yields and   asset prices   Finally, turning to the fourth question, on communications, I do think the sample statements   do a good job at implementing both the qualitative and inflation target approaches, and they’re good   models to follow  However, given their brevity and the novelty of a continuous LSAP approach,   many questions will immediately arise about our strategy, and the three-week lag until the minutes   October 15, 2010 48 of 62             come out is much too long to leave such uncertainties unresolved  My preference would be for the   Chairman to conduct a press briefing immediately following the announcement  It could take the   form that was used, I believe, when we moved fed funds rate down to the lower bound  It need not   be a full-blown press conference  It could be remarks to the press that are either on the record or on   background  I think such a briefing would accomplish what we need at this stage  A press   conference does have some appeal, but it would probably become obligatory on a regular basis and   would be quite a commitment for the Chairman to undertake  "
8875,2010-11-02,"  Yes  Thanks, Ben  Let me just say that I share your concerns  I think   we’ve come in for a lot of criticism of our external communications—we’re getting low grades,   and they’re not entirely undeserved  I personally see them as damaging our credibility and our   reputation at a time when the institution is under enormous scrutiny, and we can ill afford it   I think the first issue that you raised on communication should be a no-brainer  We’re   obliged to maintain the confidentiality of FOMC information—period, full stop  And that   includes documents that we look at in the FOMC and information on who said what  It’s   obvious that these guidelines have been breached  I also know from personal experience over   the years that it’s easy for this to happen—it can happen pretty innocently when an experienced   reporter lures one into revealing things that end up crossing the line  But I’m assuming it should   be completely noncontroversial that we all need to be more careful and to abide by the Program   for Security of FOMC Information  So I think it’s not going to take long for our subcommittee   to look at that—at least I hope not   The second issue you raised is more subtle, and it is an important one for the   subcommittee to take up  How do we ensure that our conversations with market participants and   outside consultants don’t create the impression, and even the reality, that well-connected   outsiders have access to inside information?  I myself sometimes talk to market participants, and   I do value those discussions, but I think we are placing ourselves at risk  I think the guidelines   that Michelle prepared and circulated are a terrific starting point, but maybe we need to go   further, and I look forward to hearing your ideas on this   November 2–3, 2010 5 of 238             Regarding the third issue—voicing policy views prior to meetings—I believe it’s a   long-standing tradition of the Committee to refrain from publicly articulating firm positions on   the stance that a member is going to take on future monetary policy moves  In some ways, I   think following this tradition was easier and more straightforward when we were doing   conventional policy  We just had to be aware that we should refrain from speculating about   future moves on the federal funds rate or indicating any firm view of our own  I recognize that,   now that we’ve hit the zero bound, the options are a lot more complicated, so it seems natural to   weigh in on what kinds of tactics we could or couldn’t support  But, frankly, I think many of the   comments we’ve made are destructive of collegiality and of the Committee process—they do   come close to feeling like a situation where we walk into the room having said, in effect, that it   doesn’t matter what arguments or evidence one of us around the table musters, because our   minds are made up   I think it does more than undermine collegiality  I think we’ve been generating a great   deal of noise and market volatility  That’s something we’ve consciously tried to avoid in the   past  It’s not that we’re not entitled to independent views—I think we absolutely are, and we   have a right to express them  I’ve always been a firm believer in the notion that it’s important   for us to walk in here with independent views, because it helps us avoid groupthink, which is a   huge danger, and because it enriches the debate  But when the Committee actually makes a   policy decision, I feel that, when we make public remarks, we all have an obligation to state   clearly what the policy is and what the rationale for it is, even if we might think or want to say   individually that we have some qualms about it or some disagreement with it   One way to strengthen the voice of the Committee that we’ve discussed a bit would be   for the Chairman to speak about policy more frequently and, perhaps, at critical moments, such   November 2–3, 2010 6 of 238             as when we’ve made key policy decisions  This could occur through background press briefings,   as happened several times during the crisis, or at periodic on-the-record press conferences    During our videoconference, I noted that a number of you supported approaches along those   lines, and such approaches are getting some thought around here  At any rate, I look forward to   talking to all of you as we move forward, and I hope we can develop some guidelines we can   agree to live by    Good suggestion    So moved    Can I just make a brief point on that?  I think we’ve seen that one of the   reasons that the duration of unemployment has become so long for so many people is that the   quit rate is unusually low at this point  That means that people who are employed and have jobs   aren’t getting out of their seats looking for new jobs—if they did, they’d be creating vacancies   November 2–3, 2010 41 of 238             for people who are unemployed  So, one reason that it’s so hard to get a job if you don’t have   one is that nobody who has a job seems willing to move  That could be interpreted as a measure   of great fear in the labor market that people not only are not getting outside offers, but they also   don’t want to take the risk of moving to another city, looking for a job when they get there, and   so on  So existing employees who are unusually fearful could be putting more than the normal   amount of downward pressure on wages; that would counteract what you’re saying    Thank you, Mr Chairman  The data we’ve received during the   intermeeting period reinforced my view that the path to recovery will involve a long, slow slog    I expect unemployment to remain elevated for years to come, and inflation, as far as my eye can   see, to run below the 2 percent level I consider most consistent with the Committee’s dual   mandate  The reports from our business contacts strike me as consistent with such a forecast    Outside of housing, where conditions are dismal, they describe an economy that is growing, but   only at a snail’s pace  Businesses remain focused on productivity  They are reluctant to hire and   invest  They have little pricing power   The heartening news during the intermeeting period is that financial conditions have   eased meaningfully, as markets have become increasingly convinced we intend to resume our   LSAP program  Market views on the odds and magnitude of such a program have shifted back   and forth over the past several weeks, and that has provided us with real-time readings pertaining   to its likely impacts on longer-term yields, equity prices, and the dollar  And, thankfully, the   implied policy multipliers look to be nontrivial and in line with earlier staff estimates   The forecast I prepared for this meeting assumes that the FOMC will ultimately ratify the   expectations concerning LSAPs that are currently embedded in markets  In contrast to the   Tealbook baseline, I assume that we will ultimately add about $1 trillion of Treasuries to our   balance sheet, although any purchases beyond the $600 billion initial tranche would be   November 2–3, 2010 78 of 238             contingent on future economic developments  My assumption about monetary policy involves a   bit more accommodation than the Tealbook, but I still anticipate a path for GDP, unemployment,   and inflation that is broadly similar to the Tealbook baseline  By the end of 2013, I foresee an   unemployment rate around 7 percent, still meaningfully above my longer-run NAIRU estimate   of around 5¼ percent, and core inflation that is still in the vicinity of 1 percent   With respect to risks to the forecast, I continue to judge the uncertainty attached to my   projections as unusually high  An especially large source of uncertainty pertains to consumer   spending  The Tealbook assumes that the personal saving rate will stabilize around 5¼ percent,   and a forecast along these lines appears roughly consistent with the life-cycle consumption   equations relating spending and income and wealth  But I remain concerned that the process of   balance sheet repair in the aftermath of the financial crisis could involve more significant   deleveraging by households and a rise in the personal saving rate above the Tealbook baseline,   resulting in outcomes like the weaker recovery alternative in the Tealbook  Household debt and   ratios of debt service to income were exceptionally high at the outset of the financial crisis  They   have declined over the last two years, thanks in part to defaults  But the household debt–income   ratio is still well above historical norms  Many households now face borrowing constraints that   are likely to impede their spending  And, along the lines that President Evans mentioned, debt is   eroding less rapidly in real terms in the current low-inflation environment than it would if   inflation were running closer to our target and to the inflation expectations that households had   when they borrowed  Stated differently, many households that borrowed during the boom are   now experiencing wage increases that are notably lower than they must have anticipated  The   bottom line is that further deleveraging poses a real risk to the expansion, and this risk is   exacerbated by very low inflation  In fairness, though, I think the risks relating to consumer   November 2–3, 2010 79 of 238             spending are two- and not one-sided  By now, there appears to be considerable pent-up demand   for autos and other consumer durables, which could trigger more rapid growth in spending if the   job market improves and uncertainty about future income abates, similar to the stronger recovery   scenario   The second factor that creates abnormally high risk to the outlook pertains to the financial   system  It appears to be healing but remains highly vulnerable to shocks  We saw last spring   how rapidly credit conditions could tighten when European sovereign debt concerns mounted,   and renewed turmoil in connection with sovereign debt cannot be ruled out  As several of you   noted, there remain risks associated with the large-scale put-back of mortgages to the banking   sector, and the excellent financial stability memos prepared by the staff for this meeting highlight   evidence of asset price bubbles in some markets  Abrupt shifts in global capital flows could   trigger asset price movements posing risk to the financial system   On the issue of risk skew, I see the risks pertaining to GDP growth as weighted   asymmetrically to the downside and for an important reason  Monetary and fiscal policies in the   United States and other advanced countries have ample latitude to respond if aggregate demand   proves too robust, but little or no scope to respond to downside shocks   Turning to inflation, my forecast is that it will remain in the vicinity of 1 percent for the   duration of the forecast period  The data we have received during the intermeeting period   confirm that core inflation remains extremely low, and disinflation has been broad-based    Incoming data reveal that wage trends are extremely subdued, and, even with some slowdown in   productivity growth, unit labor costs are barely rising  My concern about the possibility of   deflation is tempered by my belief, bolstered by survey evidence, that inflation expectations   continue to be well anchored, creating an offset to the downward pressure on inflation resulting   November 2–3, 2010 80 of 238             from enormous slack in the labor market  But we cannot completely dismiss the risk that   inflation expectations could follow actual inflation down in the years to come    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I favor alternative B  You gave an eloquent,   detailed, and very convincing defense of this alternative in your remarks yesterday, so I’ll just   reiterate and emphasize my agreement with a few of the points you made   First, the outlook for employment and inflation are dismal  We will miss both objectives   by a country mile for years to come  Of course it will take considerable time after such a large   November 2–3, 2010 173 of 238             shock to attain our objectives no matter what, but optimal policy calculations call for much more   stimulus—as you explained in detail yesterday  The pace of progress is inadequate  Further,   LSAPs are not a panacea, but they can make a meaningful difference  We’ve seen a significant   improvement in financial conditions on longer-term rates, equity prices, and the dollar during the   intermeeting period as markets have increasingly built in the expectation that we will act  The   improvement in financial conditions we’ve already seen will help to support a stronger recovery   and help to return inflation towards levels consistent with our dual mandate   If one stares at the graphs on page 5 of the Tealbook showing the paths of GDP and the   unemployment rate under alternative policies, the benefits do look minor  But putting numbers   on them, as you did yesterday, suggests a meaningful improvement  You estimated that a   $600 billion program would create about 750,000 jobs by the end of 2012  A similar calculation   suggests the program would raise output over the next two years by around $125 billion    Expanding our balance sheet may entail some risks, but the benefits are nontrivial, and I agree   with your assessment that the risks are manageable, especially if we proceed cautiously  I also   agreed with your comments concerning the possible impact of this policy on the dollar  On   balance, I believe that because it has a positive impact on US growth, our actions are not on net   harmful to our neighbors  A stronger US recovery, I believe, is very much in their interests   Contrasting alternatives A and B, I prefer B  I think it makes sense to commit at the   outset to a dose of purchases that we can be quite confident we will want to undertake and to   attach greater conditionality to purchases beyond that level, so we can see how economic   conditions are evolving once the program gets under way  My expectation, based on a forecast   similar to Tealbook, is that we should and will end up purchasing roughly $1 trillion of longer-  November 2–3, 2010 174 of 238             term securities; but the $600 billion initial commitment, which, I guess, is the equivalent of   around a 75 basis point cut in the federal funds rate, is a sufficient step for today   The wording in paragraph 5 leaves open the possibility of purchases beyond $600 billion   and suggests a bias towards ease, but it doesn’t lean too heavily in that direction  It also leaves   open the possibility that if the data surprises are sufficiently strong to the upside, we might not   complete the intended $600 billion of purchases  But I think the bar for us to stop short of   $600 billion should be quite high  I would not, therefore, want to add “up to” to qualify   $600 billion in paragraph 3   I see both pros and cons to altering the “extended period” language along the lines of A4    On balance, my preference is to leave well enough alone  A4 slightly improves the clarity   around our “extended period” commitment by setting out conditions that would be required for   us to raise the funds rate target before mid-2012  But, because mid-2012 appears to be the modal   market forecast for liftoff, the statement will not push out market expectations very much  And   the wording of the conditions around that promise still leave plenty of scope to keep markets   guessing how high exactly is “elevated,” and what data would convince us that inflation   expectations are no longer well anchored   Of course, it’s hard to be more specific because, as a number of you have emphasized, we   haven’t agreed about such matters among ourselves  I think our current language is working   quite well, in the sense that incoming data surprises move market expectations about liftoff in   ways that seem appropriate, and those reactions have been working to strengthen the   transmission mechanism  "
8898,2010-12-14,"  So moved   December 14, 2010 14 of 127              So moved    Thank you, Mr Chairman  The data we have received since our last   meeting suggest that the economy is continuing to grow, and the mood among households and   businesses is improving  My contacts have been cautious for quite some time  That hasn’t   changed, but more seem cautiously optimistic  Incoming data on retail sales and consumer   confidence have surprised them and me to the upside  Consumer spending is hardly exuberant,   but purchases of durable goods, a typical driver of recovery in the early stages of expansion,   have picked up some steam, and I consider that encouraging  Given the exceptionally high ratio   of household debt to personal income, I continue to think that the deleveraging process has some   way to run  But the ratio of debt service to income and the financial obligations ratio have both   declined substantially, and this may be creating greater latitude for a rebound in discretionary   spending   December 14, 2010 58 of 127             Of course, the performance of the labor market is critical to consumer spending going   forward, and it is disappointing that unemployment ticked up during the intermeeting period    But other labor market indicators—initial claims, hours, and incoming data on hiring and job   openings—suggest some modest ongoing improvement   The fiscal package agreed to last week, if enacted into law, is also a positive for the near-  term outlook  It should boost growth somewhat during the coming year and diminish the risk   that fiscal drag could tip the economy back into recession  All of these factors point to an   improved near-term outlook and some abatement of downside risk to the economic recovery  It   seems likely that these developments account for a portion of the extraordinary backup in   nominal Treasury and TIPS yields since the November FOMC meeting   In spite of the many upside surprises during the intermeeting period, the news has not   been uniformly upbeat  Two intermeeting developments that particularly concern me pertain to   the housing market and the European debt situation  With respect to housing, as David   explained, incoming data have been dismal, and, to my mind, they justified the substantial   downward revision to projected residential investment spending in the current Tealbook  The   discouraging tone of recent data accord with the truly downbeat reports we are getting from   homebuilders  A group we met with here at the Board noted that prices in most markets have   declined to the point where they no longer cover construction costs  So from a supply   perspective, new homebuilding is largely unprofitable  Moreover, incoming data suggest that   house prices remain under continued downward pressure due to the bloated supply of new and   existing homes for sale, plus the huge shadow inventory reflecting foreclosures and seriously   delinquent mortgages   December 14, 2010 59 of 127             One of the most striking and worrisome revisions in this Tealbook pertains to house   prices  A further 8 percent decline in house prices, as Tealbook now assumes, will affect   consumer spending via wealth effects and negatively affect the ability of households to borrow    Such a large decline in house prices will also significantly increase the already large fraction of   homes that are underwater on their mortgages, likely precipitating additional foreclosures and re-  defaults on modified loans  Financial institutions remain quite vulnerable to losses related to real   estate  Such dynamics could restrict the availability of credit, feeding further house-price   declines in a worrisome adverse feedback loop   Like Nathan, Vice Chairman Dudley, and others, I also see the European debt situation as   very worrisome and posing significant risk to the recovery  The crisis has intensified in recent   weeks  It now shows signs of spreading beyond Greece and Ireland to Portugal, Spain, and other   euro-area countries  Strains have been evident in short-term funding markets  The pricing of   sovereign debt suggests that markets now assume that restructuring for some countries,   particularly Greece, is almost inevitable  And debt dynamics calculations for Ireland and   Portugal suggest that the fiscal responses required for these countries to avoid restructuring are,   frankly, draconian  Fiscal contraction on the scale needed would severely undermine their   prospects for economic growth  Moreover, restoration of growth seems likely to require wage   cuts to restore competitiveness, and such cuts, if they occur, would make the burden of the debt   yet more onerous   The European response thus far strikes me as inadequate to stem contagion, and I am   concerned that these developments have the potential to precipitate a broad-based pullback from   risk-taking, with spillovers into domestic asset prices  For example, we have seen negative co-  movements between US equity prices and peripheral European CDS premiums in recent weeks,   December 14, 2010 60 of 127             similar to the pattern that prevailed last spring  The alternative simulations in the Tealbook   suggest that an intensification of the crisis could have significant implications for the outlook   Finally, turning to inflation, the data on core inflation have once again surprised to the   downside, and wage increases remain very well contained  Even if temporary factors are partly   responsible for the very subdued inflation readings in the past few months, the pace of core   inflation still seems to be moving downward, and, by any measure, the deceleration is broad-  based    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support alternative B  I think we should   stay the course on the policy we announced in November and make minimal modifications to our   statement  We said that we intend to purchase $600 billion in additional Treasury securities by   mid-2011  This decision is subject to review, but I think the bar for stopping short of   $600 billion should be set pretty high  One relative consideration is whether the outlook has   changed substantially  I think the answer is “no”  Inflation is still below the levels we consider   consistent with our dual mandate, and it’s continuing to trend down  Inflation surprises during   the intermeeting period have been on the downside  Unemployment is even higher than we   anticipated it in November, although other measures of labor market performance suggest   ongoing but very gradual recovery  The outlook for growth in 2011 is slightly stronger due to   the fiscal stimulus, but that stimulus is temporary, and the changes on balance are only marginal    Some downside risks to the outlook have abated, but others have increased  On balance, I still   consider the risks weighted to the downside  So the value of the program in providing insurance   against downside risk, something that’s especially important in the neighborhood of the zero   bound, remains, in my view, a valid rationale   A second consideration is whether potential risks associated with the program appear to   be materializing  Again, I think the answer is “no”  In particular, inflation expectations have not   become unhinged, and the program has not generated noticeable flight from the dollar   The third consideration is whether asset purchases are actually efficacious in stimulating   the economy  Here the incoming data strengthen my view that they are  We saw very   significant movements in longer-term Treasury yields and equity prices between Jackson Hole   and the November FOMC, and those seem clearly to have been conditioned on market   expectations of the program  That market response was consistent with the key assumption on   December 14, 2010 98 of 127             which the program was premised, namely, that relative supplies of securities of different   maturities matter to the structure of yields and term premiums   Of course, we’ve seen an enormous run-up in longer-term nominal and real yields since   the announcement  Strong data do appear to explain part of the backup; end-of-year positioning   and convexity hedging likely also played some role  But I agree with Brian and the staff that a   significant contributor was the scaling back of market expectations about the likely size and   duration of the program  The evidence suggests that criticisms of the program and the ensuing   political backlash contributed to this adverse market reaction and, at the same time, raised the   degree of uncertainty concerning longer-term rates and Fed policy  Higher risk premiums due to   increased uncertainty may also be pushing up yields  These market responses are unfortunate,   but they serve to strengthen my view that asset purchases do matter in influencing financial   conditions  "
8928,2011-01-25,"  I would like to move the nomination of Ben Bernanke as Chairman    I would like to nominate Bill Dudley as Vice Chair    Our intention was consistent with what the Chairman just said  We’re   concerned about potential leaks of documents or their contents that are discussed in an FOMC   meeting as well as leaks about the substance of discussions, such as who said what  As far as   publicizing past data that just happened to appear in the Tealbook, such as historical movements   in the exchange rate, I wouldn’t think of that as a violation   We’re certainly not trying to be legalistic about this  We wanted to add a procedure to   cover what happens if there are violations  It begins with a process of triage in which anything   that’s reported to the Secretariat would be reviewed by the Secretary, the General Counsel, and   the Chairman, and only things that are considered to be significant breaches would go to   investigation  I think that section VII tries to make that clear, namely, that things have to be   judged to rise above a certain threshold    Suppose something came out in the minutes that described the staff   projection, and it happened to say that in this round the staff lowered its forecast for house   prices  That would be fine, but anything that wasn’t in the minutes about Tealbook projections   wouldn’t be   January 25–26, 2011 8 of 282               I think so   January 25–26, 2011 9 of 282               Dan, it’s our intention to try to devise a set of guidelines for the staff   after this is approved for the FOMC    So moved    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I, too, am encouraged by recent news   suggesting that, outside of housing and nonresidential construction—sectors which remain mired   in gloom—private spending and production gained some momentum toward the end of last year    The improved tone of the data is mirrored in the anecdotal reports I hear  Businesses seem   slightly more optimistic about future sales and a bit more willing to hire and invest  The more   positive tone of the data improves my confidence that the recovery is on firmer footing and will   gradually pick up steam going forward  My modal forecast has changed only marginally in   response to incoming data, but my assessment of the risks to the outlook for economic growth   and inflation has become more balanced   January 25–26, 2011 125 of 282              The forecast I prepared for today’s meeting is very close to that in Tealbook and in my   November projection  I raised my forecast of economic growth in 2011 by a few tenths of a   percent, reflecting upside surprises in consumer and investment spending and the enactment of   the fiscal package  But these positives were offset by developments since November, suggesting   a deeper and more persistent housing downturn and steeper declines in house prices than I   previously anticipated  The large overhang of existing homes for sale, the bulging foreclosure   pipeline, the inability of homeowners with negative equity to trade up, and continuing tight   lending standards are depressing house prices throughout the country  I expect the resulting   negative wealth effects to take a toll on consumption   For 2012, I lowered my growth forecast a few tenths to reflect the shift from this year to   next year in the onset of fiscal drag  All in all, I now anticipate that, by the end of 2013, the level   of real GDP will be a few tenths higher and unemployment a tenth or so lower than my   November forecast  The essential contours of my forecast are unchanged  I envision a recovery   that will strengthen but proceed slowly by postwar standards  As a consequence, unemployment   will decline only very gradually, remaining around 7 percent at the end of 2013   Turning to inflation, I have been surprised by the sharp upward movement in commodity   prices, but data on core prices, compensation, and unit labor costs have been consistent with my   previous forecast  And I continue to project that inflation will remain notably below the   2 percent level that I consider consistent with our dual mandate and will rise only minimally over   the forecast period  A key issue with which I grappled during this round was how much to revise   up my forecast of consumer spending in response to stronger incoming data  I ultimately   decided that the staff’s decision to revise up the level of consumer spending, but not the growth   rate beyond mid-2011, is a sensible and balanced response  It seems dangerous to overblow the   January 25–26, 2011 126 of 282              significance of the surprise when it is out of line with the fundamentals, particularly changes in   employment, wages, and wealth  As David discussed in his presentation yesterday, these factors   have had a remarkably good track record in explaining fluctuations in consumer spending and   the personal saving rate since the onset of the crisis   Of course, perceptions concerning current and future labor market conditions and   income, and other factors, like access to credit, also influence consumption, and the staff tried to   capture these influences with measures of sentiment  Yesterday’s jump in confidence in the   Conference Board survey suggests some improvement, but other surveys thus far reveal no   significant or sustained rebound, even though most measures of sentiment are off their   recessionary lows  Moreover, as David noted, the staff forecast assumes that sentiment will   improve going forward, and the Tealbook growth forecast stands well above the Blue Chip   consensus and near the top of our own central tendency   On the labor market, in spite of December’s drop in the unemployment rate, the number   of new jobs in recent months has fallen short of the number needed just to accommodate the   growing population  The decline in labor force participation, very modest gains in wages and   compensation, and continuing perceptions in surveys that jobs are exceptionally difficult to   obtain, all suggest that the labor market remains quite weak  I interpret the quit rate—the   fraction of employed workers who voluntarily resign their jobs to search, exit the labor force, or   take another job immediately—as a good measure of fear and perceived opportunity  Papers   prepared and circulated for yesterday’s discussion show that the quit rate is exceptionally   depressed  The quit rate is now above the lows reached in the depth of the recession, but I take   the very modest increase as a signal that improvement in the labor market is, thus far, quite   modest   January 25–26, 2011 127 of 282              The most significant change in my forecast versus November pertains to my assessment   of the balance of risks  In November, I considered the risk to both economic growth and   inflation as weighted to the downside, and I now consider them balanced  On the downside, I am   particularly concerned about spillovers to spending and financial markets from further house   prices declines and consider the risks well illustrated by the two alternative simulations in   Tealbook  And, of course, spillovers to financial markets from European sovereign debt   developments are a continuing source of downside risk  That said, I see more upside risk now   that the recovery will be stronger than my modal forecast  For example, auto sales were quite   strong during the fourth quarter, and this could foreshadow more robust spending due to pent-up   demand for durables than is incorporated in the Tealbook baseline  I was struck that that   baseline envisions declining vehicle stocks per capita over the entire forecast period   With respect to inflation, like market participants, I am less concerned about deflationary   risk than in November  Spikes in commodity prices create upside risks, but I agree with   Tealbook’s assessment that any pass-through to core inflation is apt to be quite modest  And I   read the anecdotal reports as suggesting that firms still have little or no pricing power    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I favor alternative B  I’m comfortable with   the wording of the first paragraph of B as it stands, but I could support a mild upgrading of the   outlook along the lines that President Lockhart suggested  Although incoming data have   strengthened my confidence that the risks have become more balanced, my modal outlook has   changed very, very little since our last meeting  I continue to anticipate that unemployment will   remain undesirably high and inflation undesirably low—below the 2 percent rate that the   majority of the Committee has indicated is their preferred inflation objective—for the   foreseeable future   With respect to policy, I’m comfortable for now with our current stance  Optimal policy   simulations and rule-based recommendations in Tealbook indicate that economic conditions   continue to call for a highly accommodative policy  By the various metrics in Tealbook, we do   not have our foot too heavily on the gas  With respect to our LSAP program, I continue to think   that the bar for not completing the announced $600 billion of purchases should be high, and that   hurdle has not been breached  My reading of the evidence is similar to yours, Mr Chairman  I   think the program has had a modest but positive impact on financial conditions, and it may   deserve some credit for diminishing market anxiety about deflation  Fears that the program   could cause an outsized decline in the dollar or trigger a rise in inflation expectations have not   materialized  We should continue to evaluate the program in light of incoming evidence, but I   don’t think the proposed change to the last sentence of paragraph 3 is needed or desirable  Any   January 25–26, 2011 180 of 282              change at all in the wording will arouse market speculation about our intentions, so I would   prefer to keep the language identical to December   With respect to our external communications regarding future policy in the days ahead, I   think we should be clear that we recognize the need to withdraw policy stimulus as the economy   recovers and that we have the tools and commitment to do so  I see an advantage in emphasizing   the Committee’s commitment to a specific numerical inflation objective  As the discussion in   Tealbook makes clear, a well-understood and credible commitment would provide protection   should the timing of our exit—in spite of our best efforts—turn out to be too late  I think   markets are aware of the Committee’s inflation goals, but it could be advantageous to strengthen   this commitment by making it explicit, as in alternative C  Clearly, we would need to lay the   groundwork before adopting a numerical objective, but I support the efforts of President Plosser   on this initiative, and I think this could be a good time to make progress on a longstanding   communications goal    That still gets rid of the nonresidential portion    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I would like to begin by thanking Governor   Duke and Presidents Fisher and Rosengren for serving with me on the subcommittee  And I   want to thank all of you for the very helpful input that you have given us so far   As you may recall, the Chairman gave our subcommittee a three-part charge  He asked   us first to assure appropriate treatment of confidential FOMC information, including our contacts   with the press; second, we were to develop policies to avoid the perception that individuals   outside of the Federal Reserve System are able to gain inappropriate access to FOMC   information that could be valuable in forecasting monetary policy; and, third, we were to develop   policies to ensure that the public communications of FOMC participants do not undermine the   Committee’s decisionmaking process or the effectiveness of monetary policy   After consultation with many of you, the subcommittee thought that the best way to   accomplish the first objective was to strengthen the Program for Security of FOMC Information   by adding an explicit enforcement procedure, and yesterday afternoon you voted on an   amendment designed to accomplish that  So I consider that aspect of our work complete   January 25–26, 2011 197 of 282              To make progress on the remaining two charges, we thought it would be sensible to take   them up sequentially  Today we are particularly seeking your thoughts on how to address the   second charge  What policies should the Committee put in place to avoid perceptions that   individuals outside the Federal Reserve System are able to gain inappropriate access to valuable   FOMC information?  We’d like to hear your thoughts on this topic, and our hope is that we can   return soon, potentially in March, with a revised proposal, and then return to the third question   for discussion   We circulated a set of questions that you should have in front of you to guide discussion,   and we’d like to have a full go-round of the Committee to hear your views  We ask you to   address three questions  The first pertains to access  Should there be limitations on access   between FOMC participants and individuals or firms that stand to gain financially?  And, if so,   where would you draw the line?  The second question pertains to content  Should there be   limitations on the content of meetings and conversations, if access is permitted?  And, third, if   limitations on access and/or content are desirable, should we establish a formal policy   concerning these matters, or simply develop some informal guidelines?   On that issue, you may recall that, in our memo to you dated January 6, our   subcommittee suggested that contacts with financially interested outsiders should, at least in our   view, be addressed by a formal policy  We’re concerned that any perception, whether it’s based   in fact or not, that financially interested outsiders have inappropriate access to FOMC members   or information creates severe reputational risks for the Federal Reserve  Our subcommittee   thought it important for the Committee to have in place a formal policy, the important thing   being that it would be binding on all FOMC participants and not just a guideline that’s voluntary    It would state, in effect, that it is not acceptable for FOMC participants to convey information—  January 25–26, 2011 198 of 282              whether it’s covered by the Program for Security of FOMC Information or whether it’s outside   of that program—that would be likely to confer financial advantage on particular private   consultants and businesses   In contrast, we proposed in our subcommittee memo to you that other matters should be   addressed by informal guidelines, matters such as the blackout period, guidelines about staking   out firm positions, and so forth  But we’re seeking your input and reaction on this question   today, so the third question to you is  Do you agree with our subcommittee that we need a   formal policy on this?   Let me stop there and begin the go-round    Could I just ask a follow-up question?    Do you think it would be okay to talk to the clients of a financial firm   behind closed doors about your personal views on monetary policy?    They could be benefitting    Well, suppose the sponsor is a financial firm, and the firm has arranged a   conference for clients, and you’re asked to be the speaker    Okay    An example is that Merrill Lynch asks you to come to a client conference   where you will be the main speaker    I know exactly what you’re talking about, and I would regard that, after   having contemplated it, as something we absolutely shouldn’t do   January 25–26, 2011 206 of 282               It’s our intention to develop corresponding guidelines    We intend to address that    Well, it seems to me that a formal policy could be a statement of ethical   principles, possibly couched in the positive way that you and Jim and Jeff and others have   proposed  It could be a clear statement of what one’s ethical obligations are  Obviously, there   are gray areas when it comes to specifics  But the idea is that, even though it’s not quite   enforceable, a positive answer to the question “Do you adhere to high ethical standards” is not   voluntary, it’s obligatory    But for supervisory purposes    It’s great that we’re all in agreement  [Laughter]  I appreciate the wide   range of views we’ve heard  I think that, at a minimum, what I would try to accomplish is to   January 25–26, 2011 229 of 282              articulate some overarching philosophy concerning communications that expresses both its   positive value and the ethical principles that we need to adhere to in order to make sure that we   don’t create undue private advantage  How we get past there isn’t obvious; the gray areas here   are immense  I share the view many of you have expressed that these contacts are very valuable   as we carry out our work, and I think our subcommittee really needs to think about whether we   can devise any more-concrete guidelines about how the philosophy applies in specific situations    Again, I appreciate the views you’ve expressed, and, obviously, we have our work cut out for us  "
8953,2011-03-15,"  So moved    Thank you, Mr Chairman  The data we have received since our last   meeting support the view that the recovery is gathering steam and has become self-sustaining    Private demand, rather than temporary fiscal stimulus or inventory investment, is increasingly   powering the expansion  Even so, there are ongoing drags from housing, nonresidential   construction, and state and local government spending, along with new downside risks relating to   possible near-term federal spending cuts and the negative spillovers from higher gas and   commodity prices, and broader uncertainties relating to the Middle East, North Africa, Japan,   and the euro area  These risks to the recovery have grown in recent weeks, and they diminish my   confidence that we will enjoy smooth sailing ahead   With respect to private spending, I am encouraged that business surveys and anecdotal   reports have taken on a more optimistic tone  Businesses appear far more upbeat about sales and   express greater willingness to invest and even hire  These improved attitudes are consistent with   the patterns we are seeing in capital spending  Recent signals pertaining to consumer spending   have been harder to read, but, on balance, they too point to at least moderate growth in line with   disposable income  And surging auto sales suggest a release of pent-up demand   Consumers are hardly ebullient, but they seem more optimistic and for good reasons    The stock market has recovered, labor market conditions have improved somewhat, those with   jobs have less reason to fear losing them, and the burden of debt payments has abated to more   normal levels  Further, a tax cut is beginning to show up in paychecks  Of course, declining   house prices are a continuing negative for household wealth and borrowing capacity, and the   intermeeting evidence suggests that this trend continues unabated   Anecdotal reports suggest that access to financing, especially for car loans, has improved   even for those with poor credit histories, and this may be an additional factor boosting purchases    March 15, 2011 70 of 165              Looking forward, though, I am concerned about the vulnerability of consumer spending to   further upward movements in oil prices  And in this regard, the plunge we saw last Friday in the   Michigan survey’s consumer sentiment measure, serves as a wakeup call   History shows that gas prices are highly salient to households, and rising prices at the   pump can quickly affect consumer confidence  In recent weeks, the negative effect of rising gas   prices on confidence has apparently overwhelmed all of the positive factors that were and should   be boosting confidence  We should expect some toll on spending, because higher oil prices   affect not only consumer psyches but also their purchasing power  Auto purchases could be   especially vulnerable   Turning to the labor market, I see hopeful signs of improvement  Employment is rising   in both the establishment and household surveys, initial claims have declined, and an increasing   fraction of firms indicate an intention to add to their payrolls  That said, like President Evans, I   am skeptical that conditions have improved and slack has diminished by quite as much as   Tealbook assumes, based on the 09 percentage point plunge in the unemployment rate since   November  Such a large decline in the unemployment rate over a short period of time is   historically unprecedented, and to my mind, the patterns in the data are hard to interpret  In   particular, I don’t see much auxiliary evidence to corroborate such a large improvement  For   example, even though employment has expanded in both the household and payroll surveys,   overall job gains since employment stopped falling have been modest, and the gains since   November are far too small to account for such a large drop in unemployment  Furthermore,   there is no evidence of a rebound in labor force participation—something I would expect to see   during a recovery  Hours have also been flat, and this leaves me wondering whether a portion of   the recent decline in unemployment may reflect a shift of discouraged workers from the   March 15, 2011 71 of 165              unemployment pool to those counted as out of the labor force  For example, about 38 million   workers lost their jobs between November 2008 and March 2009, and those who are still   unemployed would have exhausted extended unemployment benefits in recent months  I   recognize that such an interpretation of the data may be completely wrong, but I do see a   significant mystery here, and I hope we can unravel it in the coming months   Turning to inflation, it is clear that headline inflation will be elevated in the months ahead   due to surging energy and commodity prices  Friday’s Michigan survey shows that rising gas   prices have not only lowered consumer sentiment, but already boosted inflationary expectations    The survey reveals a sizable increase in inflation expectations one year ahead and a smaller   increase in inflation expectations at the 5-to-10-year horizon  I view this development with   concern, but I am not alarmed because, as David and others have noted, the pattern we are seeing   is quite typical  Consumers commonly react strongly to contemporaneous movements in   inflation, particularly to gas price increases  In other words, they overreact to recent inflation   data  This suggests that when headline inflation comes down, as I expect it will if commodity   prices either stabilize or reverse course, consumer inflation expectations should fall in tandem    We have seen this pattern repeatedly in the past  With respect to pass-through from higher   commodity prices, the evidence points strongly to only very limited pass-through to core   inflation and inflation expectations since the mid-1980s   I want to thank President Evans for carefully laying out the evidence in his memo to the   Committee, and I would like to say that I completely agree with the conclusions he draws    Thanks to well-anchored inflation expectations and limited pass-through, our Committee has had   a good deal of flexibility in responding to such shocks as oil prices escalated between 2004 and   2008, and my expectation is that monetary policy will probably not need to respond this time   March 15, 2011 72 of 165              around either  That said, it would be dangerous for us to take the stability of long-term inflation   expectations for granted  So we must be vigilant in monitoring data bearing on pass-through of   commodity price increases to core inflation, second-round effects on wages, and movements in   inflationary expectations in the days ahead    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I favor alternative B with the changes   proposed by Presidents Kocherlakota and Williams  I am comfortable with the stance of policy   for now  I favor completing our announced program of Treasury purchases and maintaining the   “extended period” language   The outlook for economic growth has improved somewhat  But regardless of how one   reads the labor market, there is an awfully long road to travel to attain our maximum   employment objective  In addition, both headline and core inflation remain subdued, in spite of   rising commodity prices  I therefore believe we can be patient in withdrawing accommodation    That said, recent commodity price increases do create inflationary risks  And while past   experience provides comfort, it does not guarantee future results  We must certainly monitor   incoming data carefully, and it is conceivable that we may need to respond  Indeed, all along,   our “extended period” pledge has been tied to economic conditions, including subdued inflation   trends and stable inflation expectations   With respect to tapering, I see no particular need, given our past experience and Brian’s   discussion, to taper our purchases as the program winds down  On paragraph 3, therefore, my   preference is to exclude the bracketed language  Information on the pace of purchases would be   needed if the Committee intended to vary the pace in coming months, but without tapering, I   believe it would be more confusing to markets to include wording we omitted last time   Looking ahead, the risks to the outlook for both inflation and economic growth have, to   my mind, increased considerably  We need to be prepared to respond to whatever developments   unfold in the days ahead  So even as we return to planning for an eventual exit from our   accommodative policy, I consider it important to remain prepared to provide additional stimulus   should downside risks to the expansion materialize   March 15, 2011 118 of 165               Thank you, Mr Chairman  I would like to begin with a few comments   concerning the subcommittee’s rationale for moving ahead with press conferences  And I’d like   to then highlight a couple of aspects of the arrangements that we are recommending   When the subcommittee on communications was reconstituted last fall, a crucial element   of our mission was to consider approaches for ensuring that the public understands both the   consensus of the Committee and the diversity of views among individual participants  One   obvious pitfall of our existing communications framework is that after the end of each blackout   period, the timing and sequencing of participants’ speeches and other external communications   has been rather random  And it’s become increasingly apparent that such a random ordering can   contribute to public confusion about our monetary policy decisions   In considering how to redress this problem, we looked closely at the experience of other   central banks, especially ones where monetary policy decisions are made by committees    Although the communications practices of foreign central banks are diverse, we found it notable   that press conferences are held by all of the major foreign central banks, and, indeed, by nearly   all central banks in foreign industrial countries, the only exceptions being Australia, Denmark,   Iceland, and the national central banks of the euro area  Such press conferences are uniformly   seen as an important and effective communications tool  Moreover, for central banks like the   March 15, 2011 128 of 165              ECB and the Bank of England, regular press conferences seem to have been particularly helpful   recently in highlighting the consensus of the policy committee in a context where a diversity of   views has been readily apparent to the public   In light of those considerations, the subcommittee recommends that the Chairman   conduct quarterly press conferences in the afternoon after the conclusion of each two-day FOMC   meeting  The ECB, the Bank of England, and the Bank of Canada each conduct press   conferences while the markets are open  The purpose is to allow any news to be digested into   market prices   Now, to accomplish this, we would need to issue the FOMC statement somewhat earlier   after two-day meetings  And, in particular, we would propose that the first day of each two-day   meeting would start two hours earlier so that we could conclude by 11 am on the second day,   issue a statement at 115 pm, and then begin the press briefings at 215 pm   The approach recommended by the subcommittee would ensure that the Chairman is the   first person on the Committee who communicates with the public after each two-day FOMC   meeting  As in each of his speeches and testimony on monetary policy, the Chairman would try   to convey the sense of the Committee’s thinking at these press conferences while making note of   the diversity of views, as appropriate  Of course, given the dynamic and interactive nature of a   press conference, it is important to recognize that the Chairman would need to have full   ownership of the answers that he gives in Q&A, and we recommend that this same principle   would apply to any prepared remarks that he would present at the start of each press conference   One significant benefit of initiating these press conferences is that there could be a   corresponding shortening of the blackout period following each two-day FOMC meeting    Needless to say, no Committee participant should be present at the press conference themselves,   March 15, 2011 129 of 165              and FOMC participants should not have contact with media representatives afterward    Moreover, the subcommittee recommends that all forms of external communications—that   includes speeches, editorials, and media interviews—would be embargoed until the end of the   postmeeting blackout period  But the subcommittee thinks that a blackout period ending at noon   Eastern Time on the day after two-day FOMC meetings would be appropriate  Such an   arrangement would help keep public attention focused on the FOMC meeting statement and the   Chairman’s press conference for a full media cycle, including the TV news on Wednesday   evening, as well as the newspapers on Thursday morning  Under these arrangements, each of   you would be completely free to communicate your own individual views on monetary policy   starting on the Thursday afternoon after each two-day FOMC meeting  I should also note that   our subcommittee has not yet reached any conclusions about other potential changes in the   blackout period, such as the timing of the blackout for one-day meetings  Rather, any such   recommendations will be brought forward for your consideration at a later date   Our subcommittee believes that press conferences could be particularly useful if the   Chairman is able to make reference to the contours of the latest SEP projections in his opening   remarks as well as in Q&A  Such an approach would likely draw greater public attention to our   economic outlook and could be helpful in explaining how the Committee’s policy strategy is   informed by our longer-run projections for output growth and unemployment and our individual   assessments of the mandate-consistent inflation rate  And, in fact, by incorporating information   from the SEP, we believe that these press conferences would significantly enhance FOMC   communications regarding the Committee’s overarching policy framework as well as our   specific policy decisions   March 15, 2011 130 of 165              Of course, to the extent that these press conferences draw greater public attention to the   SEP, it will be helpful to keep in mind that the SEP itself is a communication tool that may well   evolve somewhat over time  For example, one fairly obvious limitation of the SEP is that it   doesn’t include any information about our individual assessments regarding the appropriate path   of policy, even though our projections for economic activity and inflation are contingent on these   policy assessments  The Chairman may wish to respond to any such questions by noting that   potential enhancements to the SEP will be considered as part of the Committee’s ongoing efforts   to enhance our public communications   Finally, the subcommittee recommends moving forward with these press conferences   starting with the April FOMC meeting  The April meeting is a two-day meeting  It is the last   meeting until October that will not be followed with Humphrey-Hawkins testimony  That   meeting may be particularly consequential, because the Committee will be deciding whether to   complete the final phase of our $600 billion asset purchase program, and we may well be   considering certain aspects of our policy strategy over horizons extending beyond the end of   June   About 10 days ago we circulated—and I hope you have in front of you—a set of   questions to guide our discussion now  I am not proposing we have a full go-round, but it would   be very helpful if you would make note of any specific concerns you might have about moving   forward with this initiative, and if you would indicate whether you agree that the first such press   conference should take place following the April FOMC meeting  Let me stop there and, rather   than have a full go-round, please feel free to make comments or pose questions to either of us   March 15, 2011 131 of 165               I guess what I mean is that if he makes some remarks, they are his   remarks as opposed to something that he would need to have approved by the Committee  The   FOMC statement would remain, obviously, a full Committee statement   March 15, 2011 132 of 165               That is different    Dennis    I don’t think we are envisioning any change in the way the statement   would be crafted  And we would be getting the statement out to the press an hour before the   press conference begins, so that reporters have a chance to absorb it, and then ask intelligent   questions at the press conference    Narayana   March 15, 2011 134 of 165               I guess on the issue of what happens after one-day meetings, the thought   here was to begin in a more controlled way with two-day meetings  But there’s nothing in this   proposal that ultimately would rule out having this after other meetings as well, but we certainly   didn’t want to start there    The distinguishing feature of the two-day meetings is the economic   projections and the ability that that would give the Chairman to explain our overall framework   and put decisions into the context of them    Jeff    The answer, I guess, is that the bond markets close at three      Sarah    Absolutely  Everybody is covered  It would be until noon the next day    It covers everybody and all forms of communication on the economy or monetary policy    Charlie    My own sense is that’s entirely possible that we may come to view   ourselves as having greater flexibility in the statement once the Chairman is just several hours   later taking Q&A about our policy and commenting on it  But it’s hard to predict exactly how   that’s going to evolve over time    Dennis    It does sound helpful  I note there are a lot of conferences; often our   Banks have conferences on Fridays, so it has been a problem for people that we need to make   speeches on the Friday after an FOMC    I think it would be very useful to get a sense of the Committee on when   to end the blackout period after these two-day meetings  Betsy, do you want to weigh in on that?    Dennis    Other comments on this?  Jim?    Charlie    Let’s see if we can get a consensus; let me try to get an overall sense of   how people feel about the blackout period and when to end it  In a way, I think Bill has come up   with a nice compromise between the two things  Let me put his proposal forward first, which is,   the blackout period would run through Thursday  On Friday, people would be free to go out and   give speeches, and that addresses the issue of conferences on Fridays  Hopefully, people would   show self-restraint, though  I do hope this isn’t going to become, “Oh, the Chairman got out   there, so now we have to race to give interviews the moment the blackout ends”  But let me try   Bill’s compromise approach  Blackout would go through Thursday  By a show of hands, how   do people feel about that?    I was thinking of these three choices  Thursday at noon is one choice;   end of the day on Thursday—I guess, midnight—is the second choice; and current blackout time   on Friday is the third choice  Starting with the one in the middle, because it got considerable   support  [Show of hands]  How about the shorter blackout period, through Thursday at noon?    [Show of hands]  And the longer blackout period, our current practice going all the way through   Friday?  [Show of hands]  So it looks to me like, Bill’s approach    Okay  So I guess I’m seeing considerable support for Vice Chairman   Dudley’s suggestion    Yes, this is just about the two-day meetings  There’s no change that   we’re proposing for the one-day meetings or beforehand, but that’s something our Subcommittee   could also take up and might come back with further proposals concerning the blackouts    Okay  So I did start out by saying we’re only talking about the blackout   after two-day meetings  We have drifted into a discussion of why not shorten it after the one-day   meetings, and the subcommittee really hasn’t discussed that, but it would be useful to have a   sense    Suppose we said, for all meetings the blackout period goes through   Thursday midnight?   PARTICIPANTS  Yes It’s a good start    Yes?   PARTICIPANTS  Yes    We just cut a day off the blackout period    Right  For all meetings, whether there’s a press conference or not  So   Friday, now, we’re proposing, is okay  Anybody have a—Bill, you have a look of discomfort    Okay  Fridays we’re free    Okay  Thank you  "
8978,2011-04-26,"  So moved    Second    Second     Second    Thank you, Mr Chairman  And let me add my thanks to the staff for   their helpful background papers and to President Plosser for his thoughtful memo   As I reviewed those materials, I was struck that the problem before us is a classic   example of an underdetermined optimization problem  There are a number of free parameters   and a multiplicity of ways we can set our instruments to attain any particular macroeconomic   outcome  In selecting among the various options, I believe we should focus on approaches that,   first, serve to simplify and, therefore, facilitate our internal decisionmaking as we respond over   time to evolving economic developments  And, second, we should focus on approaches that   facilitate clarity in our external communications to the public   An analogy might be helpful in explaining what I have in mind  Imagine that our   Committee is the flight crew of a Boeing 747  We need to land at night at a nearly deserted   airport, but we discover that the air traffic controller has fallen asleep on the job  [Laughter]    The good news is, we have a brilliant and highly experienced pilot, and all of us trust him to   accomplish a safe landing  Nonetheless, we have to keep in mind a few key facts  First, the   instrument panel of a Boeing 747 has lots of dials and instruments  There is no unique right way   to adjust them during the approach  Second, the cockpit is crowded, and the crew needs to work   April 26–27, 2011 73 of 244              together harmoniously to execute a successful landing  And, third, the passengers are all   listening on the intercom system—[laughter]—and may be prone to panic  Our communications   need to be clear, simple, and reassuring   How does this analogy apply to our exit strategy?  Well, first and foremost, I suggest that   we agree on where we’re landing  [Laughter]  In the context of our exit strategy, where we are   landing includes a number of distinct components  The first relates to our dual mandate   objectives  We need to be clear, both internally and in our public communications, that, first and   foremost, our exit strategy is designed to facilitate their attainment  Second, the Federal Reserve   is also responsible to contribute to the effective and efficient functioning of financial markets, so   we should avoid needless disruption  And, finally, there are questions relating to the ultimate   size and composition of our balance sheet and the operating strategy we’ve planned for the   conduct of policy when life returns to normal  I consider it desirable for us to decide and   communicate early our decisions concerning all of these matters, not leave them unsettled for   months or years to come   In this regard, I support all three principles listed in item number 4 of the “Questions for   Discussion” handout, and I think it would be very helpful, Mr Chairman, for you to convey them   in your press conference tomorrow  I think it would also be beneficial for us to reach some   consensus on our long-run operating framework  And I personally could support a return over   time to a corridor-style operating framework in which the fed funds target is our primary   instrument of monetary policy, even though I do see some advantages of a floor framework   Turning next to our landing procedures, the memos and our previous discussion make   clear that there are many options consistent with any given macroeconomic outcome  All in all, I   see a strong rationale for following a KISS—or Keep It Simple, Stupid—approach  I see a   April 26–27, 2011 74 of 244              compelling case for setting the path of the federal funds rate target in a state-contingent manner   that would be consistent with our past practice and with market experience and expectations    Those of us in the cockpit have followed this approach in the past, so it should facilitate our   decisionmaking process  For the passengers, too, it is familiar, and therefore likely to be   reassuring  And, in particular, I would be strongly opposed to an exit strategy in which   adjustments for both our balance sheet and the federal funds rate target are highly state-  contingent   Making use of two monetary policy instruments at the same time has no clear benefits but   would surely introduce a further layer of complexity into our decisionmaking process and our   public communications  I think we should follow a largely predetermined approach to   normalizing the size and composition of our balance sheet  I would prefer for us to agree on that   approach as soon as possible and explain it clearly to the public   Regarding the initial stages of the descent, I would support stopping reinvestment of   principal as a first step, and my assumption has been that that would include both Treasury and   agency securities  But I think it would be useful, in light of the issue that President Kocherlakota   raised, to maybe just see a bit more staff analysis on the implications of allowing MBS to run off    I suspect that a decision to suspend our reinvestment policy will clearly signal the onset of policy   firming to the markets and the public  Therefore, I am not certain there is any particular   advantage in waiting to drop the “extended period” language  It might, instead, be helpful to   follow a simpler exit sequence in which we move simultaneously to suspend reinvestment policy   and change our forward guidance   Turning to the issue of asset sales, I think they should be gradual, predictable, and   announced in advance  Beyond that, I am open to considering various possibilities  For   April 26–27, 2011 75 of 244              example, I would be open to decoupling our strategy for normalizing the size of the balance   sheet from our strategy for normalizing its composition  My assumption is that it is the size of   our longer-term securities holdings, rather than their composition as between agency and   Treasury securities, that affects term premiums and the stance of policy  I also assume that such   a shift would have only a negligible effect on MBS spreads  If these assumptions are correct, we   could begin to normalize the composition of our balance sheet fairly soon  For example, the   Desk could initiate gradual and predictable sales of agency MBS maybe on the order of   $10 billion or $15 billion a month, reinvesting the proceeds into Treasuries   I would only want our balance sheet to begin shrinking when we have concluded that the   process of policy firming should commence  When that point arrives, though, along with   suspending the reinvestment policy, we could also stop rolling over the proceeds of these MBS   sales into Treasuries  This strategy would facilitate a moderately faster shrinkage of our balance   sheet and would reduce the quantity of bank reserves by a nonnegligible amount before any   increase in IOER  An advantage of this strategy is that, with a smaller quantity of reserves, we   may have greater confidence in the ability of our reserve draining tools to sufficiently tighten the   link between IOER and the federal funds rate  I may be wrong to worry about this link between   IOER and the federal funds rate, but, like President Evans, I do have some concerns about how   tight that link will be  And I think a tighter linkage between these rates would prove helpful for   both internal decisionmaking and external communications     Thank you, Mr Chairman  My view of the modal outlook is little   changed since our March meeting  I agree with the contours of the Tealbook and in particular   with the judgment that the first-quarter soft patch probably reflects idiosyncratic factors with   relatively little bearing on the outlook  I anticipate economic growth at a moderate pace during   the second half of the year and expect it to strengthen over time   An armada of headwinds is constraining the recovery  higher food and energy prices,   falling housing prices, ongoing weakness in residential and nonresidential construction, intense   pressures on state and local government spending, and, beginning next year, significant fiscal   drag from the federal budget  Nonetheless, I anticipate that the impetus from investment and   consumer spending, along with robust global growth, will prove powerful enough to overcome   these drags  Business confidence has improved markedly  Manufacturing activity is robust    Our accommodative monetary policy has caused credit and broader financial conditions to ease,   supporting aggregate demand through many different channels  There are heartening signs of   improvement in the labor market, and recent data suggest that unemployment and vacancies are   now tracing the cyclical pattern that has been typical of past recoveries  I see this as encouraging   evidence that unemployment is mainly cyclical, not structural, and should, therefore, revert to   normal as the recovery proceeds  My bottom line is that the US economy appears to be in a   self-sustaining recovery that is proceeding at a moderate pace  I expect the output gap and   unemployment to decline, but slowly, so both will be substantially higher than normal levels at   the end of the forecast horizon   Turning to inflation, measures of underlying inflation remain well below the 2 percent   level I consider consistent with our dual mandate  For example, the market-based core PCE   April 26–27, 2011 147 of 244              price index has risen less than 1 percent over the past year, and at an annual rate of 12 percent   over the three months ending in February  These inflation outcomes partly reflect healthy   productivity growth and modest wage increases  Unit labor costs have barely increased since   2007  Moreover, inflation expectations remain generally well anchored  Higher commodity   prices have naturally caused headline inflation to surge in recent months  Core inflation has also   picked up somewhat as producers are passing through a portion of their higher input costs into   the prices of a broad range of goods and services  However, as long as commodity prices   generally level off, I expect that by around midyear, headline inflation will revert to rates close to   those of core inflation, which in turn should decline significantly over the second half of this   year  With exceptional slack in the labor market throughout the forecast horizon, I see little   chance of the second-round effects that would occur were employers to boost wages in an effort   to compensate workers for the real income losses they have sustained  And here I agree very   much with President Williams’s comment that there is virtually no evidence in the United States   of real-wage rigidity  Therefore, I expect inflation to remain subdued throughout the end of the   forecast horizon   My modal forecast is benign, but the risks surrounding it keep me awake at night  As   policymakers, our job is to be prepared to respond to a wide array of potential threats, and some   could necessitate more-rapid policy tightening, whereas others would call for additional policy   accommodation  We therefore need to maintain open minds on the future stance of monetary   policy   The most obvious risks relate to commodity prices  Higher food and energy prices are   sapping household purchasing power, and the effect is evident in consumer surveys and   anecdotal reports of retrenchment by the lower-income households most severely affected    April 26–27, 2011 148 of 244              Anecdotal evidence also suggests that the uncertainty associated with recent commodity price   trends is causing some businesses to put expansion plans on hold  These existing downside risks   are compounded by the possibility that futures prices notwithstanding, commodity prices could   escalate a lot further, potentially derailing the incipient recovery  Were such a scenario to   materialize, we might well conclude that policy should be more accommodative than in the   Tealbook baseline  Of course, we must also be prepared for the possibility that a further surge in   commodity prices could push up inflation and inflationary expectations, triggering a wage–price   spiral to take hold  Such a development would necessitate a significant policy response  Our   experience during 2002 to 2008, when oil prices more than quadrupled, but measures of   underlying inflation remained close to 2 percent, gives me comfort that commodity price   movements need not trigger such an outcome, but we cannot take such a benign scenario for   granted   I actually have quite a long list of risks that I worry about, but I’ll mention just one other    A second risk that worries me relates to fiscal policy  Meaningful efforts to cut the federal   budget deficit could produce a significant and extended drag on economic growth in the years   ahead  The recognition in the Congress that a multiyear budget plan to stabilize the US   debt-to-GDP ratio is essential to fiscal sustainability and longer run economic growth is   heartening  Failure to enact such a package would threaten our financial stability, while an   extended period of delay would be associated with elevated uncertainty that could start weighing   heavily on the spending decisions of households and businesses  However, the needed fiscal   adjustment is substantial, and a program on the necessary scale could be associated with   significant fiscal drag that would reduce the equilibrium real interest rate in coming years  In   April 26–27, 2011 149 of 244              this scenario, a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy could be appropriate for quite   some time    I just wanted to ask the staff—isn’t it the case that the broader measures   of unemployment have declined less than the official measure?   April 26–27, 2011 158 of 244               Will do   April 26–27, 2011 182 of 244               Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support alternative B  I consider the   current stance of monetary policy to be warranted by economic conditions  The unemployment   rate remains well above its longer-run sustainable rate, and, as I noted in the economic go-round,   this gap mainly reflects a shortfall in aggregate demand rather than structural factors  Moreover,   longer-run inflation expectations remain reasonably stable, and I anticipate that headline inflation   will subside later this year to a level close to underlying inflation, which remains substantially   below my assessment of the mandate-consistent inflation rate  I expect the economic recovery to   continue at a gradual pace and inflation to remain subdued over the next several years  I,   therefore, support the continuation of our forward guidance that the federal funds rate is likely to   remain exceptionally low for an extended period   And I support the completion of our $600 billion asset purchase program  I think the   effect of that program began working its way through the pipeline even before we announced it   last November, and market expectations have been conditioned all along on the assumption that   we would follow through and complete the purchases  So in response to President Bullard’s   argument that we should stop early, I would say that the failure to complete the program would   April 26–27, 2011 198 of 244              surprise markets, and it would boost longer-term rates right now  In effect, such a decision   would amount to a withdrawal of policy stimulus now, and that’s a policy shift that I don’t   consider warranted at this time  I also think it would impair the Fed’s credibility and   unnecessarily whipsaw financial markets   My views on the appropriate path for monetary policy generally accord with the   Tealbook baseline, but I see risks to the inflation outlook that could warrant an earlier onset and   more rapid pace of policy firming  In particular, if a continued run-up in commodity prices   appeared to be sparking a wage–price spiral, then underlying inflation would begin trending   upward and a policy response would be imperative  In light of the experience of the 1970s, it’s   clear we cannot be complacent about the stability of longer-term inflation expectations, and we   must be prepared to take decisive action, if needed, to ensure that they remain firmly anchored    On the other hand, our policy decisions and communications must also take into account the fact   that there remain material downside risks to economic activity and inflation  At our March   meeting, we generally agreed that the recovery was on a firmer footing, but the incoming   information over the past six weeks has been notably less upbeat   I still expect the recovery to proceed at a moderate pace, and I’m glad we have resumed   the exit strategy discussions  But let’s be mindful of the possibility of déjà vu  We could still   discover over the coming months that the modest pace of GDP growth last quarter was more than   just a soft patch  Given the very high bar for launching a third round of asset purchases, this   suggests that we should be cautious about moving too quickly to initiate the process of policy   firming   On the various language issues, I do understand the logic of including the bracketed   “[generally]” in paragraph 1, and I could certainly live with doing it  On balance, I guess I do   April 26–27, 2011 199 of 244              think it would be quite a significant change and would be perceived that way by the markets  I’d   prefer to omit it  I think longer-term inflation compensation, as measured by TIPS, is within   historical ranges, and staff analysis supports the view that the recent uptick since our last meeting   is actually due to changing liquidity and inflation risk premiums  So I could go either way on   that, but would prefer to omit it  And on the language in paragraph 2, on balance, I would   support President Evans’s suggestion that we include the modifier “headline” in front of   “inflation”    Finally, I wanted to mention that I really appreciated Narayana’s memo about using the   Taylor (1999) rule to gauge the appropriate timing of policy liftoff  I’ve actually been a   long-time proponent of using simple rules as benchmarks for monetary policy, which is not to   say at all that we can just put policy on autopilot, blindly following the prescriptions of any   single rule  I don’t think—and the Chairman’s discussion yesterday showed this—that we can   use them to absolutely pinpoint a moment when we need to begin tightening  But I think that   giving greater prominence to such rules could facilitate our internal decisionmaking process and   would be helpful in explaining what we are doing to the public  "
9006,2011-06-21,"  So moved    I want to thank you very much for an excellent presentation, and to   applaud the staff’s work in the collaboration that you have going here on DSGE models  I think   it’s extremely valuable, and I agree with you that these models can play a very useful role in   medium-term forecasts  I hope that the Committee will be able to routinely look at forecasts   June 21–22, 2011 17 of 282              generated by the suite of models you’ve described, along with FRB/US and SIGMA and other   models that we have here at the Board   I just want to make one suggestion about something that I would find useful  I’ve long   been a fan of using simple rules as benchmarks for monetary policy  And I think   macroeconomic models can play a key role in formulating and comparing these rules  President   Williams has written important papers showing that, in gauging the performance of simple rules,   it is important to use a range of alternative models to help identify rules that would be robust to   uncertainty, particularly uncertainty about the structure of the economy, as well as shocks  So I   want to suggest and encourage staff to potentially conduct an analysis of simple monetary policy   rules using the DSGE models that you have presented to us today, and we could do the same   thing using other models at the Board—FRB/US and SIGMA, which is an open economy DSGE   model that’s been developed here  I know we’ve talked about possibly having a future   discussion of monetary policy rules, and I think this would be a potentially useful part of it    I have a difficulty with President Kocherlakota’s interpretation of   “extended period,” although I completely agree with him that it’s appropriate for us to discuss   June 21–22, 2011 41 of 282              and clarify what we mean  I don’t think that dropping “extended period” should imply that the   Committee anticipates raising the target funds rate in three to six months  I would, instead, say   that it means it will be at least three to six months  It could be a lot longer, because my   interpretation is that when we include “extended period” language in the statement, we are   saying the FOMC sees very low probability that it will need to tighten in three to six months, or   two to four meetings  Once the probability has risen sufficiently that we think we might need to   tighten—but we could be talking about a probability that is a lot lower than 50 percent—then it   becomes appropriate to drop the language to give the Committee flexibility to move as needed    But when we drop it, we may not anticipate moving  The odds may be lower than 50 percent    And, in fact, the funds rate target could well—depending on how things materialize—stay   exceptionally low for a very long time, even though we got rid of the language    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support the proposed exit strategy   principles  My preference is to remove the time references in line with President Rosengren’s   suggestion, but I saw including the more specific time frames as an attempt to compromise  I do   think it is very valuable to reach consensus here  I think, if we can endorse a consensus view, it   will simplify our communications, reassure markets, and enhance the predictability of market   responses to our actions  I think this is very worthwhile  I’d prefer no timing references but   could live with it as is    So moved    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Like everyone around this table, I grappled   with two main questions in developing my forecast for this round  First, does the unanticipated   weakness in economic activity evidenced since April represent a temporary soft patch or,   instead, a more significant and disturbing absence or loss of momentum?  And second, does the   recent escalation in inflation represent a temporary bulge or, instead, portend a more persistent   upward shift in the medium-term inflation outlook?  I found the second question easier to answer   than the first, so let me start with inflation   The key question bearing on the medium-term inflation outlook is how to account for the   very substantial increase we have seen in core  For example, core PCE inflation in the three   months ending in April, and core CPI inflation in the three months ending in May, were   19 percent and 25 percent, respectively  And that contrasts with 08 percent and 06 percent   inflation for the same indexes in 2010  Delving into the details, it appears that a large fraction of   June 21–22, 2011 141 of 282              this increase was attributable to surging commodity and food prices and the Japanese supply   disruptions  In particular, exceptionally large increases in the PCE prices of transportation,   restaurant services, and motor vehicles and parts explain a substantial fraction of the run-up in   the core PCE  A whopping 08 percentage point of the roughly 2 percentage point step-up in   core CPI inflation reflected higher prices of new and used motor vehicles  With popular models   in short supply, there has apparently been less discounting and fewer incentives, and pressures   have spilled over to the used car market  We should also not be surprised to see limited pass-  through of recent commodity price increases in a broad array of non-energy goods and services    Our directors and business contacts have told us consistently that they intend to pass higher input   costs on to their consumers, and it seems obvious from the data that they have succeeded    Importantly, commodity prices have stabilized, even receded a bit, and Japanese production has   come quickly back on line, so these pressures on core should dissipate going forward  With   stable longer-term inflation expectations, minimal cost pressure from wages, moderate   productivity gains, and a higher projected path for unemployment, I anticipate, in line with the   Tealbook, that inflation over the forecast period horizon will decline below the 2 percent level I   consider most consistent with our dual mandate   Turning to the weakness in spending, I had a much harder time deciding how large a   share to attribute to rising food and energy prices and the Japanese supply disruptions  Higher   food and gas prices have taken an obvious toll on cash-strapped consumers  This is evident in   anecdotal reports indicating that businesses catering to lower-income consumers have seen   particularly large declines in sales  The response of consumer spending to the increase in higher   food and energy prices may have been abnormally large in recent months, given that a sizable   fraction of households are currently underwater in their mortgages and heavily credit and   June 21–22, 2011 142 of 282              liquidity constrained  And with exceptionally high unemployment, many households may be   unable or reluctant to respond by tapping precautionary savings  However, with commodity   prices having stabilized, even receding slightly, and Japanese production coming back on line, it   seems reasonable to project that the growth rate of consumer spending will pick up noticeably in   coming quarters  That said, I followed the Tealbook’s lead and lowered slightly my medium-  term economic growth forecast in response to incoming data  I also revised my risk assessment   relating to growth from balanced to skewed to the downside  These revisions reflect the   broad-based character of the recent weakness and my growing concern that business confidence   is eroding, causing firms to put plans for capital projects and hiring on hold—a response I see as   exacerbating the slowdown and creating the potential for a self-fulfilling negative feedback loop   to develop, a phenomenon that could cause the recovery to stall   During the past month or so, I have met with Reserve Bank directors here at the Board   and on a visit to Cleveland, and I have been carefully reading the reports that the Reserve Bank   presidents submit in conjunction with your discount rate requests  The two words that crop up   continually are “uncertainty” and “caution”  Survey measures of business confidence have   declined, and a growing, albeit ill-defined, sense of malaise has surfaced  It reflects uncertainty   about the strength and the durability of the recovery, along with myriad other worries including   concerns about ongoing sovereign debt issues in Europe and the United States, uncertainty about   fiscal and regulatory policy, and anxiety about geopolitical risks in the Middle East and North   Africa   In this regard, an interesting Tealbook box documents that uncertainty, while below the   highs achieved during the financial crisis, is now abnormally high  Interesting theoretical work   by Nick Bloom at Stanford has modeled time-varying uncertainty  Bloom finds that increases in   June 21–22, 2011 143 of 282              uncertainty can lead to large drops in economic activity because a rise in uncertainty makes firms   cautious  It causes them to pause hiring and investment  Of course, our Chairman’s early   research focused on exactly such behavior  He developed a theory of cyclical investment   fluctuations based on the idea that events whose implications are uncertain can depress   investment by temporarily increasing the returns to waiting for additional information  Waiting   is a way to avoid costly mistakes  The reports of Reserve Bank directors provide abundant   evidence of such behavior  They routinely report that, because of heightened uncertainty, they   are postponing hiring and investment decisions, and, more generally, deferring commitments  In   financial markets, we have witnessed a pullback from risk-taking activity that may reflect similar   motivations  For example, conversations of our staff with market participants after the June   SCOOS survey point to a broadened, persistent decline in the use of leverage by investors  Our   staff notes that this phenomenon appears to be longer-lived and to lack any specific and   identifiable trigger, instead reflecting a confluence of worries about sovereign debt, geopolitical   risks, and a slower pace of recovery  Market participants report that this pullback has been   accompanied by a significant decline in market liquidity   While firms and investors are apparently waiting for the fog of uncertainty to lift, my   modal outlook is that it will  It is premised on the assumption that a revival in auto production   and sales next quarter, coupled with diminishing drag from food and energy prices, will cause   economic activity to rebound in coming quarters, in turn diminishing business uncertainty,   improving confidence, and setting the stage for moderate economic growth  The current   weakness is, thus, a soft patch  But I also attach some probability to a darker scenario in which   businesses’ responses to uncertainty add to the numerous other headwinds and financial risks and   end up aborting an already fragile recovery   June 21–22, 2011 144 of 282               Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support alternative B  The description of   the economy appropriately acknowledges the fact that incoming data have been weak, and the   labor market appears to have lost momentum  My own view is that the risks to the outlook have   now shifted to the downside as in alternative A, and I would be comfortable including the   “downside risks” sentence from A in B as President Rosengren suggested, but I do not think it is   absolutely necessary at this point to refer explicitly to downside risks in the statement  Given my   forecast for very moderate output growth over the next few years, a higher path for the   unemployment rate, a path for inflation that remains under 2 percent for the entire forecast   horizon, and inflation risks that are balanced, I remain very comfortable with our current   reinvestment policy and with the “extended period” language  Like the Tealbook and the   June 21–22, 2011 189 of 282              markets, I have pushed out my expectation about how long we’re likely to keep our funds rate   target near zero during this intermeeting period  I still think our next move will be toward less,   rather than additional, monetary accommodation, but I agree with Presidents Rosengren,   Williams, and Evans that we need to do contingency planning, including a consideration of   further steps that we might take should the outlook deteriorate more substantially  7  Thank you, Mr Chairman  And I, too, want to start by expressing my   gratitude to Governor Duke and to Presidents Fisher and Rosengren for all of their contributions   over the past several months in the work of our subcommittee  Today we’d like to present for   the Committee’s consideration a pair of policies concerning the external communications of   Committee participants and Federal Reserve System staff, respectively  In drafting these   policies, we benefited enormously from the Committee’s extended discussion of   communications issues last January and from many helpful comments and suggestions we   received after we circulated initial drafts of these policies to the Committee in mid-May  We’ve   made a number of revisions in response to your input   Before moving these policies for adoption, however, I’d like to make a couple of   comments about their overarching purpose  First, each policy is framed as a set of general   principles, not a detailed rule book  The policies include some examples to illustrate the   application of these principles, but each policy concludes by noting that those examples are not   intended to serve as an exhaustive list, and hence that good judgment will be essential in   applying the principles  As an analogy, one might think of these principles as corresponding to   the Ten Commandments, while the list of examples is akin to Talmudic commentary  [Laughter]   Second, these policies are intended to represent the broad consensus of the Committee   regarding the principles that should apply to our external communications  Indeed, I hope that   virtually anyone who looks at the policies would see these principles as essentially   unobjectionable and consistent with common sense  One important consequence is that the                                                     7The materials for the discussion of policies on external communications are appended to this transcript  (appendix 7)    June 21–22, 2011 201 of 282              policies do not extend to some aspects of our external communications on which there is no clear   consensus  An example would be the extent to which participants should avoid staking out   positions in advance of FOMC meetings   Third, these policies are intended to reinforce the public’s confidence in the transparency   and integrity of our monetary policy process  If the Committee proceeds to adopt the policies,   that decision will be reported in the minutes of this meeting, and I wanted to note that our plan is   to post the policies on our public website  But we don’t anticipate doing so with trumpets and   fanfare surrounding their publication  Rather, I think it’s reasonable to view the adoption of   these policies as essentially clarifying and formalizing the set of principles that we have been   previously following, but on an informal basis  To introduce another analogy, we could view   this step as roughly equivalent to moving from a common law system to a written constitution,   although I will defer to the lawyers on our Committee if they disagree with that analogy   Fourth, these policies are intended to complement the ethics principles in the Federal   Reserve Administrative Manual (FRAM) and other codes of ethical conduct for Federal Reserve   officials and staff  However, those ethics codes are mainly oriented toward avoiding conflicts of   interest in financial transactions, whereas these policies are focused on external communications    It’s also worth noting that the guidelines in FRAM, which were adopted in 1970, are labeled as   voluntary  That suggests that a senior Federal Reserve official could simply opt out of the policy   at any time  If our goal is to reinforce the public’s confidence in the integrity of our contacts   with outside individuals and organizations, I think it’s essential to establish a binding set of   principles to govern our external communications  In particular, these policies indicate that the   FOMC itself will be responsible for ensuring that all Committee participants abide by these   June 21–22, 2011 202 of 282              principles while each Bank president will be responsible for overseeing the conduct of that   Bank’s staff, and the Chairman will maintain that responsibility for Board staff   Finally, I want to emphasize that, in contrast to the Ten Commandments, the specific   language of these policies is not written in stone  I would instead hope that these principles will   be living and breathing documents that the Committee will reaffirm at our organizational   meeting each January, and that they can evolve over time as appropriate  For example, we have   to ensure that the policy pertaining to staff doesn’t inadvertently hamper their research activities,   since that research plays such a key role in advancing our understanding of monetary policy    Therefore, over the coming months, I think it would be very helpful if the research directors were   to take a very close look at the practical implications of the staff policy and to report back to us   about any fine-tuning adjustments that they think would be helpful or necessary   So let me stop there  I’d like to move adoption of these policies by the Committee, and   I’d be happy to address any specific questions  Dan    Thanks for the question  I’d be happy to clarify and welcome other   members of the subcommittee to weigh in on this  There was no intention in this revision to   delineate anything about acceptable or unacceptable forums or forms of communication  So we   used the phrase “meetings or conversations” as a synonym for the word “contacts,” which   appears in a number of other places in the policy, and so I translate “meetings or conversations”   as simply broadly referring to all contacts  We use the term “members of the public”  And that’s   a phrase that appears repeatedly in the policy and is meant to refer to all members of the public   and, for example, would include the press    Correct  Jim    Maybe I’ll just respond briefly on the first two  With respect to the   potential chilling effect on staff research, that’s certainly something that the subcommittee has   absolutely no intention of having occur, and because we all realize that these are principles,   we’ve only given a few examples of how these principles would apply in areas that are either   clearly black or clearly white, and we recognize that there are gray areas  I think those types of   examples would be very helpful, especially for staff  That’s why I particularly would urge the   research directors to sit down and to discuss concrete examples  I don’t know the Eggertsson   paper, so I can’t weigh in on the particulars there, but we have thought about whether or not this   principle applying to staff would restrict legitimate and valuable research, and as we’ve thought   about it, I don’t see that it will  What the principle is saying is that the official staff—that is,   officers—should not express normative views about forthcoming policy decisions  That doesn’t   mean you can’t do a research paper and say a particular consideration, like the impact of energy   prices on future core inflation, would suggest a particular policy approach  What’s to be avoided   is saying, “In my personal view, I believe that in an upcoming meeting, the right thing for the   FOMC to do is X”  There could be a consideration you’ve discussed in a research paper that   June 21–22, 2011 207 of 282              points in a particular direction  You articulate that, but as long as you recognize that, for   example, when the FOMC makes decisions, there are a lot of different things on the table at the   same time  That might be one thing that would be an important consideration, but this   Committee might consider other things at the same time  So it’s to say, at the next meeting or in   forthcoming meetings, official staff shouldn’t be saying, “The right thing for the FOMC to do at   the next meeting is X,” and the other thing that official staff should not do is speculate, “I think   the Committee at the next meeting will do X”  It’s intended to be rather limited, and I think it’s   very important for the research directors to consider concrete examples of the kinds of things   staff really do face, and to think things through  And if the way this policy is worded is   inadvertently restrictive of legitimate research activities and presentations, please come back and   we will reconsider the language   On the off-the-record interviews, our subcommittee discussed this issue  We recognized   there were strong feelings around the table, and I think it fell in an area where we cannot get   agreement, and we simply omitted it    Jeff    Well, the research directors can try to take an example like that and   indicate what they think is appropriate, and I think they’re going to decide that that’s perfectly   fine    It’s a formal policy, and we have moved it for adoption  I’m going to   ask for the Committee’s approval of this    It’s not informal  It’s not voluntary  "
9029,2011-08-01,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I am, of course, enormously relieved that a   deal to raise the debt ceiling has been reached, and I hope that it involves enough deficit   reduction to avoid a downgrade  But I agree with Bill that it’s premature to sound an all-clear   until both houses of the Congress have voted to approve the legislation, and I agree with him that   we do need to be prepared to deal with renewed market turbulence over the next couple of days,   given the potential ramifications for financial stability and the implications for the economic   outlook  In this regard, I would support Bill’s suggestions to authorize the Desk to intervene to   maintain orderly conditions in money markets by purchasing Treasury bills and possibly by   conducting RPs to relieve substantial upward pressure on GC repo and other short-term interest   rates, if that were to emerge   August 1, 2011 43 of 53              Now, even if the deal does encounter problems in the Congress, I expect that actions of   this type might well prove unnecessary after the Treasury finally states that they do intend to pay   principal and interest on time and we have finally issued our own set of policy statements  But if   the stress nevertheless escalates, I’d support interventions to alleviate pressures on money market   funds that could otherwise necessitate our invocation of 13(3) to ramp up a facility to backstop   them  And I think we should certainly do what we can to avoid a situation in which market   concerns about the liquidity of T-bills threaten the success of an auction, in turn triggering   further flight from money market funds and market disruption more broadly   I think a statement indicating our willingness to act to preserve orderly conditions in   money markets could, as Bill suggests, play a valuable role in creating a backstop, and the need   for actual intervention would probably be minimal  I’d also support repo operations by the Desk   to keep the GC repo rate more closely aligned with the fed funds rate if the spread was widening   quite substantially and if the pressure was showing through to money market rates more broadly,   especially—and probably only—if we judged that the market disruption reflected concerns   pertaining to liquidity in the bill market   Such interventions would then seem justifiable to me on normal monetary policy   grounds  Now, both of these proposed actions would increase the size of the Fed’s balance   sheet, and that would create some risk that markets could perceive the Fed as being willing to   backstop the Treasury  But the risk seems manageable to me in the current circumstances, in   light of the fact that T-bills would roll off our balance sheet rapidly and the Treasury would have   made clear their intention to pay scheduled principal and interest   More generally, should we be faced with future episodes of this type where default seems   to be in question, I would broadly support actions that are designed to preserve financial stability   August 1, 2011 44 of 53              and to foster attainment of our dual mandate  In thinking about how to do that, actions like 9 and   10 in the memo from Bill and Brian would seem to be possible to me, but whether or not I would   endorse them would depend on the actual circumstances were this to arise  I certainly agree,   though, with the general principle that we absolutely need to avoid actions that create serious   questions in the markets about the Fed’s commitment either to an independent monetary policy   or to price stability   If I could switch just briefly from short-term tactics to longer-term contingency planning,   I’d say that I’ve come away from this episode quite concerned by what we have learned about   the vulnerability of market infrastructure in the event of an actual default  I think our discussions   with market participants that Louise and Brian described reveal that a default might well have   had catastrophic market consequences  Given that we could face a similar situation somewhere   down the road, I think it’s important for us to think about lessons learned so that we and markets   will be better prepared if we face such a situation again  And I completely agree with Eric and   others that we need to address the risks that money market funds pose to financial stability  "
9054,2011-08-09,"  So moved    So moved    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ve marked down my economic growth   outlook substantially in light of the information received over recent weeks, and I’ve become   increasingly concerned about the downside risks  The latest data indicate that the US economy   has been running alarmingly close to stall speed over recent months, and I anticipate only a   modest pickup in growth over coming quarters  Indeed, as David Wilcox mentioned, the staff’s   econometric analysis suggests a 1 in 4 probability that the economy has already slipped into   recession  In other words, given the recent evolution of GDP, gross domestic income, and the   unemployment rate, the NBER might well conclude that another recession began sometime last   quarter  One particularly troubling sign of economic weakness is that real personal consumption   expenditures have declined in each of the past three monthly readings  It’s worth noting that a   pattern of three consecutive monthly declines in real PCE has occurred only on a handful of   occasions over the postwar period—namely, 1959, 1974, 1980–81, 1990–91, and, most recently,   in late 2008 and early 2009  In every single one of these previous occasions, the three-month   sequence of real PCE declines was associated with an NBER-dated recession   Of course, there are some special and temporary factors depressing consumer spending    Supply chain disruptions had a dramatic impact on the auto sector last quarter  So it seems   reasonable to anticipate a significant pickup in motor vehicle production and sales over the   course of this summer, providing a transitory stimulus to consumer spending and GDP growth    Nonetheless, we should keep in mind that those supply-side factors cannot fully account for the   recent weakness in household spending  The nondurables and services components of real PCE   August 9, 2011 71 of 162              were both completely flat, on net, over the past three months  Energy price increases also   depressed spending in the first half of the year, but careful staff analysis suggests that the decline   in real disposable income resulting from higher energy prices can explain only a portion of the   negative consumption surprise   Consumers are more downbeat than can be explained by trends in income, wealth,   inflation, and unemployment  To gain greater insight into the American consumer’s psyche,   over the past few weeks I’ve been quizzing various friends, relatives, taxi drivers, and even   innocent bystanders in the supermarket checkout line concerning their perspectives on the   economy  I could report some interesting anecdotes, but I’m reluctant to draw definitive   conclusions from these interactions with a fairly small and arguably nonrandom sample of   contacts in Georgetown, Berkeley, and Lanai  [Laughter]  To gain a more accurate read on the   wider population of American households, I devoted a few hours last weekend to analyzing the   plethora of consumer sentiment surveys, including several conducted on a daily basis that are   now readily available on the Internet  Most of the survey results are free, but to support   aggregate demand and in the interest of monetary policy, I shelled out $1999 for a premium   subscription to one of them  In evaluating surveys of consumer sentiment, it’s important to keep   in mind that there are marked differences in methodology that might be innocuous during normal   times but have crucial implications under present circumstances  For example, the Conference   Board survey has served as a long-standing benchmark on consumer sentiment  I was surprised   to discover that this survey is still conducted via the US mail, just as it was a few decades ago    Thus, it’s easy to see how the Conference Board’s measure will be heavily weighted toward the   sorts of consumers who don’t move very often and promptly notify the US Postal Service   whenever they do so  By comparison, the Michigan survey contacts households by a phone-  August 9, 2011 72 of 162              based approach, developed about two decades ago, in which telephone numbers are randomly   selected from the phone book  One pitfall is that this approach may systematically underweight   consumers who have a cell phone but no landline  There are, however, polling organizations like   Gallup and Rasmussen that conduct daily surveys using state-of-the-art methods and that use a   whole raft of demographic data to help ensure that the results are representative of the   population   The Conference Board survey indicates only a modest drop in consumer sentiment over   recent months, but I no longer find that result very reassuring  In contrast, the Michigan survey   and the Gallup and Rasmussen polls all indicate that consumer sentiment started moving down   during the spring and then plummeted last month to levels not seen since March 2009    According to the Gallup poll, about three-fourths of households view national economic   conditions as getting worse, while the Michigan survey indicates that only 10 percent of   households are expecting any increase in their own real income over the next year or two    Moreover, the latest daily readings of the Gallup and Rasmussen polls suggest that consumer   sentiment has continued drifting downward over the past week in spite of the debt ceiling   resolution and bits of good news from the latest employment report  Yesterday the Rasmussen   index showed that sentiment among the roughly half of Americans with at least $5,000 invested   in stocks, bonds, or mutual funds fell to lows not reached since March 2009  I would also   mention that this morning, an NFIB small business survey was released for July; it shows a   further fall to recessionary readings in business confidence this spring and indicates that this   result is almost entirely driven by respondents’ concerns about their likely sales   Returning now to econometric evidence, staff analysis of Markov regime-switching   models suggests that an elevated level of consumer pessimism is by no means unwarranted  For   August 9, 2011 73 of 162              example, the recession probabilities that David Wilcox presented in his briefing were derived   from a Markov regime-switching model in which the economy periodically transitions between   three possible states  an expansion state, with normal GDP growth; a recession state, with   negative GDP growth; and a stall-speed state, in which GDP growth is positive but well below   normal  The estimated parameters indicate that the stall-speed state is a harbinger of bad news   because that state is almost invariably followed by a recession  Unfortunately, this model   currently implies that the probability is greater than 60 percent that the economy is either at stall   speed or in recession  Of course, this model-based approach could be overestimating the   magnitude of downside risk to the economy  The model doesn’t account for the extent to which   economic growth during the first half of this year was damped by the supply chain disruptions   and other transitory factors  However, the model is blissfully unaware of other significant risks,   such as the S&P rating downgrade, the weakness of the housing sector, and the serious   challenges facing our European counterparts   In summary, incoming information since our last meeting points to a modal outlook of   sluggish economic recovery over coming quarters, and I see very substantial downside risks   attending this outlook  In my view, these circumstances clearly call for additional monetary   policy accommodation, a point to which I will return in the policy go-round    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I consider the case for policy action   compelling  Even though transitory factors played a role in depressing growth during the first   half of the year, the data we have received since June revealed broad-based weakness that is very   likely to persist  How can a forecast in which resource utilization and inflation both linger at   levels below the Committee’s targets possibly be consistent with an optimal monetary policy?    At the very minimum, we should ease policy until our medium-term inflation forecast is centered   on 2 percent  The argument for policy easing becomes yet stronger when we consider the   balance of risks to economic activity and inflation  The downside risk to growth is particularly   serious now because the potential for fiscal policy to respond in the event of a downturn is   limited, if not nonexistent  Should those downside growth risks materialize, we would likely be   facing significant disinflationary risks, too  Our arsenal is not empty, and we should avoid any   inclination to save our ammunition until a later date   I strongly support your proposal to substitute the language related to “extended period”   proposed in paragraph 3 of alternative A for that in alternative B  As you mentioned, such   forward guidance would be broadly in line with the implications of the staff’s estimated   outcome-based policy rule and with FRB/US model simulations of the Taylor 1999 rule  Both of   those rules prescribe a funds rate trajectory that remains at the zero lower bound until the second   half of 2013, at which point the unemployment rate would be in the vicinity of 7½ percent and   inflation would be around 1½ percent  I would also note that the optimal control rule calls for   significantly later action to raise the funds rate off its lower bound at a significantly lower   unemployment rate   August 9, 2011 94 of 162              To further enhance the clarity of our forward guidance, I believe it would be helpful to   provide more-specific quantitative information about the economic conditions that are likely to   warrant the continuation of exceptionally low levels of the funds rate  For example, I would   propose language along the following lines  “The Committee anticipates that exceptionally low   levels for the federal funds rate are likely to be warranted as long as the unemployment rate   exceeds 7½ percent and the medium-term outlook for inflation remains subdued  The   Committee currently expects those economic conditions to prevail at least through mid-2013”    Such a formulation seems roughly consistent with the implications of our June economic   projections, which had a central tendency of 7 to 7½ percent for the unemployment rate in   2013Q4 and a central tendency of 1½ to 2 percent for overall PCE inflation in 2013  Providing   a quantitative threshold for the unemployment rate would also underscore the conditionality of   our forward guidance and hence might help ensure that the public interprets the reference to a   calendar date—namely, mid-2013—as a forecast, not an unconditional promise  Indeed, this   approach would help the markets and the public understand how a shift in the economic outlook   would be likely to affect the anticipated timing of policy firming  For example, if there were a   further downward revision of the economic outlook, investors would recognize that the   7½ percent unemployment threshold would not be reached until a later date, and hence they   would push back the anticipated time of policy liftoff   I’d also like to suggest one further change—to paragraph 4 in alternative B to make it a   bit more forward leaning  I would propose changing the word “will” to “is prepared to”  In   other words, I propose, “The Committee will carefully assess the economic outlook in light of   incoming information and is prepared to employ its policy tools as appropriate to promote a   stronger pace of recovery in a context of price stability”   August 9, 2011 95 of 162              Looking toward September, without a clear improvement in the outlook, there are a   number of reasonable options for policy action that we should consider  For example, I think   that extending the duration of our Treasury holdings along the lines suggested in alternative A   has some merit  Such a program is attractive because it might push down longer-term yields,   including mortgage rates, and might offer greater support to the housing market  Another   promising approach would be to establish some sort of peg or cap on shorter-term interest rates    Because capping rates at the short end involves buying at the short end, whereas lengthening the   duration of our portfolio involves selling at the short end, we would need to analyze which   alternative approach is preferable  I’m somewhat less inclined to make further cuts in IOER, but   I would certainly be willing to entertain such an approach  At any rate, given the plethora of   policy tools and the potential urgency of taking some further action in September, I hope we can   plan on having a two-day FOMC meeting to ensure that we have enough time to consider the   various options and to make specific decisions as appropriate    “The Committee anticipates that exceptionally low levels for the federal   funds rate are likely to be warranted as long as the unemployment rate exceeds 75 percent and   the medium-term outlook for inflation remains subdued  The Committee currently expects those   economic conditions to prevail at least through mid-2013”   August 9, 2011 96 of 162               Correct  The “medium-term outlook for inflation remains subdued”    Okay  Let me be clear that I would support the language in A3 and   think that the language I’ve proposed is consistent with what’s there  And the reason for its   being useful even though it coincides with market expectations is that it does show concern, and   it does indicate that some transitory pickup in economic growth in the next quarter or something   is not going to cause us to move off “exceptionally” or “extended period”  It takes some upside   risk off the potential that we would be raising the funds rate  I guess the reason that I like the   quantitative threshold pertaining to unemployment is that it gives a clearer rationale for how we   came up with this particular date and, by making our reaction function clearer, shows that we   want to see a sufficient improvement in the economy before we would consider lifting the funds   rate—as long as, I wrote, “the medium-term outlook for inflation remains subdued”  I’m not   sure if that’s the best language  One could say “as long as the medium-term outlook for inflation   is consistent with the dual mandate”  That might be more general, and President Evans might   like that better  The idea is that there’s an escape clause having to do with inflation, but we’re   giving a sense of concreteness  What do we expect to see before we would contemplate raising   it?  And given that the outlook can weaken or it can strengthen, we’re bringing into play a   August 9, 2011 101 of 162              helpful and stabilizing market mechanism  Bad data?  Markets automatically say, “Wow, 7½   percent—that’s not going to occur until 2019  The Fed’s going to be on hold for years and years    It’s a lot longer than 2013”  Or vice versa in the event that we get strong data  That’s what I’m   seeing is the advantage    Because, if you’re right, you have an inflation escape clause there    You might have other negative votes    So we’re putting in the reinvestment—“maintain its existing policy of   reinvesting principal”?    This is Dan’s proposal for 4  "
9080,2011-09-20,"  So moved    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I greatly appreciate the detailed staff analysis   of policy options relating to our securities holdings and communications  I’ll comment just   briefly on the maturity extension program and IOER and devote most of my remarks to questions   about clarifying our policy goals and reaction function   Regarding the maturity extension program, I think the likely benefits outweigh the costs    Estimates of the program’s effects on financial markets and the macroeconomy are subject to   considerable uncertainty, but it seems plausible that the overall impact might be broadly similar   to that of QE2, perhaps generating an additional 500,000 jobs or so over the next couple of years    Indeed, viewed as a form of jobs package, this program seems cost effective  Under the modal   outlook, the program would have only negligible effects on the present value of our transfers to   the US Treasury, and under an alternative adverse scenario like that shown in the staff memo,   the implied cost per job appears to still be under around $200,000, which seems quite low   compared with many other proposals for stimulating employment  This is, as many have   mentioned, a one-shot action, and certainly, if there were further deterioration in the outlook, I’m   very open to considering further LSAPs to provide additional stimulus  I also agree with Vice   Chairman Dudley that it makes sense to consider broadening our purchases or, alternatively, our   reinvestment of runoff from our MBS portfolio back into further MBS purchases   September 20–21, 2011 87 of 290              As for interest on reserves, I think cutting it to 10 basis points would provide a modest   stimulus to bank lending and economic activity  I recognize that a reduction in IOER might   induce more banks to charge an explicit fee on deposits and that the public reaction might be   negative  That said, I agree with President Kocherlakota about this  Such a tax on money   holdings provides stimulus to the economy by inducing some shift in private portfolios away   from cash and into riskier assets, whereas he mentioned into spending  I’m concerned about the   increasing volume of negative commentary that the $4 billion per year we’re paying on reserves   when prevailing money market rates are lower constitutes an unwarranted subsidy to banks  I do   recognize, though, that a cut in IOER could have some adverse and unintended consequences for   money market funds, the federal funds market, and other aspects of market functioning, perhaps   making it an inadvisable time to make such an adjustment   Let me turn next to the clarification of our longer-term goals, which is something I   strongly support  As an old-timer, I intended to brag about participating in the FOMC’s very   first discussion of this topic back in 1995  In fact, I printed out my remarks here [laughter] from   that meeting, two pages, and the seven subsequent discussions in which I’ve participated  I   contemplated the idea of simply repeating what I’d said back then  Nevertheless, I used the   FOMC Secretariat’s handy web search tool, and I was astonished to discover that the sequence of   discussions of this topic actually stretches back much further into the distant past  For example,   here’s an excerpt from a list of questions that the Committee discussed on a Monday afternoon in   August 1983  “Should ultimate economic goals be given clearer expression in conveying FOMC   policy intentions to the public through, say, a specific numerical statement of objectives—”   MRTARULLO  What year was this, Janet?   September 20–21, 2011 88 of 290               1983—August 1983  —“or should expressions about ultimate economic   goals continue to be limited to general qualitative statements?”  That question sounded eerily   familiar  [Laughter]  So, too, did the answers  Preston Martin, who was the Federal Reserve   Board’s Vice Chairman at the time, specifically recommended the adoption of a 2 percent   objective for consumer price inflation  In every Committee discussion, there’s been widespread   consensus on the benefits of adopting a numerical inflation objective, which, for the sake of time,   I will not repeat at this point  As I look back on all those previous discussions, what’s most   striking to me is how frequently the Committee had reached the very threshold of consensus,   only to become stymied by details that seem trivial in retrospect   I think this is a good time to move forward  Indeed, there are a number of reasons why   this may be a particularly propitious time to formalize the Committee’s longer-run goals  From   the standpoint of internal decisionmaking, all of us agree that monetary policy is fundamentally   responsible for the longer-run inflation outlook and for ensuring that longer-run inflation   expectations remain firmly anchored, whereas the longer-run outlook for economic growth and   employment is largely determined by structural factors  We have reached a broad consensus that   a PCE inflation rate of 2 percent would be fully consistent with our statutory mandate  Our   longer-run unemployment projections generally lie in the range of 5 to 6 percent, and we all   agree that those projections are intrinsically uncertain and subject to revision   Moreover, I want to take a moment to dispel any notion that communicating an estimate   of the longer-run sustainable unemployment rate is somehow inconsistent with flexible inflation   targeting as practiced by other central banks around the world  For example, here’s an excerpt   from the Swedish central bank’s October 2010 Monetary Policy Report  “The Riksbank   conducts a policy of flexible inflation targeting    with the aim of attaining an appropriate   September 20–21, 2011 89 of 290              balance between stabilising inflation around the inflation target and stabilising the real   economy”  The Riksbank regularly publishes its estimates of the longer-run sustainable rates of   output growth and unemployment, and its Monetary Policy Reports show how actual output and   unemployment are expected to converge over time to those longer-term sustainable paths  In a   paper delivered last week at Brookings, Lars Svensson noted that policymakers at the Riksbank   scrutinize optimal control exercises and simple Taylor-style rules in much the same way that we   do here at the Fed  Moreover, the Riksbank is by no means unique  The Bank of Canada, the   Norges Bank, and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand each use similar language to describe the   practice of flexible inflation targeting, and each central bank publishes estimates of the gap   between actual resource utilization and its longer-run sustainable rate while noting that such   estimates are uncertain and subject to revisions   As for the Federal Reserve, information about our individual assessments of the mandate-  consistent inflation rate and our longer-run projections for unemployment has been published   regularly in the SEP since early 2009  Over the past year or so, the Chairman has addressed this   topic in a number of highly visible speeches and congressional testimony and in his press   briefings in April and June, and many of us around the table have highlighted these goals in   speeches and media interviews  So I believe clarifying our longer-run goals in an FOMC   meeting statement as proposed in paragraph 2 of alternative A would be seen as a helpful and   only incremental step in the ongoing enhancement of our public communications   Let me turn next to the idea of providing more-explicit, quantitative information about   the Committee’s reaction function as in paragraph 4 of alternative A  This is an approach I   strongly support if it’s coupled with an explicit numerical statement of our longer-run objectives   as in paragraph 2 of alternative A  The use of such explicit, quantitative forward guidance could   September 20–21, 2011 90 of 290              be tremendously helpful in clarifying for markets and the public the connection between our   economic outlook and the anticipated timing of policy firming  Absent the introduction of such   conditional thresholds, I can imagine all but endless discussions in this Committee about whether   to change the date for liftoff in our statement in light of ongoing changes in the economic   outlook  In contrast, if we proceed to quantify the conditionality of the forward guidance, the   need to specify calendar dates would diminish and perhaps disappear completely  Under a   modal outlook like that of the staff, in which unemployment is declining only gradually and   inflation remains below 2 percent, it seems reasonable that we would keep the funds rate targeted   at its current setting until the unemployment rate drops below 7 percent  Of course, the evolution   of aggregate demand would determine the timing of that outcome and hence the calendar date at   which policy firming is likely to commence  For that very reason, spelling out the conditionality   of our forward guidance would serve as an automatic stabilizer  Further deterioration in the   outlook would cause investors to automatically push back the likely date of policy firming and   thereby lead to more-accommodative financial conditions, while an unexpected strengthening in   the outlook would have the converse effect   As the staff memo indicates, such quantitative forward guidance might provide little or   no stimulus if the medium-term inflation threshold were set at 2 percent  In contrast, the memo   shows that a modestly higher inflation threshold of 2½ percent, coupled with an unemployment   trigger of 7 percent, could provide meaningful policy stimulus by pushing back market   expectations about the likely timing of policy firming  Moreover, such guidance could be   helpful in clarifying that the anticipated path of policy would not necessarily shift in response to   an uptick in core inflation or a transitory aggregate supply shock, at least as long as   unemployment remains far above its long-run equilibrium rate  In my view, a modestly higher   September 20–21, 2011 91 of 290              rate of inflation over the medium term would be completely reasonable in the context of a policy   strategy that fosters a somewhat more rapid reduction in the unemployment rate  Under such   circumstances, a clear expression of the Committee’s longer-run inflation goal would help ensure   that inflation expectations remain firmly anchored   Finally, I believe that the forward guidance in our meeting statement should be viewed as   a complement to the SEP and not a substitute  While the SEP summarizes the individual   projections of all meeting participants based on each participant’s own assessment of the   appropriate path of policy, our meeting statements are crafted through a consensus-building   process that inevitably involves compromises among people with disparate views  Moreover, the   SEP provides quantitative information about each participant’s modal outlook, whereas our   forward guidance is explicitly contingent on economic conditions, conveying some information   about our reaction function   By the way, I would note that some foreign central banks do produce multiple sets of   projections conditioned on alternative scenarios roughly similar to the materials at the end of   Tealbook, Book A  Nonetheless, including alternative scenarios in the SEP might not be   appealing to everyone at this table, and in any case, such an initiative would require a substantial   period of consultation and development  However, given the significant interest that I’ve heard   expressed around the table in policy projections and adding them to the SEP, I believe my   subcommittee would be more than willing to continue exploring this and potentially bring back   further recommendations beyond what we circulated in August to this Committee    Thank you, Mr Chairman  The data we have received since August   confirm that consumer spending is anemic  The labor market is deteriorating further, and growth   in both emerging market and advanced foreign economies is slowing  We need a revival of   confidence to spur recovery  Instead, pessimism has deepened among households and small   businesses  Safe-haven flows have pushed Treasury yields toward historically low levels, while   many other indicators of financial conditions have tightened over recent weeks  Since last   March, when our meeting statement suggested that the economic recovery was on a firmer   September 20–21, 2011 164 of 290              footing, real PCE has advanced at an annual rate of only 04 percent, a truly glacial pace    Spending on core nondurables, a cyclical category that includes many discretionary items, has   actually declined since March  Moreover, real spending on motor vehicles in August remains   nearly 12 percent lower than in March, a reduction that seems consistent with cyclical factors   and not just temporary supply chain disruptions   While I still anticipate some pickup in the pace of economic growth over coming   quarters, I have become increasingly concerned that the economy is near stall speed and could   easily slip into recession  Indeed, commenting on the findings of the most recent Michigan   survey, Richard Curtin, its longtime director, cautioned that in his view, “a renewed downturn in   consumer spending is as likely as not in the year ahead”  Curtin’s assessment is substantially   bleaker than that in the Tealbook, which projects real PCE growth of 23 percent in 2012  The   survey’s index of consumer expectations, which is a component of the index of leading   indicators, fell in September to its lowest level since early 1980  The percentage of consumers   expecting their finances to improve in the year ahead declined to 17 percent, and the fraction of   households anticipating a decline in their inflation-adjusted income soared to 60 percent  These   readings are the bleakest ever in the history of the Michigan survey   The Tealbook projects that the recovery will gain some momentum in 2013  The driving   force is an assumed diminution of the gloom that is now afflicting consumers and businesses    The lifting of gloom is sufficient to create a self-fulfilling prophecy of recovery, moving the   economy from its current bad equilibrium to progressively better ones  As Tealbook A, puts it,   “The economy’s    self-correcting mechanisms    will gain traction over the next two years,   fostered by continued accommodative monetary policy”  Some other restorative mechanisms are   also working to foster recovery  For example, over time, without sufficient investment, the   September 20–21, 2011 165 of 290              economy’s capital stocks of housing and durable goods decline absolutely or in relation to a   growing workforce or population, raising the return on such investments, and this should spur   some revival in spending  Unfortunately, mechanisms of this type are exceptionally weak  The   assumption that the gloom afflicting households will eventually lift seems reasonable since the   degree of pessimism among households and businesses exceeds anything that appears to be   warranted by such fundamentals as income, inflation, unemployment, and wealth  Most   recessions are short-lived, and it seems logical that recovery from this downturn will likewise   gather steam  But recessions are not all alike  Many occur when monetary policy is tightened to   bring inflation down and end when the Fed puts its foot on the accelerator  Reinhart and Rogoff   find that recessions following financial crises tend to be prolonged, but when they end, the   impetus commonly comes from surging net exports induced by a currency depreciation  This   recovery mechanism is operative to some extent, but insufficiently potent as an impetus for   recovery  Fiscal policy has often been deployed in the past to get the economy going  At   present, though, the scope for a fiscal response seems limited both here and abroad  Indeed,   fiscal policy is projected to be a drag on economic growth in both the United States and Europe   The fact that no meaningful policy response to continuing economic weakness has been   forthcoming appears to be a further factor depressing confidence  For these reasons, I find it   hard to rule out a scenario along the lines of the “Recession” alternative simulation in the   Tealbook, one in which the current malaise intensifies, triggering a further downturn, possibly   followed by long-enduring weakness similar to Japan’s “lost decade” or the US Great   Depression  During the Depression, the loss of confidence was so deep and prolonged that it was   not restored until World War II   September 20–21, 2011 166 of 290              Among the many downside risks to the outlook, I particularly highlight the potential for a   significant deterioration in financial conditions to restrict credit to the private sector  Since the   August Tealbook closed, spreads on high-yield bonds have reached recession levels, CMBS   spreads have similarly widened, CDS spreads on several large banking organizations have risen   to levels close to those prevailing at the time of the Lehman default, and the stock prices of   financial institutions have declined markedly  In addition, the trend we have been seeing of   increased availability of credit and easing of terms in the SLOOS appears to have faltered, and   our SCOOS survey points to a diminished appetite for risk-taking  Of course, European banks   are facing significant strains in funding markets, and there is pronounced downside risk that   increased stress in European financial markets will spill into our home markets   Turning to inflation, I agree with the Tealbook forecast that inflation is poised to head   downward over time as the pass-through of previous important commodity price increases is   completed and production and inventories of motor vehicles are restored toward normal levels    Over time, I expect the extraordinary slack in the labor market to push wage growth and core   inflation down  Financial markets appear to share this assessment, given that five-year inflation   compensation has declined to about 16 percent, a reading identical to that registered a year ago   just before we announced the inception of QE2  It’s worth recalling that our Committee at that   time was concerned about the risk of deflation  Board staff calculations from TIPS computed an   implied probability of about 30 percent that the price level would decline by April 2015  That   probability fell substantially after QE2 was announced, and it continued to decline through the   spring, but it’s been rising ever since and again stands around 30 percent  The implied   probability of deflation has risen especially steeply since the August FOMC   September 20–21, 2011 167 of 290              Monetary policy operates with lags, so our decisions need to be based not only on current   conditions, but also on the outlook  I’d like, therefore, to conclude by comparing the outlook   now and a year ago, when we launched QE2  Of course, there are various ways of performing   such an exercise, but one instructive approach is to gauge the evolution of the outlook for 2012    As of October 2010, the Blue Chip consensus was that the unemployment rate would average   84 percent in 2012, whereas the latest consensus forecast for 2012 is ½ percentage point higher   at 89 percent  Indeed, the Tealbook projection for unemployment in 2012 has been revised   upward by the same amount since last October  In effect, professional forecasters and the staff   each see a more sluggish pace of recovery and a higher trajectory for unemployment than they   had anticipated a year ago  In contrast, the outlook for CPI inflation in 2012 is essentially   unchanged  The latest Blue Chip consensus and the Tealbook forecast are each only   01 percentage point higher than a year ago  In summary, a forward-looking perspective   suggests that the likely progress toward our mandated objectives is even less satisfactory than we   were expecting around the time that we initiated QE2  That deterioration in the outlook, in   conjunction with downside risks that loom larger than a year ago, is a factor that inclines me   toward additional monetary policy accommodation, a point that I will underscore in our policy   go-round tomorrow    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support alternative B  The economic   outlook has deteriorated significantly since our August meeting and downside risks are looming   ever larger  I’ve become increasingly concerned that the economy is near stall speed and could   easily slip into recession  As I explained in the economic go-round, I see the modal outlook as   decidedly worse than a year ago when we decided to adopt QE2  In particular, my outlook under   current policy settings, like the Tealbook’s, is for unemployment to stay horrifically high for   years while inflation over the next two years declines below mandate-consistent levels  I can’t   see how such a forecast can be consistent with optimal policy under an inflation-targeting   strategy if we interpret that as a forward-looking approach in which we choose policy to   minimize a loss function, including deviations of inflation from target and deviations of   unemployment from its long-run equilibrium level  In addition, we face downside risks that are   exceptionally large at a time when policy is constrained by the zero bound  Therefore, I strongly   support taking actions at this meeting to foster a stronger recovery, assuming they pass a cost-  benefit test   In my judgment, the maturity extension program, even though it is obviously not a   panacea, is a cost-effective tool for providing some additional monetary accommodation  I   September 20–21, 2011 238 of 290              support Vice Chairman Dudley’s suggestion that we roll over maturing MBS principal back into   MBS rather than into Treasuries  I agree with the arguments he and others made for this   strategy  Reducing the spread of MBS yields over Treasuries will have greater bang for the buck   and would avoid a reduction in market liquidity that could result from our increasing dominance   in the long end of the Treasury market   Regarding specific language, I would prefer the first variant of paragraph B(3) because   conveying our intent to complete the full program seems likely to provide the greatest extent of   stimulus and would be consistent with our communications about the previous round of longer-  term Treasury purchases  That said, I see good reasons for engaging in regular reviews of this   program over coming months  In particular, if the strains in European financial markets intensify   much further, it’s quite plausible and perhaps likely that safe-haven flows would flatten the   Treasury yield curve to the point where there might be little or no benefits to proceeding with our   maturity transformation program  In light of such considerations, I’d be willing to support the   second variant of paragraph B(3) if that language seems preferable to other members  Finally, I   strongly support the bracketed language in paragraph B to underscore that the Committee is   prepared to employ additional policy tools as appropriate  Indeed, as I noted yesterday, I believe   that communications may be the most powerful tool that’s still in our toolbox  I continue to see   advantages to the approach in alternative A, but this is something we need to give further   consideration to in the context of the larger discussion of our monetary policy framework in   November  I also strongly agree that we need to consider out-of-the-box or blue-sky approaches   should things deteriorate further, and that it’s important to develop those tools now    Good idea    Is that what you were thinking of, liquidity and the like?

9107,2011-11-01,"  So moved    Exactly    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I, too, want to thank the staff  I greatly   appreciate their thorough analysis of alternative policy frameworks   Let me turn to the questions  On the first question, I think that a flexible inflation-  targeting framework would be fully consistent with our dual mandate  As I noted at our   September meeting, I’ve been a long-time advocate of establishing a specific numerical inflation   objective as a means of facilitating our internal decisionmaking and augmenting transparency   November 1–2, 2011 77 of 282              and accountability to the public  Under current circumstances, a clear long-run inflation goal   would help ensure that transitory supply shocks don’t shift inflation expectations, and it would   underscore our determination to minimize the risks of deflation  A consensus statement about   our policy framework could be an ideal means of enunciating an explicit inflation goal because   such a statement of principles could emphasize our commitment to both parts of our dual   mandate  The statement could specifically indicate our judgment that the mandate-consistent   inflation rate is 2 percent, while noting that our estimates of the longer-run sustainable   unemployment rate are regularly conveyed through the SEP  In my view, it would be also   essential to clarify that the time horizon over which inflation is expected to converge to the   longer-run goal would depend on economic conditions and would reflect the Committee’s   judgments about the path of policy that most effectively promotes both parts of our dual   mandate   Turning to the second question, a long and distinguished literature shows that central   banks can foster better macroeconomic outcomes by making conditional commitments about the   future path of policy rather than by following a discretionary approach of re-optimizing at every   meeting  I think commitment strategies are particularly beneficial when the current setting of the   policy rate is constrained by the zero lower bound, because the central bank can provide extra   accommodation by promising a shallower interest rate trajectory than would be implied under a   purely discretionary approach   The conditionality is a crucial element of commitment strategies because an   unconditional commitment could result in very poor, even disastrous outcomes under some   circumstances  In theory, the ideal Ramsey planner would formulate and communicate a   complete set of state-contingent commitments  He would spell out exactly how the path of   November 1–2, 2011 78 of 282              policy would unfold under every conceivable scenario  In reality, of course, the idea of a policy   committee agreeing to a myriad of policy paths and seeking to communicate all of that   information to the public is completely impractical   The staff memo mainly focuses on one approach to addressing this problem—namely, the   use of simple rules that specify how the central bank will respond to observable economic   variables  In my view, such rules can serve as very useful benchmarks for assessing the stance   of monetary policy and for helping the public understand how policy may evolve under   alternative scenarios  But it would be highly inadvisable to make a binding commitment to   follow one particular rule, because there are surely contingencies under which any given rule   might perform quite poorly  I, therefore, consider it preferable to take a more pragmatic   approach, one that involves communicating our modal expectations about the path of policy and   conveying the conditionality of that path by specifying thresholds for key economic variables, in   effect, the approach illustrated in the final variant for paragraph 4″ in alternative A1  And here I   agree completely with President Evans and others, and I agree exactly with his analysis of why   this type of approach would be robust and beneficial  As an alternative, the Committee could   indicate its modal expectations for policy and the associated paths of economic variables as is   proposed in 4′, the second variant of paragraph 4 in alternative A1  But this approach would   seem to me to be at least somewhat less effective in communicating conditionality   Turning to the third question, I’ll devote most of my comments to nominal income   targeting  There is a significant body of research that highlights the extent to which this   framework can facilitate the stability of prices and the real economy, and a number of prominent   economists who have recently been urging the Fed to consider adopting it as a means to respond   more forcefully to current economic circumstances   November 1–2, 2011 79 of 282              The staff memo shows that nominal income targeting could be quite helpful in promoting   our dual objectives under the modal outlook in a range of alternatives  Nonetheless, as I’ve   contemplated the possibility of a nominal income target, I’ve become increasingly convinced   that there would be enormous practical challenges in implementing this framework, and that may   help explain why no other central bank has ever followed such an approach  Let me highlight a   few specific concerns   First, as is noted in the staff memo, it would not be appropriate for the target path to be   permanently fixed  Rather, it would need to be revised whenever there were significant changes   in the estimated level or growth rate of potential output  Importantly, such revisions would need   to be retrospective as well as prospective  For example, last August’s NIPA re-benchmarking   led to a substantial revision of the estimated path of potential output that would have required a   corresponding change in the target path  I can easily imagine the public confusion on such   occasions  People would complain the Federal Reserve is changing the goal posts   Second, the target path by itself doesn’t provide a full description of this framework    Rather, the central bank must also specify and communicate the rule it will follow in bringing   nominal income back to that target path  That choice may have non-trivial implications for the   stabilization performance of the framework  For example, it might seem intuitive to follow a   rule that prescribes monotonic convergence back to the target path, but such a rule would   generate macro outcomes that are much less appealing than those obtained in the staff memo,   which uses a rule that implies substantial overshooting  Nevertheless, I suspect it would be   much more difficult to explain the overshooting rule to the public, and of course, the whole   rationale for this approach could be undermined if wage and price setters and financial market   investors didn’t fully understand it   November 1–2, 2011 80 of 282              A third pitfall of nominal income targeting—this is something that Presidents Williams   and Kocherlakota have been commenting on—is that the strategy may involve a very long   process of convergence to the balanced growth path, not just 5 or 6 or 8 years, as described in   many of our SEP narratives, but perhaps stretching out as long as 15 or 20  For example, in the   FRB/US simulation of the recession scenario with policy remaining highly accommodative   through 2018, the unemployment rate, as Mike noted, drops to close to 3 percent  Inflation peaks   around 2¾ percent, and nominal income overshoots its target path by around 2 percentage points    At that point, though, monetary policy can’t just shift back to being neutral  Rather, to bring   nominal income back to target, the stance of policy gradually becomes contractionary  By 2024,   the economy is in mild recession with unemployment rising back up to 6 percent and inflation   running around 1¼ for a few years until the path finally settles down around 2030   In effect, the strategy succeeds in dampening the near-term consequences of the recession   shock by providing a clear and credible commitment to a policy path stretching out over nearly   two decades  From an aesthetic viewpoint, the dynamic elegance of this policy is breathtaking    [Laughter]  I spent the weekend contemplating potential analogies, deciding that the best   comparison would be to an Olympic figure skater who leaps in the air for a triple Salchow  We   all hold our breath until she lands gracefully to complete the rest of her performance  However,   we should remember that the figure skater’s routine is one she’s practiced hundreds of times   [laughter] until she could execute it as flawlessly as possible  Even if she has an awkward   landing, the worst case is that there’s no gold medal, but surely no champion skater would   introduce a routine for the very first time right in the middle of an Olympic performance  And   like the practical complexities of nominal income targeting, it would only be prudent to develop,   implement, and carefully communicate this approach over a course of a number of years  This is   November 1–2, 2011 81 of 282              the approach that’s been taken by the Bank of Canada, which has spent the past half-decade   exploring alternative monetary policy frameworks in close consultation with the public and the   Canadian parliament  In the near term, however, we might consider making more frequent   references in our monetary policy communications to the level of nominal income and its   relevance in guiding our thinking, in effect, turning it into a second pillar of policy   More broadly, the conditional commitments may be the most potent tool in our toolbox at   this stage, but we need to be mindful of the intrinsic limits on our ability to make credible   promises over time horizons that extend beyond several years  We need to follow a pragmatic   approach for promoting the stability of economic activity and inflation, recognizing the limits of   our understanding of the structure and evolution of the economy and of our ability to anticipate   or plan for all possible contingencies  This inclines me, as I said, toward enhancing our forward   guidance, ideally along the lines that President Evans has articulated or, alternatively, through an   approach that would involve our projections   On the final question about projections, I do strongly favor publishing information on   policy projections in the SEP  Our subcommittee will be happy to work with staff to develop   specific approaches to circulate to the Committee for your consideration if the Committee wants   to go in this direction, and I certainly think that it’s something that we should carefully consider    I look forward to working on that    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Three working hypotheses have guided my   thinking about the economic outlook  All three received support from the data during the   intermeeting period  The first is that growth during the first half of 2011 was significantly   depressed by transitory factors  sharp increases in the prices of imports and commodities and   disruptions in global automotive supply chains  That hypothesis is consistent with the recent   rebound in the spending data   The second hypothesis is that those transitory factors also boosted consumer inflation    Thus, with well-anchored inflation expectations and subdued growth in compensation, I expected   that as those transitory factors waned, inflation would subside to levels at or below the mandate-  consistent rate  This hypothesis has also been confirmed by recent readings on consumer prices    In fact, the prices of core goods have been practically flat, rising at an annualized rate of only   02 percent over the three months ending in September, compared with a rate of about   3½ percent over the prior three-month period  Meanwhile, services prices have been rising   steadily at a 2 percent pace over the past year  The latest three-month reading on core PCE   inflation is now back down to 1½ percent and seems likely to decline a bit further going forward   My third hypothesis is that economic growth has only limited upside potential due to the   persistent headwinds that are restraining aggregate demand  Because the odds are so low that the   recovery will gather any real head of steam, unemployment seems likely to linger at dismally   November 1–2, 2011 173 of 282              high levels for many years to come  Incoming data suggest that spending in the third quarter was   somewhat stronger than I had anticipated, and the composition of growth may foreshadow   slightly stronger growth in the fourth quarter as well  That said, nothing in the data dissuades me   from the view that growth will gain momentum only gradually, and that view is also evident in   the Tealbook and in the consensus outlook of professional forecasters  The key factors holding   back spending are well described in the Tealbook and include unusual pessimism among   households about their future income and financial prospects, declines in the values of homes   and financial assets, still-elevated debt levels, and reduced access of households, particularly   those under water on their mortgages, to credit   The daily readings on consumer sentiment from the Gallup and Rasmussen surveys did   point to some improvement over the past few days in the wake of Europe’s announcement of   measures to address its financial crisis and the attendant rebound in the stock market  I’ll report   tomorrow morning on how things look  But even with that slight rebound, consumer sentiment   has simply reverted to exceptionally low levels that were seen in late July     Other drags on the recovery include persistent dysfunction in the housing and residential   mortgage markets and budget pressures that are restraining spending at the federal and state and   local levels  Moreover, incoming information points to a more significant slowdown in   European growth, a development that’s having spillover effects on the global economy and is   likely to damp the US economic outlook   Turning to risks to the outlook, I still see those risks as weighted to the downside,   although there’s slightly more balance than in our last meeting  Incoming data diminish the odds   that the economy is about to slip into recession  But the odds still remain very high, in my view,   that there will be negative spillovers from the European debt and banking crises, and I consider   November 1–2, 2011 174 of 282              this the number one risk affecting the outlook  European developments could still derail our   recovery, and I think this is a scenario that’s very well illustrated by an alternative simulation in   the Tealbook   My long-standing concerns about the ability and willingness of European policymakers   to address their sovereign debt and banking issues effectively were reinforced 10 days ago, when   I attended the meetings of the G-20 governors and ministers and their deputies in Paris  I had a   chance to see, up close and personal, that the key players were still very far from having nailed   down crucial elements of the deal only days before their self-appointed deadline  Glimpsing   how the sausage was made was not at all reassuring  Of course, like many others around the   world, I did breathe a huge sigh of relief when the euro-area leaders announced agreement last   Thursday on a comprehensive package of measures to address Greece’s unsustainable debt   situation and the vulnerabilities of European banks and sovereigns, and presented a road map for   stronger coordination and constraints on fiscal policy  But I’m not at all surprised to see a   turnaround in market sentiment, and I fully expect that the road ahead will be long and will   involve lots of scary turns and steep cliffs along the way  As Brian noted, of course, spreads on   the debt of most peripheral countries barely budged, even after the agreement was announced,   and at this point, spreads on Italian debt have reached new highs   Here I’m going to pick up on some themes that Bill and Steve mentioned, but in my   view, there are a number of reasons why substantial downside risks are likely to continue not for   months but for years to come  In the first place, Greece, Ireland, Spain, Portugal, and Italy have   all committed to further deficit reduction, and the adjustments called for by Greece and Ireland   are exceptionally large  Fiscal contraction on this grand scale, at a time when economic activity   in Europe is already weakening, will further undermine growth  From the perspective of   November 1–2, 2011 175 of 282              markets, this creates severe implementation risk  And as Bill and Steve noted, if you just take   the case of Greece, even with a 50 percent haircut, the troika plan to stabilize Greece’s debt-to-  GDP ratio near 120 percent involves very tough fiscal targets, which are quite likely to be missed   if growth falls only slightly short of the pace assumed in the analysis  Historically, large fiscal   adjustments have typically occurred in situations where higher real export growth, reflecting a   depreciation of the country’s real exchange rate, could compensate at least partially for fiscal   drag  No mechanism other than slow growth of wages and prices, along with structural   adjustments that tend to be difficult and slow, is available here to restore competitiveness   A second concern of mine—and Bill mentioned this—is the potential for a European   credit crunch  The funding pressures currently afflicting European banks have already caused   them to restrict credit and to delever, and these pressures may intensify as growth slows, as   European banks experience pressures on their earnings and higher losses on their nonsovereign   assets, and as banks struggle to meet the higher capital standards called for by European leaders   and banking authorities  The leaders’ statement, as Steve and Bill noted, does stress the   importance of ensuring that capital raising not cause excessive deleveraging, but there is no   mechanism in place to prevent banks from shedding assets  Moreover, even with more capital,   European banks remain highly vulnerable to further sovereign debt problems given their   enormous exposures  So the soundness of the banking system can be assured only if the   sovereign debt issues are decisively addressed  Negative feedbacks between economic   performance, the health of the banking sector, and the default risk of sovereigns that stand   behind their banking systems create the potential for vicious downward spirals    A third concern is that no matter how clever the arrangements to leverage the EFSF,   without substantial participation by the European Central Bank, the underlying funding may   November 1–2, 2011 176 of 282              simply be insufficient to cover a new Greek package, to backstop bank recapitalization, and to   offer credit enhancements sufficient to ring-fence Italy and Spain, given the enormous borrowing   needs of those countries over the next two years  To me, it’s highly questionable whether   investors, including banks, will be willing to buy Italian and Spanish debt at yields that don’t   threaten debt sustainability   And finally, with respect to European politics, as the European leaders’ statement   emphasized, progress on fiscal integration in Europe is necessary to the success of the euro, but   exceptionally difficult politically  And the governments, as we can see in Greece and Italy,   already seem close to the breaking point   In summary, my modal outlook is that the European leaders will succeed in addressing   these challenges, but only over a painful and protracted period  In the meantime, we’ll need to   monitor European developments closely and stay alert to the associated risk to financial stability   and economic growth    Thank you, Mr Chairman  We’ve taken a number of important steps to   ease monetary policy in recent meetings  Even so, absent further accommodation, the outlook is   unacceptably weak  Under current policy settings, the Tealbook forecast and the Committee’s   central tendency projections show unemployment remaining exceptionally high for years to   come and inflation running below the 2 percent level that most Committee members consider   consistent with our dual mandate  A central bank that practices flexible inflation targeting would   be looking for ways to provide further accommodation   In my view, it would be feasible to foster a more satisfactory recovery, without pushing   inflation above 2½ percent, by using communication strategies like those illustrated in   alternative A1—namely, strategies that would convey the Committee’s intention to exit from the   zero lower bound at a somewhat later date, and to firm policy at a somewhat more gradual pace,   than financial markets currently anticipate  Such a strategy is embedded in the projection that I   submitted for this meeting, and hence my forecasts for both of the dual objectives are more   appealing than in the extended Tealbook baseline  In particular, my preferred policy path is   associated with a faster pace of economic growth over the next few years, a significantly lower   rate of unemployment by late 2014, and a trajectory for inflation that stays very close to its   mandate-consistent rate  Among the specific variants of paragraph 4 in alternative A1, the   thresholds in version 4″ are very appealing to me as a way of conveying quantitative information   about the conditionality of forward guidance, and I agree with the comments and discussion that   President Evans has given of why this is a good approach  The formulation in version 4′ based   on projections, however, could also be workable   November 1–2, 2011 223 of 282              Nonetheless, as we have discussed, it makes eminent sense to make adjustments to our   forward guidance in the context of a clear expression of our overarching goals and strategy  I’m   hopeful that we can reach a broad consensus on a statement of principles over the next couple of   months  I look forward to working with the subcommittee on communications to find a   formulation that fully respects our dual mandate  I also hope we’ll be able to move forward with   incorporating policy projections into the SEP  As a matter of fact, I became even more   persuaded of the merits of publishing our funds rate projections as I filled out my survey for this   round and discovered that my rosy economic forecasts could easily be misinterpreted in the   absence of information on my judgment about appropriate policy   Regarding alternative A2, I’m also open to additional LSAPs, especially as a complement   to providing additional accommodation through our forward guidance  I would be particularly   supportive of MBS purchases to help foster recovery in the housing sector, especially since   dysfunction in mortgage markets is attenuating the effectiveness of monetary policy   accommodation  A pickup in the housing sector could make a substantial contribution to the   recovery if starts were to rebound toward more normal levels  Moreover, house prices have   significant effects on spending via wealth, cash flow, and collateral effects, and a stronger   housing market would also improve the health of the banking system  So initiatives along these   lines certainly deserve further consideration   In summary, rather than changing our forward guidance or engaging in further LSAPs at   the current meeting, I’m supportive of adopting alternative B today  With respect to the specific   language, I strongly prefer to stick with the current wording of “at least through mid-2013”   rather than substituting the phrase “for the next six to seven quarters”  The phrase “at least”   conveys that policy firming might not commence until significantly later than mid-2013, and this   November 1–2, 2011 224 of 282              phrasing has already been helpful in guiding financial markets, as Brian noted in his briefing   yesterday  The Desk survey suggests that investors now see liftoff as most likely in early 2014    Moreover, from the standpoint of effective communications, I consider it preferable to formulate   our forward guidance in terms that can be reiterated at each meeting as long as there isn’t any   substantial change in the economic outlook  In effect, we should lay out the anticipated path of   policy as clearly as possible based on our economic forecast, and we should follow that path   unless there’s a good reason to change it  Finally, on the language concerning “significant,” I   could, frankly, go either way on this  The current language, the language that was incorporated   initially in B, seemed acceptable to me based on the data suggesting less risk of inflation and the   fact that there has been some progress on Europe, but I could certainly live also with including   “significant,” especially if, as Brian says, it’s been digested by markets at this point  "
9148,2011-12-13,"  So moved    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I think it is worth recalling that this FOMC   meeting marks the third anniversary of the Committee’s historic decision to lower the federal   funds rate to zero  In announcing that decision, our December 2008 meeting statement indicated   that weak economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds   rate “for some time”  That phrase, and its successor—“an extended period”—were generally   interpreted as suggesting a likely duration of around three to six meetings  But here we are in   December 2011, and not only is the funds rate still pinned at zero, but modal market expectations   are that monetary policy will remain constrained by the zero lower bound for several more years    Moreover, professional forecasters, like most of us around the table, anticipate that the economy   will not be back on its balanced growth path for quite a long time to come  Can there be much   doubt that historians will look back on this period as the lost decade?   December 13, 2011 67 of 198              As we engage in our usual festivities this month, we might also keep in mind the   devastating economic circumstances that continue to confront so many people around the   country  For example, a record 46 million Americans can give thanks to the supplemental   nutritional assistance program for the meals on their holiday tables this season  Indeed, the   numbers of individuals receiving food stamps has risen month after month and is now more than   30 percent higher than in June 2009 when the NBER officially declared that the recession was   over   In sifting through the latest data, I was struck by the complex combination of recent   developments  In particular, unexpectedly strong readings on consumer spending and vehicles   sales were accompanied by a disappointingly large shortfall in income, and the surprisingly large   decline in unemployment was coupled with only modest growth in output and payroll   employment  In the end, I reached the same conclusion as the Tealbook—namely, that the   incoming data confirm the fundamental picture of an economy that is recovering only gradually   at best  In effect, under current policy settings, the US economy continues to face an   exceptionally prolonged period of unacceptably high unemployment and a duration of   unemployment spells that is simply unprecedented  The longer this situation persists, the more   likely it is that individuals who are unable to obtain work will be permanently scarred—a   development that is not only tragic for them and their families, but will also lower the potential   of our economy   While there are certainly some upside risks to the Tealbook’s outlook for a very slow   recovery, it is evidently quite hard to identify any scenario under current monetary policy in   which growth would be sufficiently robust to bring unemployment down to normal levels within   the next several years  In fact, no such alternative simulation appeared in the Tealbook  Even in   December 13, 2011 68 of 198              the scenarios labeled “Faster European Recovery” and “Faster Snapback,” unemployment falls   only to the vicinity of 7 percent at the end of 2014  Unfortunately, the drags afflicting aggregate   demand from fiscal policy, housing, and a weakening global economy and stronger dollar are   just too large to support robust growth     In my view, the risks to growth continue to be weighted to the downside  Most notably,   while the Europeans may have made some progress in cementing stronger long-run fiscal   discipline, they have done little to address the deterioration in the European economic outlook or   to resolve the uncertainties that have caused market participants to shed sovereign debt and lose   confidence in European banking institutions  Barring further major policy initiatives, those   uncertainties are likely to afflict the forecast for many months, if not years, to come  We can by   no means rule out an intensification of spillovers to our own financial markets and a further   appreciation of the dollar that could undermine the prospects of US export growth  At the same   time unemployment is forecast to fall far short of its maximum sustainable level and inflation   now appears likely to drift substantially below the 2 percent level most of us consider consistent   with the Fed’s dual mandate  Incoming data clearly confirm that inflation has subsided    Moreover, in light of the considerable slack in the labor market, subdued trends in compensation   and unit labor costs, and downward pressure on import prices, the Tealbook forecasts that   inflation is likely to run at around 1¼ to 1½ percent over the next several years  Fortunately,   long-term inflation expectations remain stable  However, as with the balance of risks to the   growth outlook, I also see the risk to inflation as weighted to the downside   With inflation expected to remain below mandate-consistent rates, and unemployment   expected to deviate very substantially from my estimate of its longer-run normal level, I consider   December 13, 2011 69 of 198              the case for providing additional accommodation to be very strong, as I will discuss in the policy   round    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I can support Alternative B today, although I   see a compelling case for further policy accommodation, given that my forecast envisions an   extended period of unemployment far above normal levels, coupled with inflation below   2 percent  In this regard, I found the discussion of rule-based recommendations in the Tealbook   very helpful  It reveals that every rule we monitor, with the exception of Taylor 1993, calls for   stimulus over and above that currently in place   There is also a strong case to do more from a risk-management perspective, given that the   zero bound is expected to constrain policy for the foreseeable future, and there are exceptionally   large downside risks  I’m attracted to both of the policy options in Alternative A and believe   these steps deserve serious consideration by the Committee in January   With respect to our forward guidance, I’d be inclined to shift mid-2013 guidance out to   late 2014  Such a shift would be consistent with current market expectations and the outcome-  based rule incorporated in the Tealbook baseline  The constrained optimal policy in the   Tealbook calls for an even later onset of tightening in mid-2016  Of course, forward guidance   indicating that we expect to hold the funds rate at zero through any particular date, even if   appropriate in the modal outlook, should not be unconditional  I, therefore, hope we can also   provide the public with greater insight into the economic conditions that the Committee believes   would continue to warrant such a policy stance  We have considered a number of different   approaches to elucidating conditionality, and I still see considerable merit in the threshold   approach that we have discussed in previous meetings and that President Evans has publicly   endorsed  But I’m open to alternatives, and the approach embodied in paragraph 4 of Alternative   A, while a little bit less informative about the Committee’s reaction function, also has   December 13, 2011 103 of 198              considerable merit  It would serve as a valuable complement to the policy projections that I   think we will begin including in the SEP in January   I’d also be supportive in January of a program of further asset purchases along the lines   proposed in Alternative A  MBS purchases make considerable sense because, in addition to   easing financial conditions generally, they could have a disproportionate effect on mortgage rates   and the housing sector  Mortgage rates have declined this year, but the spread between the fixed   mortgage rate and 10-year Treasuries has widened considerably   While I’d be open to either of the approaches suggested in Alternative A, I see some   significant merit embarking on an open-ended program of purchases as in paragraph 3′  The   program proposed there begins at a modest pace, and it could be scaled up or down over time as   conditions evolve  If we move in this direction, I believe it would be helpful for the public to   have a very clear idea of the policy objectives that would motivate the program  I hope we will   also agree to articulate a consensus statement of our goals and objectives  The publication of   policy projections, coupled with a consensus statement on our goals and policy framework,   would enable the public to place any further easing policies in appropriate perspective    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’d like to begin by thanking the members of   my subcommittee  Charlie Evans, Charlie Plosser, and Sarah Raskin for their work and   collegiality  I also want to thank the staff who supported our efforts  Andy Levin, Loretta   Mester, and Spence Krane   In launching this afternoon’s discussion, I thought it might be useful to begin by   describing one of my favorite electronic devices, namely, the Garmin Nuvi handheld GPS  It’s   not quite as fancy as the new Apple iPhone, but I find it’s very well suited for the specific task of   helping me follow the most efficient route to where I’m going  Of course, the first step in using   the Garmin is to indicate my destination or, in other words, to specify the goal that I’m trying to   reach  By the way, this step isn’t always so simple, especially when I’m with my husband and   son in San Francisco, and we’re debating what restaurant we want to eat at that evening  The   December 13, 2011 115 of 198              Garmin also lets me specify some basic options about the type of route  fastest, shortest, avoid   highways, and so forth  Perhaps you might think of those settings as specifying the essential   strategy for determining the route  Once I’ve entered my goal and my strategy settings, the   Garmin displays the projected path from my current location to the specified destination  In   particular, the appropriate path may change once I’m under way  For example, if I need to make   a temporary detour, such as a pit stop for gasoline, the Garmin performs a quick recalculation   and then displays a new path from that point onward  Moreover, on such occasions, the Garmin   also helps reassure my passengers that we haven’t gotten lost [laughter], and we’re still on a   feasible route to the destination   Aside from giving you potential gift ideas for the holiday season, I hope that this analogy   helps motivate the communications initiatives that our subcommittee has submitted for your   consideration today  In particular, we believe it would be very beneficial for the Committee to   agree on a consensus statement regarding longer-run goals and policy strategy so that the public   can clearly understand our intended destination and our basic approach for getting there  And we   would recommend that information about participants’ assessments of appropriate policy be   incorporated into the SEP starting in January so that the public can see the policy paths that   underpin our projections for economic activity and inflation  In the remainder of my remarks, I   will highlight a few broad issues regarding these initiatives, and then Spence Krane will brief   you on some specific details   In considering the SEP initiatives, it’s useful to keep in mind that the Committee had   extensive discussions of monetary policy communications in 2006 and 2007, especially since   there are only a few of us old-timers sitting around the table who were around in those days of   yore  We looked closely at the monetary policy reports issued by a number of other central   December 13, 2011 116 of 198              banks, but everyone agreed that negotiating and publishing a single FOMC forecast would be   completely unworkable  We also considered the ECB’s approach of publishing the outlook of   the staff but not that of policymakers, but that approach also seemed problematic   After exploring other possibilities, we finally decided to build on the same basic approach   that the Committee had been following since the late 1970s in conjunction with the semiannual   reports to the Congress—namely, collecting and publishing summary information about   participants’ economic outlook based on their own individual assessments of the appropriate path   of policy—and thus, the SEP was launched in November 2007  Of course, the Committee could   always decide to completely rethink our entire communication strategy, as long as everyone   understands that it would likely involve another multiyear effort  Moreover, having spent a   cumulative total of about a decade sitting at this table, I suspect that another big rethink might   well end up with the same basic approach we decided to follow in 2007  After all, the FOMC is   a relatively large and diverse Committee, and that diversity is clearly visible to the public in the   minutes, as well as in our speeches, media interviews, and so forth  As we know, devoted Fed   watchers can sift through all of those features and interviews in an effort to gauge the sense of   the Committee and the range of views  However, it seems much more transparent and sensible   for the FOMC itself to be conducting a regular survey of participants and to publish summary   information about the distribution of our views using quantitative exhibits as well as qualitative   narrative  Thus, our subcommittee’s basic strategy has been to consider potential enhancements   to the SEP rather than going all the way back to square one yet again   In the course of our discussions back in 2006 and 2007, we did consider the possibility of   including participants’ policy projections in the SEP, but our assessment of benefits and costs   was quite different at that time  On the one hand, we were still in the great moderation era, and   December 13, 2011 117 of 198              the federal funds rate was reasonably close to its longer-run neutral level, so there didn’t seem to   be compelling benefits of publishing information about the anticipated path of policy  On the   other hand, there were significant concerns that such projections could be misunderstood as   unconditional promises rather than contingent on incoming information  Consequently, it   seemed appropriate to focus on conveying the economic outlook when the SEP was launched   At this juncture, however, our subcommittee sees a compelling case for incorporating   policy projections into the SEP  Given that the federal funds rate is roughly 4 to 4½ percentage   points below its longer-run neutral level, our assessments of the outlook for economic activity   and inflation are intrinsically linked to our judgments regarding the appropriate path of policy,   including the timing of liftoff as well as the pace of subsequent firming  Indeed, it has become   increasingly difficult to provide a plausible rationale for publishing our economic projections   while withholding information about the policy assessments that underpin those projections    Thus, incorporating policy projections into the SEP will comprise a substantial enhancement in   FOMC transparency   Although any communications initiative is associated with some potential downside   risks, our subcommittee views those risks as both modest and manageable in this instance  After   all, the Committee has been providing forward policy guidance in our meeting statements for the   past three years, so the inclusion of policy projections in the SEP will not be the same sort of   novelty that it might have been back in 2007  In fact, publishing such information in the SEP   might help underscore the conditional nature of our forward guidance because the public will be   able to see how the policy projections evolve over time in response to incoming information   Our subcommittee also recognizes that the distribution of policy projections in the SEP   may not always line up neatly with the forward guidance of the meeting statement  However, to   December 13, 2011 118 of 198              put it in Silicon Valley terms, we see that characteristic as a feature, not a bug  In particular, our   meeting statement is developed through a consensus-building process that frequently involves   compromise among participants with diverse views about the appropriate path of policy  At   present, that diversity of views only becomes apparent to the public through a fairly chaotic   process, namely, a random sequence of speeches and media interviews  In contrast, if   information about participants’ policy projections is incorporated into the SEP, then the   Chairman can refer to that information in his post-FOMC press conferences whenever that seems   appropriate   Looking ahead, our subcommittee is eager to explore other potential enhancements to the   SEP, including several possibilities noted in our recent memo as well as any other suggestions   that you would like us to consider  Our tentative plan would be to come back to the Committee   with further recommendations next spring, but our motto for today is, “Don’t let the best become   the enemy of the good”  We hope that you will support our recommendation to proceed with   incorporating policy projections into the SEP starting in January   Turning now to the second communications initiative, I’ll say a few words about process    At the November FOMC meeting, the Chairman encouraged our subcommittee to develop a   consensus statement regarding the Committee’s longer-run goals and policy strategy  Over   subsequent weeks, we prepared an initial draft and made revisions in light of the feedback we   received through our informal consultations  The latest draft was circulated to the Committee   last Friday, and it incorporates a few editing adjustments relative to the previous draft  Our   subcommittee is hopeful that this draft can garner broad support from Committee participants    However, we’re not recommending any specific decision at this meeting  Rather, we will be   listening closely to your comments and we will certainly do our best to help identify any further   December 13, 2011 119 of 198              adjustments that would help expand the breadth of support  And if the Chairman judges the   degree of consensus to be sufficiently broad, we would plan on presenting that statement for   formal consideration by the Committee at the January organizational meeting  Thank you, Mr   Chairman, Spence Krane will now brief the Committee on the details of these communications   initiatives  "
9172,2013-10-16,"  So moved    I was just going to mention that it seemed to me you mentioned at the   outset that the minutes of this meeting would be a good opportunity  It looks like we’re going to   get through this episode  The minutes would come out at a normal time  If we have a   reasonably detailed discussion indicating that the Committee supports 1 to 5 and that’s   articulated clearly in the minutes of this meeting, while it doesn’t bind a future Committee in   terms of what they’ll do in some future crisis, it certainly could be pointed to and would be   suggestive that the Committee has considered this and would regard this as normal  And   depending on what we say on the next set of issues, it might also be helpful for the minutes to   provide at least some indication of the Committee’s inclination, say, on RPs    I would just say, to be brief, I agree completely with President   Rosengren that on 7 particularly, it’s something we should be prepared to do for the sake of   financial stability and our monetary policy objectives, if there’s real pressure on repo rates  The   ways in which this can occur have been well articulated by Vice Chairman Dudley and Governor   Powell  And if there is time to consult with the FOMC, I think it’s advisable to do so  But I can   easily imagine situations where there wouldn’t be time to consult, and I think the Chairman   should have the discretion   And on 8 and 9, I agree with Governors Stein, Tarullo, and Rosengren—these are things I   wouldn’t take off the table  I wouldn’t be eager to do them, but I wouldn’t say “never”  "
