 I was sitting back there along the wall   Baby steps   As in most of the rest of the country, conditions in the Eighth  District are strong and labor markets are very tight The unemployment rate in the Eighth  District is actually a bit below the national average Rather than repeat the kinds of anecdotes we  have heard before along those lines, I would like to emphasize my interpretation of the Asian  situation because I think we are all searching for that as the key to understanding where we are    3/31/98  In my view there are three analytically distinct effects on the US economy that flow  from Asia One is the trade effect If we search, we find firms and industries that are impacted  by reduced Asian demand for US goods In the Eighth District, we see this in food processing,  including chickens I was surprised to discover how high a fraction of District food exports go to  Asia  Secondly, after the summer, as the impacts of Asian developments and the  appreciation of those impacts grew, we obviously had declining interest rates I think that came  about for two reasons one, safe-haven money came to the United States; secondly, there  emerged a view in US markets that the Asian impacts would slow the economy and that the  odds on monetary policy becoming easier or tighter had changed That was an indirect effect  from Asia I suspect that the second reason relating to the outlook for monetary policy was much  more important than the safe-haven money that came here Obviously, the lower interest rates  are unambiguously expansionary for the US economy  The third analytically distinct impact is lower oil prices that have come about from the  decline in Asian demand for oil The lower prices have had mixed effects in the United States  The firms and the regions that specialize in oil production are obviously impacted negatively, but  the overall impact is positive because we have a lot of oil consumers who are benefiting  My overall assessment is that Asia is primarily a relative demand shock rather than an  aggregate demand shock for the United States We have shifts in the mix of demands in the US  economy I believe we need to appreciate especially that the particular impacts we see in the  trade account and in the oil regions are easy to spot That is, they involve particular firms,  whereas the generalized effects on consumers that come from lower interest rates and lower oil    3/31/98  prices are much more diffuse I think they are much more important but easier to miss precisely  because they are so widespread  Overall, it seems to me that slower US growth than that seen in recent quarters is  likely but primarily because of resource constraints Economic activity is bumping along, it  seems to me, above and beyond capacity I do not see slower growth in aggregate demand  because I believe the underpinnings for further growth in aggregate demand are very strong  There are many signs of booming demand The ones that impress me are the recent rapid growth  of income, output, and consumer demand that is fed by rising asset prices everywhere one  looks--equities, bonds, real estate--and high and rising money growth, however defined This is  not an issue of exactly what monetary aggregate is one's favorite since all of the Ms are giving  the same kind of picture We also have tight labor markets and wage pressures In sum, I don't  see anything in current economic conditions that suggests significant negatives in our outlook   I am very surprised that in recent months the markets have responded  so little to the stronger than anticipated economic data The markets have absolutely solid  expectations that we will not move I think it is very unfortunate that that situation faces us as  we sit here today As an outsider, I also have been puzzled about the asymmetric directive  because it appears six weeks or more after the time it is adopted It may turn out that the  message is not what we want at the time it actually appears I think we know what kind of  message we would like to give today and would expect from the remarks that the Chairman  intends to give at the appropriate time--namely, that the markets need to be prepared for a  tightening in the future The asymmetric directive, if released quickly, could be a mechanism for  providing that message I hope that we can deal with this issue very promptly I agree that we  need to discuss it, but I hope we can have it on the agenda quite soon and perhaps make a  decision on this at the next meeting In my view, disclosing the symmetry or asymmetry  promptly might have some benefits But I find it puzzling that if we adopt an asymmetric  directive today, which I am prepared to support, it will not be released until after the next  meeting   I, like everyone else around the table, am well aware that the inflation  numbers look very good But I am concerned that we are at a very vulnerable stage We could  have some bad news and once a rise in inflation gets going, particularly if our policy has gotten  behind, it is going to be very hard to catch up So, I think we want to move before we see any  worsening in the inflation numbers That is what is going to keep it all under control    3/31/98   I have a comment and a question Clearly, the outlook depends, as you  made clear, on the outlook for equity prices, the bond market, and the exchange rate For the bond  market, you are assuming that rates stay about where they are, which I think is a sensible thing to  do I think it makes the most sense to have a baseline forecast that follows the same procedure with  respect to all of these speculative markets, making use of the evidence from the marketplace The  baseline stock market assumption should be along the lines whereby the returns will approximate  the risk-free rate plus the equity premium, with a similar kind of assumption for the exchange rate  where changes are based on interest rate differentials The staff would then explore the  implications for the forecast of some potential deviations from those baseline financial market  conditions That would be my suggested approach  I have a question on inventories Have you made any inquiries to firms in industries  where you suspect that there has been large inventory accumulation? We talked about the specific  information that we have on oil inventories But how about other industries where there may be  inventory accumulation that you can identify? Have there been any phone calls to people in those  industries to ask them what is going on as best they know?   I was just trying to get at the issue of whether the firms themselves felt  that their inventory accumulation was voluntary or involuntary   Right, that's what I thought   I was about to get to that!   May I ask a question on that, a very quick question?   I just had a very brief question about personal income Doesn't the  first release on personal income come mostly from the employment data? If so, is it really an  independent reading on personal income?   Okay   As with everybody who asks business leaders, bankers, and others  about labor market pressures, we see such pressures in the Eighth District In addition to staff input  on this issue, I have been traveling around the District, and I participated in three sessions in    5/19/98  different cities In these sessions I was particularly trying to extract from people evidence of price  pressures What we get by and large are stories about wage pressures The stories about price  pressures continue to be rather isolated It looks as though firms are either turning down business  or just finding ways to deliver the goods or the promised services at prices that are more or less  where they have been  The labor market continues to tighten One of our directors put it this way a woman  who runs a computer services firm said that she can not even find recruiters anymore! [Laughter]  There is no question that the pressures are there I keep asking myself how we should interpret  these apparently inconsistent findings on the wage side and the labor market side and on the price  side What I come out with is that there are solid, perhaps even rock solid, expectations in the  marketplace of continuing low inflation Firms do not want to permit costs to get built into their  structures that they do not think they can realize in future prices Therefore, the wage increases that  we are seeing by and large are in isolated areas or in areas where firms find that they can improve  the productivity of their operations one way or another and meet what they view as very, very  competitive price conditions  I worry, though, that these solid expectations of continuing low inflation will last only  so long as we continue to see good performance on inflation itself If inflation starts to rise, I worry  that some of these expectations will start to come unstuck The process could become cumulative,  and we could see a much quicker change in that outlook than we would all like to contemplate  I recall that the situation in the UK in the late 1980s was rather the same The  measures of inflation expectations in the UK indexed bonds compared with the conventional  bonds did not show that the market was successful in foreseeing the outbreak of inflation in the  UK, which, of course, was quite substantial The market does not necessarily foresee what may    5/19/98  be ahead I think the market is relying on us to make that forecast come true, and we should be  very cautious about saying that there is a benign situation, that there is no problem just because the  market doesn't see a problem The market is looking to us to make that forecast come true Those  are the only comments that I want to offer at this point   I want to start with the puzzle that I talked about at the last meeting  The markets and business forecasters are all looking at the same data that we look at Yet, they  seem to be assigning essentially zero probability to the possibility of a Fed tightening That  concerns me because I think markets are not paying enough attention to what the Fed may have to  do to sustain the excellent record on low inflation, which has to be our primary goal I believe it is  important that we talk about our outlook for aggregate demand rather than output per se In my  view, output growth may well slow because of resource constraints If it does slow, that will not  necessarily be a sign that we are out of the woods We need to be looking at aggregate demand  growth As I see it, we have somewhat of a classic case in which money growth and associated  measures may be giving a different signal than some of the other developments in the economy  We are going to have to make some choices about that  I do not have a conviction that however I vote my decision will turn out to be right  after the fact I have been trying to think through the various risks and the tradeoffs One approach    5/19/98  is to look at the situation at the end of the year and in retrospect at the decision that we reach today  and my own position There are two risks to weigh one against the other If we do not act today  when in retrospect we should have taken action, what are the costs that we will have set in train?  The other way, if we act today when in retrospect we should not have, what are the costs? It seems  to me we have to weigh those two in trying to decide how to come out on this  I think that the difficulties in countries around the world, including of course Asia  most immediately, should not be a major influence on our decision That's because it seems to me  that if the US economy starts to go off track, we are going to create problems for the international  economy as a consequence I also am concerned that although Indonesia is the problem in front of  us today, at our next meeting it might be another country, and at the meeting after that still another  I am worried that by looking at the problems abroad we can be diverted from our major  responsibility for price stability in the United States  As I weigh the case I and the case II risks, it seems to me that if we raise rates today  and in retrospect it turns out that the increase was not necessary, we can reduce rates in the future  while creating very minimal problems in the meantime from that action On the other hand, if we  do not act today when looking back we find we should have, it seems to me that we will be getting  ourselves further behind and digging ourselves into a deeper problem that would be considerably  more costly to straighten out than if we had started earlier So, that is my calculus along those  lines I do not have, as I emphasized, a conviction that whatever we do, it will turn out in retrospect  to be the right thing to do I think we have to weigh the costs of the different kinds of mistakes that  we may make   I think this is a very nice piece of work, but if I were assigned a job of  refereeing it for a journal, I know that it would take me two or three days, maybe a week, of hard  full-time work to get through the paper and get to the bottom of it There are a lot of very  interesting but very important technical issues affecting how the staff gets these results I think  the overall issue is extremely important as a backdrop to a decision, which I hope we will reach at  some point, that our long-run policy goal is zero inflation properly measured, whatever that might    6/30-7/1/98  mean in terms of the actual CPI I believe we need to be clear about all the technical issues  involved before we actually confront this as a live issue I would propose that this paper be put  into whatever is the appropriate form and sent out to four or five academic specialists in  macroeconomics who approach these issues from different perspectives to give us the best  professional opinions I have spent so little time on the paper that I hesitate even to comment on  it I spent a couple of hours reading and thinking about it, and I have thought about these issues  before I don't know whether you want to get into a substantive discussion on this, Mr  Chairman   I agree Obviously, if it is going outside, it would have to be done in a  way that would not cause us grief from that point of view   This is an issue that has been discussed in the academic literature for a  long, long time   My reading of the ranges in recent years is that they are almost  completely ignored by the public primarily because the financial markets realize that money  growth does not play an essential role in the Committee's deliberations on the course of policy  That was my perception when I became a member of this Committee I think the ranges can  serve a useful function in conveying our attitude about a policy on inflation in the long run I  would leave it completely to the Chairman as to how he believes he can most effectively use this  opportunity to convey the Committee's views I certainly share the view that a move to  alternative II would be very unfortunate because I think it would be read in the context of some  relaxation of our concern about inflation The question as to whether we have alternative I or  alternative III or III-A or something else along those lines, I would leave completely to the  Chairman's discretion to choose whatever he thinks he could use most effectively in conveying  our views  I, of course, have some sympathy with Larry Meyer's statement that the aggregates  should play a more important role in our policymaking That is certainly my view But I think  the Committee has to get there first in terms of our actual use of aggregates in the making of  policy before we announce to the world that that is what we are doing So, although I have a lot  of sympathy with that approach to policy, I don't think it would be a good idea to make the  announcement and then not carry through on it   I would like to make three comments The first is a plea on  terminology dealing with net exports We know as a matter of arithmetic that I plus C plus G  minus net imports equals output; that is arithmetic But to say that net imports are a drag on  output is making an assumption about causation that I do not think should be there   I'm not so sure about that, but I think it is very easy to express that in a  different way We can simply say that total spending exceeds total output when net exports are  negative I think it is too easy to slip into a wrong frame of mind on this My plea is to be  accurate on the terminology here  Secondly, when I looked up oil price futures in the newspaper this morning, August of  this year to August of next year, I saw Brent oil futures going from $14 to $17 per barrel I think  that is a substantially larger increase than you have, so you might want to comment on why your  view differs from that in the futures market  Thirdly, and this is the most important comment, it seems to me that the internal  structure of your forecast makes perfect sense if growth in final sales slows The components of  the forecast would be internally consistent But I still do not understand where the drive to slow  the growth of aggregate demand comes from The real federal funds rate is falling during this  period because you have the CPI rising and presumably inflation expectations, at least in the  model, are consistent with the CPI We assume the market is smart and sees what is going on so  that the real funds rate is falling The only retarding influence in the forecast is the impact from  Asia It reminds me a lot of the debates when I first came into this profession in the late 1960s  when we were hanging everything for a slowdown of the economy on federal fiscal restraint    6/30-7/1/98  The Asian impact is very much like a restraining fiscal policy We all know what happened in  the late 1960s environment The fiscal restraint in 1968 did not in fact slow the economy So, I  am very worried that we are putting much too much weight on Asia in this outlook and that we  are not paying enough attention to the underlying strength of aggregate demand as driven by  very accommodative monetary and credit conditions   As opposed to unwatchful waiting not being the right policy!   I will try not to double anything Since our last meeting, there has been  no significant change in Eighth District economic conditions We continue to have exactly the  same kind of stories about tight labor markets and firms with unfilled positions We don't see  any great upward pressure on product prices We do have some disruptions from the GM strike,  as is true in a number of other Districts It looks as if we're going to have an Anheuser-Busch  strike, but perhaps given the uncompleted stadium in Texas--   I am told that the management of Anheuser intends to keep the brewery  operating, so I guess it will become the largest microbrewery in the United States  District housing markets remain very strong In most markets, we have seen house  price increases in the 5 to 10 percent range over the last year Prices in the St Louis market rose  14 percent in the last 12 months according to the data I'm looking at, suggesting that I bought  my house just in time back in early April  I would like to talk about the national outlook and the puzzle in the business  investment area If one thinks about firms that are growing over time and expanding capacity,  one would expect them to be adding capital and labor and not ending up with excess capacity in  either area If we look at the capacity utilization numbers, it would appear that conditions are  quite comfortable, and yet all around the country we hear stories of labor shortages, firms with  unfilled positions, and an increasing amount of turnover So, there seems to be something of a  mismatch between the capital and the labor sides That could come about because firms have    6/30-7/1/98  made some miscalculations, but I'm guessing that the investment outlook will remain strong  because firms in this situation are going to be substituting capital for the labor that they cannot  hire We have an example in Louisville UPS is going to be adding a huge facility, an  investment of over $800 million, to automate the package sorting that they do every night and  reduce the large amount of hand labor in that operation That is a very large investment I hope  it works better than the baggage handling system at the Denver airport, which also was  automated, but I guess the Denver airport eventually straightened that problem out Given the  persisting stories that we hear about the shortages of labor, we probably will continue to see  strong investment With the capacity utilization numbers that we are looking at reflecting capital  that is not in tune with the available labor or some maldistribution by industry or otherwise, we  should not be lured too readily into a comfortable outlook on investment just because the  capacity utilization numbers look lower than they have at times in the past  I continue to believe that with an unchanged federal funds rate, the inflation risks are  substantially greater on the upside of the Greenbook forecast than on the downside I have not  changed my views at all, so I will not repeat them   My concern is that meeting after meeting we are drifting into a situation  that will accommodate higher inflation next year and the year after Let me start with an  assumption about the policy environment that we are going to be facing over the next few  meetings through the rest of this year The inflation rate over the remainder of this year is almost  completely predetermined We don't know what it's going to be, but whatever it is, it is not  going to be much affected by what we do at this meeting or the next However, what happens to  the inflation rate is going to make a difference to the environment within which we are making  our policy decisions  I am also quite prepared to assume that our external problems or the problems in other  economies are very likely to be with us, and I fear they will be with us for a long time Consider  two different scenarios for our coming meetings First, suppose that the published CPI inflation  rate remains low That will make life easy for us We will have the luxury of acting or not  acting at any point, and we can continue a policy of watchful waiting But consider scenario  two Suppose that the CPI starts to rise in the published data to the 3 to 4 percent range, which I  think is certainly well within the realm of possibility Then we are going to be faced with some  very, very difficult decisions Assuming the problems with Asia and maybe elsewhere in the  world persist, we are going to be faced with the same unpleasant external situation but with the  added pressure of CPI increases right in our faces I continue to believe that it would be best if  we were to raise the funds rate now rather than to wait for what I think could well be a more  difficult environment for taking action in the future    6/30-7/1/98  It is not obvious to me that a tightening move now is going to make the situation in  Japan worse What I believe the Japanese need to do is to have a consistent policy direction on a  number of fronts, including a monetary policy that is more expansionary to end their deflation  Such a policy in Japan is likely to lead to some further depreciation of the yen against the dollar,  and that is a constraint that the Japanese feel in part because of US pressures If an  appreciation of the dollar against the yen is attributed to policy action here, it may actually make  the situation easier for Japan I don't know  Having said all that, I well understand the judgment going the other way There are  very tricky issues in the international markets and because of all the uncertainties in the outlook  that we have discussed, I am happy to support your recommendation   When I try to think through this issue, I start with three elements We  have policy decisions; we have a policy rationale that we try to convey to the markets; and we  have the internal policy debate I think it is very important that the internal policy debate be kept  confidential so that we can have a complete and free exchange  In terms of the policy decisions, I believe they should be disclosed promptly to the  market in part to avoid leaks and in part to provide the clearest possible direction to market  participants and to avoid the problem of different market participants with different positions  getting information at different times In the past, before the funds rate decision was announced    6/30-7/1/98  after every meeting, some market participants, the experts, got the information first, and I do not  think that is a wise way to operate  In terms of the rationale, a fully articulated rationale is impossible We are never  going to agree on exactly why we do things We all come out in somewhat different directions  The rationale that is incorporated in the directive is very, very general It is mostly boilerplate I  don't understand the difficulty of releasing the full directive because it is almost all boilerplate,  and it is a very minimal common ground that we can agree on So, I would be in favor of  releasing the directive I cannot imagine that release would cause us any grief  The issue then comes down to the question of whether the tilt is a policy decision or  not If it is not a policy decision, it seems to me that it does not belong in the directive at all  because the directive is a statement of what we are telling the Open Market Desk to do and the  underlying rationale for that I think the tilt could be used constructively to convey our sense of  the balance of risks, the likely future direction of our policy decisions I believe that is the point  that Bob Parry was making Of course, that is where I came in at my very first meeting back in  March because we were facing this issue We were talking about whether we should be  providing some signal to the markets about our future policy direction, and we thought moving  to asymmetry might be useful in that regard Maybe it is like a half step on the funds rate We  might have different interpretations of exactly what it is, but I think it would be useful to keep it  in the directive and treat it as part of our policy decision, providing a sense to the market of our  future direction   Conditions in the Eighth District are substantially the same as they have  been in recent months Labor markets remain tight Labor shortages are abundant, particularly in  professional areas Builders are unable to satisfy demand in some markets The agricultural  economy in the Eighth District is in fairly good shape There are some areas that have had too    8/18/98  much rain and some too little, but on the whole crops are going to be satisfactory In sum,  economic conditions are about unchanged in the Eighth District, but there is an ever so slightly  easier or less buoyant feel to these District conditions  I want to concentrate my comments on the national economy I also want to talk about  Asia from that perspective, but I will begin by talking about the balance between aggregate supply  and demand, putting Asia aside On the aggregate supply side, I think that we probably have  overshot full employment and are seeing evidence of that in the upcreep of wages and in the labor  shortages that are widely reported My casual impression is that we have rising numbers of labor  disputes and time lost through labor disputes There have been a number of strikes That is a  standard feature of labor markets that are overstressed Almost independently of what happens to  aggregate demand, I think we can anticipate slower growth of employment than we have had as  we move toward a closer equilibrium of supply and demand in the labor market  On the aggregate demand side, domestic final sales remain strong, and that was true in  the second quarter as well Money growth, whether we use M2 or a narrower measure--I prefer  MZM because I think it avoids the problem with sweeps--is up substantially over the last year in  terms of both measures It has tapered down a little most recently, but I see no signs of a real turn  Now, how big is the impact from Asia? Has that slowed aggregate demand sufficiently  to put us on a reasonable track for the near future? Asia accounts for roughly 25 percent of the  world economy If 25 percent of the world's economy gets into deep trouble, one would expect to  see a big impact on the other 75 percent The question here is the magnitudes involved Consider  an analogy within the United States Suppose California got into really big trouble Suppose Bob  Parry really screwed up so that the whole Twelfth District had a financial crisis and California  looked about like Japan and Nevada about like Indonesia and Oregon about like Malaysia and so    8/18/98  forth Would that have a big effect on the rest of the United States? Well, of course it would!  That region is fully integrated into a single national economic area We use the same currency  We have a completely integrated capital market The labor markets are closely interconnected  through a lot of movement of the workforce The goods markets are completely connected There  are no trade barriers except for a few agricultural barriers Trying to take fruit into California may  be a problem, but that's about it  The relationship of the Asian economies to the economies of the rest of the world is  quite different The labor markets are not integrated at all The goods markets are integrated  The Asian economies are open, but nothing like California and the rest of the United States  Capital markets are fairly well integrated There are floating exchange rates, but not a single  currency So, there is a very great difference between 25 percent of the world economy in Asia  and a comparable piece of the US economy  The question is how large are the impacts flowing from Asia to the rest of the world  economy and particularly to the United States Total US exports are something on the order of  14 percent of GDP, and our exports to Asia are something on the order of 3 percent of GDP  These are rough orders of magnitude, close enough for back-of-the-envelope calculations Of  course, we are not going to lose all of our exports to Asia So, if we anticipate a significant effect,  we have to rely on an argument that says there are substantial indirect effects on other parts of  US trade that are coming through other countries Obviously, as Europe loses some exports to  Asia, European demand for US goods may go down But it is critical to get the magnitudes right  and not be seduced by the high visibility of the Asian problems There is no question that these  Asian countries are experiencing very severe problems, but the question is how big are the  impacts flowing through into the United States economy as a whole    8/18/98  The research staff at the St Louis Fed has taken a look at the disaggregated US  exports for the first five months of this year relative to the first five months of last year They  have broken down our exports by two-digit SIC industry codes to try to get a real feel for the  magnitudes involved The effects on some of these industries are very large At the top of the list  we find that SIC code 10--producers of metallic ores and concentrates--have lost 50 percent of  their exports to Asia In other words, firms in those industries have seen their orders of such  products from Asia cut in half Obviously, that is very visible Producers of some other products  like refined petroleum and related goods have seen their Asian demand decline by as much as 47  percent If we go down the list, agriculture and livestock exports to Asia are down 29 percent this  year compared to last year I will not read the whole table  Of course, the relevant question for the impact on the US economy is not those  numbers but the decline in exports to Asia relative to the size of these industries If we take the  industry that has experienced the biggest percentage impact, metallic ores and concentrates, which  lost 50 percent of its Asian business, that turns out to be about 1-1/4 percent of the product of that  industry, using 1996 production levels So, the loss of the Asian business amounted to 1-1/4 percent  of the domestic production of that industry That gives us the right order of magnitude in terms of  the effects within the United States The biggest impact for any of these industries is that for  agriculture and livestock, which lost about 2 percent of its business as a consequence of the  reduction in exports to Asia I don't know what the effects of the Asian problems will be in other  parts of the world, but I think it is very important for us to keep the magnitudes in the context of  the size of the market in the United States In addition, we should not forget the indirect offsets  that take place because Asia is not an integrated part of a single currency area within the United  States, the point that I made before    8/18/98  I don't think there is any question that the risks in the outlook have become greater in  both directions If it turns out that the impacts from abroad are larger than our best guess  currently, obviously demands in the United States are going to be weaker There may also be  substantial financial and political uncertainties stemming from unrest in some of these countries  that would have an effect on our economy On the other hand, it may well be that the underlying  strength of nominal demand in the United States is going to be little affected by Asia and that we  will find ourselves in an increasingly inflationary environment I think the uncertainties are quite  substantial in that regard That is about all I want to say at this point Thank you   I support alternative B I also support a symmetrical directive because I  think that the risks are far more symmetrical now than they have been during the previous few  months since I became a member of this Committee I would like to point out that a key feature  of the policy regime in recent years is that the market has moved rates and has done a lot of the  stabilization work for us under conditions where the Fed has set the right long-run environment  and the market has moved There currently is plenty of room for the market to move rates higher,  and should incoming data start to point in that direction, I would anticipate that the market would  back up quite a bit So, in that sense, there is plenty of room for a tightening policy to take place  through the market In the other direction, there is not that much room, although a little, for rates  to decline from where they are now because they are anchored to the current fed funds rate That  would mean that if economic conditions were to weaken quite a bit as the data come in over  coming weeks and months, we might be looking for policy easing to follow the market down as  that evidence accumulates   I, too, like Option 1, but I would prefer the tilt language from Option 2  I think that the earliest possible release of the minutes, consistent with their being written clearly  and informatively, is a good idea I would like to add that I cannot imagine a better time to  introduce these new procedures than right now, given the other things that are going on   Conditions in the Eighth District, as we have heard around the table  with regard to other Districts, are largely unchanged in the real economy I think it's fair to say  that the mood is less buoyant than it was earlier The financial market upsets, again in terms of  the real economy, have been I think largely a spectator sport so far, although one that is much  less fun than watching Mark McGuire I want to reemphasize the point that Bill McDonough  made The stock market decline is a very typical decline; its size is nothing abnormal, but the  spreads that we have seen open up in lower quality credits indicate a very abnormal state of  affairs The spreads were too narrow before, but they are now much too wide If those spreads  remain that wide, they will be an indication of a very serious drawing back in the very near  future So, I interpret the conditions in my own District and the stories that we hear as simply  reflecting the fact that the financial market upsets have not yet registered in the lending and  spending activities that affect the real economy The stock market declines should make us feel  good in a sense, but I will confess that every decline, especially the big declines, give me a very  uneasy feeling Every recovery that we have had in these volatile markets has made me breathe  a little easier As I see it, the situation is quite uncertain right now  The variance of the outlook has certainly increased The soft landing scenario is  something of a central tendency, with a fairly wide range of perfectly plausible outcomes on    9/29/98  either side It may be the best bet down the middle, but there is some significant probability on  both sides That suggests we may have a lot of business ahead of us as the information comes in  If we get the soft landing, then I would suppose that the spreads will have to narrow because  everything will seem to be coming out all right and the financial markets should settle down  That obviously is what we want Clearly, we will continue to see adverse effects coming from  abroad The recessionary trends abroad are affecting US exports and the import-competing  industries; steel is a good example Those effects are very real and to some extent we are going  to end up with an economy that is going in two directions, with some domestic activities very  clearly impacted by the foreign sector But the external sector is not by any means the largest  segment of the national economy If the home-grown industries--the service industries,  construction, housing, domestic investment--can all remain solid, we are going to come out all  right on a national average basis, although the hurting industries will to continue to hurt until  conditions improve abroad  With regard to the outlook, it seems to me that we have something of a race between  two forces here Interest rates on low risk credits have declined Borrowers who are very well  situated, such as homeowners who can put down substantial equity, are going to have their  activities stimulated by this environment On the other hand, the more risky borrowers are going  to be held back They are going to have projects cancelled So, we have a race between these  two forces that will determine exactly how the economy comes out over the next quarter or two  Of course, that will then determine whether the economy tips over into a genuine recession or  whether it in fact ends up with a soft landing So, I certainly agree that the balance of risks has  tipped very decidedly over into the negative side I think that the flight to quality does explain  recent rapid money growth, but I want to emphasize that the dramatically increased spreads in  the financial markets are highly abnormal They just do not represent business as usual    9/29/98   I support the proposed cut of 25 basis points I have a preference for  symmetry, but I don't believe the issue is very important In the long run what we do is what  determines the outcome, although I believe that what we say can be extremely important in the  short run So, we need to be clear about our direction and our purpose We have to emphasize  that our intention is to focus on the US economy not because we are unconcerned with what is  going on abroad but because we have only one policy instrument At best, we can serve one  policy objective and that should be to achieve price stability or maintain low inflation in the  United States That is a very important message that we need to repeat continuously Market  expectations are very important in terms of how monetary policy exerts its effects in the short  run We have seen a large decline in interest rates in recent months That is not just good luck  It is not just an accident It is a consequence of the market's understanding of the Federal  Reserve's objectives and what its policy is going to be in the long run That decline in interest  rates could not have occurred if the market did not believe that the incoming data were consistent  with low inflation and that we would in time act to bring interest rates down as required to keep    9/29/98  the economy in'the neighborhood of full employment So, I think that the consistent message  that we send about the importance that we attach to our long-run objective of price stability is  essential to having built in stabilizing effects from market fluctuations in rates  I would like to comment briefly on the discount rate In the long run, I would like to  see the discount rate closer to the federal funds rate, but I think that this is not the time to make  any such adjustment I hope that the Board will accept a 1/4 percentage point cut in the discount  rate so that the change in the federal funds rate at this time will be viewed as perfectly normal  and will not send any possibly confusing messages to the market   I favor Option 2, and I agree that the sentence about "any potential  changes" does not add to the clarity of the directive A new issue that I would like to raise  relates to the last sentence of the directive concerning M2 and M3 I would hope that we would  not have a ritual expectation of slowing monetary growth if we do not in fact have such an  expectation I think, for example, that slower growth probably was not our expectation in the  recent past So, I would hope that if we are going to have this sentence in the directive, it  actually will reflect the judgment of the Committee and not be just ritually inserted   Perhaps, yes   There is a potential problem here I agree with Al Broaddus that the  federal funds language should refer to the intermeeting period, but I think it's clear that the  reference to growth in the monetary aggregates covers more than the intermeeting period So,  we should put in some language that has a longer horizon for the aggregates   I just wanted to emphasize the release issue, too I do not want to miss  the discussion of immediate release   I agree with Jerry Jordan that it does not matter, in buying securities at  auction, whether the Treasury is issuing conventional bonds or TIPS In either case, we are just  taking them off the market So, I don't think it's a good idea to buy them at auction either I  think TIPS are an experiment It has not been under way all that long, but I am concerned about  the message that we might be sending to the market I think we might interfere with the  information value of these bonds if we're in the market, particularly if we're in the secondary  market, because then the game for the dealers becomes one of trying to figure out when we are    11/17/98  going to come in and at what price we are going to come in I want to leave that market alone  and let it function on its own The larger the amount of floating supply, the more likely it is to be  a liquid market So I am opposed to dealing in these bonds at all   I want to go back to the issue of the volatility of the federal funds rate,  which has been mixed in with the discussion of indexed bonds First of all, I don't quite  understand the concern over volatility There are simple ways of reducing volatility if we really  want to do so For example, we could post very narrow buying and selling rates, perhaps 1/16  percentage point on either side of the target rate It also would be perfectly feasible to eliminate  volatility completely, although there may be very good reasons for not doing it Second, the  Desk used to intervene more frequently during the day, but it has ceased doing that, probably for  good reason More importantly, however, I just don't think that the volatility of the federal funds  rate should be of much concern to us Peter does a good job with the situation he has, and we  should just accept that some volatility is inherent in the way we choose to operate   Mr Chairman, could we also get information from foreign central  banks? After all, the UK has been involved in this a good bit longer than we have And we may  get some useful information from experience abroad   May I ask a question about that?   I do not understand to what extent the extension of the repo maturities  is solving a problem for the dealers rather than solving a problem for us I think our  responsibility is to solve our own problems rather than the dealers' problems   We should not be taking any responsibility for the term structure, and  that is the advantage of focusing our operations on the very short end I would not like to see us  possibly affect--or be viewed as affecting--the term structure even in just this maturity segment    11/17/98   I want to go back to the monetary aggregates My friend from Texas  referred to the currency component of the aggregates, although I thought Texans always  concentrated on bigger things than currency Let's talk about savings deposits for a minute,  which are three times the size of currency When we look at the detail on the aggregates, the    11/17/98  really rapidly growing areas are savings deposits and money market funds We know that banks  are filling some of the gaps in the credit market arising from the partial seizing up of the  securities markets Large denomination time deposits, which banks often use for funding their  credit growth, are shown as essentially flat in the table, but banks are meeting their funding  needs from money market sources as well Banks are funding themselves very comfortably with  very rapid growth of liquid deposits, probably mostly from households Savings deposits are  mostly from households because it does not make sense for businesses to hold such deposits  The money market mutual funds also are growing very rapidly So, it looks to me that there is  extremely rapid growth in the liquidity position of households, and it is not tapering off with the  recovery of the equity markets I could understand the story that households were apparently  taking funds out of the equity markets when those markets were weak and parking them  temporarily in money market funds, or somewhere But there is always the question about the  people on the other side of the equity markets because for every dollar that comes out of the  stock market, somebody else puts money into the market It is just the prices that change What  insight can you offer as to what to make of this, Dave? It has been a phenomenon just since  August, but my interpretation is that there clearly have been very rapid increases in liquidity in  the household sector   But we do have to be careful about the magnitudes Money market  funds have decelerated in October to an annual rate of 315 percent   Yes, I understand   I didn't realize I was going to be that close to the top of the list!  [Laughter] Let me talk a bit about the Eighth District first I think our situation is largely a  microcosm of the national picture I would like to comment particularly on a new source of  information that I am in the process of developing  I have this information under a pledge of our  confidentiality    11/17/98  With regard to national economic conditions, I would note that although the forecast  for the fourth quarter in this Greenbook is down from that in the last Greenbook, the third quarter  came in higher than was expected and therefore the second half of 1998 now looks somewhat  stronger than at the last meeting It's just by a few tenths, but generally the picture is for a little  more strength than we had been expecting My sense is that output has overshot full  employment and that the labor market has been pushed temporarily beyond its long-run  sustainable capacity If that view is correct, we are going to see growth in the near term below  the long-term trend for a while as the economy returns to its sustainable path That is my sense  from all the information that we have about the labor market and the pressures that we've seen,  particularly all the unfilled jobs and the difficulty in finding people to fill certain job positions    11/17/98  So, the question for me is whether this below-trend growth, let's say over the next year or so, is  going to occur with or without rising inflation  I think the financial turmoil around the globe has passed its peak My reading of Asia  is that we're seeing some progress, with the very important exception of Japan Prices in many  of the Asian equity markets are a little higher, exchange rates are a little stronger, the bond  spreads are a little narrower, and conditions generally seem to be getting a little better there  I don't know where the appropriate place is to bring up this matter today, but included  in my FOMC packet that was delivered to the hotel last night was a letter from the National  Association of Manufacturers (NAM) urging this Committee, urging me in particular, to lower  interest rates I hope that in the future the staff will not include such letters that come from  outside sources in my FOMC packet If word gets around about this, my briefcase will not be  big enough to carry home all the mail I might receive I am happy to respond to the NAM folks  if they write to me in St Louis, but I don't think it is appropriate for their letters to come here  Thank you   Mr Chairman, I will support your recommendation, but with  considerable reluctance I think this is another example where immediate disclosure of our  decision on symmetry would be very useful to us in terms of providing a signal to the markets I  fear that the markets will interpret this adjustment as another in a string of easing actions yet to  come I would hope that along the way in coming weeks, when the time seems appropriate and  the market tone seems acceptable, you could indicate to the market that it looks as if our easing  is finished for the time being, whatever is the right way to do that I think this is a case where  disclosure would help the Committee  I am concerned that we are pouring gasoline rather than water onto this economy The  fact that the growth of money is unexplained is not a great comfort to me It would help if we  could explain what is going on by pointing to some statistical anomalies, to some institutional  changes, to money going abroad, or to whatever, but the fact is we cannot come up with any  good explanation I fear we may be pouring a great deal of liquidity into an economy that is  bound to be slowing anyway for the reasons that I talked about earlier The economy currently is    11/17/98  fully employed, its growth rate needs to be a little slower, and therefore I am not at all concerned  about the forecast of slower growth If it comes true, that is going to be very good news   Is this the appropriate time to bring up the issue of indexed bonds that  we talked about last time?   I happened to be on the morning call when the Desk first bought  indexed bonds, and there was a very large reaction in the marketplace It seems to me that this  experience raises the question that I brought up before, about whether we should be buying    12/22/98 8  indexed bonds for the FOMC portfolio I am still opposed to it In my view it produced a  substantial change in the yields when we went in that day I think our operations in this market  are going to muddy the interpretation of the information we can get from the market   On the first day--not just the first hour, but the first day--the longest  indexed bond, which I believe is the one that we purchased, was up 16/32 The neighboring  bonds were down 12/32, 14/32, 19/32, and 20/32 In the general market that particular day the  non-indexed conventional bonds also were dropping in price As I understand the process, when  the Desk is going to buy securities in the secondary market for the System portfolio, it asks for  propositions from the market And it is your standard practice to look for the propositions that  are attractively priced from our perspective, and that means the ones that are a little out of line on  the general yield curve Would that be a correct interpretation of what you do?    12/22/98   Okay I can understand picking up some that are trading at a peculiar  price relative to the adjacent issues, but you can't make that decision on the indexed bond  without taking a view as to what the relationship between the indexed bond and the conventional  bond would be   Mr Chairman, I will only note that I am not convinced by the  argument   That is certainly a reasonable proposition Thank you   Yes, I also support the proposal    12/22/98 87   Mr Chairman, local conditions in the Eighth District are largely  unchanged    12/22/98  I would note  that comments from these sources are confidential, of course  There is no question that the agricultural regions in our District are hurting Many of  the farmers have taken substantial losses At this point their credit is not really impaired,  although some may have problems obtaining credit for the next planting season As a  consequence of the weakness in the agricultural regions, there is a very pronounced slowing in  the agricultural machinery sector Sales of farm equipment are down substantially, and I think  we see that in our national statistics Homebuilding, without question, is strong except in the  agricultural areas We had a report from southern Indiana that homebuilders are on allocation for  bricks, believe it or not A contact in Kentucky reports that builders have a two-year backlog I    12/22/98 27  think that situation is generally quite typical in the urban areas The labor market is very strong  in most areas, again except in the agricultural regions  On the national outlook, the staff forecast looks about right to me However, I believe  that our inflation risks are clearly on the upside rather than the downside I continue to be  concerned about the high rate of money growth I wonder whether the staff outlook on  investment is not giving enough weight to the very tight labor markets, which provide an  incentive for firms to invest to substitute capital for labor I think our traditional accelerator  models may be missing the connection between the labor markets and business investment That  is all I have for now   I, too, support an unchanged federal funds rate But I want to talk  about looking further out into the future than just the current situation Mr Chairman, you  emphasized what I regard as indeed the key feature of our economic environment, the lack of  any pricing power I think that comes from what are now, fortunately, very, very deeply  embedded views about price stability or continuing low inflation Back in the 1970s when firms  would raise prices, other firms would use that as a good excuse to raise their prices also Now    12/22/98 63  when firms raise prices, other firms do not follow, and the original price increase gets rolled  back And understanding that process, firms don't try it in the first place So we have a very  deeply embedded environment of low inflation I view that as a great strength in our situation  But I ask myself this question What would we expect to observe from a dose of  monetary stimulus in an environment with entrenched expectations of low inflation? In other  words, the stimulus is not going to flow through, at least in the near term, to goods prices but it is  going to flow through to something else What I would expect to see is that it would flow  through to some combination of asset prices and output if it cannot flow through to goods prices  I would note that M2 growth at roughly 9 percent is high but not explosive We are  not dealing with an explosive situation in money growth, but it is high So, it seems to me that  what we have observed is fairly consistent with the picture that I am drawing, that the dose of  money growth has been flowing through to higher-than-expected output We certainly see it in  consumption; we see it in investment The economy as a whole is operating at a high level We  have seen it flow through to many asset prices, though not all This is consistent with the stock  market story I'm talking now not about recent weeks, but in a perspective of about the last 12 to  18 months and what has been going on with the high money growth Certainly the picture with  bond prices is consistent Interest rates have gone down a lot; bond prices have gone up in the  last 18 months We have talked about house prices and real estate prices more generally Here  again, the rate of increase is not explosive, but there is no question that it is a change from what  we had earlier in the 1990s Some of this I think is a consistent story that money creation has  been showing up in house prices and apparently even in agricultural land prices Despite the  weakness in current farm goods prices, agricultural land prices are not plummeting    12/22/98  There are important exceptions to this hypothesis that I am offering Until the last few  months, the dollar has tended to be strong rather than weak We have not seen increases in  prices of foreign assets relative to the dollar Certainly oil and other commodity prices have  gone down sharply Oil is an important asset that can be held in the ground; it does not have to  be produced But I am persuaded that the money growth that we have seen is showing up more  or less as we would expect in the economy and that it explains a great deal of what we see in the  current situation  Ned Gramlich earlier talked about the difficulties of explaining the money growth that  we've seen I would like to present an analogy here Suppose we saw a jump, let's say, in the  ECI If we could explain that jump as a consequence of some anomalies in the data or faulty  seasonal adjustment or something like that, we might feel comfortable with the jump But if we  could not explain that jump, I think all of us around this table would assume that, lo and behold,  we were finally starting to see the results of the labor market pressures in that number So, the  fact that we cannot explain in detail where this money growth is coming from or where it is  showing up is not a source of comfort to me but a source of concern  If it were not for the fact that a tightening today would be a very large shock to the  market, given our recent easing moves, I think there would be a case for tightening now because  we are working through the credit market disturbance The bond market is functioning normally  again; the number of new issues is back more or less where it was But I do believe that it is  very important that monetary policy be consistent and predictable over time Therefore, I would  not favor a move today because it would be regarded as very, very peculiar in the light of what  we have done recently and in the light of the expectations that we have established   Mr Chairman, I would go for option 3 I would take out "in coming  months" because I view this as the operating directive that applies until the next meeting I  believe that a sense of the longer-run perspective of the Committee can be and is given in the  minutes that are released at the same time as the directive I feel strongly that the last sentence  referring to M2 and M3 should come out because I believe that in the interest of accuracy it  should reflect what the role of money is in the Committee's deliberations I also believe that it  could serve as a useful policy device at some point If and when money is regarded as being  more important in our deliberations, it can be put back in; and markets are going to notice if we  put it back in If there is a change in our view on this matter, then it seems to me we would want  a way to convey that And putting it back in would be a clear way to convey it   I would take it out now because in the interest of accuracy it does not  belong there   I don’t have any objection to the proposed program, but I might   understand it better if the following were explained What difference would we see in   the marketplace if we did no lending at all versus lending as outlined under this   proposal?  Tell me what I would look for with and without the lending    I have a quick question of fact on financing conditions in the US   corporate bond market I should know the answer, but I don’t Roughly speaking, what     2/2-3/99 41   fraction of the new issues is at the lower-rated end and what fraction is at the higher-rated   end?  Your chart emphasizes the corporate junk bond rate, and that is up substantially   How important is that quantitatively? I’m just asking for a ballpark figure on that    So the percentage breakdown is roughly 60/40    Do we deserve it?    Mr Chairman, in the Eighth District the story is primarily an echo   of recent months The Eighth District was not much affected by the credit market   disturbances last fall and, therefore, we have not been much affected by the weakening of   those disturbances Rather than repeat the echo of what we have seen, I would just like to   make one comment It seems to me that more and more firms are learning to live   successfully with what they had regarded as labor shortages They still do not see the   pricing power needed to raise prices and, therefore, they are learning to get along with   what they previously regarded as a short-staff situation We just do not hear so much   about that any more, although when we ask people they tell us about all their unfilled   positions     2/2-3/99 64   On the national level, my contacts at UPS and FedEx say that they see steady   growth in the United States They see the situation in Europe as solid They see a   bottoming process in Asia and they see Latin America as weak, though they do not have   extensive business there   I would comment with regard to Brazil that the market response to the Brazilian   upset has seemed to me very sensible and measured The markets have made distinctions   that make good sense; that is completely unlike the response in August to the problems   faced in Russia I think the situation is entirely different   The staff forecast makes good sense to me We could all quibble with a tenth or   two here or there I think the staff has done a fine job of incorporating everything that is   reasonably forecastable What is going to get up and bite us at some point is something   that we cannot foresee, but I am not going to criticize the staff for not forecasting the   unforecastable That’s all I am going to say at this point    Chart 3 has a price stability simulation, which Chart 4 does not   have I have what I think is a simple question Roughly speaking, what would the   federal funds path be in Chart 4, assuming the NAIRU were lower but the same end   result--converging on ¾ percentage point less inflation per year than the baseline--is   desired? To get that in Chart 4, presumably we would have a federal funds rate   somewhere between the baseline and the dot-dash line Is that correct?    So Chart 4 is built under the assumption that we are satisfied to   converge more or less on the existing rate of inflation That addresses the question of     2/2-3/99 103   what we have to do if the NAIRU is lower, if we’re satisfied with where we are on the   inflation rate But for those who have an objective of a lower rate of inflation, we’d need   to add that to Chart 4 in our discussion of the implications for policy of Chart 4    At the beginning of this trajectory, where we are right now, even if   the NAIRU is as low as 4½ percent we need a higher funds rate to start to work the   inflation rate down or we are at risk of actually seeing the inflation rate rise That is what   the baseline tells us even at the current unemployment rate    Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation I would like to   talk a bit about what I regard as a very important issue, which Larry Meyer emphasized   yesterday And that is that we need to be talking not just about the setting of the federal   funds rate, but about the policy strategy from which the current rate setting arises   It is clear that the central fact occupying us is this ongoing surprise in the   relationship between real activity and the rate of inflation, which we call the Phillips   curve The Phillips curve framework has been around in its current form essentially since   the late 1960s We have worked with what we call the expectations-augmented Phillips   curve I believe there is far too much emphasis on the NAIRU and not enough emphasis   on the expectations part of the behavior in these markets To me the experience over the   last couple of years indicates that expectations trump the unemployment rate in   determining the current rate of inflation--that the expectation of continuing low inflation   is the factor dominating this outcome   Firms say over and over again that they don’t have pricing power, and that is   because their competitors won’t follow any price increases they have tried to put into   place Competitors behave that way because they think the inflation rate will remain low     2/2-3/99 115   and, therefore, if they can retain control over their costs, they are happy to grab more   market share So prices remain very much under control   I agree with you that emphasizing the exchange rate and oil prices as special   factors is not the way to look at those variables Those above all are expectational   variables Oil is a storable commodity Oil is behaving so well in good part because it is   expected that prices will remain low in the future Oil is not a good store of value any   more with the rate of inflation down The same is true of the exchange rate It has   behaved so well because of the sustained low rate of inflation in the United States   Now, that does not mean that the unemployment rate is not below what is   sustainable in the long run There are so many stories about the existence of labor market   pressures and shortages and so forth that we probably are operating below the NAIRU It   is just that the expectations part of it is dominating the outcome in terms of the current   rate of inflation   The ideal situation, if we knew how to do it, would be to peg the rate of inflation   at a very low level and go for price stability, letting the real economy run wherever it   wants to run What we would all like to see happen is to have the maximum possible   employment and productivity growth consistent with price stability The problem is that   there seems to be so much evidence that the real economy leads the cyclical process, with   inflation coming later So, to say that we can ignore the real economy in setting current   policy seems to me likely to be a mistake in the long run   Therefore, I come down to saying that we are going to have to pay attention to the   fact that the real economy is growing very vigorously and that the unemployment rate is   low We should not ignore the anecdotes about very tight labor markets Credit   conditions and monetary growth are both very clearly on the stimulative side The   financial turmoil that motivated this Committee last fall appears to be mostly behind us   Over the course of this year, starting sometime this spring, I think it is going to be   appropriate to be tightening up on the funds rate   I would like to come back to the original point that I was making about the   importance of expectations I think we need to do everything we can to seal in this   expectational environment That is what makes all this possible in my view That means   that if we get some bad news on the inflation rate, we need to be prepared to pounce in     2/2-3/99 116   order to demonstrate that we are not going to let that continue To show that we take   inflation very seriously is to me the most constructive thing we can do Whether or not   we want to act before we get some uptick in inflation is another matter But we are not   faced with that issue immediately at this meeting Thank you    I have a quick question regarding the on-the-run and off-the-run   Treasuries Could you remind me what the normal relationship has been over the last 20   years or so?    I just wanted to be sure that the less than 7 basis points you   were talking about is not the anomaly against the norm    The September 30 through January relationship is the anomaly    I have a labor market question We know that the labor market   in the aggregate has done very, very well We expected solid performance and it has   come in better than expected The participation rate has gone to postwar highs, I believe     3/30/99 15   At the same time, we know that manufacturing employment has been on the weak side;   that is related in good part to the problems in Asia My question is this Do we know   anything about the laid-off workers in manufacturing or perhaps even something about   physical capacity in manufacturing?  Have these workers been absorbed permanently or   on some sort of long-run basis elsewhere in the economy?  Or are a lot of people sitting   around unemployed so that the aggregate numbers reflect other people who have come   into the labor force?  What will happen when demand for manufacturing, because of   eventual Asian recovery, comes back? Will these resources come back into   manufacturing in the United States?  Or do we have steel capacity that is permanently   shut down and workers that have been dispersed to other industries?  Do you have any   feel for that?    Similar skills are involved    Mr Chairman, economic conditions in the Eighth District are   largely the same Some industries and some geographic regions are doing a little better   and some are doing a little worse, but the overall picture is certainly one of steady,   sustained growth without undue strains or problems   Two of my contacts, one at FedEx and one at UPS, both report steady growth   in their domestic business My contact at FedEx had some detailed comments about the   company’s international business He said that Fed Ex is seeing the first pickup in a year   in its international business--an increase of 18 percent in the latest quarter on a year-over-  year basis--led by strong shipments originating in Asia and going both to the United   States and to Europe That would suggest that exports are flowing out of Asia South   Asia had the best growth, Japan showed single-digit rates of increase, and growth in   Europe was slowing a bit but still fairly strong However, there was no growth   whatsoever in the traffic from the United States to Japan, and that would be consistent   with what we know from other sources   I was particularly interested in talking with contacts and   others about the labor market situation I heard from these people the same stories we   have been hearing about problems in recruiting entry-level employees and problems with   increased turnover I have been trying to make sense out of that situation I certainly do   not get the impression that the business leaders I am talking to believe this is anything   approaching a crisis situation They are learning to live with it Nevertheless, I have the   distinct impression that they regard the situation as inherently temporary; it’s not   something they want to see continue nor do they expect it to go on indefinitely They are   expecting some of the pressure to come off Of course, that is the same story we have     3/30/99 43   been hearing for eighteen months now, and the pressure has not come off But the strains    have not been so severe as to cause them to do anything very dramatic There continues    to be pressure around the edges in compensation that is not showing up in the wage    numbers is providing tuition scholarships because a lot    employees are part-time    and so forth So, is recruiting people in   a city with great labor market pressures, is by providing tuition assistance at   the local university   had an interesting comment on the labor situation He said   is able to extract--that’s my word, not his--a fair amount of what he called   “discretionary effort” from the labor force  By having its labor force work somewhat   longer hours of overtime and perhaps at a somewhat faster pace, the firm is able to handle   its problem of a shortage of entry-level employees He said that his firm was pressed to   the limit at the time of and could not have continued the pace for any great   length of time Fortunately, the and that took the pressure off   has fewer people in its training program than the firm would like--my   contact would feel comfortable with about double the number--he does not anticipate any   problem through the fall The fall, of course, is the peak season for   but it all depends on demand coming out more or less as anticipated   Let me add one comment on the policy front We have drifted a little into the   policy discussion and I don’t want to go any further in that direction at the moment But   I would like to suggest that some of the differences around the table may reflect different   views on what our inflation target really ought to be My own view is that our inflation   target ought to be in the neighborhood of 1 percent on the CPI Given the not completely   understood discrepancy between the CPI and the GDP chain index, perhaps I should say   1½ percent on the CPI My suspicion--though of course I would let everyone speak for   himself on this--is that some people around this table are more comfortable with allowing   the inflation rate target to be somewhat higher because they believe it is inappropriate to   try to push it down So, certainly, my policy views reflect in part my belief that we are     3/30/99 44   clearly on the high side of the appropriate inflation target I just throw this question out   as something we ought to be clear about To what extent do our policy differences reflect   differences in our views about the outlook and the risks, and to what extent do they   depend on differences in where we really want to go in the long run?    Mr Chairman, if I were a voting member I would, with respect,   dissent from your recommendation I want to explain why First of all, I believe the   appropriate inflation goal, properly measured, is zero in principle As I translate that into   price indexes, it gives me a CPI somewhere in the area of 1 or 1½ percent, given the   ambiguity of the reading that we are getting out of the chained price index So if we   stated the target as a CPI of 1½ percent, plus or minus 1 percentage point, it seems to me   that we are already at the upper end of that range and probably heading a little higher   Secondly, in the absence of the credit market disturbances last fall, most of which have   dissipated, I think it is very unlikely that we would have cut rates then So now that the   markets are mostly back to normal, I believe it is time to unwind those cuts and bring   monetary policy back on course Thirdly, I think the balance of the risks is on the upside   I would illustrate that point by comparing the following two options One option is to   raise rates now and have it turn out ex post not to have been necessary; the other option is   to hold rates steady now and have it turn out after the fact that we should have tightened   I would much rather deal with the former situation than the latter because I believe it   would be much easier to reverse a tightening than to have to catch up if it turns out that   we are behind   I absolutely agree with you that if we have a tilt in the directive, it ought to be   disclosed given the changed announcement policy If the information regarding the tilt     3/30/99 60   were released six weeks from now after our next FOMC meeting, the market would be   confused about what our new disclosure policy means So, if we are going to have a tilt,   we should disclose it And that, I think, is a good reason not to have a tilt   I also believe that at present we have as good an opportunity as we are ever   going to have to emphasize that our objective is low inflation and not an attempt to   control the rate of growth of GDP or the unemployment rate I say that because there is a   widespread expectation that the increase in oil prices will lead to an increase in the price   indexes in the months ahead Whether that means that we should act now or wait until   we actually see that in the price indexes is a matter for discussion I think it would be   better to act ahead of time before we see it in the indexes Thank you    I have a very quick comment My impression is that a lot of the   small institutions are not setting up lines with us because they are assuming that the   Home Loan Banks will provide the liquidity It is not obvious to me that the Home Loan   Banks know where they are going to get their liquidity So I would think that’s a critical   point to straighten out with the Home Loan Bank System We need to make sure that we   somehow either backstop that system or that they tell their banks in no uncertain terms   what those lines are going to be That will force the smaller banks to set up arrangements   with us    I agree with that That is why I think we might be able to get   them to be more explicit about how much they will be able to provide through their own   resources so that the banks will realize that they must backstop themselves with us In   my conversations with small banks, there is this presumption that it is all taken care of   and that their Home Loan Bank will take care of them I don’t think they have really   thought that through    I have a question about the outlook for investment, which is   driven importantly, as it should be, by acceleration considerations My sense is that   investment has been very strong both because of the labor market tightness and the need   to substitute capital for labor and because of the attractiveness of new technologies   designed to improve productivity When you look at capacity utilization, do you have a   sense of how much of the reported capacity is really genuine capacity, given the newer   technologies that are coming in?  I remember what happened in the early 1980s, for   example, when the steel industry was being hit hard There was a lot of steel capacity on   the books that, in fact, was never put back to work even though the economy revived I   would guess that we might have something similar going on now with the rapid growth   of these new technologies that are simply making some of the old capacity on the books   no longer relevant for capacity utilization considerations Do you have a sense of that?    There is a strong tendency on these forms for people to put in   about the same number they did last year, as we all know    The point is that it may be consistent over time, but you don’t   want it to be consistent over time if the underlying pace of technology has suddenly   changed dramatically A whole lot of new technology is coming in That’s not unlike the   change in the exchange rate in the early 1980s, which permanently put under water a   whole lot of US manufacturing capacity    Mr Chairman, conditions in the Eighth District are largely   unchanged The only significant development is the announcement, which I think   everybody is aware of, that Boeing will be laying off about 7,000 workers from a defense     5/18/99 36   plant But, of course, that business is going to go to some other defense plant; those   aircraft, though different models, will be built someplace else   My contacts at FedEx and UPS reported that conditions were largely   unchanged domestically but that the volume coming out of Asia was substantially   stronger They both made a point of emphasizing to me the pickup in Asian markets   And both said that Latin America remained weak while Europe was solid--neither strong   nor weak, but just solid   My FedEx contact reported that their labor situation is easing a little due to   aggressive recruiting, but the company is still short of labor The UPS representative said   that the labor market in Louisville is the tightest the company has ever seen One other   point about FedEx I thought was interesting Domestic volume for shipments of auto-  related parts has expanded substantially I guess Fed Ex does a lot of last minute delivery   of auto parts coming out of Mexico and from within the United States And that would   confirm the other evidence we have that the auto industry is operating at a fairly high   rate   As for the national outlook, I think that depends critically on our policy, so I   am going to delay my discussion of the outlook until I fold it into the policy discussion in   the next go-around Thank you    Mr Chairman, I believe that the reference to the tilt needs to be   announced this afternoon That is the correct thing to do I also associate myself with   those who believe that a modest firming should be put in place now   I’d like to talk briefly about the analysis that underlies my views on policy I   don’t think there is any question that financial conditions are accommodative as   measured by money growth, the ease of financing in markets, and the behavior of the   equity markets The issue is how fast the economy can grow, assuming there is an ample   amount of money We have talked a lot about productivity, but I think it is important to   keep in mind that one thing that economic theory tells us about productivity growth is   that it determines the gap between wage growth and price growth; it does not determine   the level of either one With the uncertainty about productivity growth, I believe we   ought to be splitting it about down the middle That is, if we have a favorable upward   surprise in productivity growth, we should let half of it go into wages and half of it come   out of prices rather than try to hold price inflation where it is and let it all show through   in faster wage growth There is an argument for taking some of it out of prices In any   event, there is no question that the outlook for productivity is subject to a great deal of   uncertainty going forward   There are lots of different ways of formulating this To make it very simple   and straightforward, if we look at this in terms of a Phillips curve issue, there is a lot of   concentration on growth or on the gap or whether the natural rate of the NAIRU has   changed In fact, I think the expectations component of the Phillips curve is at least as   important and that the best way to understand what has happened in the last couple of   years is to say that expectations have trumped the gap The reason that we have been   able to run an economy as well as it has unfolded is that there have been firm   expectations of continuing low inflation But expectations will not continue to trump the   gap forever The underlying realities of the pressure on resource markets will gradually   take hold; and once we lose the advantage on expectations, I believe it is going to be   painful and difficult to get it back   So, my policy recommendation stems to a large extent from the view that   allowing any substantial risk that price expectations will get away from us is a very great     5/18/99 65   risk to run In the staff’s inflation forecast--though we can always quibble over the point   estimates here because we all know what the standard errors are--I think the probability   of an outcome ½ point higher on the inflation rate is substantially higher than the   probability of ½ point lower on the inflation rate And given that assessment of the   probabilities, it seems to me that we need an appropriate policy bias to reflect that bias in   possible outcomes   If we do not tighten policy soon and if for whatever reason we are unlucky and   the rate of inflation rises, we will then face the real risk that expectations will start to turn   against us We will find ourselves playing catch-up And once the market comes to   believe that we are falling behind, our effort to catch up is going to be very painful for the   market and for us On the other hand, if we tighten and inflation remains low, I believe it   would be easy for us to reduce the funds rate later That is part of the analysis underlying   my view that to raise rates in present circumstances is in some sense a safety play   I anticipate a tightening trend Some people have expressed the hope that we   won’t have to move, but for those of us who believe that some tightening is going to be   required, I think we need to have some idea of how much that is going to be That to me   is important because once we are seen to be in motion it is possible that the markets will   move long-term interest rates higher than we might consider justified I think we are now   at about the outer time limit of being able to make a credible case that we are simply   undoing some of the policy easing from last fall  The more distant in time that becomes,   the less credible it will be to appeal to that as a way of providing some cap on market   expectations of where this tightening process might take us But if we have some bad   luck on some of the inflation numbers coming in over the next few months, I believe we   will find it difficult to manage under those circumstances And that is why I believe it   would be better to get ahead of the curve now    Yes    On the Y2K issue, I don’t think there is any potentially important   event since I have been an economist about which we have less professional basis for   speculating [Laughter] I really don’t It seems to me that the role for us here is to   ensure that the things we say try to minimize the impact of this event The kind of thing   we should say is that, based on everything we know about all the preparations that we   and everybody else have made, there is no reason for any rational consumer or any   rational business to do anything that is going to show up in the aggregate data    That is what I think we could offer as economists As for trying to   speculate about things on which we have no professional knowledge, I just don’t know   what to say about them    Mr Chairman, it’s obvious that everyone around the table is   “chafing at the bit” to discuss policy, and I’m going to do my part to behave in a   disciplined fashion here by just discussing the outlook   In the Eighth District the story is very simple; it’s the same old story We’re   seeing exactly the same kinds of things that we have been seeing for a good number of   months now I make a special point of trying to talk to my contacts about what seems to     6/29-30/99 49   be different, what seems to be on the radar screen that hasn’t been there My impression   is very clearly that firms are successfully managing their labor market pressures   For example, is very concerned about the labor market situation   for his company He says that its needed employees at the Louisville   hub He says that the company is having a hard time all around the country--except in   Philadelphia, Ed, by the way He says he’s having no problem in Philadelphia; I don’t   know why the situation there is different higher hiring referral   bonuses and retention bonuses So, clearly, that company is concerned On the other   hand, who was quite concerned about his labor situation earlier in the   spring, says that now his folks are able to find labor pretty readily though they are behind   on IT staffing What seems to be happening is that case-by-case firms are coming up   against the labor market pressures and they are able to manage the situation successfully   Of course, managing the situation in some cases means that they are paying more wages   or retention bonuses or something, so there’s perhaps some up-creep in wages involved,   although obviously it is not showing up in the national statistics   Another thing that has come on our radar screen is that our bank examiners are   expressing a little concern--I want to emphasize it’s a small degree of concern--about   loan administration in the banks Credit demands are strong enough and loan officers are   in tight enough demand that our examiners have the sense that some of the banks they   examine are simply not able to have disciplined loan administration So there may be a   bit of sloppiness in that area that could produce some problems later on No one is very   concerned about it, but I mention it because it was the first time I really had heard about   that from our examiners   We have the same situation in agriculture and so forth that has existed for some   time and has already been commented on by others, so I have nothing to add    Mr Chairman, I support the recommendation for a 25 basis point   increase in the federal funds rate I think the issue on symmetry is complicated by the   fact that the language in the directive refers explicitly to the intermeeting period The   sentiment around the table seems to be that we may or may not need an increase in the   intermeeting period or at the next meeting; I think that’s the way the markets are going to   interpret symmetry But the sentiment around the table is that, more likely than not, we   are going to need some increases later in the year, perhaps at the next meeting or   sometime later So I think the problem is that we are getting into a box with the precise   wording of that symmetry clause If it’s confined strictly to the intermeeting period and   if we can make that clear in what we say, then it seems to me that a symmetrical directive   is probably appropriate I don’t think we want to give a firm signal that we are rather   confident that we will need to increase rates before or at the next meeting My judgment,   in reading what people said around the table, is that we are not confident about that I   would very much defer to your desires in how you want to craft the directive language   and the associated wording of the press release     6/29-30/99 106   Getting away from the issue of the wording--which is a very important issue and   I’m not trying to belittle it at all--I certainly count myself among those who believe that   the Phillips curve is an unreliable policy guide What that means is that the predictive   content for the inflation rate--and I’ll emphasize the “predictive”--of the estimated   employment gap or GDP gap, however you want to put it, seems to be very low But   having said that, it is still true that we must somehow regulate the thrust of monetary   policy to keep it in line with the economy’s capacity to produce goods We can’t get   away from that underlying responsibility of trying to match the monetary thrust with the   economy’s capacity to produce   If it is true that output growth and employment provide little insight into the   inflation rate in the short run, this Phillips curve idea, then I also want to emphasize that   the converse is also true--that the inflation rate does not have predictive content for   employment and growth We believe the proposition that as a long-run matter the   inflation rate can settle wherever it might be more or less independently of the   unemployment rate But we can’t have it both ways We can’t believe, it seems to me,   that the Phillips curve works only in one direction or that it doesn’t work in one direction   If there’s no content in one direction, there’s no content in the other direction either That   leads me to emphasize that we should not believe that a monetary policy thrust designed   to yield, let’s say, a lower rate of inflation is going to have any predictable implication for   employment and growth   I have no doubt that a highly restrictive policy could tank the economy I think   we all believe that we can take the economy by surprise and we could produce a   significant downturn by making a mistake But I continue to believe that that’s not the   likely course of events I think the greater risk to employment is that inflation will drift   up and will drift up to the point where it will unsettle market expectations, and that will   put us in the box of saying we just can’t allow this to continue We will get ourselves off   on one side and market expectations will be destabilized So I believe that the greater   risk to employment stems precisely from a drifting up of inflation That is my reading on   that   I’d like to make a suggestion about the directive language It seems to me that in   the general paragraph of the directive--I’m referring to the version called the draft     6/29-30/99 107   directive which has a brown cover--we ought not to be implying in any way that we are   opposed to high employment and high growth So I would suggest that we move the   language on inflation, which is in lines 13 to 17, up to the front so that when we talk   about the state of the economy we put the inflation discussion first I’m looking at this   draft that was sent around to us with line numbers on it    The document begins with “the general paragraph,” which says   “The information reviewed at this meeting suggests a continued vigorous expansion in   economic activity” In other words, we start off by talking about economic activity   What I’m suggesting is that we start off by talking about the inflation environment The   wording can’t be moved exactly the way it is written there, but the language about   inflation is down in lines 13 to 17 I’d emphasize that our concern is with inflation rather   than have the very first thing in this directive be a commentary on the growth of the   economy I understand very well that there may be a problem changing the wording of   something like this on very short notice But I would like to throw out for consideration   anyway trying to change the thrust of this so it doesn’t look as though somehow we are   opposed to vigorous growth by starting right off the bat with that as an observation about   the economy    Absolutely In the press release for this meeting, if there is a press   release, we could put the emphasis on inflation and productivity growth and the   uncertainties about them ahead of the discussion of the real economy Anyway, I throw   that out just as a possibility   Let me say that I continue to believe that greater clarity in our inflation objective   would be constructive I talked about this a couple of meetings ago I’m not going to say     6/29-30/99 108   that there’s a convincing case that a CPI of 1½ percent for the year is going to yield a   better economic performance than a CPI of 2½ percent But I do believe that uncertainty   about that matter is worth in the end 100 basis points in long bonds, whether we settle at   1½ or 2½ percent I think most people would say that uncertainty that adds 100 basis   points to market interest rates is going to affect the way the economy works So I   continue to believe that more clarity about what our real objective is in that area would be   useful   In terms of the market discussion about our policy and the language used last   time, the disclosure of the asymmetry--the way I would like to put it in Wall Street   language--means that “the fed funds rate is now in play” There was a period in which it   was pretty stable and now it is in play The whole issue is up in the air and that’s going   to be true until things seem to settle down and the rate settles down   The ideal situation would be that both we and the market draw the same   conclusions from the incoming data about what actions are necessary to be consistent   with low inflation That is the sort of expectational equilibrium that we would most like   I believe the right way to handle this process is to be sure that the market is very clear   about our objectives and about our willingness to act to achieve those objectives As the   data arrive on both the real economy and the inflation rate and on productivity and   everything else we look at, we would hope that the market would come to the same   judgments as we would about how to interpret that data The hope is that we’re not just   looking at ourselves in the mirror when we try to assess market reactions to the data We   should try to give to the markets a sense that we’re all in this together in terms of trying   to make sense out of the incoming flow of data and that we don’t have an absolute   conviction by any means about where all of this is going to take us That is, we don’t   have a conviction about how much the federal funds rate is going to have to move or   even in which direction necessarily Given that we’re not very far off of the right place to   be, we think the rate is going to depend on how the data come in   I have a mild preference for an asymmetric directive, I suppose, because I think it   accurately describes the tenor of the Committee’s feelings about this But I think also   that we need to have some discussion that emphasizes to the market that asymmetry     6/29-30/99 109   should not be interpreted as a forecast of an automatic 25 basis point increase at the next   meeting independently of what happens    I can offer a little, but not much, insight into the Y2K inventory issue   My contact at UPS says that for its own planning purposes his company has been surveying   its top 300 shippers We are going to get more information on this survey before too long,   but at this point he could share with me that their shippers expect some acceleration of   shipments before the turn of the year when it is feasible to do so As a consequence, UPS is   going to have a smaller cutback in its capacity in that period than usual  Ordinarily, starting   pretty much on Christmas day, they cut back capacity by about They are going   to cut back by   and then make their   normal seasonal reductions That is all I have at this point on their survey results, but my   contact will provide me with more detailed information later    Mr Chairman, conditions in the Eighth District are as they have been   The environment is good, and I do not have any particular news to report I want to spend a   couple of minutes on the information I have gotten from FedEx and UPS, which is rather   interesting because it is a bit mixed in terms of the domestic economy   But first, both of my contacts report that their international business is doing fine,   better than anticipated FedEx says that it sees increasing growth abroad; volume from the   United States to foreign markets and from markets abroad into the United States is growing,   especially for Asia In fact, FedEx reports that the international business is 3 to 5 percent   stronger than had been anticipated in the months of June and July   On the domestic side, my FedEx contact thought that there was a clear sign of some   slowing in volume--not dramatic, but clearly perceptible FedEx reported that its own   business was slower year   over year for the first time in a long time   That was not, however, the view of my UPS contact He said that the economy was   booming and that UPS volume was exceeding projections, domestically and internationally   Through July, year-to-date volume was up 46 percent over the comparable months of last   year, versus an expected increase of 39 percent, so that is significantly above what they had   planned Growth was especially strong in domestic ground business My UPS contact had   just returned from meetings at   As I said, both UPS   and FedEx agreed that business with Asia was really picking up   My FedEx contact reported that there is no question that fuel prices are hurting He   said that FedEx has put a surcharge on West Coast less-than-truck-load traffic, and he   expects more surcharges to be put into effect if fuel prices remain high FedEx is not   concerned about wage pressures; my source said the company is making up wage increases     8/24/99 63   with productivity gains My UPS contact said that his company has continuing severe   problems in the labor market UPS has a lot of part-time employees who are college   students In trying to reduce employee turnover, which has become a significant problem-­  and this of course should remain confidential until UPS decides to announce it--UPS   expects to reopen its labor union contract   I   would also note that UPS has had to divert traffic out of Chicago--Mike Moskow talked   about the pressures in the Chicago labor market--since the company cannot handle the   volume in Chicago because of the labor shortage there So, those are a few anecdotes from   those two sources   One of our research department people put together some data on employment growth   that I thought was interesting In the last year employment growth among both males and   females in the 25 to 54 age bracket was 08 percent That is pretty much in line with the   demographics The employment growth has been coming entirely from what labor   economists call secondary workers, including a lot of older people Growth in employment   of workers 65 and over, male and female, was 4½ percent; among those aged 55 to 64,   people who should be working anyway but had opted for early retirement, it was 43   percent So it is clear that the employment expansion has been coming in these   demographic breakdowns that have relatively low participation rates  In principle, there is a   lot of room for expansion On the other hand, most people over 65 have retired for good   reasons, so presumably there has to be some limit to how many of those can be brought back   into the labor force   In the course of our budget work at the St Louis Fed, we were quite taken aback by   the increase in health care costs that we are facing I asked our HR people to do a survey of   all the other Federal Reserve Banks I thought that would be easy information to get Of   course, these are tentative guesses and some of the final contracts may be different, but let   me just read you those numbers In terms of health care costs, the Reserve Banks are   looking at the following increases Boston, 14 to 20 percent; New York, 6 to 11 percent;     8/24/99 64   Philadelphia, 9 percent; Cleveland, 10 percent; Richmond 7½ to 15 percent; Atlanta, 10 to   20 percent; Chicago 13 to 15 percent; at our own Bank in St Louis, 14 to 15 percent;   Minneapolis, 15 percent; Kansas City, 7 to 8 percent; and Dallas, 8 to 10 percent San   Francisco had a very accurate forecast of somewhere between 24 and 238 percent!   [Laughter] I don’t know what the average there is going to be* I found this rather   interesting because I wondered to what extent our experience in the St Louis area was   peculiar But, in fact, this is a very, very general phenomenon and these costs are clearly up   quite a bit from what we’ve seen in recent years  I think we can regard that part of labor   costs as pretty much baked in the cake So we can anticipate that those costs will be   showing up in the ECI as those contracts are actually signed and take effect next year   In terms of the prospects ahead of us, the Greenbook forecast, of course, is for   somewhat lower real growth and somewhat higher inflation I think we have to be ready to   deal with the prospect that growth will turn out to be a little lower and inflation a little   higher than forecast; in my view that outcome has a much higher probability than the   reverse And that will be an uncomfortable situation It means that the financial markets are   going to be whipsawed One day they are going to get data showing lower growth and they   will say, “Oh, the Fed is going to ease” The next day they are going to get data that suggest   the inflation problem is worse than anticipated and they will expect the Fed to tighten We   are going to have a tricky problem of setting a steady course That is all I am going to say at   this point Thank you    Mr Chairman, I support the recommendation for a 25 basis point   increase The market expects it and not to move at this point would confuse the market As   for Y2K issues, I think our position ought to be that as we approach the close of the year we   won’t hesitate to change our policy if necessary After all, we have said again and again that   we are ready for Y2K and the banking system is ready So there is something peculiar about   saying that the Y2K issue has to be an absolutely controlling consideration In my view if   we have good reason to move, we should move Y2K should be one of the considerations   involved in any decision, and it might tilt us in the direction of not moving But I do not   think we should foreclose moving if there is a compelling case to move Obviously, we   might see strains in the market that are greater than those that we now think are likely, in   which case that would elevate the importance of Y2K considerations   My view is that over the last two years, until the beginning of this year, financial   conditions were quite accommodative and perhaps even expansionary But that situation   has changed  Rates are up Money growth is slower this year I think we will be not very   far from where we ought to be with the increase in the fed funds rate today If we are   starting out after today pretty close to where we ought to be, I think we have to make clear   to the markets that our future policy moves are going to be driven by what we see   happening And if we end up with more inflation than we currently anticipate, we have to   be ready to respond to that That seems very important to me; we shouldn’t try to preordain   or give any very firm view about our policy direction in coming months   My preference is very strongly for a symmetrical directive I firmly believe that the   market is quite unclear about what the symmetry/asymmetry clause means; we need to   defuse the speculation about that and try to get the market to pay less attention to it I think   we ourselves around this table are unclear about what that clause means It is awkward for   us as we talk to people around our Districts and to the press to have to stumble and mumble   about what this clause that we voted on means In my view, the best way to defuse this is   for us to adopt a symmetrical directive for the foreseeable future until we ourselves are clear   about what we mean by that clause Thank you    I’d like to pursue a bit more the question that Bob McTeer raised about the   role of the current account We certainly do hear discussion about the exchange value of the dollar   moving in the direction of becoming weaker, given that the US current account is in such a   substantial deficit Let me focus on Japan and give you a back of the envelope calculation, which I   am sure you can correct, to convey the nature of my thinking on this Japan, of course, has a large   current account surplus But my instinct is that to a large extent that reflects the fact that the   economy has been so weak and, therefore, import demand is weaker than it otherwise would be   Let’s suppose--and this is the back of the envelope calculation that you can fix--that Japan   is operating at 10 percent below potential in terms of output, and suppose its propensity to import is   015 If Japan were operating at full capacity, imports would be 1½ percent of GDP higher and its   current account surplus would be a whole lot lower And the case for the yen to appreciate would   be weaker because the current account surplus would suddenly look quite different if Japan were   importing a whole lot more Obviously, this analysis applies to the United States as well In part,   the deficit in our current account reflects the fact that exports have been weaker than anticipated   because so many economies around the world have not being doing very well So, although it is   true that revival abroad will raise interest rates abroad and its effect on the capital account will tend   to weaken the dollar, it is also true that the demand for US goods will rise quite substantially Can   you give any sense, just in the context of the Japanese example because that is where the focus of     10/5/99 14   attention is right now, how much of the Japanese surplus is a consequence of the fact that their   economy has been going nowhere for a decade?    Not for want of trying    I understand that    Mr Chairman, as I travel around the Eighth District I try to press people on   what’s new or what’s different There’s usually a silence and then somebody will talk about the   pressures in the labor market Of course, that’s not really new So what I’m hearing is just a   broken record When I press people about the labor market, they say it’s awfully hard to find   workers, but they are finding them At the end of the day they’re hiring people, though they have   to struggle to do so They get people who apply for receptionist jobs who have body piercing in   any number of places [Laughter] They wonder how these people have the nerve to walk in, but   they do Apparently the employers end up coaching them or whatever and put them in those   positions So, those are the kinds of stories we hear Essentially there is nothing new except a few   amusing anecdotes along the way   My contacts at UPS and FedEx confirm the strong recovery in US exports, particularly to   Asia They emphasize especially that the resurgence in activity in Korea and Japan is very clear   though Malaysia and the Philippines still have problems They say that they just can’t get enough   capacity out of Hong Kong--that the market is very strong there Exports to Latin America are   fairly flat; I get the impression from my contacts that nothing much is going on there In terms of   export volume, UPS at the beginning of this year was anticipating an increase of   At this point UPS is projecting volume in the year   2000 to be over this year So, UPS is anticipating in US exports   to those markets   I continue to hear stories about the difficulties of keeping staff levels up but, again, UPS   and FedEx are finding ways to do it On the Y2K issue, UPS is expecting some surge in both US   exports and imports--some shift of shipments that would have occurred in January into December     10/5/99 34   for precautionary purposes I think all of the things we’re hearing along those lines make sense   The FedEx picture is very much the same, so I won’t say anything specific about that   On the national picture, I think we can reasonably forecast that we will have an upward   creep in pressures on inflation and an upward creep in the possibilities for productivity growth It   is somewhat of a race as to where those two will come out I must say that I would be a lot happier   if money growth were coming down during this period of rising interest rates Obviously, with   rising interest rates, we’d generally say that, other things equal, there would be less money   demanded Yet money supply growth is continuing above the growth of nominal spending, or at   least what is a reasonable track for nominal spending So I am certainly concerned about that   On the inflation outlook, besides the “creeping” part, whether it does creep up really   depends critically on expectations And as long as expectations remain very, very solid, as they   are, I think we’re not going to be faced with any sudden outbreak On the other hand, we play the   critical role in keeping those expectations where they are Thank you    Mr Chairman, I support “B” asymmetric I want to talk about the disclosure   issue in a minute, but let me first say that I think “B” is the right place to be Even though we have   all these uncertainties about both productivity growth and labor force participation, there is always   the possibility that with very favorable surprises we would end up with lower inflation than the   point forecast And I don’t think that’s a bad outcome, given that I still believe we have a positive,   though very small, rate of inflation in the economy in a trend sense     10/5/99 59   The way I want to look at this situation is to recognize that a lot of the stabilization work is   being done by the market and eventually, I’ll say, “ratified” by the Fed--but granting that the Fed   has established the basis for such a stable environment So we want our communication with the   market to be such that as data arrive the market moves interest rates in the right direction It seems   to me that if we do not publish some notion of asymmetry at this point, we may well be indicating   to the market that we think our policy adjustments are completed I think that’s the way the market   would read it Therefore, upward surprises or very strong data, which are what we expect to see   coming down the pike, might not move interest rates in the way that would be constructive over the   longer run So I believe we do want to indicate that we are asymmetric, whatever language we use,   so that we will get the right market responses as the data come in If the data come in on the low   side or are very benign, then we would get the response that we need out of that, too   In terms of what to publish, part of the issue--maybe a good part of it--stems from our   statement that we would publish symmetry or the lack thereof from time to time when we felt it   was particularly important So I think some of the market overreaction, as we read it, has come   about because the market believes we’re really trying to tell it something In my view, the best way   out of this is to indicate to the market that we expect to have a statement after every meeting,   although in practice many of those statements might be very routine boilerplate that doesn’t really   say anything But we could try to take some of the special ring out of a statement by saying that we   now intend to issue statements routinely after every meeting That to me is what I would call the   least unsatisfactory way of getting out of the situation we find ourselves in at this point Thank   you    Mr Chairman, it seems to me that the most low-key way of doing this would   simply be to take the first paragraph plus the last paragraph of the draft press release without the   first three words That would be a simple statement about what was done--period    Just continuing this line of conversation If a lot of funds go into the   market because of the exercise of the options, it drives the funds rate down, as you said But   then I assume that reduces the probability of any further options being exercised later on So in a   sense it is a one-time hit    To make sure that my understanding is correct, I had a question about   currency My understanding is that currency outside the banking system is growing at a very   normal rate We do not see any particular increase in the hand-to-hand circulation as yet Is that   your sense?    Currency in circulation includes the currency in bank vaults?    But not much more    As it has been earlier?     11/16/99 8    Mr Chairman, I think I would delete the second paragraph altogether   [Laughter] To be frank, it doesn’t seem to me to add very much Often it’s better to say less   rather than more unless we’re convinced that what we’re saying is constructive and will produce   the result that we want I also share Governor Meyer’s concern about a possibly misleading   reaction in the marketplace from some of the language in the third paragraph    I agree with Larry I think the focal point of the decisionmaking is the   interest rate decision, the federal funds rate decision There will be many different views at any   one time about why we converge on that particular decision, and trying to explain the different   nuances is not going to be helpful However this comes out, it should never be viewed as a   prediction or forecast of what’s going to happen at the next meeting The fact that it has had and   may continue to have low predictive value seems to me irrelevant If it had high predictive   value, that could mean we should have acted right away We shouldn’t want a high predictive   value I regard our aim as trying to give a sense of direction I think it really is going to be   easiest for us to reach a consensus on that if we focus entirely on a sense of direction with   respect to the policy instrument, the federal funds rate    Mr Chairman, I can summarize the information from our contacts in   the Eighth District in four points First, housing activity is definitely a bit slower, but not a   whole lot Second, labor market pressures continue, but despite isolated areas of sizable wage   gains there is no generalized break-out from the recent experience of modest wage increases     11/16/99 34   Third, product pricing remains under good control overall Fourth, everyone is tired of talking   about Y2K Nobody has anything to say there; nothing in fact seems to be happening   My FedEx and UPS contacts both reported recent increases in volume Measuring on   a year-over-year basis, the August-September months are stronger than the earlier months So,   they see things accelerating And UPS, anyway, is revising up its volume projections for next   year Both UPS and FedEx confirm the Greenbook view that Asia and Europe are strong Latin   America is relatively flat; not much is going on there Firms continue to cope satisfactorily with   the labor market pressures UPS relies a great deal on college students as part-time labor The   firm has increased the rewards, and my impression is that students are coming out of the   woodwork to throw packages   Changing gears to a different topic, I want to emphasize my view that the asymmetry   announced at the last meeting did exactly what I certainly had hoped it would do In response to   the strong incoming data, market rates moved up Then as the data came in benign later in the   intermeeting period, rates moved back down So I think the asymmetry did precisely what we,   or at least I, expected it to do That’s all I want to say at this point    Mr Chairman, I support the recommendation I’d like to offer two   observations First, in terms of low inflation expectations and the lack of pricing power, that’s   because the market trusts us to contain inflation And, therefore, we can’t use those low inflation   expectations as a good signal about when it might be time to move If we start to lose that trust,   then we have gotten behind But we haven’t lost it and we’re not behind Secondly, if the data   come in perfectly benign, right down the center of the point forecasts, it doesn’t really matter   whether we move today or not It seems to me that what’s important here is that we’ve   positioned ourselves should we get data on the high side, with greater strength in activity and   inflationary pressures If we don’t move now, then the market could well say we’re frozen until   the end of January That would risk our getting behind There’s plenty of room for rates to go   down should the data come in on the soft side    I think I have enough copies to go around if you’ll keep passing them   on I wanted to put my thoughts down on paper because that allows me to state things more   concisely The Working Group’s proposal on the balance-of-risks language, what I am   calling Option 1, has been slightly modified since we last discussed it But my major   concern has to do with the last part of it involving a statement by the Committee on its   views about future economic conditions, and that is what I want to focus on Let me go   through my points   First, I think it is going to be much easier for us to agree on a possible policy action   than on a statement concerning possible future economic conditions Second, I believe that   the Option 1 language has an implicit Phillips curve analytic framework behind it and in my   view not every member of the Committee will be comfortable with that framework Third, I   think that many in the market will view the Option 1 language as essentially a code for the   existing tilt language--that, in fact, it will be read as a Committee view about future policy   And it is important for us not to allow perceptions to develop that we’re talking in code   Another issue, my point four, is why we would be talking about economic conditions rather   than future policy action  If we are truly talking about economic conditions, why do we take   a Committee vote on the matter--a statement about our forecast, if you will So, I think the   markets will tend to view our language about economic conditions as really code for future   policy   Furthermore, I am concerned about the way in which the general public may   interpret this language I think we are inviting headlines that say “Fed sees economic   weakness ahead” if we vote on a directive that says we see possible economic weakness I   don’t think that is going to be helpful to us     12/21/99 61   I’m also concerned that the language in Option 1 has an analytical weakness If we   are successful in being preemptive, then the changing economic conditions we see will lead   us to take a policy action and will not at the end of the day create either economic weakness   or inflation That’s the whole idea we’re trying to get across We see the possibility of   economic conditions that, if not offset by policy action, would generate economic weakness   or inflation We want to preempt the changes in the economy that we don’t want to occur   So, I think the language proposed in Option 2 is really more accurate The change in   economic conditions that we see developing is going to generate policy action and will not,   in fact, generate economic weakness or inflation   Lastly, I think the majority on the Working Group overreacted to the market’s   response to our announcement in May We had explicitly told the market that we would   disclose the tilt when the Committee wished “to communicate to the public a major shift in   its views about the balance of risks or the likely direction of future policy” So it is not   surprising to me that the market reacted when we first used that device because we said we   would announce the tilt when we had something major to say In fact, since May, I think   the market has understood that we were using this device on a much more routine basis   And in my view the responses since May when we have used an asymmetric directive have   been helpful and have not reflected an overreaction   So, those are my seven reasons for having a strong preference for what I’m calling   Option 2 I must say that I wish I had had this all straight in my mind 10 or 12 weeks ago   when I started to think about it, but my views have evolved as we’ve gone along My initial   view was one of a mild preference for what I’m calling Option 2 over Option 1 The more   I’ve thought about it, the more I have become concerned about the Option 1 approach    On wages, is there any way to sort out the forward-looking   expectations effects from the backward-looking effects of recent changes in the CPI, which I   think you were using as a part of your outlook for wages?    Mr Chairman, the comment that I hear around the Eighth District is   that there is absolutely nothing new That can’t be quite absolute, but it is very close After   all, we met only five weeks ago and not all that much happens ordinarily in five weeks In   summary, our labor market continues to be tight but not impossible, pricing power remains   limited for most firms, and there are small but noticeable effects in the housing industry   from the increase in interest rates     12/21/99 37   On the Y2K front notes that   Apparently   were planning to curtail operations on those two days had   planned not to operate on the 31st but had so many requests from customers that it will be   operating, though it will not My sense of it is that   are finding the capacity--that the industry has responded and there   is really nothing more to be said about it I’m guessing that at the end of the day we will   find virtually all of this Y2K effect lost in the rounding error and we are not going to see   much effect   On the national economy, I would make just one comment, namely that as far as I   can tell there is no significant restraint from any quarter Everything we’re looking at is   solid, strong I don’t see anything on the downside I still react negatively to the term   “drag” in terms of net exports That term continues to annoy me It seems to me that net   exports are about as much of a drag as a Styrofoam boat anchor [Laughter] Thank you   SPEAKER(?) A true sailor!    Mr Chairman, I agree with Al Broaddus that the Committee is clearly   anticipating, on the basis of what we know now, that we will make a policy move in   February, provided that in the interim no data come in that would disconfirm that   expectation That is what I think is the sense around the table And I believe that the   asymmetric directive draft provides a better sense of that view     I think being very explicit about the numbers involved would be a good   thing for us to do  Suppose we were to say that our long-term goal is 1 percent on the deflator   and that we now estimate 4 percent on real growth as potential, which adds up to 5 percent  That   would be all right with me  What I fear, however, is that without being explicit about the   inflation goal, people will read that 5 percent--given that prices have been creeping up a bit and   most of the pressures are on the up side--as indicating that we are going to accommodate   somewhat higher inflation  That is the message that we would be giving  That would be my fear   if we are not explicit          89    Well, as I said, if we are willing to be very explicit about what our   long-run inflation target is and what our estimate of potential growth is, then I think we can make   the argument  And I believe we should  I’ve said before that I think we should be much more   explicit about our inflation target  In my view, that would be constructive     Yes, because given what I’ll call our “revealed preference” in the way   we actually have been behaving, I think the market believes that we are perfectly satisfied with   an inflation rate somewhere in the neighborhood of where it is right now  And that’s a little   above what I would regard as zero inflation, properly measured, taking account of the biases in   the indices  My best guess is that something like 1-1/2 percent on the CPI and 1 percent on the   deflator, taking account of measurement biases, is a pretty good estimate of what zero inflation   really is  We are somewhat above that right now and I think the market believes that we are   quite happy to be somewhat above, as evidenced by our own revealed preference in terms of the   decisions we have made       Cathy, if I could just comment very quickly on that  It doesn’t change   nominal  What the NIPA revisions have done is to change the split between real output and   prices  So in that respect those revisions do not really bear on this issue      That’s right, but there was an offsetting change in the inflation number    Essentially it changed the split of the nominal     I want to go back to Chart 10  Karen, it looks as though you have an   assumed exogenous change in an endogenous variable  That’s something I have spent 30 years   trying to tell my students not to do!     I'm speechless!  [Laughter]      I guess the question is  What can one learn from such an experiment   when by its very nature, if it’s partial equilibrium, it involves a whole lot of things that don't add   up?  The model that you have is now internally inconsistent     St Louis isn't one of them!     Mr Chairman, I’ll be very brief  I don't have anything to report in the   St Louis District that adds to what we already have heard around the table  My contacts at   FedEx and UPS confirm very, very vigorous economies in Asia  Air cargo is at capacity coming   from Asia to the United States and both FedEx and UPs are talking about adding more capacity    In the United States, both firms find that the fourth quarter was better than they anticipated  A   survey of customers and potential new customers at FedEx indicates a more vigorous spring than   had been anticipated a short time ago  So the outlook in the immediate future is very strong    Both also report, though, that the labor situation is well under control  They see no problems   with either staffing or labor costs, no undue pressures there   On the national picture, I would simply like to emphasize my sense that it’s a lot easier   to imagine that inflation will be a half point higher than the staff forecast than a half point lower     Mr Chairman, I certainly also support your recommendation  We are   faced with very powerful, real forces that we want to allow to run to the extent that they can in   terms of increasing productivity, employment, and real income without upsetting the inflationary   apple cart  I would like to relate your comments this morning to our discussion yesterday about   the trade deficit  The trade deficit is also part of this real adjustment that is going on in the   economy and it is not fundamentally a nominal phenomenon  The trade deficit is financing the   capital flows that are coming to this country because the rate of return is so high  And it cannot   itself be an object of our policy because it is determined by these real forces that are so unusual,   certainly in the context of postwar US history and perhaps much further back than that    I think a move of 25 basis points and a statement that the balance of risks is toward   inflation is exactly the right way to go  The market is our friend  The market, after all, has   anticipated this move  We saw interest rates rise  This federal funds futures prediction has been   in the market for four weeks or more, and we should not do anything that leaves the market   wondering what we are up to  If we were to go with 50 basis points and a balanced risk          129  statement, the markets would most likely say that we have concluded that we are done  And that   is certainly not our conclusion  So we want to make the market do as much of this work as   possible, lead the way, and help us figure out what is the correct response to the incoming flow   of information  I absolutely agree that this is likely to mean a sequence of 25 basis point   increases at each meeting  It wouldn’t be correct to say in Dave Stockton's famous language “as   far as the eye can see” but, nevertheless, for quite some time  And by working cooperatively   with the market I think we will have the best chance of coming out of this without a big upset    So, I support your recommendation 100 percent     Mr Chairman, I certainly agree that we need a thorough, ongoing   study of these issues because they are much more than just technical issues  I also think that we   ought not to prejudge the outcome of that study  As much as we may be uncomfortable with   having impacts on the Treasury market in the meantime, I think the least risky alternative for us   is to continue to conduct open market operations in the style that we have historically  We are              - 20 -     not going to run out of Treasury debt between now and September or the end of this year, or   whenever we get this study completed  I would rather see us take the risk of having some effects   on that market that we would prefer not to have than to find ourselves slipping for technical   reasons into something that we do not fully understand     There is quite a bit left out there, yes     I have a short question for Karen--or what could be a short question    The discussion in the Greenbook seems to put primary weight on the current account as the   underlying factor in the forecast for the dollar  I would think that you would want to put a lot   more emphasis on the capital account and conditions affecting it  We are in a rising interest rate   environment  The economy remains very strong  My tendency would be to tilt the dollar   forecast in the other direction  That is, looking ahead over the next year or two, conditions in the   United States would suggest at least continued maintenance of the dollar at its current level or, if   anything, a stronger dollar  Could you respond to that?     I’m going to make some scattershot comments here to convey   particular points  In the Eighth District we have a clear sense of slowing employment growth,   but it seems to be the result of labor supply constraints  The largest states in the District by   population--Illinois, Indiana, and Missouri which, of course, are shared with other Districts--   enjoy unemployment rates that are at or below the national average and labor force participation   rates above the national average  So I don't think there is any question, as we hear from our   contacts, that the reason we are seeing less employment growth is a consequence of the supply   constraint  The people just aren't there to hire              - 67 -     My second comment is that a recent meeting of health care professionals reinforced   the fact that there is tremendous strain in the health care business  That is an area that is very   distressed, and the problems in that sector are going to continue for a long time   Let me make a few comments about the national situation  My FedEx and UPS   contacts both report continuing very strong conditions abroad, especially in Asia  UPS is   running at capacity  That company’s planes are full coming into the United States, and UPS is   accelerating its additions to air capacity UPS also reports continuing pressure on the available   supply of entry-level labor  The company relies a lot on college students and relatively low-  skilled workers to “throw boxes’’--the way I like to put it--and UPS managers are finding it more   difficult to fill those positions  UPS has added fuel surcharges, as we all know  When I asked   my contact whether he sees any resistance to those charges, he said “no”  Their customers all   understand that there have been big increases in fuel costs and are accepting those fuel charges   Let me make a comment about the stock market  I have not gone back and looked at   the data systematically, but I certainly have the impression that the negative correlation we are   seeing between broad indexes--the NASDAQ and S&P 500, for example--are really   unprecedented  That it is a very, very odd circumstance  Historically, broad indexes are very   highly correlated, and to have them moving in opposite directions is very unusual  I will offer a   speculation as to why  And I mean the word "speculation" because I don't think I understand   what is going on  What may be going on is a phenomenal commitment to investing in equities   somewhere, so that when people come to question one part of the equity market they shift into   some other part of it  Of course, on any given day there is no way that people can disinvest  All   that happens is that securities get repriced  The effort to move out of certain sectors just reprices   these securities as investors try to shift from one area to another  Historically, of course, we have              - 68 -     seen that process more between equities and bonds, let's say, rather than across sectors of the   equity markets  We haven’t gotten to that point yet  We haven’t seen generalized changes in   equity prices  There have been sector effects, but no generalized shift  Historically when we   start to see people questioning the equity market as a whole, of course, the effort to get out of   equities depresses their prices as people try, but in the aggregate unsuccessfully, to get into other   investments   I agree with Ned Gramlich  I don't know how far this tightening process is going to   go, but I have the sense that we are at a pretty early stage in this process  I also have the sense   that money growth, although it has slowed, has not slowed anywhere close to the extent I would   have expected, given the interest rate increases we’ve had  If one looks at some episodes of   substantial tightening in the past--and I would suggest looking at some charts depicting 1983-84,   1987-88, and 1994--interest rates rose a lot and money growth just plummeted  By the end of all   those periods I cited, money growth was down to zero or below on a 12-month basis  So I have a   sense that we are only a short way into this process  And the reason I want to emphasize that is   not that I know where rates are going to go or how far we are going to have to move, but because   I think we are going to see increasing strains and pressures in the markets as we pursue this   process  I believe the markets are going to be vulnerable to shocks that come from the outside    My leading candidate--and there are a zillion of them that might materialize--would be shocks   coming from Japan because I think the Japanese financial system is very stressed and in serious   difficulty  I don't think investors in Japanese securities have really awakened to how vulnerable   that situation is  Right now interest rates are only about where they were in 1997, and yet by   every measure the Japanese economy is substantially more stretched than it was at that time              - 69 -     I get questions from the press and we see speculation that the oil price increases are   going to serve to slow the economy  I think that is also a false hope  I view the situation as   almost entirely a relative price disturbance  The consumer spending that is suppressed by people   having to fill up the tanks on their big SUVs is, after all, income to oil producers  And those   producers are going to be spending it  That includes the foreign producers who may be spending   some of it in this country or elsewhere  In terms of any aggregate demand effect, as a first   approximation I think it’s simply a wash  Therefore, we ought not to look at oil prices as a   possible source of reduction in aggregate demand pressure  So, those are just some random   comments that strike me about our current situation     Mr Chairman, I support the recommendation  I think we need to leave   the view in the marketplace that this is the strategy--that we will have 25 basis point increases   until the data convince us that a further increase is no longer necessary     I want to reinforce something that Don Kohn said about the importance of the market   understanding what our strategy is  The market should know that our aim is to focus on what I              - 85 -     would like to call the medium-term inflation rate  We are trying to keep the rate of inflation on   average, over a two-year horizon or something like that, at a low and stable rate  All the other   measures that we talk about such as the unemployment rate, NAIRU, the stock market, or   anything else are all derivatives in that we’re trying to follow whatever information we can to   achieve that inflation objective  But the objective is always the inflation rate   I think the possibility of a 50 basis point increase has nothing to recommend it  Let   me put the point this way  Suppose we knew what the ultimate end was going to be in terms of   where interest rates were going to go  That would pin down where the 10-year bond rate was   going to be  And whether we put off the other 25 basis points by six weeks or not makes no   difference whatsoever to a 10-year bond rate or to a longer-term rate  But, of course, when we   say right away what our understanding is about the ultimate end of this process, well, of course,   that raises the problem  And if we were to do 50 basis points, we would raise all sorts of   questions about where we were going and what we were doing  It would be very hard for us   sitting around this table to predict what the response would be  On the one hand, some people   might look at that and say that we think our job is over for now--we are doing one more increase,   doubling up the amount this time, and we don't intend any more in the future  That would be one   possible interpretation  Others would say that we feel a great sense of urgency and we have to   move more aggressively to keep things under control  In my view 50 basis points would produce   a very unstable expectational environment, and we would have great difficulty in predicting what   the response would be in the market  I think it is very dangerous to take a policy action when we   have so little idea about what the response will be  So, I would be very, very opposed to   considering a 50 basis point increase unless we had sitting right in front of us some crisis              - 86 -     situation demanding response  But we don't  Everything is going along very much as   anticipated, with differences only nuances from what we expected last time     I have a question about the international accounts, the foreign dollar   claims  How do we get a sense of the magnitudes here?  I understand the uneasiness about   this  But what fraction of Dutch assets, for example, are now claims on the United States?  Or   how do these fractions compare with some of these models of optimal international portfolio   diversification?  I know they may give you some guidance of how far off we--      27     Mr Chairman, in the Eighth District the stories that I hear as I   wander around the District are very much the same as they have been for the last six months   or so  I do get a sense that two things are perhaps a little different  One is that I hear more   reports of what people are touting as a one-shot wage catch-up  In other words, employers are   not anticipating ongoing increases of a larger magnitude but are trying to catch up to the   market because they have a sense that they have fallen behind in one area or another  I also   believe that more frequent reviews of compensation are taking place  Firms that traditionally   in recent years might have reviewed compensation and made adjustments once a year are now   doing it more frequently, reviewing every six months, for example   My UPS and FedEx contacts suggest a significant--I don’t want to exaggerate--but   definite increase in the pressures they are seeing  They see greater pressures in the labor   market, greater pressures in US demand, and greater levels of activity abroad, and in all three   areas the pressures are above what they had anticipated        52  On the labor market side,                              said they are “struggling” in his words   and are going to be adding incentives to attract workers  They are short a substantial number   of workers, particularly at                                  They have missed some of their delivery times   because they don’t have enough manpower  He said                                                                                                     and he characterized the strains as clearly more intense than they were a   year ago                                  says that his company is increasing entry level pay by 7 to 10   percent plus paying retention bonuses  All                    operations are under very substantial   pressure                    lowered the minimum scores on its basic skills test for qualifying new   blue-collar workers  My contact also noted that his firm is expecting health care costs to be   up 7 to 8 percent this year and 10 to 11 percent next year  And he says that in talking to CFOs   around the country he has the sense that others expect much the same  This includes all the   contacts he talks with on a regular basis   In terms of demand pressures, my UPS contact says that domestic volume is   coming in much stronger than anticipated  In his words, UPS is experiencing “just   unbelievable domestic demand”  Activity abroad is clearly very strong and my contact says   that UPS now expects the volume in Europe in 2001 to equal the volume previously   anticipated for 2004  That is, UPS has pulled forward three years its growth forecast for   Europe  Carriers are absolutely maxed out at capacity on the Asia to US routes and the firm   is searching for more aircraft to expand capacity   Another interesting note from my UPS contact was that his firm and others in the   air transportation business are expecting severe problems this summer  That, of course, is the   peak period for travel and there are disruptions because of thunderstorms and so forth  But      53  the expectation is that there will be substantial strains on infrastructure in the air   transportation business in the United States   Let me make one comment on money growth, a topic that seems to have   disappeared from our discussions  I’ve looked at the data and I believe that money growth has   not declined by anywhere near the extent we have seen in other recent periods of monetary   tightening  I will use 12-month growth rates to illustrate my point  Looking back to early   1989, after a period of monetary tightening that started in 1987, 12-month M2 growth was   down to about 3 percent and MZM growth was at about -2 percent  By early 1995, M2   growth was below 1 percent and MZM growth was about -3 percent  Currently, M2 growth is   in the 5 to 6 percent range on a 12-month basis and MZM growth is 7 to 8 percent  I have the   very distinct sense that despite the increases in interest rates, we have just barely stayed ahead   of the demand pressures  There has been no real restriction of monetary policy taking place   except possibly around the edges of the housing industry  And, of course, that would be   consistent with the numbers we are seeing on output   There is no real restraint in place as   yet  Thank you     Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation  I'd also like to   speak to the issue that Tom Hoenig raised  I think we want to be careful not to confuse   gradualism and predictability  While the goal of predictability is extremely important, we   can't always make policy predictable  Sometimes we are going to have to surprise the market    But I think it is extremely helpful when we are able to have the markets very much on the   same wavelength as we are  An increase of 25 basis points, after all, has been in the market   for quite some time  The extra 25 basis points, if we in fact opt for 50 basis points today, has   only been in the market since the ECI release  So, all the most recent reports reflect a policy   assumption in the marketplace that includes the 25 basis points that we are putting in place      90  today, and then we are saying we should put in some more because the market believes that   additional restraint is necessary     News from this meeting will consist of three pieces  One piece is the funds rate,   and we are matching what the market expects, so it's not really news  The second is the   balance of risks language and, given what is in the fed funds futures market, I think we will be   matching what the market anticipates  The main news out of this meeting will be the   statement that accompanies our policy announcement  To my taste, it is going to be important   that our message somehow says that, given what we know today, we believe that rates are   going to have to continue to rise  I don't know how far that process is going to have to go,   whether it's more or less than what the Greenbook forecasts  And as Jerry Jordan rightly   emphasizes, it will be very important that we not go too far  But in terms of what we know   now, I don't think we want to give the impression that we see the end of this process  Some   people may read the 50 basis points, despite what is in the federal funds futures market, as   saying that we believe we are about at the end of our tightening  In my view, that would be a   mistake since I don't think that's what the evidence suggests today   I would also like to comment briefly on the vulnerability of the stock market  I   think we all know that the stock market is still very elevated by historical standards and that   the volatility in the market is really unprecedented  The NASDAQ has been more volatile this   year than in the entire history of the index  The market is shaky  It is not going to help us if   the market cracks  That would cause us a lot of trouble  I don't mean just political trouble; I   mean trouble in carrying forward a monetary policy that does what we need it to do  So, I   think having a policy that is well in line with what the market expects, while it certainly   provides no guarantee, runs much less of a risk than if we surprise the market in a major way      91    Mr Chairman, I was going to make a comment very similar to the one   that Al  Broaddus made  I think the discussion of monetary targets has been a highly imperfect   way of nevertheless getting at an important point on which we ought to have some agreement   around this table--namely, what the inflation target is that the Committee itself has in mind  I   believe there are divergent views around the table as to what the inflation target ought to be  I   would rather see our discussion focused on the inflation target itself  Whatever the attitude in   the Congress, we need to have some working assumption  At the present time we have different   working assumptions around the table as to where we would like to go, say, in the medium   term, or in what direction we would like to work  There are some people around the table who   would like the inflation rate to be lower than it has been and is likely to be  I would count   myself in that camp  I think there are others who are quite satisfied with the current rate or   would be willing to see it go somewhat higher before we come down very hard, in policy terms,           87  to try to do something about it  So, although highly imperfect, I think the discussion of the   monetary aggregates has had implicitly in the background a focus on the Committee's long-run   objectives for inflation, which I think it would be desirable to clarify     Mr Chairman, it would seem to me logical to take the third paragraph,   which refers to the signs of slowing as being tentative, and put that right after the first sentence           120  of the second paragraph, which refers to real activity, and move the comment about core   inflation down     Mr Chairman, on the same point, if I may?  Dave, let me ask the   question the way I interpret the Chairman’s query--or maybe I don’t have quite in mind what he           29  does  Suppose you set the NAIRU in the model simulation arbitrarily equal to the current   unemployment rate  That short-circuits all of the wage/price mechanisms that come from the   gap   Is there a mechanism in the model that under those circumstances will pin down the rate   of inflation or the price level or however you want to put it?  Or does the whole wage/price   mechanism in the model flow from a gap?     My instinct is that in a model that runs off the interest rate--there are   no monetary quantities pinned down by this model, the policy assumption runs off the federal   funds rate--the price level has got to be indeterminate  It just has to be, if you short-circuit the   price-setting process by setting the NAIRU always equal to the current unemployment rate  It           32  can't be pinned down by expectations because expectations have to be pinned down by   something that determines the price level     Which is usually the monetary authority  So, one really can't just run   a simulation on the funds rate and short-circuit the wage/price mechanism     Clearly this is a pretty complex discussion about the model’s   properties under different assumptions     All I'm saying, Mr Chairman, is that I think there is a different   possible conception of how these relationships work, which I don't have fully worked out in my   mind  I have a sketchy idea, and I don't think it all has to flow through this mechanism     No, I think there is another way of doing it  One way would be to pin   down expectations by an assumption about the response of monetary policy  But if you don't   pin that down because you are specifying monetary policy in terms of some--I'll just say   “arbitrary”--federal funds rate, then that doesn't solve out     Mr Chairman, my anecdotal information from the Eighth District   suggests that the situation is largely as it has been, except for some modest--and I emphasize   modest--slowing in the housing sector  I found the reports from my contacts at FedEx and UPS   interesting because both of them talked a lot with customers about their likely volume   requirements in the fall, which is of course the busiest season for both firms  In each case they   are expecting volume to continue very strong and, if anything, stronger than it has been  My   contact at UPS said he believes that particularly in December UPS is going to be pressing on   capacity  The company plans to work with the firms for which it ships goods in order to try to           60  move the shipping schedules up a bit, but UPS expects demand to be pretty vigorous  I heard   the same sort of message from FedEx  My contacts from both firms also mentioned the   pressures from rising fuel costs  FedEx has had a fuel surcharge in place for some time and sees   no effect on its volume from adding that surcharge  Of course, these reports from both firms are   confidential, but I was told that UPS is expecting to announce soon a fuel surcharge on its   package shipments, a fee it has not as yet had in place   Both firms emphasized the difficulty that they continue to have in finding entry-level   workers  Although that situation is not new, it continues and, if anything, has become a bit   more intense  My UPS contact gave me a really good sense of what this has meant at his firm    Most of the entry-level people, who sort packages in their hub locations, are part-time college   students  In fact in Louisville, as some of you may know, UPS has an arrangement with the   University of Louisville for classes to be held in the afternoon so the students can work in the   middle of the night for four hours unloading and loading planes  The straight wages for these   employees are probably in the neighborhood of                                                     on top of that for   signing bonuses, attendance bonuses--if they stay employed with UPS for six months or   whatever--and tuition reimbursement  So the wage costs that are not explicit--those not going   out in the paychecks--involve supplements that have now risen to                          which I think   is pretty amazing for people who are earning                                as the standard wage  And this   same contact in Louisville said                                                                                                                    to give you an idea of the labor force shortage that they are dealing with  I had a similar   kind of report from FedEx  My FedEx contact said that they also are having problems signing   up middle management employees  Finally, both firms expect their volume to continue to be   very strong, both in their international and US businesses           61  Let me go back to our discussion of the NAIRU and make a few comments    Obviously, in a macroeconomic model, everything is simultaneously determined  So I want to   start off by saying that I understand that  But I think there are two different conceptions of   NAIRU that more or less have the causation running in opposite directions  The traditional   NAIRU formulation views the wage/price process as running off a gap--a gap measured   somehow as the GDP gap or the labor market gap  And the direction of causation goes pretty   much from something that happens to change the gap that feeds through to alter the course of   wage and price changes  I think there is an alternative model that views this process from an   angle that is 180 degrees around  It says that in an earlier conception, either through a   determination of a monetary aggregate or through a federal funds rate policy, monetary policy   pins down the price level or the rate of inflation and, therefore, expectations of the rate of   inflation  Then the labor market settles, as it must, at some equilibrium rate of unemployment   Where the labor market settles is what Milton Friedman called the natural rate of   unemployment  But the causation goes fundamentally from monetary policy to price   determination and then back to the labor market rather than from the labor market forward into   the price determination  I certainly view the causation in that second sense  I think it is the   willingness of the Federal Reserve to stamp out signs of rising inflation that ultimately pins   down expectations of the price level and the inflation rate  Now, the labor market has been   clearing at a level that all of us have found surprising  But I don’t think that necessarily has any   particular implication for the rate of inflation, provided we make sure that we are willing to act   when necessary  As long as inflation expectations remain well under control and we are willing   to move, I think that pins down the rate of inflation in an adequate way  I understand that   everything is determined simultaneously, but I think there are two rather different directions of           62  causation that people have in mind  In the macroeconomic model used here, if we can count on   some way to arbitrarily pin down the expected rate of inflation, we can then solve the model   quite satisfactorily  Again, that’s an assumption that one puts in the model, but I think it flows   from the monetary policy that is being pursued  Thank you     Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation  The futures market   has built in another 1/4 point at our August meeting  I believe that is a reasonable bet at this   time, but I think the data over the coming weeks will decide that issue and the market will move   rates in the appropriate direction     I don’t understand why the US Treasury should be unhappy if the                   are willing to hold US Treasuries at 2 percent or some unusually low yield  It would   seem to me that if the market understands why this has come about, it won’t cause any trouble  It   would just benefit the US taxpayers     Mr Chairman, the reports around the Eighth District are broadly consistent   with those already noted for other parts of the country  I would summarize by saying that the   pressure is off but there is no sign that the economy is sinking     One comment on the labor market  My UPS contact indicated that his firm has had no   problem in obtaining professionals and that for the first time in several years the issue of entry-level   labor has been successfully addressed  I had reported earlier that obtaining the entry-level labor to   do package-sorting work had been a terrible problem for UPS  He noted that the turnover for entry-  level workers is down to 30 percent as compared with 40 to 45 percent a year ago  So, the retention   bonuses and the referral bonuses have done exactly what the firm had hoped they would do  Our   contacts at both UPS and FedEx also reported that the international markets that they deal with are   booming     I absolutely agree with the Greenbook outlook that it is more likely that inflation is going   to be creeping up than drifting down  And I would like to reemphasize or echo the point that Cathy   Minehan made The reason for separating energy prices from other prices is to try to differentiate a   temporary development from something that is longer running  But energy prices have now been   going up long enough and are likely to remain at their current level, so that factoring them out of our   thinking and just looking at the core CPI instead of paying attention to the total CPI I think is a   mistake   I have a comment on the Greenbook forecasting exercise  I would like to see a forecast--   and whether we call it a baseline forecast or not I don’t really care--that is built as far as possible on   assumptions that are consistent with market forecasts  I think that is the case with oil prices now    The assumption for oil prices is essentially what is in the futures market  I would like to see that   basis for assumptions carried through wherever it can be  For exchange rates, that is not the       47  assumption in the staff projection  We can debate what the long-run course of exchange rates may   turn out to be  But to have a forecast for exchange rates over the next year or 18 months that differs   with the market forecast is perhaps not the most productive way to assess the outlook because we   don’t know when these long-run forces will begin to take hold  At any rate, I would like to see a   Greenbook forecast that is based on the market forecast for exchange rates  And I would say the   same about the forecast for the federal funds rate  There is a substantial divergence now between the   federal funds assumption in the Greenbook forecast and the federal funds assumption that is built   into market data  And unless we know where that difference is coming from, it seems to me that we   may not be getting the most we possibly can out of the market evidence that is in front of us   I’m uneasy about building the Greenbook forecast on the assumption of accelerating   productivity  Productivity has accelerated; the growth rate has been rising  But to project the rise   into the future I would say is a risky proposition  It may well be correct, but we know so little about   productivity and the underlying economics of productivity determinants that to base a Greenbook   forecast on an assumption of accelerating productivity seems to me a rather risky bet  Sorting out   what is temporary and what is permanent is a very difficult problem, and for the most part with   productivity we are just extracting observations from the recent past  To project ever-increasing   productivity could, in my view, mislead us  That is all I want to say at this point     Mr Chairman, when I went to the airport yesterday morning in Bozeman,   Montana to fly back to this meeting I was a little concerned about whether the flights would be   running on time I asked the clerk whether I would be able to get back to Washington for this   meeting  I’m sure he did not know who I am but he said  “Tell Alan Greenspan to leave the   economy alone”  [Laughter]  Apparently you agree and I support your recommendation       Mr Chairman, I’d like to take a couple of minutes to talk about the   intervention issue because I think it’s a very important issue for us  If I were currently a voting   member of the FOMC, I would offer an amendment to the motion to ratify the recent transaction in   euros for System account  My purpose would not in any way be to express concern over the actions   of the Account Manager, but to reduce the probability of future interventions for System account    The amendment, and I don’t have exact wording, would require that any future intervention be made   in the context of the Committee’s discussion at its most recent meeting and that the Chairman   should, if feasible, consult with the FOMC before authorizing additional transactions in foreign   currencies  I take this position because I believe that the recent exchange market intervention is a   very serious issue for the Federal Reserve  The intervention has not to date created problems, but it   probably will in the future  Going down this road is likely to be costly to the United States   The decision to participate in the European effort to support the euro was made by the   US Treasury and not by the Federal Reserve  However, we have lent our prestige and blessing to   the intervention by participating, not just as an agent for the Treasury, but for our own account    Moreover, the intervention was widely reported as an intervention by the central banks involved  I   believe that the intervention was unwise and did not serve the interests of the United States, nor of   Europe for that matter  But our responsibility is to the United States and we ought to make the best   judgments we can in that regard  If the US Treasury has a different judgment, then it should      12  intervene for its account  We can act as agent for the Treasury, but I believe we have an obligation   not to intervene for the Federal Reserve account if in our judgment the intervention is unwise     The problem with intervention in the foreign exchange market is that a dynamic is created   that almost invariably has caused difficulty in the past  I believe that we face a high probability of   the same process occurring in this case  Economists are agreed that sterilized intervention is   unlikely to have any long-term effect  If there is a problem with policy fundamentals, then those   fundamentals must be changed to achieve any lasting change in the value of a currency in the foreign   exchange market     Based on extensive study and experience with exchange market intervention, economists   have developed an overwhelming consensus that an exchange rate system should be either freely   floating or thoroughly fixed through a currency union or a currency board  The halfway house of   intervention is unstable and unsatisfactory  I know of no documented case in which an intervention   episode from the beginning of a series of interventions to the end turned out well  I know of lots of   cases that turned out badly  I’ve studied in considerable detail the intervention dynamic that began   with the Plaza Agreement in September 1985 and lasted for several years The conclusion from that   analysis is that the Plaza intervention and its aftermath were costly for the United States and for   Japan and the United Kingdom as well  Intervention during the 1980s and the early 1990s that   attempted to maintain the European exchange rate mechanism did not work well  I could multiply   these examples many times over     Intervention creates a political and economic dynamic that with high probability creates   further problems  The dynamic ahead of us is that further instability is likely, whether the euro sinks   again or recovers  If the euro sinks, calls for additional intervention are inevitable  And the   European central bank, having started down this road, will find it very difficult not to continue       13  Should the euro rise significantly, there will be calls to intervene in the other direction before an   excessively strong euro damages European exports and the European economic recovery  In either   case, we’ll be asked to participate in these interventions  Only if we are lucky and the euro settles in   the neighborhood of its current level for many months do we have a chance that the dynamic of   intervention will gradually fade, making further interventions unlikely   Federal Reserve policy should not depend on our being lucky  If euro fluctuations lead to   a European judgment for additional intervention, so be it  But the Federal Reserve should, in my   view, make clear that this central bank does not believe that intervention for the Federal Reserve   account is wise and that, therefore, we do not intend to join in any future intervention operations    We can make that point clear to our European friends and to the US Treasury without advertising   our position publicly     I do not accept the argument that the United States, including the Federal Reserve, is   simply passively supporting our friends in Europe  The United States and Europe are now in the   intervention business together  I believe it imperative that the Federal Reserve lead in reestablishing   a US policy of nonintervention in the foreign exchange market     The Federal Reserve is in a very difficult position on this matter  If the Federal Reserve   rather than the Treasury had the legal responsibility to make these decisions for the United States,   then I do not believe that the FOMC would have been out front urging intervention  This Committee   might or might not have cooperated when the ECB asked us to intervene for the Federal Reserve   account  I hope the Committee’s response would have been a polite “no”  But now we have lent our   prestige and accepted a degree of the responsibility for the outcome of this process that has started,   while deferring to the Treasury on the decision to support the ECB’s intervention decision  If this   Committee is opposed to the intervention on its merits, as I believe it should be, then we need to find      14  a way to extract ourselves from supporting intervention with our prestige and our resources  We   should not permit ourselves to be in a position where we are accountable but have ceded authority   over the intervention decision to the Treasury  That is why I believe that the Federal Reserve should   make clear to the Treasury that the System will not share in any future interventions without the   express authorization of this Committee     Mr Chairman, if I may  What I think we need is a standing position that   we do not share 50/50 with the Treasury in any intervention unless there is an explicit decision to do   so  It is very awkward to say no when we have a custom of sharing 50/50  I understand that  It is   that custom that I would like to see us change  And I think we have a context today that shows why   we need to change that standing position     I have two distinct questions, which are completely separate  The recent   earnings warnings that have come out of Apple and Intel--and I believe Xerox and maybe some   others--have referred specifically to September sales as being considerably weaker than anticipated    Is there something there that those companies are seeing that we’re not seeing?  Or do you think,   having made more buoyant forecasts earlier, that this is in part a way of covering themselves with   the analysts?  That’s one question for you     Secondly, I want to congratulate the staff on its careful work on energy  I think that was   very helpful  At least on my reading of that work, this is much more than an oil price shock  What   we have is a worldwide demand shock at work here and there’s a normal lag in trying to adjust   production for changes in demand  Also, there was some confusion over the inventory of stocks that   has been built and that kind of thing  But I think a major part of this story is a worldwide demand   shock  I believe that is very important to emphasize because the general discussion of this in the   press--including some of the comments economists have been making about it--I find almost   embarrassing  But I do have a question because I understand that a lot of the problem now is with   refining capacity  So, even if we get the crude oil, we may have trouble getting the finished product    I understand that refineries in the United States are going flat out  What do we know about   refineries elsewhere in the world and how close to capacity they are operating?  And do we know   anything about the amount of new capacity that’s coming on stream or how long it takes to add   capacity in refining?     Mr Chairman, as I wander around my District, I always ask the question   “What’s new?”  And the answer is not much  It seems to be pretty much steady as she goes  I   recently had a trip to Jefferson City, which is obviously not a very big market  The overall      63  unemployment rate there is around 2 percent and the big issue in that area is a new one for them--the   importation of Mexican workers  And I think that example is one of many that we could cite of just   how important the strength in our labor market has been for improving the allocation of resources in   both the labor and capital markets  We certainly want to do everything we possibly can to keep that   going, and that is why maintaining stability on the inflation front is critical     I do have one issue with President Jordan  Jerry, entertainment spending for sports may   be a problem in Cleveland, but it is doing just fine in St Louis!  [Laughter]    My UPS contact was not available this time, but my FedEx contact said that his firm   continues to see very strong demand with the exception of heavy freight, which goes by truck  And   that observation ties in with the information we have on the auto industry and the trucking industry;   we know that sector has slowed a bit  So that report simply confirms what we are aware of from   other sources  Overall, the situation is fairly steady according to my FedEx contact  International   business continues to be very robust, growing by 15 to 20 percent year over year  And it’s strong   not only for shipments into the United States but also for outbound shipments  In fact, he said there   has been a pickup in US outbound shipments  And UPS business is very robust within foreign   economies, particularly in Asia, which would suggest that economic activity abroad is continuing to   do very well  FedEx continues to have difficulty attracting entry-level workers; that is a problem we   hear about over and over again  And FedEx still sees significant compensation pressures at the   professional levels  But company managers are convinced that productivity improvements are   covering those costs, so they don’t see them passing through to their prices  The exception, of   course, is fuel  FedEx has put on fuel surcharges and its customers have accepted the surcharges   without complaint  It’s just a fact of business, and those added costs are being passed through with   no difficulty      64  On the national picture, I would simply like to emphasize that the energy price increases   really are impacting a lot of people  Of course, the rise in the aggregate CPI over the past 12 months   is now running around 3-1/2 percent; that is up a lot  It’s driven almost entirely by energy but that   still involves a very significant adjustment for people from what they were seeing previously  So I   want to emphasize that one shouldn’t read energy out of the CPI and say everything is just fine, as   some commentators seem to do--though I don’t think that’s true of those around this table  I believe   that we really do have to pay attention to the aggregate CPI when the increase has been as long-  standing and as persistent as this increase is becoming now     Mr Chairman, I support the recommendation  I would like to point out,   though, that if we were using the old directive language I think there would be a case for symmetry    In my view there is about equal probability that the next move would be up or down  But the danger   with trying to read that interpretation into the current language is that the market would interpret a   balanced risk statement--if we were to go to that--as saying that we believe the inflation picture has   become more benign, which I do not think is the case  I think it is also worth emphasizing that   historically oil shocks have had particular events behind them We had the Suez Canal closure in   1956  We had the coalescence of OPEC in 1973  The Shah of Iran was deposed in 1979 and there   was the Gulf War in 1990-91  The current case does not have any incident of that type     Well, I don't think it is of the same magnitude      83    Well, let me comment about that  I think we have always understood that   monopolies make prices high  They do not make prices rise  And there is no question that in the   face of strong demand it is in the interest of a monopoly to exploit a strong demand to raise prices     No, what I’m saying is that oil prices bottomed out in 1998 and there has   been a very strong worldwide recovery in the last four to six quarters  Worldwide there has been an   economic boom     I agree that there is an inventory cycle that is very hard to understand  By   inventories I mean the inventories that are invisible and that we don't have any direct data on  I have   no quarrel with that  But I am saying that I don't think it’s an accident that we have rising oil prices   in the context of a worldwide economic boom  That is the only point I wanted to make regarding my   view on this matter     That will add to our woes, no question about it       Mr Chairman, I have a question, but first I have an observation on that   point  I don’t think it matters which way the exchange rate is moving  From the perspective of       11  the rest of the world, it’s always our fault if somebody else is having problems  That’s my   reading of the history of that!     On the yield curves on page 3, the most recent observation in the lower right corner is   obviously very, very unusual, and I’d like to offer another observation about that  What strikes   me is this pervasive sense developing in the market that there’s going to be a policy easing   ahead  At the same time, the expectation is that it will happen but not yet   I asked a member of   my staff to print out a chart of both the five-year and two-year Treasury yields in terms of their   differential in relation to the three-month-ahead fed funds futures market  What you see on the   chart is that there are two instances when that spread had become as large as it is now  One was   in the fall of 1998  I think it’s clear that the issue then was the flight to quality in the two-year to   five-year area; that involved more of a liquidity flight to quality than an expectational issue  The   other case was back in the spring of 1989  So, what we have is the sense that there’s going to be   a policy easing, but not yet  It’s off into the future quite a bit  And that, I think, is quite odd,   based on our experience of the last 10 to 12 years anyway, or since we have had the fed funds   futures market  I just offer that observation     I have two questions  Around St Louis we have some automobile   plants that are shut down on temporary layoff  And I think we might want to be sure that we   understand the shutdowns this week because this is the week of the employment survey  And if   we have a substantial number of people on temporary layoff, that will show up in the               22      employment survey number that is reported at the beginning of next month  I think we should be   aware of that  Do you have any idea what that number is likely to be?     My second comment is on an entirely different subject  I think the discrepancy   between your fed funds assumption and the assumptions in the market is the largest I’ve seen in   the two and a half years I’ve been here  Perhaps you could comment on the significance of that     I want to go back to the point that Ned Gramlich was making  It’s true   that with a different fed funds trajectory there would be issues about what to do with asset prices    But, of course, we have the same problem today because we have the market with this trajectory   of expectations that are determining current asset prices, the takeoff point for the outlook  So I   think it is a real conundrum  It’s a very, very difficult problem, and I understand that  But the   policy significance for us is that we have perhaps an unusually large discrepancy between the   view in the market and the view of our experts on this outlook  And that’s clearly something that   we’re going to have to grapple with in thinking about where we go from here       Within the Eighth District I think we have, as Bob McTeer put it for his   District, a fairly pervasive change in mood  The view is not that things are going down the drain   but there is a pervasive sense of slower growth  In a meeting we had with St Louis area   investment professionals, that was the unanimous view expressed around the table  Also, one of   our directors reported a significant decline in industrial sales of electricity, which probably   relates to the weakness in the manufacturing industry because that industry is a big user of   electricity in the St Louis area   I talked to both my UPS and FedEx contacts last week, and I will start with what they   had to say about the international economy  My UPS contact had just returned from a trip to   Asia, an area in which he sees tremendous growth in airfreight  He believes that Japan is starting   to rebound and that Korea is picking up further  The airlines are all building a network in China   and the expectation is that growth within China will explode in coming years  So they are very,   very upbeat about Asia  He mentioned strong growth of his airfreight traffic between Europe               61      and Asia and within Europe but reported that traffic between Europe and the United States was a   bit weak   My FedEx contact had similar views on the international economy  Imports into the   United States from Europe and Asia are running at a 20 plus percent growth rate year over year   and that, of course, would be consistent with what we are seeing in the macro data  FedEx   reports that volume within Europe and Asia remains strong  They also see continuing strong   growth in Latin America and are building a new hub in Miami to service that growth   On the domestic economy, my FedEx contact had an interesting observation  Just   recently, in October, he noted a clear sign of slower growth in the United States  He said that the   express packages they are shipping are of a lower average weight and that there is also more use   of ground shipping and less resort to airfreight, suggesting a significant slowing  I think FedEx   does a lot of business shipping automobile parts, so that would be consistent with what we see in   the auto industry  But they are expecting continued strong growth in both their ground and   overnight express business  They are anticipating a lower seasonal peak this year, a little less   pressure in the November/December period   My UPS contact had some interesting things to say on the cost side  Their experts    have calculated--I thought it was interesting how specific their calculation is--that                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        So they obviously are looking very carefully   at that  They are expecting the compensation terms of that settlement to spread across the   industry, though I suppose other continuing issues are involved that are not all wrapped up in the               62                                                I think that is probably the major information I’ve been able to gather   from poking around in our District   On the overall national picture, I believe the risks on the inflation front remain largely   unchanged  We seem to have a continuing upcreep in inflation--not a breakout but continuing   upward pressure, with the same risks that we’ve seen  I do think, though, that there is a much   higher risk than we saw 6 weeks ago or 12 weeks ago of growth coming in slower than we would   like  So if we do move to a balanced risks statement, in my view it would not be because there is   any reduction in the inflation risk, but rather because we have an increased risk on the output and   employment sides   I would also like to emphasize that there are lags in the inflation processes that are   much, much longer than in the employment and output processes  So we should not be all that   surprised if next year we were simultaneously to see increases in both reported inflation and   unemployment     Mr Chairman, first of all I agree that we should hold steady on   the federal funds rate  But I would prefer a balanced risks statement, and let me give you   the logic of my argument   It seems to me that the way monetary policy works today is that we maintain a   firm medium-run and long-run commitment to low and stable inflation, so what we do   has to be consistent with that  At the same time, a tremendous amount of short-run   stabilization depends on the market changing interest rates in response to short-run   developments  That being the case, it seems to me that we want the market to feel free to   move rates in response to current developments in the direction that those developments   demand  What I am concerned about is that we not set up an expectation in the market,   which exists today, that there is no near-term easing in prospect  That's the expectation   that's built into the federal funds rate futures  I would like to see a statement that’s more   neutral with respect to that possibility so that the market could move more readily in   either direction   I think we have to be careful about reading too much into the TIPS spread  In   my view the TIPS spread is a measure of our credibility, which is extremely important  I   don't think it necessarily means that we have policy tuned right  I could cite a contrary   case--namely 1982, when policy had changed dramatically but the markets didn't believe   that the Fed was going to stay with it  So inflation expectations were very slow to come   down and it took a long time for the expectations to catch up with the reality of where   policy was  And the same thing could happen today  I don’t think we want to assume   that the TIPS spread shows that we've got policy just right               89      I would prefer that in the statement we make it clear that the risks are now   balanced, but not because the inflation risk has gone away  Indeed I think, if anything,   the near-term inflation risk has gone up somewhat, which we could say  Rather, the risks   are now balanced because the outlook on the output and employment side has changed  I   agree that the critical issue is the combination of the statement itself and the balance of   risks clause in the statement  But I would not like to leave the market with the message   that we don't see any reasonable prospect of a policy easing in the next few meetings,   which I think is going to be the tenor of the way the market will interpret that message     I agree that the presentations gave a very nice sense of the uncertainties   that we face  I have a question about the inventory situation, given that inventories are so often a   major part of cyclical processes  My impression from looking at the data and the charts is that   inventories are not far out of line  We have nothing like the kind of inventory situation that we’ve      20  seen at cyclical peaks, where inventories clearly have blown up, leading to a substantial cut in   production   Yet there are areas where there are inventory concerns  Could you elaborate a bit on   the inventory situation?  What is the right sense of that?     Thank you, Mr Chairman  In recent weeks at the St Louis Fed we've had   luncheons with investment professionals from the St Louis area and with senior officials from   biotech firms  The message from them is very similar to the one we've heard around the table, one   of a great deal of caution  The people I've talked with, however, do not believe that the economy is   sinking--just that growth is weaker, not currently negative   A somewhat different view emerged when I talked to my FedEx and UPS contacts  The   first comment my FedEx contact made was that since early November there has been a real   slowdown on the domestic side  Their domestic package business is now up only 1 to 1-1/2 percent   year over year, and given the rapid growth they had experienced before, that would mean--if a   seasonally adjusted series existed--that it is actually down  Both of my contacts said that   international business remains good, but both had the same view of the domestic business  UPS   volume is running 3 to 5 percent below what had been projected   My FedEx contact said that his firm has a lot of the package business in the auto,   computer, and retail industries  They have checked with their customers such as                   and   others to see if the slowdown had something to do with FedEx or was an economy-wide issue, and   their customers all said that the overall economy was slow  My UPS contact expressed the same   view   On the labor front, both companies have found considerably easier conditions with only   isolated pockets of staffing problems  They don't have any general problems with staffing their   operations anymore  My FedEx contact in particular pointed out that they no longer have difficulty      61  recruiting and retaining people in the professional ranks  Essentially, I think what has happened is   that the slowdown in the dot-com industry has released a lot of workers into the marketplace and   they are being absorbed  It is taking a lot of the pressure off the labor market   I think it's correct to say that economic activity in recent weeks has been surprisingly   slow  And most people view the outlook for coming months, the first quarter or so, as also likely to   be slow  However, there is a general sense of optimism about, let's say, the second quarter and   beyond among the business people we talked with  But as we look further out into the future, I think   perhaps we need to apply more economic analysis because my gut feeling is that cyclical processes   are under way  I see these reflected in areas like durable goods orders and much wider credit   spreads that are reducing credit availability to more marginal borrowers  In my view we are   observing a fairly standard set of cyclical processes  But they need not, of course, end up creating   recession if we have a policy response that is appropriate to the changing circumstances   I'm reminded that a couple of weeks ago I had the very pleasant experience of touring the   Boeing F-18 assembly plant and had about thirty minutes in the simulator for an F-18  I must say   I'm a lot happier sitting around this table than I am in an F-18!  But in the process of trying to land   that plane in the simulator of the aircraft carrier, I ended up producing what the instructor called   "pilot-induced oscillation"  [Laughter]  That means finding oneself wobbling first one way and then   the other way  And I think we have some of the same concerns about monetary policy  We don't   want to overreact--      Well, I did not end up in the drink!  I had some helping hands, although on   one occasion the instructor forgot to put the hook down, so there was no catch on the deck, and we      62  pushed the throttle forward and took off again What it amounts to is a $20 million video game and   it's a lot of fun!     Anyway, we don't want to produce a Fed-induced policy oscillation  I think that is part of   our concern  In my view we don't have that situation in front of us for the following reason Policy   is really positioned very much on one side at the present time  Adjusted for risk, the federal funds   rate is the highest rate in the market  Back in May when we raised it to 6-1/2 percent, some rates   were above and some rates were below  The funds rate was pretty much in the middle and there was   room for rates to move substantially in either direction  Right now, if we have a resurgence in the   economy, there is room for longer-term rates to rise by 150 to 200 basis points without our doing   anything  We're not forecasting a resurgence but if that happens, there's lots of room for rates to rise    I don't think there's much room for the market to take rates lower  Outside of a recession situation, I   don't think one could find in the data a term structure more inverted than the one we have now  So it   seems to me that positioning ourselves in the middle requires that we ease a bit  There would still be   a lot of room then for rates to rise without a move by us, if it turns out that the economy is about to   rebound   That is where I come out and why I think this is an appropriate time to ease  I'd also point   out that as of yesterday the federal funds market had priced in a 40 percent probability of an easing   at today's meeting  I don't know what the fed funds market is doing at this moment, obviously, but a   probability of about 40 percent is not quite half way there but almost  And the probability looking to   the February fed funds futures contract is that by the end of January we will be more than 25 basis   points along an easing path  An easing of 25 basis points plus is priced into the February contract    So my bottom line is that we need to reposition ourselves to get back in the middle of the playing   field again  Thank you      63    Mr Chairman, as you know from my earlier comments, I would have   preferred to reduce the federal funds rate at this meeting by 25 basis points  Let me try to put my   position this way  On the issue of when to ease we can ask the question in two ways  Obviously, the   market fully expects an easing at the beginning of next year, and one question to ask is what   difference does it make if we ease now rather than wait  But we can put the question the other way   around, what difference does it make if we wait six weeks?  It's hard to imagine that six weeks   makes any real difference  The extent to which it may make a difference has to have something to   do with expectations and public attitudes  In my view, in terms of public attitudes and expectations   about our policy moves, there are ample data in hand now to justify easing  That is, I don't think      75  anyone would say that we are making a mistake by acting at this point  On the other hand, probably   the single most prominent piece of information we’re going to get that bears on this policy issue is   the December employment report that will come out at the beginning of January  If that shows   weakness--very low employment growth or a decline in employment--I think there will be a great   deal of pressure, probably within the Committee and in the public at large, for us to respond  Quite   frankly, I believe it would be better for us to anticipate that development rather than wait until we   have such a piece of negative news  As I said before, I think there's ample space for rates to move   up and not much space for them to move down  So, I would prefer to see us position ourselves in   the middle, as I indicated earlier      Thank you, Mr Chairman  I want to start by reinforcing Tom   Hoenig’s comment and congratulating the authors of all of these studies This is a subject   that is almost totally neglected in the academic literature, as far as I know, and I note that   there aren’t very many footnote references  I think it’s important that we publish these   papers as soon as we possibly can because we ought to get some academic discussion   going  There are a lot of good minds out there and we ought to rely on their help We   may get some further insights  Moreover, it would assist us in the discussion over the   next few years of how to deal with this issue  So I would hope we could publish these   papers     Secondly, I think we all understand that the government might change its   underlying fiscal policy so that this problem no longer exists  In fact, it’s not that   difficult to imagine a combination of spending increases, tax cuts, and a little reduction in   the long-run growth estimates such that this problem might not be with us 12 months   from now  That is possible  But for our discussion around the table today we ought to   assume that it is going to exist  And, therefore, as much as I respect Al Broaddus’   thoughts on this issue, if the underlying government surplus continues and the   government debt disappears, some part of the Federal establishment is going to end up   owning some assets other than Treasuries  So I think we should take that as the point of   departure for the discussion     I would also raise a point that has not been mentioned but is very worthwhile   to think about  And that is that if the government, the Federal establishment as a whole,   ends up as a creditor, what we do may set a pattern for what other parts of the     1/30-31/01 25  government do  One such example is Social Security, where there is a going to be a large   block of assets, at least on paper, sitting in the trust fund  So we need to consider that   what we do may therefore have much greater influence than just on our own situation    We’re going to be looked to as an example for how to handle this issue for the   government more generally  And that makes it an even more serious issue for us, I think   My own thinking about this to date is that insofar as possible we should rely on   assets that carry the full faith and credit of governmental entities and, of course, that has   been true with our focus on Treasury securities in the past  We have not talked very   much about state and local securities  The fiscal affairs of the Federal and state   governments are thoroughly entangled already because of the large-scale Federal grants   to states and municipalities  Thus, my own preference would be that we consider very   seriously adopting a principle that our primary assets must carry the full faith and credit   of a government--which might be a state government  That principle would have the   advantage, I think, of being relatively easy to understand and very defensible  And to my   mind it’s a far better principle than one that says federal versus everything else  Because   if the principle is federal versus other things, we’re going to get into the GSE question,   which I think we ought to avoid  In my view it would be much, much better if we could   accumulate assets in the form of claims on state governments rather than claims on GSEs     I know there’s a limit because there is only a finite amount of   such assets in that market as well  Nevertheless, it might be sufficient in size, at least for   a time, for us to do what we might need to do  And it seems to me that it would be a   better principle     1/30-31/01 26  As I understand the current projections, assuming some fiscal adjustments this   year, let’s say, that don’t eliminate the problem, essentially the problem accumulates to a   maximum at about the time when fund flows in the Social Security system turn and the   outlays exceed the incoming revenues  That’s sometime in the neighborhood of 2015 to   2020 depending on the number of people taking retirement at a certain age and that sort   of thing  So the interval until then is generally the period of maximum vulnerability or   difficulty for us  Once the Social Security system is selling off assets, our problem will   become a good bit easier, I think  And it could well be that with some fiscal adjustments   we could accumulate some claims on state governments that would get us past the most   difficult period  At any rate, I would focus attention there to begin with, as the first   resort   It also seems to me useful to think about our portfolio, as I believe we are, as   having a relatively stable, permanent part and a trading, temporary--or whatever we want   to call it--part that meets the cyclical and seasonal needs of the open market portfolio  I   think the permanent part of our holdings could go into state government securities,   securities that carry the full faith and credit of a government  They don’t have good   secondary markets, but they don’t really need to for this purpose anyway  For the   temporary part of the portfolio I think we’d want to be sure to use several different   approaches and diversify, because we don’t know exactly how this might work out  The   two logical places to emphasize for some expansion in our short-term holdings would be   the discount window and RPs  But going entirely one way or the other, I think, puts us at   an undue risk, should the approach we select turn out to have some problems that we     1/30-31/01 27  don’t foresee or some problems that we know are there but turn out to be bigger than we   now foresee  Thank you     I have one comment and one request  My comment is that if we   have a portfolio of private securities, there may be aspects of managing the credit risks   that would differ for us relative to a private portfolio  When we’ve looked at the issue of   managing those risks, it has been discussed primarily as if we were a large mutual fund   investing in bonds or something like that  Some elements of our operation may differ   from those of a privately managed portfolio  For example, we might want to stay with a   buy and hold strategy  Once we decide to buy a security we might not want to sell it,   whereas a private portfolio manager might want to sell it  I don’t know precisely what   the risk-management differences might be but I’m thinking about issues like that     We may not have a choice if there is a default  In any event,   there may be some differences  What would we do if we ended up in bankruptcy court as   a claimant?  That’s a more realistic example, if we have debentures in the portfolio other   than home mortgages   Secondly, my request  Can we at least downgrade the security classification of   these studies to Class III so that the staffs at all the Reserve Banks could look at these   materials?  That’s a request for the powers-that-be to consider     Mr Chairman, I’d like to comment on the Authorization for   Foreign Currency Operations  I wrote out a few notes, which I’m going to read   I spoke in some detail at our October meeting about foreign exchange market   intervention  I continue to oppose intervention and want to discuss briefly some   considerations beyond the economic ones I took up in October   Let me be clear that I am not talking about intervention in emergency   circumstances  The Chairman must have authority to intervene in crisis situations, such   as those that might arise if a President is assassinated or a war breaks out, or if any of a   wide range of unpredictable but terribly serious events should occur  My remarks apply     1/30-31/01 75  to circumstances in which intervention might be debated for days or even weeks in   advance   Our practices and institution of intervention date from an era in which the   FOMC genuinely believed that intervention was a useful tool of economic policy  My   sense of current views around this table is that no one wants to make a strong case for   intervention and that some members are very much opposed to it  Any intervention   today, then, must be for fundamentally non-economic purposes--political purposes,   broadly defined, but not partisan political purposes   The Federal Reserve’s reputation and independence depend on the public’s   viewing us as totally non-partisan and as exercising our best judgment on sound   economic policy  We are now in a situation, if I read Committee members’ views   correctly, in which we are willing to intervene on occasion even though we do not believe   that doing so is sound economic policy  How do we justify actions we believe do not   represent sound economic policy?  Should we be in a position in which we must decide   when to say “yes” and when to say “no” to the Treasury on intervention, when the   grounds are inherently non-economic?  I think not   Moreover, our intervention resources arise from the Federal Reserve’s power   to create money  By intervening at the behest of the Treasury, we augment Treasury   resources beyond those appropriated by Congress  Someday, someone in Congress will   make an issue of that, and we will not in good conscience be able to claim that we have   intervened because we believe that intervention represents sound economic policy  I   believe that we risk our good reputation by intervening with funds Congress is not willing     1/30-31/01 76  to appropriate directly  Congress could, after all, increase the size of the Exchange   Stabilization Fund at any time   Another issue that troubles me greatly is that when the United States intervenes   at the request of a foreign government or foreign central bank we have no assurance that   the intervention plans will be closely held in confidence; we have no control over the   process  We are at risk that intervention plans will be disclosed prematurely and that   others will trade against us--so called “front-running”  Should we ever face a verified   case of front-running against our intervention, all hell would--and should--break loose in   Congress  I believe very strongly that intervention, if any, should be solely for purposes   of US economic policy and should be controlled by the United States  The front-  running risk is one we should not take, especially given that the benefits of intervention   are so problematic in the first place   I understand that intervention policies are to be reviewed jointly by the Federal   Reserve and the Treasury  Subject to this review, I can vote to support the current   foreign currency authorizations  However, I think some discussion of these issues before   that review, either now or at a future FOMC meeting, would be useful so that the views   of the FOMC as a body could be registered in the review process      Yes, thank you     Yes     Mr Chairman, Larry Meyer and a couple of other people have   asked why the St Louis discount rate change is not effective today   The reason is that     1/30-31/01 190  the State of Arkansas has some bank usury ceilings that are tied to the discount rate  As a   practical matter, the change in the discount rate can’t become effective until the following   day  It has to do with Arkansas law     That’s correct  We can’t make it effective immediately     I think we could leave it out of this statement  You might have   to explain it, but--      Full stop     Well, to me the way to think about it is that the Board accepted   the recommendation from the St Louis Bank but because of our peculiar situation as a   standard practice the change has to become effective the following day  But I don’t think   we need to have that detail in the press statement     What is important is just the fact that the Board accepted our   recommendation  That is what you did, and that’s all you have to say       I want to thank the staff for preparing the alternative simulation   that has a monetary policy assumption that more or less approximates the readings from     1/30-31/01 122  the fed funds futures market  Could you help me to understand that by explaining longer-   term interest rates in that forecast relative to the baseline and how that feeds into certain   sectors, especially housing and business fixed investment?     As I understand it, in the baseline forecast you have long-term   interest rates remaining about where they are, which is the only rational forecast of long-  term interest rates anyway  I say that because if you had an expected major change,   you’d have big capital gains and losses that should not exist in the marketplace in a   predicted fashion  So it may really be that what is sensible here is to leave long rates   about where they are, which is what you’ve done in this alternative simulation, and just   change the shorter rates     I didn’t know I was going to get the last word this afternoon    In the Eighth District there is a sense of caution, but I think deep gloom would   be the wrong term to use  People seem to feel that things have flattened out  The   banking system appears to be strong; there is some increase in problem loans but not   large numbers of defaults and delinquencies  Everybody is aware of the TWA   bankruptcy and there is a great deal of local support in St Louis for a quick   reorganization in the bankruptcy court  It appears that TWA is going to be reorganized   under the ownership of American Airlines, with essentially no employment impact  My   guess is that all will continue smoothly on that front     I’ve been searching to find the optimal level of gloom because I think it is too   easy to be all one sided in assessing the current situation  Let me comment on a point   that I don’t think has been mentioned  There is no question that December's weather was   lousy  It was the coldest and snowiest December in many, many years  I think we need     1/30-31/01 168  to try to sort out how much of what we are observing is an impact from days lost at work   and days lost by retailers and so forth in December    I have a sense that December's weather is not the primary story, but let me give   you a few numbers that I got from my UPS contact  Domestic airfreight last year through   November, compared to the same 11-month period of the previous year, was up 31   percent  But in the month of November 2000 as compared to November 1999, it was   down 13 percent The same was true for international traffic  In 2000, year-to-date   through November, international airfreight was up 11-1/2 percent; but just comparing   November 1999 to November of 2000 it was up only 6 percent  So November is the   month when the downdraft really hit and that predates the worst of the weather     However, my contacts at UPS and FedEx both are projecting an upswing in the   second half of 2001 after a slow first half, which is consistent with the pattern for the year   that our forecast shows  UPS is putting a contingency plan into place, however  The   company has a working assumption that business in the year 2001 will be up 11 percent   over the previous year, but is developing a contingency plan that assumes business will   be up only 6 percent  So UPS managers are knocking 5 percentage points off their   growth assumption and making plans for what they will have to do if that scenario   materializes   My UPS contact says that his folks have surveyed their 300 major customers   and those customers see weak business in the near term but a pickup in the second half of   the year  So, again, that fits with the picture that we’ve developed     The only other point I’d like to mention in terms of the national economy is   that to a large extent our sense about how these processes work comes from a long     1/30-31/01 169  experience with business cycle fluctuations  Historically, until the 1990-1991 recession,   both long- and short-term interest rates turned at the cycle peak or within plus or minus   two months from the peak  This time, long rates reached a peak, depending on exactly   which series one looks at, back in the spring of last year and have gone down quite a bit   in recent months  Al Broaddus noted that money growth at this point is well maintained    Historically, there was a substantial cycle in money growth  We don’t have that this   time  Past recessions have always involved residential construction  Typically we see   big declines in housing  This time housing starts are holding up  So I think the prospects   are that, yes, the economy is going to be weak  But I don’t believe that we have a falling-   out-of-bed situation  We do need to respond; I’m not trying to say that we don't  But I   think we want to be careful that we don’t have a sense of more gloom than is justified by   what we know  I’m talking about the optimal amount of gloom here!      Mr Chairman, I certainly support your recommendation  I’d   like to make just a brief comment about the lags in this process  I think it’s important to   recognize that market interest rates have moved ahead of our actions in anticipation of   what we’re going to do  In explaining this move, when we’re giving speeches and that   kind of thing, we should emphasize that a lot of ease has already been reflected in the   marketplace ahead of our actions  For example, the two-year constant maturity rate   moved below 6 percent in October, dropped below 5-1/2 percent in early December, and   then by early January it was down to about 4-3/4 percent  So the market has moved   ahead of us and we have some easing already in the pipeline, which clearly shows up in   the housing numbers, as I mentioned yesterday     David, I have a question about the saving rate  I’m sure that   some of this internal debate you spoke of had to do with the saving rate  Perhaps it’s a   little below zero, but let’s just assume it is zero for the moment  It’s a lot easier to     3/20/01 27  imagine it going to plus 4 than to minus 4; there’s a sort of asymmetry built into that   situation  If the stock market returns to more historical norms of behavior, why shouldn’t   we expect the personal saving rate to go back toward historical norms?     But productivity growth from, say, 1948 to 1968 or 1973 was   not all that different from what we’re looking at today, yet the saving rate back in that era   was much, much higher     That might be the mechanism, but that doesn’t tell us whether   it’s really sustainable in the long run to have such a very low saving rate     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Conditions around the Eighth   District are very similar to those described by others who have already commented  The   situation is mixed, but on the whole activity is flat to okay  The mood is decidedly worse   than the reality, but I don’t detect a huge amount of concern and fear  The way I would   put it is that there’s just a sense of uneasiness   When I called my                         , the first words out of his mouth were that                      a really bad February  He said that the volume in the domestic express   business--that’s the air part of the business--was actually below that of February last year,   a significant drop  The ground business was up 5 percent year over year, but that was 5   percentage points below the pace it had been running  That slowdown primarily reflects   the                            ships a lot of auto and computer parts, areas where a significant   inventory adjustment is taking place                         customers believe that the inventory   adjustment is mostly complete and they anticipate a return to normal shipping patterns by   late spring or early summer     While my contact started out by saying that the company had a really bad   February, he said the declines were not horrific--just a few percentage points  He also   indicated that the declines did not seem to be continuing; there was a lot of new business   in the pipeline  He pointed out that the ground business is still growing, apparently   reflecting some substitution of ground shipments for air shipments because of less need   for quick delivery and, of course, a cheaper means of transportation  He also said that     3/20/01 62                  not planning any layoffs nor even reducing employment by attrition  They find   no significant wage reductions in the works, but their executive bonuses are going to be   down quite a bit  On the whole, labor market conditions are easier, but the firm continues   to have problems finding quality entry-level recruits  He noted, however, that almost no   IT people have left in the last few months, which is of course consistent with the   shakeout we’re observing in the dot-com industry   My                      pointed in particular to very weak conditions in international   business, especially in Asia, which is probably related to the fact that a lot of computer   parts are shipped out of Asia  He said that South America is showing a similar trend but   that business in Europe remains quite strong                         has put a freeze on   promotions and new hires  The company seems to be under quite a bit of profit pressure   and is reducing employment through attrition  The outlook, however, is not terribly   negative, though my contact does see significant pressures on labor costs in the airline   industry  The terms of the United Airlines settlement of last year are going to spread   through the industry and,                               calculations, that will add 16 cents per   package to                    So they’re seeing a lot of upward pressure on their operating   costs   I also called a senior official                       to ask about recent trends in its   business  He said that he sees no significant change in the buying                                    customers; the mix of goods remains about the same  Total traffic is down a little but not   a lot  He said that                          decided last June that activity was slowing down quite a   bit; it showed up first in                         stores and later in                                          However, the company came out of the holiday season in excellent shape on inventories      3/20/01 63  There is no inventory overhang at that company  My contact expects sales to remain   relatively flat, but he said that his “fallback” expectation was that business was going to   get better rather than worse   He made an interesting comment about the labor market  He said that                                     expecting an increase in the minimum wage and had already put through   some wage increases in anticipation of that  Of course, the company is not going to take   those raises back even though a minimum wage increase was not enacted, but   anticipatory increases of that sort could explain some of the wage numbers we have   observed    One final note He reported                                   a regular phone survey of   about 15,000 of its customers--a significant sample--and detected a lot of fear of being   laid off  That seemed to be the main news from that survey   I want to make three comments about our situation  A number of people have   commented about the equity market  My observation is that it’s very, very unfortunate   that investors in that market keep looking to the FOMC to bail them out  A reassessment   of the earnings prospects in the tech business is taking place  That involves a real   readjustment, having to do with the nature of that business and judgments on whether   excess investment exists that needs to be worked off  I know that a lot of fiber optic   cable has been laid all over the country, which may have involved some excess   investment  That’s a real adjustment, and the equity markets ought not to be looking to   us to fix that problem because it is not anything we can fix   Secondly, money growth has been very high  The current environment is not   at all typical of recession environments in the past  If we look at the numbers, the narrow     3/20/01 64  aggregate that I prefer, MZM, grew at annual rates of 13 percent in December, 22 percent   in January, and 26 percent in February  M2 grew at an annual rate of 10 percent in   December, 12 percent in January, and 11 percent in February  So, money growth has   been quite high  My sense is that credit is somewhat tighter than it was but is still readily   available; anyone with a reasonably bankable proposition can find funding   Thirdly, I would like to see us come out of this meeting in a posture that does   not foster widespread expectations that our next policy adjustment will be another   reduction in the funds rate  In my view we ought to try to get ourselves in the center of   the range so that the odds are more or less equal that the next policy move is going to be   an increase rather than a decrease in the funds rate   Also, I think the balance of risks language for the weighted-toward-weakness   option is directional in meaning  To me it implies that we expect the economy to be   going down  But the consensus forecast is for continuing very slow growth in the   economy, not a decline  That’s not to say that a decline will not occur, but the best guess   is that real GDP will grow at a rate of about zero to 1 percent  That’s the consensus of   private forecasters, though obviously the spread involves estimates above and below that   range  Nevertheless, that’s the average of the Blue Chip forecasts and also what the   Philadelphia Fed survey shows     So, these observations lead me to believe that today we ought to use language   indicating that the risks are balanced on either side  If this really is an inventory   adjustment and if we’re almost through it, then we’re going to see a rebound  That’s the   logic of an inventory adjustment--that we will see a rebound in production  Thank you     Mr Chairman, I can support your recommendation, although it   is not my first choice  And because it may prove relevant for some future meeting, I’d   like to explain briefly a different view   Let me call option X a 50 basis point cut with the balance of risks toward   weakness  I’ll call option Y, my preference, a 75 basis point cut with a statement that the   risks are balanced  I think the immediate market impact of those two options would be   roughly the same because the balanced risks statement is not foreseen by the market  I   look at this as a problem of where we are likely to be perhaps four weeks from now    Incidentally, I want to make clear that a balanced risks statement only means that the   probabilities of the next move being up or down are equal  I would not be foreclosing     3/20/01 93  another easing move at the next meeting if the data support such a move in a compelling   way  But let’s say the incoming data are on the weak side four weeks out  Option X, the   one we are likely to vote for today, leaves us in the same situation as we were going into   this meeting--that is, with continuing speculation about when and how big our next move   will be  Option Y puts us ahead of where we would otherwise be  If the incoming data   are flat to strong, option X results in uncertainty about whether we might still be   contemplating another downward move  Option Y leaves us “finished” for the time   being, which I would view as the correct message  Clearly, option Y positions us to stop   easing at forthcoming meetings  That is my best guess of our future policy path, given   the forecast, the sentiment, the anecdotal information, and the rapid creation of liquidity   in the system at this point   I am quite frankly opposed to giving a deliberate hint of an intermeeting move    I think that's going to cause us difficulty not only in coming weeks, but well beyond   because people will be wondering in the future if an intermeeting action is on our minds    So, I believe that that would be a mistake     Mr Chairman, my preference would be to leave out that   sentence for several reasons  First of all, we are never relaxed  Quite frankly, I've never   relaxed and I don't think anybody else around the table has ever relaxed about the   economic situation  We follow developments very closely  If the economic situation   does evolve rapidly and it calls for action, then I don't doubt that we will step up to the   plate and do what is necessary  But my concern about this language is that lots of routine   data come in and if some measures come in a little on the weak side, that may cause a   reaction  This language will prime the market to watch every piece of information that   becomes available and will increase the market’s volatility  All sorts of minor   developments that don't call for any action will be looked at from the perspective of   whether it will trigger the Fed to act or not       Oh, I understand that  But I'm talking about my forecast of how   the market will read this     3/20/01 107    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I think the overall message from the Eighth   District is flat, flat, flat  Housing remains on the strong side and manufacturing on the weak side    --no dramatic changes in either direction  Bank loan demand, depending on which banker one   talks to, is either up a little or down a little  The bankers do say that lending standards are being   tightened modestly, to some extent in response to pressure from regulators  But they are   tightening them on their own as well      My contact at                                       business is running about 10 percent below a year   ago  On a year-over-year basis, April was down 9 percent and May so far was down 10 percent   Shipments of high-tech items—                             of computer components--and auto parts have   been particularly weak  The ground business is up; the company’s customers seem to be   substituting ground shipments for air express because of the lower cost  As for international   business, US outbound shipments are now negative year-over-year and inbound shipments are   very low but still show positive growth  European business seemed to be holding up fairly well   but Asian business was especially weak                    added surcharges because of increased costs                                       , of course, are faced with higher wages for pilots and mechanics as well as     5/15/01     49   higher costs for fuel  So, both companies are experiencing significant cost increases along with   the declines in the level of business The overall reaction                                    was one of surprise   about how weak things are  His firm had expected some resurgence but that doesn’t seem to be   taking place                                 pointed out that he had been with the company for 27 years and   despite all that experience he feels very surprised and concerned about the situation                   faces  Again, there are a lot of cost pressures--pilots, mechanics, fuel--and a declining level of   business  Probably the best evidence of the                       the situation is that the company is really   very much in a hunkering-down mode  It has deferred delivery of two new aircraft out of 17 that   were on order and plans to park four older aircraft and take them offline until they are needed  He   pointed out that a buyer probably can get a good deal from Boeing now because a lot of passenger   airlines are also deferring or canceling orders  In terms of its management of the                                cutting back employment; the company has a hiring freeze and is not filling vacant positions    Capital expenditures are down  Special projects of all sorts are being delayed or on hold    Managers have tightened up on  corporate travel and travel only on urgent need  As my contact   put it, they are tightening the belt across the board--expense accounts, relocations, and all those   adjustments that companies make when they experience a lot of pressure on profits     The story from                                      was quite different                           sees problems   in finding good sales associates, for example  Turnover is down significantly, perhaps because of   the softer labor market, but the company is still encountering some labor market pressures  My   contact said he found current demand conditions confusing, not consistent with the usual kind of   recession or downturn pattern  In particular, the average size of a sales ticket is up 4 to 5 percent   from a year ago and the split between what they call discretionary and nondiscretionary     5/15/01     50   expenditures is about unchanged  Nondiscretionary items would be things like toilet paper and   diapers, I suppose, and discretionary items would be appliances and things like that  When   people are under a lot of pressure, it’s the discretionary purchases that get squeezed out                                         very closely and has seen no change in that split  My contact sees the data as   suggesting that the situation is not getting worse and is perhaps slightly better  What they see in   their stores does not correspond with the very weak employment report that we got; consumer   behavior doesn’t seem to match that  He said that the company is debating whether to ratchet up   ordering a bit to reduce the frequency of out-of-stock situations in certain goods they sell  They   regard inventories as in very good shape; that’s not an issue  Price pressures are minimal  They   just price off the cost of goods, and vendor pricing has remained very well controlled  He did   mention energy costs  Of course, everybody is affected by those costs   On the national economy, let me try to make a couple analytical points  I think the   downside risks are very obvious, but somehow it seems to me that the upside risks are not quite so   obvious  So I want to talk about the upside risks--not as a certainty but as a possibility  I believe   the staff forecast makes a lot of sense as a point estimate, but it is subject to risks in both   directions and I want to discuss the upside risks   We’re all uncertain about the economy’s potential growth  The Board’s staff has   marked down its estimate of potential growth a little, but we know that that number is subject to a   great deal of uncertainty  If it turns out that potential growth is less than our current best guess,   we could find ourselves pressing a lot of monetary stimulus into an economy that doesn’t really   have the potential to produce goods at that rate  That's in terms of the growth rate  In terms of   the level at which the economy is operating, certainly five years ago we would not have estimated   that 4-1/2 percent unemployment was above the natural rate, and we might still not want to make     5/15/01     51   that estimate  It may be that the labor market is in the process of converging to an equilibrium   rate of unemployment that is, given the structure of the labor market, even higher than the current   rate  And if we try to press, we’re just going to get more inflation out of that situation and not, at   the end of the day, more employment   I think the output mix is clearly changing  We’re probably going to see less   investment--perhaps for some time to come--in the high-tech part of the economy and a lot more   investment in the energy-producing areas of the economy  We know, for example, that a lot of   new electricity generation projects are under way, and for very good reason--except in Texas, I   gather, which has excess capacity  And coal is at capacity  I mean by that not only coal mines   but coal miners and coal transportation  The chairman of our board runs a large electric utility    He says that typically they try to burn coal at night to save natural gas, which is much more   expensive, in running the turbines  But coal is in such short supply that they’re even burning   natural gas at night  There is no available rail capacity to ship more coal from Wyoming to the   Midwest at the moment; it’s running just flat out  So there’s going to be a lot more investment   over time in that area and probably less investment in some of the high-tech areas  The change in   the mix and the fact that there is a depression, if you will, in the high-tech area is not something   that monetary policy can do anything about  That’s a real adjustment that is going to have to take   place over time  And if we press hard because of all the stories about the Dells and Compaqs and   the dot-coms that are suffering hard times, at the end of the day we’re not going to get more   output out of those firms   I think that’s all I want to say at this point  My view is that we’ve got to be careful that   the monetary stimulus doesn’t spill over into prices  Several others have commented to that effect     5/15/01     52   already and I think that’s a critical issue  If that should happen, our situation is going to be much   more complicated a year or two out  Thank you     Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation  I’d like to amplify a   couple aspects of my position  With regard to the April 18th rate cut, about which I expressed   reservations, I haven’t changed my view on that  But that rate cut is a fact  To me that   Committee action indicated several things  First of all, it suggested a great sense of urgency  The   press statement released at the time of that action indicated a great deal of concern over weak   investment  In my view it was practically an announcement of another 50 basis point cut at this   meeting  That’s the way the market interpreted it; the fed funds market quickly bid in a high   probability of another 50 basis points at this meeting  Since April 18th, we have seen a very weak   employment report, industrial production is down, and we’ve heard lots of news about weak   investment and layoffs  I think we have to do 50 basis points today because it reflects what we   said we were going to do and it would make no sense to surprise the markets in one direction on   April 18th and surprise them in the other direction on May 15th  So in my view it’s critical that we   do 50 basis points today  When the time comes to move the funds rate up, it’s not going to make   any difference whether we start from a rate of 4 percent or 4-1/4 percent; we’re going to face   essentially the same kinds of issues  But to be consistent I think we do need to cut the rate 50   basis points today, and I feel very strongly about that   In terms of the future, I would say a couple of things  First of all, when we developed   the balance of risk language, we tried to make it a statement about the outlook for the economy   and not about the outlook for policy  We might want to remind people of that  And we might   want to remind them that, given the lags in policy, we might still see some economic weakness     5/15/01     88   ahead but they should not necessarily interpret that to mean that it would call for additional policy   easing  Secondly, I would like to put the outlook for rates in the coming months this way  I don’t   know for sure whether further rate cuts are required  I think the probabilities are more or less   even that the next rate change is going to be up as down  We’re in a very uncertain situation, and   I believe it would be a mistake to say that we know for sure that our easing process has come to   an end  After all, we gave lots of reasons why the outlook could be weaker than what is now our   best guess  So I don’t think we should say that the easing process is necessarily at an end  In my   view we should say that we now believe there is more or less an equal probability that the next   rate change will be up as down because we don’t know how the future is going to develop  That   would be my take on the sense that we should try to impart to the marketplace because something   could come along very quickly and wipe away any suggestion that this process is at an end    Things could happen abroad or wherever  Thank you    On page 4, in the panel showing the VIX index, as I understand it   there’s some seasonality in that index--or at least I heard some market commentary to that effect    Do you have any idea what is normal for the summer?  It’s usually lower in the summer, as I   understand it Secondly, is that just a 30-day volatility?  If so, it doesn’t look very far into the   future        6/26-27/01 6    Yes, I understood that was the reason you put it in there  But my   question had to do with its normal seasonal pattern So before we reach a conclusion about what   that index suggests, I think we better know what the usual seasonality is  I don’t know the   answer to that    I don’t know one way or the other either  Okay, thank you    In thinking about Jeff Fuhrer’s chart with the highly variable structural   productivity, I believe we can make good sense of that if we go back to the growth accounting   equation on Chart 2 In my view the problem here is that we have tended to proceed by thinking   about a potential GDP track, which involves labor force growth--taking account of the   demographics--and some structural labor productivity trend  We then add the two together  But   that can’t really be divorced from the investment outlook, which is the point of the growth   accounting equation That equation says that productivity, looking at the decomposition of the   growth of output, is tied intimately to the investment outlook  That is even more true today than   it was in the past because of the relatively short duration of so much of the new capital  So our   idea of potential, which comes from adding together trends divorced from the investment   outlook, is really misleading  To me that is the point of emphasizing this concept, and I think   that point is absolutely right  Now, we may not like attaching the word “structural” to it because     6/26-27/01 31   it seems to change too fast, but linking it to the investment outlook I think is absolutely correct    So what that says about the amount of output that the economy can produce, which is obviously   relevant for monetary policy--and about the amount of inflationary pressure that might result   given the policy that we follow--is that it really is tied very closely to the investment outlook       As for the multifactor productivity, that’s not just information or the accumulation of   knowledge It also includes the effects of regulatory change that may damage productivity, such   as laws that affect the entrepreneurial environment  All sorts of public policies are going to show   up in multifactor productivity, which certainly can be negative  I’m sure many of us believe, for   example, that at times lawyers have damaged the productivity of the society    One of the issues for those who try to study productivity on a sector-by­  sector basis lies in the difficulties of identifying inputs and outputs sector by sector  I think   Denison’s position was that one has to go to an aggregate level rather than to try to specify   productivity sector by sector; the latter ends up being a losing game because of the difficulties of   relating one sector to another    What I’m getting at is the problem of taking aggregate productivity and   assigning it to sectors For example, Bob Gordon has argued that it is very difficult to sort out   the productivity of the airlines from that of the aircraft manufacturers because changes in the   quality of the aircraft affect both Trying to distinguish how much of that is aircraft--     Right, it’s telling us that the measures of outputs and inputs are strange    Well, let me make one other point  I think that perhaps what we need   from this analysis is a sense of the standard errors in this process  How much uncertainty do we   face?  Is there some kind of trend or standard investment outlook that would help us to separate   out this uncertainty about the capital accumulation?  Then the question would be Given some   standardized investment outlook, what is the standard error for the labor productivity?  What is   the range of uncertainty? I want to ensure that we’re not confounding our uncertainty about the     6/26-27/01 33   capital accumulation process with the uncertainty about the output that comes from a given   amount of capital    I have no idea No doubt that is a very difficult thing to do, but I'm   trying to distinguish the separate aspects of this problem    I have a question that’s relevant to the measurement of output and   capital I’ve seen a lot of stories about companies that invested in equipment--last year, let’s say-­  that didn’t work out and they are writing that equipment off at ten cents on the dollar or   something like that this year  The equipment is included in last year’s output at 100 cents on the   dollar because that’s when it was produced  What happens to it this year when it gets written   off?  How is it treated in the capital stock figures?  And how does it affect the national output   figures this year?    But the way it is treated in the capital stock data that you use is that it   would be accumulated--sort of a perpetual inventory but depreciated at whatever is the normal   depreciation rate    But I gather that the reason for the sharp drop in productivity this year   might have to do in part with the fact that companies are writing off capital--at least some of this   capital is equipment--faster than the depreciation assumptions you have built in  So there’s   capital in your capital stock figures that companies in fact aren’t using  Is that right?    So that will show up as reduced productivity from capital    Well, it depends on the nature of the capital  Those companies might   be getting a yield on it that’s worth 10 cents on the dollar, but it’s being carried as if it’s worth a   lot more than 10 cents on the dollar in the capital stock data that the staff is using       But the point of the question is that some of what we called output last   year-- and it entered our data as 100 cents on the dollar--in fact hasn’t turned out to be useful   because it is being written off this year to 10 cents on the dollar  So in truth we produced less last   year than we thought because part of what we produced turned out to be junk    Or waste or something  That’s my point  Some of this huge spike in   measured productivity is perhaps a consequence of overstating output last year, but some of that   is showing up this year That’s the way the data system works  Is that right?    No, that’s right But what I’m focusing on is trying to understand the   most recent data and how that bears on our outlook right now  That’s what I was getting at with   my question    Or it’s 10 cents on the dollar, right    Right     6/26-27/01 50    Thank you, Mr Chairman  My conversations with officials at FedEx   and UPS lead me to describe the situation as being essentially unchanged since the last time I   talked with them  My FedEx contact said that the firm’s customers are expecting flat volume for   the next three to four months; FedEx sees business as essentially stabilized at the current level    The firm’s express volume is down about 7 percent year over year, but ground volume is up by   about the same amount That’s essentially the same kind of picture my contact described six or   eight weeks ago International volume is still showing positive growth of 2 to 3 percent year    FedEx business in Europe is doing well while that in Asia is weak   On the labor market, FedEx is not planning layoffs but has built into its plan an   assumption of attrition, not replacing all the workers who leave  But FedEx is finding that   turnover is unusually low for the professional ranks of the firm; it’s typically 5 to 6 percent and is   now about half of that, according to my contact  That suggests that people are developing some   concerns about their ability to find new employment should they leave their jobs  Blue-collar   turnover is also down FedEx reports no difficulty in hiring new people to fill positions when   that is necessary As with other contacts, FedEx is concerned about health-care costs  Those   costs are back to double-digit rates of increase and that's a noticeable problem for them   The tone of the story from UPS was a little more pessimistic but roughly the same as   the situation at FedEx UPS is reducing its capacity somewhat by taking some smaller aircraft     6/26-27/01 109   out of service and also putting some ground delivery trucks into storage  UPS reports that   volume in Europe is holding up fairly well and volume in Asia continues to be weak, which   echoes the FedEx picture UPS continues to manage its domestic business quite tightly--holding   the line on hiring, using the phone instead of traveling, and that kind of thing   My contact at Wal-Mart said that the company had seen some slight signs of weaker   demand  I thought the firm’s analysis of recent developments was rather interesting  Wal-Mart   has a mid-month and a month-end cycle to their business  The month-end cycle is tied to transfer   payments that are paid out on a month-end basis  That cycle seems to be a little weaker but a   normal pattern continues at mid-month, which typically is the regular paycheck cycle  Wal-Mart   has noted a shift in demand toward lower priced merchandise in any given line  In apparel--a line   of shirts, let's say--the opening price point, or the lowest priced item in the line, has stronger   demand than the higher priced items  The situation is quite atypical  No one there can remember   such a large shift of this type under conditions of the sort that we have  Customer traffic is flat to   slightly higher and there is a healthy mix between the total traffic and the average size of a sales   ticket That is, people are continuing to spend about as much as they had before, despite this   apparent shift toward lower priced items   My contact was questioning me on what I might know about the likely effects of the   tax rebates I could only talk at a rather abstract level but I did refer him to the 1975 experience,   which his people are going to be looking at carefully  Wal-Mart’s inventories are on the lean side   and one of the things they’re concerned about is that if a noticeable pickup in consumer demand   materializes as a consequence of the tax rebates, their stores are going to be out of stock on some   items  So they are debating about whether to step up their orders  My contact said that the retail   sector in general is fairly lean on inventories; it's also true of their competitors  He made a big     6/26-27/01 110   point about medical costs  In his words they are “going through the roof,” up 15 to 20 percent   this year The company had expected increases more in the neighborhood of 7 percent but now is   expecting the situation to be worse next year My contact said he is not seeing price pressures   from vendors, but he noted what he called a “latent desire” by vendors to raise prices  That is,   vendors don't have room to do it now, but with a pickup in demand they would want to put some   price increases through Everyone is faced with cost pressures that they are trying to deal with   Let me offer a few comments on our current situation  I think the economic situation   we face has many unique characteristics  It is decidedly atypical of US business cycle   experience That means that we don't have a lot of the typical patterns that help inform our   judgments about it  The downturn has been concentrated to an unusual extent in a particular   sector of the economy, manufacturing  I believe that real adjustments are necessary in that area   and they are being made  Obviously, a contraction is taking place in the dot-com and telecom   industries, and that contraction is going to continue no matter what happens to monetary policy    Expectations by those industries were too buoyant a year ago  Those expectations have not been   met and are not going to be met within the next few years  So those firms are going to have to   contract and they are contracting   On a more general basis, I think earnings expectations and the stock market have been   too high The notion that earnings can grow at 12 to 15 percent for an extended period of time   when the national economy, at reasonably stable inflation, is going to be growing at 6 or 7   percent, doesn't add up  It doesn't fit  So those earnings expectations are going to have to adjust   over time  I'm talking not just about the current year and next year, but about the longer-run   earnings expectations Probably some adjustment is going to have to take place in price-earnings   ratios; by conventional measures the stock market is still generously priced  I call that a real     6/26-27/01 111   adjustment because it reflects attitudes toward the future  It's not fundamentally a nominal   phenomenon but relates to attitudes about risks and the likely course of earnings  In my view we   probably are going to see a continuing adjustment bringing price-earnings ratios more in line with   historical experience That doesn't mean that P/E ratios will go back to historical averages but   rather that they will be more in tune with past experience   The staff and private sector forecasts of where the economy is going are broadly in   agreement  Those point estimates make perfect sense to me  There is no guarantee, of course,   that we're going to get exactly that outcome, and we have to be aware of the potential risks on   both sides   Housing continues to do well, as many people have commented  I think that's   important, not just because housing investment involves a significant number of dollars but   because it is perhaps the best single measure of confidence among those in the household sector    People don't commit themselves to large mortgages--very big financial commitments over a long   period of time--if they don't have a significant amount of confidence in the future  I put a lot   more weight on the actual performance of the housing market than I do the survey data on   consumer confidence   The monetary policy background, I think, has been very expansionary  Money growth,   no matter how measured, has been high for some time--and we’re not talking about a matter of a   few weeks or a few tenths of a percentage point  We don't have to quibble about exactly what it   is The staff documents, of course, report M2  I like to add MZM to the mix of money measures;   it is the definition that I think most closely corresponds to the Friedman-Schwartz M2 definition   that produces a continuous series back to the time of the Civil War  MZM has grown 15 percent   in the last year; it has grown in excess of 20 percent at an annual rate in the last six months  We     6/26-27/01 112   are creating or permitting to be created a very large amount of liquidity  The largest mistakes in   US monetary policy history have come, I think, from ignoring money growth, and I believe it   would be unfortunate in the extreme if we, too, made that mistake   As for other measures, certainly credit markets are accommodative  The amount of   funds being raised is ample, and firms that are reasonably creditworthy have no difficulty   borrowing through intermediaries or directly in the markets  The real federal funds rate is on the   low side of estimates of the equilibrium rate  Any way you cut it, it seems to me there is no   question that monetary policy is in a very expansionary mode  A number of people have   commented about the lags in the process A lot of the monetary policy ease has come relatively   recently  We would not expect to see it show up in real activity right away   I think the inflation risks are rising  I note that we have been counting on declining   energy prices One of the things I asked my staff to do was to look at what has happened to crude   oil futures for the December 2001 and the December 2002 contracts  From them we see that the   date when energy price declines will take place keeps getting pushed into the future  I have a   chart that goes back to the beginning of 1998, when the December 2001 and the December 2002   crude futures contracts were both trading at about $19 a barrel  Over the course of 1998 they   went down a little but they have been increasing steadily since then and actually increased a good   bit over the last year So in terms of where oil prices are going over the next couple of years,   what looked like a fairly quick return to a per barrel price in the low $20s is now more likely to   be in the neighborhood of the mid-$20s  I think we are in danger of building in some more-or­  less permanent increases in oil prices, and in my view we should not just take that out of our   price indexes and ignore the fact that it's there     6/26-27/01 113   How the economy is going to evolve in coming months is obviously going to depend   on how markets respond to the outcome of this meeting  I think it's interesting to note that the   ten-year bond rate today is about the same as it was in December of last year  I don't know of   any period in which the federal funds rate has changed by such a large amount and there is   nothing to show, really, in the longer rates  This is a very unusual circumstance  Clearly the   impetus of monetary policy into investment spending is going to work at least in part through the   behavior of long-term rates of interest  And if monetary policy is in fact not pressing those long-  term rates of interest down, we're not going to see a quick response in longer-lived kinds of   investments  Investment spending is not going to respond to what we do   I think we've gotten ourselves into something of a bind in terms of the market’s   expectations of where we are going  In my view the language in our balance of risks statement   has turned out to be a forecast of what we’re going to do at our next meeting  I think the market   reads it that way If we look at the history since we’ve used that language, it has in fact been a   perfect or almost perfect forecast of our action at the next meeting  To me, that’s clearly the way   the market interprets it  Unfortunately I think we have a problem because if we say the risks are   weighted toward economic weakness, the market is going to take that as a forecast of more ease   to come  If we choose a neutral balance of risks statement, though, I'm concerned that the market   would take that as a forecast of nothing more to come  To me that would also be very   unfortunate because whether there is more ease to come or whether we will start to move in the   other direction is going to be driven very importantly by the information we get in the coming   weeks and months So I hope that somehow we can get across the idea that the current situation   is not typical but has a lot of very unusual aspects  This is a rather unique situation and we are   not frozen into a course of continuing to lower rates, which would be my biggest fear  Given my     6/26-27/01 114   interpretation of how the market is reading that language, I would consider it very undesirable to   have a balance of risks statement weighted toward economic weakness  I think that’s just a   signal to the markets that there are several more steps of ease to come no matter what we do with   the funds rate today That would open us up to a difficult situation if it turns out that we feel   compelled to reverse direction as the data come in  So I hope we can give the markets the   impression that our best guess is that we are now finished easing, but that we are very open to   responding to incoming information that might require rates to be either higher or lower in the   future I think we need to convey that there is no conviction on our part as to the direction in   which we will move the funds rate in coming meetings  Thank you    Mr Chairman, I do not support the recommendation because I believe   that the balance of risks statement will be read by the market as a forecast of more ease to come    As I read the balance of risks language, I think it is correct that over the next month or two the   balance of risks is genuinely weighted toward economic weakness and higher unemployment    But the relevant policy horizon is more 6 to 12 months out and over that horizon I believe that the   risks are truly evenly balanced In my view that's the right sort of policy horizon  If the   incoming data are weak, and that's not my forecast but I certainly don't rule it out--none of us can   rule that out--I think there's ample room for the markets to bring long-term rates down  As I   noted, those rates have not come down since December  Looking at long-term rates, if it appears   that the economy is much weaker than we now see, long-term rates easily would have room to   come down 100 or 150 basis points with the funds rate where it is  I'm concerned that we are   building in a problem for the future by indicating to the markets, in accordance with my view of   how the market will read our press statement, that there is more ease to come  This is an   empirical judgment  It's not a matter of logic  It's my judgment or forecast of how the market is   going to react to the statement  I suspect that the market will have another 25 basis point decline   bid into the September futures, and that's a testable proposition  In fact we're going to test it very   soon, I suspect   On the issue of inflation expectations, I think it is important to understand--it's very   fortunate, of course--that inflation expectations are holding steady  That's a vote of confidence in   the Committee  It is not a reading on whether we have policy tuned correctly  It's a vote of   confidence that we will do what is necessary to create that outcome--stable inflation--in the   future And I’m concerned, taking account of the lags that are inherent in these monetary   processes, that policy is on an excessively expansionary course     6/26-27/01 149    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I'm going to offer a few bits of anecdotal   information that complement things that have already been said, but I will try not to duplicate   what is already on the table My UPS and FedEx contacts both reported that much of the world   is not doing very well, though they were both fairly optimistic about Europe  My UPS contact   said that from January to June UPS business in Europe had grown at double-digit rates  Growth   was slowing down a bit now, but they still expect it to be positive  My FedEx contact reported   that Europe was the one area where growth continued; he also reported double-digit growth in   exports out of Europe and business within Europe  And he was very optimistic that growth in   FedEx business was going to continue at an 8 to 10 percent rate in Europe  Both companies are   trimming capital spending somewhat  My UPS contact said that major cutbacks are taking place   in the airline industry in general and that cargo segments were being cut  From Taiwan to the   United States and from Japan to the United States, capacity is being cut  Both companies   reported a significant amount of substitution away from the premium express business into the   more standard shipping business, which would be consistent with efforts all around to   economize   My contact at Wal-Mart said that his company’s preliminary experience with the tax     8/21/01 49   rebates was that about 25 to 30 percent of the checks cashed at Wal-Mart--Wal-Mart is cashing   those checks at no charge--are being spent on the spot at the stores He also noted that Wal-Mart   finds labor market conditions still tight for sales associates  Obviously, that is a minimum wage   or slightly above minimal wage position, and apparently the easing of the labor market in the   higher paid occupations is not showing up at all in the market for sales associates  He said it's   just as difficult as it was a year ago to hire people  Retention is up, but they still have problems   filling vacant positions  I thought that was rather interesting  He also emphasized the pressure   that Wal-Mart sees from health-care costs; those costs are going to be up 20 to 22 percent this   year and the increase may be worse next year  He noted that one development in that area is the   spread of legislative restrictions that make it more and more difficult for firms to apply   restrictions on pre-existing conditions  So the companies that have relatively generous health-  care benefits are finding what I guess might be called “adverse selection” against them  People   who know they have pre-existing conditions will try to gain employment in those firms   On a more general note, for me the issue today is not whether substantial monetary   stimulus is in place  I'm convinced that it is  The question is not whether that stimulus is going   to have an effect, but when I think it's a timing issue  I've been interested in the fact that   longer-term interest rates have not come down, or have come down only in the last week or two    The ten-year rate is still essentially where it was in December  It’s very easy, using the ten-year   strips, to decompose that rate into various maturities  So I put together a table showing the 0 to   2-year part of it, the 2- to 5-year forward rate, and the 5- to 10-year forward rate  Let me just   read you a few numbers  In August of last year, the 5- to 10-year forward rate extracted from the   strips was 56 percent At the end of December, it was 56 percent  As of Friday, it was 60   percent The 5- to 10-year maturity has been hanging up there fairly high  What has happened is     8/21/01 50   that the decline we’ve seen in the 10-year rate is due almost entirely to declines in the 0 to 2-year   part and maybe somewhat to declines in the 2- to 5-year part   Now, what does one make of a situation where the 5- to 10-year forward rate is   unaffected by all that has gone on in the last year? Incidentally, before I try to speak to that   question, let me say that a lot of our ideas about the lags come from experiences where the   longer rates do follow the short rates to a very significant extent  Looking at the historical data,   over a six-month period every percentage point drop in the federal funds rate generally will be   accompanied by a drop in the 10-year rate of about 30 or 35 basis points; that's the average   experience So one of the reasons why we’re perhaps not seeing as much result as we might   expect is that a lot of the effect typically is coming out of housing  Housing remains on a high   plateau and mortgage interest rates really haven't come down since December  There was a   substantial decline last year but not much this year   I interpret the maintained level of the 5- to 10-year forward rate--whether it's high or   not is a different matter--as reflecting a market conviction that the longer-run growth potential   for the economy has not been affected by the events of the last year  The market view is that we   are going through a period of adjustment And after all, this is a position that many people   around this table have stated We have helped to reinforce that conviction  Whether it's right or   not, we don't really know But I think there are lots of reasons to be optimistic about that   If that view is correct, I think it's logical to expect that the demand for the   technological equipment that is necessary for achieving productivity gains is going to have to   resume  That demand is going to resume because otherwise we’re not going to get the   productivity that is implied by this outlook for the economy  There was over-expansion in that   industry and there are some backlogs to be worked off  But most of that equipment has a rather        8/21/01 51   short useful life A normal depreciation period for a PC is three years or something like that  So   the backlog is going to be worked off and that demand will be coming back    Suppose that view--our outlook and my interpretation of the market’s outlook and why   the 5- to 10-year forward rate remains as high as it is--is not correct and potential growth in fact   goes back more toward the dreary levels that we had from, say, 1972 to 1995  If that happens,   then we’re going to end up with a lot more inflationary pressure than we currently anticipate    The reason is that we’re not going to be getting the productivity growth and there’s a lot of   inertia in compensation and wage processes   I just offer those ideas But I will emphasize that the recent behavior of the long end   of the market relative to the short end is a very, very unusual experience  If you look at the data   from the Korean War on--just put some columns on a spread sheet--you will convince yourself   that this is a very, very unusual period  Thank you    Mr Chairman, I can support your recommendation    I’d like to move the ratification of the operations  But I would   also suggest that the Committee add to that a sense of gratitude to those at the Desk for   the way they handled such a very, very complicated and difficult situation  And, of     10/2/01 8   course, the Desk itself was working in difficult circumstances with the relocation of its   offices and all the upset that involved So I think it was a fantastic performance and I   believe the Committee should reflect that view in its vote to ratify the Desk operations    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Let me talk first about conditions as   described to me by my various contacts  Because of the obvious importance of consumer     10/2/01 37   confidence, I’ve had four conversations with my contact at Wal-Mart since September   11th --on the 14th, 17th, 19th, and again yesterday  His overall assessment is that sales are   holding up pretty well On the Tuesday of the terrorist attacks, of course, sales at Wal-  Mart were down sharply, but for the week as a whole they were just slightly below plan    As I talked with my source several more times, that was the basic message--that sales   were fairly close to what had been anticipated before the day of the attacks  Some   changes in buying patterns have emerged that he doesn’t know completely how to   explain Wal-Mart tracks the number of sales tickets and the average amount spent per   sales ticket on a same-store basis to analyze data at comparable stores  He is seeing more   of a split between the volume of traffic and that of tickets than usual; that is, there’s a   greater increase in the number of tickets and less growth in the amount spent per ticket    But as of yesterday, the total amount spent was coming in just slightly below what Wal-  Mart had anticipated before September 11th   My contact also said that the company has done a little research with some   focus groups regarding Christmas spending plans  Of the consumer groups they’ve   talked with, the percentage of respondents who say they’re going to spend less for   Christmas is about the same as the typical response in their focus groups at this time of   year The percentage saying that they will be spending more, however, is down   significantly The proportion planning to spend about the same is therefore up   significantly He said--and I pressed him somewhat on this--that he felt it was much too   early to make any judgment about the longer-run outlook  People are still very much in   shock in terms of adjusting to the event  In his view, drawing any conclusions is almost   certainly premature at this point     My contacts in the air cargo business, at both UPS and FedEx, say that their   companies are maintaining their normal schedules They have not cut back at all as yet   Volume is running somewhat below where it had been, but not dramatically so overall    However, the express business has been hard hit  The ground business and what they call   the freight business--which is less than truckload quantities--is running about flat over   last year    emphasized that the outlook for domestic passenger airlines   is truly dire He said that as a consequence of the very stiff labor contracts that were   settled in stages over last year and this year before September, labor costs have increased   very significantly would be the first of the airlines to fail  From   looking at the financial reports, that airline already has negative net worth for the   shareholders on its books And, of course, they’re all in junk bond status                      At current   traffic levels all of them are literally within a few weeks of running out of cash and   having to close down So, the situation is very dire for the passenger airlines  And, of   course, we heard this morning that Swiss Air has declared bankruptcy   I also made a new contact with a person at a trucking firm called JB Hunt,   which is headquartered in Arkansas and is one of the largest trucking companies in the   United States Hunt’s business is very much at normal levels, with volume generally   what they had expected But the company is greatly concerned about the future,   particularly the early part of next year  For the most part, buying plans for the fall are   already completed, so the inventories are moving to the stores  But there’s a very large   amount of uncertainty about what will happen early next year   10/2/01 38     10/2/01 39   Let me divide my comments on the total economy into two parts  First, I think   it’s fair to say that very little is known at the professional level about the sentiment   question I think back to my readings of the journal literature over a long period of   studying macroeconomics and I don’t remember ever seeing articles about consumer   sentiment except in conjunction with the sentiment surveys  There’s practically no   analysis of sentiment at a professional level  I think we can say, though, that we have   some basis for understanding the economic aspects of the current situation  It seems to   me important to focus on the fact that some major fundamental strengths were in place at   the time of the attacks  We had an environment of low inflation and very low expected   inflation Oil prices had been moving lower and, of course, have come down further   since the attacks and that is an element of strength  We go into this situation with strong   bank capital, unlike the situation in 1990-91 when bank capital was weak  Banks can   make loans  And, of course, low short-term rates increase the margin for banks to   compensate for the greater risk in this environment  We have a federal budget surplus,   which means that the budget is not as big an issue as it might have been a dozen years   ago in terms of the nature of a federal response  We had a very large amount of monetary   stimulus already in place as of September 11th Our economy operates with very flexible   markets  We have a resilient people We have a very strong set of fundamentals  The   issue, I think, is how long it’s going to take for businesses and consumers to get over it,   so to speak, and to adjust to this circumstance  And we have very, very little by way of   knowing the answer to that   From looking at the effects on the stock market of past shock events--and I   went back and examined as many as I could think of--the longest period of recovery from     10/2/01 40   a shock was after the stock market crash in 1987  It took quite a while for the market to   get back to where it had been  After the invasion of Kuwait, the market was depressed   until Desert Storm and that event tended to resolve that issue  In the current situation, we   are likely to see more shocks to come  Almost certainly there are going to be some   terrorist events abroad Let’s pray that no more come to our own land  But more shocks   lie ahead that will possibly upset confidence     I’m going to delay talking about our policy situation, but I think the issue there   is that we need to focus much, much more than we usually do on the confidence issue    We need to focus on what we can do to help support confidence and stability rather than   just on the setting of the federal funds rate itself    Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation, but I would like   to add a comment  We’ve talked a lot about business and consumer confidence, and I   think the state of confidence is not independent of our own visibility  Let me emphasize   that point by assuming something contrary to fact because I think it will make the point   clear Suppose all of us who are commonly out on the road from time to time giving   speeches and talking to the press were to withdraw from that activity?  I think that would   send a very bad message to the markets  It would say that we’re terrified to fly and that   we’re terrified to talk because we might say something that would upset the markets  I   think it’s important that we be visible  We should work to resume a sense of normality    And the message that we all agree on around the table is the one that we should be stating   publicly The economy has excellent long-run prospects; our economy and society have   strong fundamentals to deal with the short-run uncertainties, but there is no way to   forecast what that short run is going to look like and, therefore, we’re not going to offer   such a forecast For us to hunker down and disappear because we’re afraid of saying   something that might be wrong or misinterpreted is only going to tend to erode public   confidence    Right, but we’re now three weeks beyond that shock    Well, I just wanted to make that point clear because I feel very   strongly that we must not disappear    In looking at a whole range of spreads--on-the-run, off-the run, bid-ask   spreads, and risk spreads on different kinds of paper--could you characterize the state of the markets   in recent days, relative to, let’s say, just before the terrorist attacks?    Right But the spreads that would indicate how the market itself is   functioning, such as bid-ask spreads, are back pretty much to where they were?    Okay     11/6/01 9    I have a question about the interpretation of interest rate developments  In   the pre-FOMC briefing you mentioned the common view in the marketplace that the budget deficit   had something to do with the behavior of longer-term interest rates  It wasn’t clear what your own   view on that was I was interested in Chart 1 in yesterday’s Board briefing where you plotted the   implied one-year forward rates, which currently are not that different five years out from those that   prevailed on January 2nd, let’s say I would have expected the budget argument to make a big   difference--to see more effect on interest rates, say, five years out and beyond the current cyclical   situation Yet those curves are not that dissimilar  In fact, the longer end is actually lower now,   which is not consistent with the argument involving the erosion of the budget surplus  Would you   offer your own view on that?        11/6/01 26    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I want to comment on a few of the highlights   from conversations I’ve had with business contacts  The extent of the weakness in the US   economy and its impact on Asia I think was well illustrated by my UPS contact who said that his   firm’s volume outbound from Asia has been running only one-half of what UPS had anticipated  Of   course, that’s because expectations were for a lot of high-tech equipment to be shipped here and that     11/6/01 50   has not happened The UPS outlook is that next year will be better than this year and they are   anticipating about a 2-1/2 percent growth in volume  Volume this year is running about 10 percent   below last year UPS, along with many others, is cutting capital spending  The firm expects to   reduce capital expenditures by $500 million out of a budget that would otherwise have been $2-1/2   billion, so the cutback is about 20 percent              My FedEx contact said that in his discussions with customers their belief is that business   is going to be flat to the end of this year and on into 2002  FedEx sees flatness but not substantial   weakness from here  The firm finds that since the end of September volume has been very steady   and predictable, though obviously not strong   My contact at JB Hunt, which is a very large trucking firm, says that customers are rather   pessimistic  Business this October was about flat compared with last October; the company had   anticipated growth of 10 to 15 percent  The market for used large trucks has collapsed  My contact   described it as a disaster and he is expecting a lot of bankruptcies in the trucking industry     I would like to finish on a slightly positive note in terms of reports from my contacts, so I   will mention that Wal-Mart, as others have noted, is doing rather well  Wal-Mart sales for the five   weeks ended October 5th, which includes the immediate and subsequent post-attack period, were up   63 percent The company’s expectation had been 4 to 6 percent, so total sales over that period were   actually a bit stronger than had been anticipated  Moreover, Wal-Mart is not cutting its capital   expenditure plans at all and in fact has revised up slightly its forecast for next year from the   expectations held before September 11th   I want to make a comment on fiscal policy  The temporary investment incentives that are   being discussed are really very treacherous Policy actions are being considered and yet the best   experts in the world don’t know how to forecast what the outcome is going to be  That says to me     11/6/01 51   that it’s a very treacherous policy instrument  There is a lot of experience with temporary   investment credits of various sorts over the years and I think the experience is not very favorable    Sitting where we are today it might look as if an investment credit is going to be a positive for the   immediate future, but I think it’s going to involve a high probability of some greater difficulty later    If the economy were to rebound strongly, we would see great efforts to bring capital expenditures   forward into the temporary window  That would make the economy even stronger  Moreover, it   would raise a lot of problems in interpreting the incoming data and trying to anticipate how much   fundamental strength really exists in the economy  If the economy remains weaker than anticipated,   we’re going to see proposals to extend the temporary provision but we won’t know whether it will   be extended or not In my view, our history of temporary fiscal policy adjustments is not a good one   and I think they are going to cause trouble rather than provide any assistance to the economy  That’s   all I want to say at this point Thank you    Mr Chairman, I can support the recommendation, although I certainly   came into this meeting favoring a move of 25 basis points  The way I see the issue is as follows  As   you certainly have said on many occasions--and I have said the same thing--we believe that the US   economy has essentially undiminished long-run prospects  The question, I suppose, is when those   long-run prospects will materialize  If we believe that they are coming in 2008 or 2010, that’s a long   time away  It seems to me that the tenor of the views around this table is that we may have a very,   very difficult five years, and that the risks are decidedly on the downside for the reasons that people   have discussed I think our statements about the long-run prospects for our economy are part of the   reason why long-term rates have not gone down very much  In my view we have expressed a lot of   optimism about the outlook for the economy and I think those statements of optimism do not fully   reflect the beliefs that we heard around the table today in terms of, let’s say, the next three to five   years Would I bet my house on my own conviction on this score?  No Obviously, we’re going   through a very difficult period--one that has no clear analog in history, yet one where to date the   absolute level of decline in activity has been mild  But we apparently are projecting a considerable   risk of a steeper decline to come  So, if we really want the reduction in the funds rate to translate   into declines in longer-term interest rates, I think we need to change a bit the tone of what we say in   our statement and in our testimony and speeches  Presumably we do believe that the long-run   prospects for the economy are sound and essentially undiminished and we should say that  But we     11/6/01 85   also need to say something along the lines--I don’t know how to word this--that we have ahead of us,   in calendar quarters or maybe even years, a very significant risk that the economy could require a   period of prolonged and substantial monetary easing    I appreciate your comment on that  My belief--conviction would be too   strong a word here--is that we will go through an adjustment, which when we look back at this   period sometime in the future, will be regarded as a cyclical adjustment and not a change in the   secular outlook for the economy  I think we will be pulling out of this situation along the lines of the   Greenbook forecast I view that as a very good outlook  But if that is really what we have in front   of us, then it seems to me that we already have a very substantial amount of monetary ease in place    And to me the argument for 50 basis points today rather than 25 is not totally consistent with that   outlook That’s what concerns me about looking at it this way  I am also concerned that there is a     11/6/01 86   sense in which we have double-counted the recent bad news  After all, we have cut the funds rate   100 basis points since September 11th in anticipation of bad news, the weak economic data to come    And we got the bad numbers In part what we are saying today is that we are cutting the funds rate   again by 50 basis points now that we see the actuality of the weak data      I understand    At any rate, where I come out is that I’m concerned about doing 50 basis   points now and about the process that I think we are getting into  I'm not going to dissent; that’s not   my point I’m just indicating the reasons underlying my preference for 25 basis points  The   likelihood is that we will have more weak economic data ahead of us and I think the market will read   in another 50 basis points of ease at our next meeting  I’m not sure that that dynamic is really   helpful That’s essentially what I am saying    When I look at the details of the forecast, clearly the timing of the consumer   recovery is an important piece of this story  And I think your forecast has a significant increase in the   saving rate in the first quarter of next year and a continuing negative on consumer durables, which I   assume is a good part automobiles  Now, one of the things that struck me is that the nature of labor   contracts in the auto industry essentially has turned a lot of labor costs into fixed costs  I don’t quite   understand the past behavior of the industry, but one of the reasons why I suppose they were so   willing to introduce all these incentives was that they were stuck with those labor costs anyway, so   why not get something rather than nothing  Presumably that motivation would continue in the first   quarter and thereafter, so if the underlying demand is on the soft side we might see another round of   incentives of some sort  Does that argument make sense?  And if so, how much weight would you put   on it in terms of the shape of the durables part of the forecast?     I will try to fill in a few interstices of the discussion without repeating what   is already before us My Wal-Mart contact said a couple of things that I thought were very interesting   He said that when Wal-Mart compares prices of items being sold this holiday season that were also   sold last holiday season, the prices of these identical items are 16 percent lower this year  I think the   retail environment can only be described as brutally competitive  My contact also said that there is a   lot of evidence that consumers are very cautious  It looks as if people may be waiting even more than   usual to purchase items in the holiday shopping period this year  They may be planning to pile up   purchases at the end of the season or may just be waiting for lower prices  There is a higher   percentage of layaway purchases than usual That’s not a retail strategy that many of us around this   table use but some parts of the population do  There is also a continuing preference shift among     12/11/01 56    consumers away from premium products toward so-called value products, the lower priced items in a   line of merchandise  Inventories at Wal-Mart are in very good shape, right on track with where the   company wants them to be  My contact said that for the first time he’s finding that the softening in the   labor market has made it easier for Wal-Mart to hire sales associates  You may remember at earlier   meetings that I said Wal-Mart continued to find a lot of tightness in the labor market for that level of   skill   My FedEx contact said that absolutely nothing had changed in their situation since we   talked six weeks ago, except perhaps that heads are not hanging anymore  It looks as if things are just   settling down  His firm’s forecast for next year shows a flat first calendar quarter over the first quarter   of this year and they’re anticipating some improvement in the second quarter and beyond     I note that Jack is trying to horn in on my UPS monopoly here  [Laughter]    That’s okay  I’m from Chicago and I believe in competitive markets,    [laughter] including for information  The overall tone at UPS seemed to be a little more bullish than at   FedEx My contact said business has been fairly good and UPS is anticipating that volume in the   beginning of next year will be up by 22 percent--that is their business plan--compared to the first part   of 2001 This year’s volume is coming in about flat compared with last year     My contact at JB Hunt, a trucking company, says that business is particularly slow  His   firm sees no basis for optimism about the first quarter of next year   Let me make a couple of comments on the national economy  There has been a lot of   discussion about fiscal policy and I think it’s worth reflecting on the fact that the Greenbook really   can’t make any assumption other than that temporary is temporary and permanent is permanent  But I   think a better way to view fiscal policy right now is that fiscal policy is in play and is likely to be in     12/11/01 57    play for some time to come  When we think back to the early 1990s, a stimulus bill--I think it was   called an investment credit at the time--was under consideration at the beginning of the Clinton   Administration but was not enacted  Then there was a tax program that was enacted narrowly  After   that, fiscal policy was settled for quite a long time It began to be discussed again during the election   campaign last year  Now fiscal policy is in play, and I think we’re going to see continuing discussions   about adjustments  Fiscal policy is not going to be a source of stability in our outlook  We cannot   expect that everything will be resolved, however this stimulus bill comes out  That’s not going to be   the end of it, I think   It seems to me that we are in the neighborhood of a cycle trough  I don’t know exactly what   that means, but I’d say it means the trough will occur within the next few months  That’s consistent,   of course, with the Greenbook forecast     One other comment I’d make is that I think it’s clear that household behavior is not   characterized by expectations of ongoing deflation  People are responding to sales incentives as a   reason to buy rather than to project that better deals will be available in the future  Therefore, the sales   incentives are leading to additional sales now rather than the postponement of purchases with the   expectation of getting an even better deal by waiting another few months  So, that’s my take on the   current outlook    I have a different subject to raise    A very quick question On page 8 of the Bluebook there is a statement to the   effect that investors currently believe that our decision at this meeting will include a balance of risks   weighted toward weakness Is that conclusion from talking with people, from surveys, or is it   extracted from the fed funds futures market, or what?     12/11/01 76     Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation but I do want to express a   little uneasiness about the balance of risks statement  Let me explain I ask myself the question    What difference does that sentence make?  It’s clear that the downward move of 25 basis points is   built into the markets And in my view long-term rates are going to go wherever they go, but this is not   going to affect their direction in coming weeks  I think our task at this point is to start an orderly   process toward a changed policy stance  That is, we seem to be close to a turning point in the   economy  And what we would not want is a situation in which the market believes for some reason   that we are pretty committed to additional cuts in the future even though the data might start to come   in rather convincingly in the other direction  So that’s my concern about the balance of risks  In other     12/11/01 85    words, the message that I personally would like to send--to put some probabilities on it--is that there   may be a two-thirds chance that we will not change the funds rate at the next meeting and a one-third   chance, if the data continue to come in weak, that we will reduce rates another time  What I would not   like to do is to create an impression that we believe there’s a high probability that we will be cutting   rates again at the next meeting That’s my concern about the balance of risks statement    I would like to make a comment on this  I am, of course, very pleased to   hear that the prospects of intervention are very low  It does seem to me, though, that sometimes   conditions change and under the press of circumstances people do things that one wouldn’t have   anticipated  I think back particularly to the most dramatic example in my professional   experience, the oft-repeated statements of President Nixon and his people that wage and price        January 29-30, 2002 Page 7 of 194  controls were out of the question Then suddenly on August 15, 1971, we had wage and price   controls I would like to see us position ourselves so that in some future circumstance we might   not be able to imagine now it would take a special act of this Committee to authorize any such   intervention  I recommend that we provide for that in order to reduce the probability that we   would, in fact, find ourselves intervening in such a set of circumstances      I want to note first of all, without going into any detail about the lessons   we may or may not have learned from Japan, that the relevance of the Japanese experience for   so-called quantitative policy is clear because it hasn’t been tried  Japanese money growth, as I   understand it, never exceeded 4 percent in the past decade, and for most of the 1990s it was a   good bit less than 4 percent And in the 1980s it was more like 8 percent or close to it  So what   Japan did was to allow money growth to sag as the country went into a period of ongoing   recession and the Bank of Japan never attempted to use quantitative policy to get out  So we           January 29-30, 2002 Page 33 of 194  don’t know from the Japanese experience whether that is going to work or not  In fact, the   Japanese experience would be consistent with a traditional Chicago view, which says that the   economy can fall into a depression if money growth is allowed to be too low for too long     Now let me ask a question about the characteristics of the econometric model that we’ve   been talking about Imagine a simulation in which there is ongoing deflation—I’ll just pick a   number of 10 percent a year for the sake of argument here—and expectations have fully adjusted   and people are anticipating ongoing deflation of 10 percent  Now imagine another case of the   same sort with 5 percent deflation or 15 percent or 20 percent where expectations are fully   adjusted In the meantime, all government interest rates have settled at zero on all maturities  As   I understand it, the characteristics of the model are such that it will generate a higher amount of   unemployment the greater the rate of deflation, and monetary quantities don’t enter into this   calculation at all  So, that’s a characteristic of the model  And the simulations that we have   talked about that were in the paper you presented embody that characteristic where expectations   are consistent with the deflation that will be generated by the way the model works  But, of   course, that is an experience that we have not in fact had    Suppose you were to generate a simulation with a different assumption, such as that any   deflation that got under way would not last beyond five years and that after five years expected   inflation would be zero That would result in very different dynamics, I think, at least as it   applies to the behavior of long-term investment because it would mean that very long-term   interest rates would not in fact be driven high in real terms as a consequence of just a short   period of deflation So the issue has to do in part with the characteristics of the model and in part   with the assumptions under which the model is simulated to give these results  I see people   shaking their heads in agreement, so I guess I’m on the right track there  Now, you say that the           January 29-30, 2002 Page 34 of 194  model assumption is that quantities are not too important  That of course reflects the fact that if   you had a simulation with, say, 5 percent deflation a year for many years, it turns out with a fixed   monetary base, for example, to generate an enormous increase in the monetary base per capita    And you’re saying that it would not matter  Of course, this argument was explored quite   thoroughly back in the 1950s and 1960s with all the discussion about Keynesian unemployment   equilibrium and real balance effects  That was sort of the origin of Patinkin’s book, on which I   cut my teeth as a graduate student  Your model assumes that those quantitative effects can’t   work or are not operable I just want to be clear about the nature of the experiment that we’re   running Surely, in terms of US experience, you would not be able to estimate parameters   about the expectations process to distinguish between an assumption of continued deflation and   an assumption that, whatever might happen in the meantime, zero inflation is expected after five   years That’s not within the realm of experience  So you couldn’t really come up with any   estimates to distinguish one assumption versus the other assumption because it’s not in the data   set   Therefore, the characteristics in the model that you used, particularly this full rational   expectations equilibrium, are critical to the output that you get  I’d like to make just one other   comment about that, and I think Marvin was getting at this point  As a practical matter, if we   ever fell into an ongoing deflation—and certainly the US experience in the 1930s illustrates this   very well—all sorts of other things would happen in terms of the reaction of the government  If   we think about what has happened in Argentina, the way I read it is that essentially the   conversion of all dollar magnitudes to pesos destroys any possibility of a capital market in   dollars because any contract made in dollars can be undone by the government at any time    That’s the experience that country has just gone through  So interest rate policy is irrelevant as     January 29-30, 2002 Page 35 of 194  well because there is no security in contracts going forward  Anything can be undone at any   time  Consequently, Argentina is in a terrible mess because it has destroyed the possibility for a   normal functioning of its monetary economy with normally functioning credit markets    Exactly One has to be able to count on contracts being fulfilled on both   sides of the transaction, and that assurance is gone in Argentina  Now, as a practical matter, in   extreme circumstances something along those lines also would begin to happen in the United   States In fact, something of that sort did start to happen with cartelization in the 1930s, where   normal commercial activities found themselves being conducted under a new set of rules—rules   in which there was not very much confidence because they could be undone at almost any time    To me that’s the more important lesson of our experience as to what happens if a country ends up   in a period of depression—that a lot of the normal commercial activity begins to be questioned as   a consequence of other activities that might take place  The reason I want to emphasize that   point is that the characteristics of the model and the assumptions in the model are obviously   critical to the simulation exercises that were run  And given that I would put a lot more weight   on quantitative effects, if you will, that are not in the model at all, I regard the model as being of   limited—not zero, but limited— relevance on the issue of what the appropriate long-run inflation   target ought to be I’m not convinced, given the assumptions and the way in which the model is   simulated, that the results tell us very much about the question of what rate of inflation would be   most appropriate or most stable      I was raising questions more than making assertions    What happens to the inflation rate five years out?    May I ask one other question about investment behavior in the model   under these circumstances?  I remember, and you may, too, if you ever read the macro textbook   written by Martin Bailey of the University of Chicago—not the Martin N Baily who was   recently on the CEA—a very striking chapter in which he was trying to address this issue of   unemployment equilibrium in a Keynesian context  What he pointed out was that, if you have   investment projects, a finite amount of capital spending can produce returns into the indefinite   future The examples he used were land improvements  My favorite one, which always made   me smile, was leveling the Midwest  [Laughter] The Midwest is not perfectly level and in fact   there are drainage problems in all the agricultural areas in the Midwest  At any rate, Bailey had   these fun applications  In this case he said that you could strip off the topsoil, bring earth up   from the shallow parts of the Gulf of Mexico, use it to fill in various areas, and level the   Midwest Then, once you had created this level agricultural land at some finite cost—it would   be expensive but the cost would be finite—you would have an indefinite stream of higher   productivity from the improved land  And, as you push the interest rate down to zero, the value     January 29-30, 2002 Page 38 of 194  of that indefinite stream becomes as large as you’d like and covers any finite cost of doing the   project So he argued that the notion that the investment demand function hits the axis at a zero   rate of interest doesn’t make any sense  Critical to that argument, of course, is the existence of   property rights because the argument doesn’t work if in fact you can’t realize the returns—if they   are cut off as a consequence of seizures of land or whatever     Japan, of course, has not pushed long-term interest rates down to zero, which would be   within the realm of possibility for the central bank to do  Presumably the Bank of Japan could   push out the maturity structure  So one of the questions I would put to you is, What are the   characteristics of the investment demand function that you’ve been working with?  If we push   long-term interest rates down to zero, or as close to zero as we please, we can make those present   values for indefinite streams of income as large as we please  Now, of course, there’s the   question about risk premiums, or a lack of securities, and I understand that    Right—although let’s look at the Japanese case  Clearly, if Japan had   moved earlier and more aggressively to drive long-term government rates down to zero, that   would have produced, at least in the short run—because all those risk premiums were already   there—a decline of the private rates as well, presumably basis point for basis point        January 29-30, 2002 Page 39 of 194   Right    Given the legal opinion that’s on the table, it seems to me that the issue is   rather narrow First of all, we need to know whether minutes in two weeks, for example, would   satisfy the law  And if there’s a view that it wouldn’t, then we might as well take minutes in two   weeks off the table because that’s not going to do the job  Second, it seems to me that there are   two options here—we can wait until we get a FOIA request, or we can get ahead of the game and   do something before a request  I would favor the latter, getting ahead of the game  If we’re   going to get ahead of the game, there are two ways to do that  One is to announce in advance   this change in practice Another is to announce it at the time the first dissent comes along  I   would be in favor of the former way rather than waiting until there’s a dissent  Also, I think   there would be an advantage if we could close this issue at our next meeting  We could then say   that we discussed it along with the usual business conducted at the beginning of each year, which   includes the reviews of the authorizations and directives regarding Desk operations  We can   wrap this into the normal review of practices and procedures and have it look as routine as   possible and try to take some of the surprise out of it             January 29-30, 2002 Page 145 of 194   On this particular point, I heard some business contacts saying they were   delaying orders, waiting until they saw the shape of the legislation           January 29-30, 2002 Page 59 of 194   I have a couple of questions about the Greenbook projection  How much   of the decline in consumption for the current quarter is model-driven and how much of that is   judgmental, driven primarily I suppose by the assumption that the automobile surge in the fourth   quarter was borrowed from this year?    So it’s mostly judgmental?    What I’d like to press you on much more than that, though, has to do with   the inventory situation  It seems to me that the outline that you have for business fixed   investment and consumption makes a lot of sense, given what we know about those sectors  But              January 29-30, 2002 Page 61 of 194  during the near term, activity in those sectors is going to be driven a lot by what happens to   inventories  At least the way I read the situation, the liquidation of inventories in the four   quarters of last year was the largest for any four-quarter period since we’ve had quarterly data,   going back in its earliest days to about 1947  I’m using the Macroeconomic Advisers’   assumption for fourth-quarter inventory investment, a very big negative number  So we’ve had,   I think by any measure, a very large inventory liquidation  In the past when we’ve had   significant inventory liquidation, we’ve had some substantial accumulation—not just the swing   that occurs going from a big negative number to about zero  If consumption turns out to be   reasonably decent—and by that I don’t mean rapid growth but even just zero—it would seem to   me that the pattern in the Greenbook has a great deal of upside uncertainty or risk to it  I believe   your assumption is for a very gradual increase in inventory investment—small positive numbers   that are growing as we go into next year We could have a very significant upward surprise  I   just wanted you to comment on that calculation    Are both the inventory and the international figures based on two months   of data essentially?    So it’s all subject to possible revision    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I read the report from the First District as   being rather cautious or even downbeat I must say that the view from St Louis is a good bit   more optimistic  I tried to convince President Minehan to accept a bet yesterday on the Super   Bowl I offered her a case of Budweiser against a case of lobster, and she just wasn’t interested!    [Laughter]    I tried to smoke out her odds, so I suggested a case of Bud against a   lobster dinner, and she still wasn’t interested  Then I said “How about against a lobster claw?”    [Laughter]    Well, we’re a little more optimistic than that in St Louis      Well, let me comment on some of the reports from our District    Incidentally, Wal-Mart is headquartered in our District and is doing just fine, Mr Moskow    I talked to my contact at Wal-Mart on January 18  He said that December   sales at Wal-Mart came in substantially better than had been anticipated; sales at comparable   stores were up 82 percent over the prior year And at that point in January, sales were running   above plan, at better than 6 percent year over year  He indicated that they had become cautiously   optimistic  Before they had believed that the turnaround was going to occur in the third quarter,   and now they’re anticipating a noticeable turnaround in the second quarter  He noted that their   inventory situation is the best they’ve had in the last four years; it’s very low and exactly where   desired They are totally cleaned out of seasonal merchandise  But he went on to say that   actually in some respects they ended up with too little inventory  Ordinarily they rely on sales   after Christmas, but they didn’t have a lot of merchandise to put on sale because the inventory   had been pretty well cleared out He mentioned that Wal-Mart is ordering goods now,   particularly from Asian suppliers, for next fall but is ordering very cautiously, expecting things   to remain about the same  They don’t see themselves in a position yet to order aggressively  He   also noted, though, that there’s something of an inconsistency in the nature of the demands that   they see Discretionary items such as electronics—Cathy made a comment about that—sold very   well during the holiday season, and yet consumers continued to go for goods at the entry level   price across a wide range of products  So in apparel or electronics or any of a broad range of   goods, consumers are generally buying the lowest priced items in a particular line   My UPS contact spent quite a bit of time talking about the labor situation  The   company’s contract with the Teamsters expires in July, and they’ve already started negotiations   on a new contract That actually was reported in the newspapers just a day or two ago  Both   UPS and the Teamsters are well aware of the fact that the strike they had several years ago was   very disruptive and harmful to the company’s business  My contact said that they already are     January 29-30, 2002 Page 80 of 194  seeing some signs that their customers are making alternative arrangements for shipping  And,   of course, they are concerned about losing that business permanently if customers develop   relationships with other shippers  But he anticipates that they will be settling that labor contract   early and will get it out of the way He also commented that they view the outlook as fairly flat,   given that their customers are not showing a great deal of optimism  Inventories are very lean;   firms just don’t want to carry inventories  So, he was not terribly upbeat  On the other hand, my   contact at FedEx said that although they haven’t seen much sign of a pickup as yet, they are   expecting increased volumes  The customers that FedEx talks with are anticipating increased   shipping needs, particularly because of the need to rebuild inventories  Lastly, my contact at   JB Hunt, a trucking firm, noted that they don’t see business picking up as yet   Let me make a comment about the prospects going forward  I want to start with an   interpretation of what happened after September 11  My interpretation is that a lot of business   leaders were unnerved by those events and they went into something of a cash preservation   mode They laid off a lot of people; they cut orders; they did not make any commitments that   they didn’t feel they really needed to make  But consumption demand remained surprisingly   strong Though business people are still in a rather cautious mood, I think that, if we can get by   for a few more months, some of that caution is going to begin to turn  So, my instinct is that   sometime this year we’re going to see some inventory restocking that will be big enough to skew   the GDP numbers upward for a quarter or two But obviously a lot is going to depend on the   maintenance of consumption demand in order for that to work through  I don’t have any   particular disagreements with the Greenbook forecast except possibly on the inventory side,   which I talked about yesterday I think there is much more of an upside risk there than a   downside risk Thank you        January 29-30, 2002 Page 81 of 194   Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation on the funds rate  I would   have preferred a move to a balanced risks statement  Let me just comment briefly about our   situation looking ahead  Taking the Greenbook forecast as a baseline—and in my view it’s a   very reasonable baseline—I think our policy options this year are going to be relatively   straightforward if the outcome approximates that baseline  We’re going to keep the funds rate   about where it is or nudge it up along the way  The policy decisions will be relatively     January 29-30, 2002 Page 121 of 194  uncomplicated  A number of people have talked about the downside risks, and I attach positive   probabilities to all the risks that people have mentioned  If in fact the economy comes out   significantly on that negative side of the baseline, then I think our situation will be less   comfortable but actually still rather straightforward  The funds rate will either stay the same, or   we’ll be shading it down That’s about all we can do under those circumstances     I’d like to comment very briefly, though, on what would happen if the outcome were on   the high side of the Greenbook forecast There is a distribution around that outcome  I’d note,   of course, that the economy is very, very liquid  Money growth has been very high, and I think it   is not by any means beyond the realm of possibilities that we could see some quarters where real   GDP growth is in the 6 to 8 percent real growth range  That’s a fairly easy number to get to for a   couple of quarters if consumption demand remains around 4 percent, business investment tends   to level off, and we get an inventory surge If that happens, then the issue going forward is going   to be how sustained that growth is likely to be, and we’re going to have a much more difficult   job of managing expectations  I think what will happen under that set of circumstances is that, as   soon as we start to raise the funds rate, the market is going to project more funds rate increases to   come  As a consequence, it will be a tricky task to manage expectations correctly so that the   market doesn’t overshoot a sensible response  Thank you    I would suggest that we change “business spending” to “business fixed   investment” since we’ve agreed that the inventory part of spending might be dramatically in the   other direction    I have a question, and it’s purely a question  Given that there has been   some discussion about the condition of FNMA (Fannie Mae) and FMAC (Freddie Mac), would a   visible program to make possible investment in GNMA securities raise issues about why we are   not investing in those of Fannie and Freddie?  Would there be a possible adverse market reaction   as a consequence?  This is along the same lines as Al’s question  If we’re getting involved in   housing, why not invest in Fannies and Freddies?  I’m also thinking about the riskiness of Fannie   Mae and Freddie Mac—the very low capital ratios that those firms maintain    Yes, I think we were all in agreement that if we could sustain the current   procedure indefinitely, that would be great  It works fine But it’s not up to us to make that     March 19, 2002 Page 100 of 117  decision We are faced with a legal opinion here  And our small group was in agreement that it   would be very unfortunate if this issue were forced upon us by someone else putting a FOIA   request to us So to us, announcing the vote tally is almost a “no brainer”  We need to get out in   front and do this in the most satisfactory way  Staying with the current practice is just not an   option    I won’t get into that topic! The sense I have from our directors and also   from some commercial real estate folks who recently attended a luncheon at the Bank is that they   don’t see a strong surge in hand, but there is a tone of more optimism   My Wal-Mart contact says that it’s a little hard for the company to figure out what is   going on because they believe that they are taking market share, particularly with the K-Mart   bankruptcy and store closings Nevertheless, they are already in the process of revising up   earnings expectations In mid-February, just about a month ago, Wal-Mart announced to     March 19, 2002 Page 42 of 117  analysts that it had a higher expectation for earnings, and they are already revising the estimate   up from there  Inventories are in excellent shape  Higher consumption spending will lead to   higher ordering; there is just no excess stock in the stores  Wal-Mart sees no important regional   differences and is expecting sales growth this March over last March to be in the 9 to 11 percent   range   As for the transportation industry, my FedEx contact said that at this point vigorous   growth in its domestic business did not seem likely, but he indicated that there was a noticeable   surge in business from Asia in particular, including Japan  Currently Asian business is up 7 to   8 percent on a year-over-year basis, and he is anticipating a 9 to 10 percent increase for next   quarter Most customers of FedEx say that inventories are now too low to meet the demand that   they see While this is not true for those in the high-tech area, even there the message is, “Stand   by, we may need more capacity for shipping goods”  He noted especially that the investment   incentives in the stimulus bill might have a large impact on the high-tech sector  My UPS   contact said that their customers don’t see an immediate surge; their expectations are that   business will improve in the third quarter, but they don’t see it happening quite yet  The UPS   situation is complicated by the fact that its contract with the Teamsters is being negotiated and   apparently the Teamsters and UPS at this point are rather far apart  So, that’s a big problem for   them  My Hunt Trucking Company contact also said that his firm does not see a big surge of   business, but he noted that on occasion recently his firm has had to turn down customers because   of the unavailability of trucks for shipping  There has been a major reduction in capacity   because of all the bankruptcies in the trucking business, so occasionally—though not often—they   have had to turn down business        March 19, 2002 Page 43 of 117  Overall, it’s easy to make the case sector by sector that we can expect a moderate   recovery It’s hard to see, for example, how housing can have a big surge  But from a macro   perspective, it does appear to me that we have a massive amount of policy stimulus in place    Monetary policy has been very expansionary no matter how one measures it, and there are fiscal   incentives as well So, it may well be that we’re going to be surprised modestly sector by sector   and that it’s all going to add up to a pretty good year   I want to thank the staff for looking into the industrial production question  I think the   staff memo on that was distributed to all Committee members  Let me just mention the bottom   line on this When growth is vigorous, we know that there’s a somewhat pro-cyclical pattern to   productivity The initial estimates of industrial production are heavily based on input measures,   so in a period of vigorous growth, the estimates of the industrial production index will tend to be   underestimates  Let me cite the history of the initial reports of monthly changes in IP versus the   revised numbers for the first twelve months after a recession trough Beginning with March   1975, if you add up the first reported month-by-month changes over the next twelve months and   average them, that gives you 683 percent growth in IP  Currently, the index as we look at it says   that growth was 103 percent in that period  That gives you an idea of what happens as a   consequence of the index revisions In the first twelve months after July of 1980, the first reports   showed 73 percent growth, and it’s now reported at 1052 percent  In the first twelve months   after November 1982, the initial data had growth at 1313 percent, and it was revised up   to1527 percent In the year after March 1991, growth was initially reported at 14 percent, and   now it’s shown as 18 percent That was a slow first twelve months after a trough     My main reason for being interested in this subject is that, given the prevailing view that   we’re going to have a modest recovery, we need to be very careful that we don’t have our        March 19, 2002 Page 44 of 117  preconceptions reinforced by the first reports on industrial production  We need to pay attention   to the revisions in subsequent months as we get the actual production data  Thank you    Mr Chairman, I support the recommendation  I had at the top of my page   of notes that this is probably the easiest decision we’re going to face for quite some time, which   you pointed out as well I also want to reflect just a bit on what we have ahead of us  The   market is going to be asking the question—probably after this meeting in fact—how far and how   fast rates will go up We obviously don’t know the answer to that  But in trying to produce a   lasting recovery, it’s going to be important not to have a “disconnect” between what the market   comes to expect and what we think we are intending  I am attracted to the idea that Jerry Jordan   mentioned about trying to condition the market to the concept that we have some undoing of the   insurance policy that we took out after September ll—that that level of rates is sort of a baseline        March 19, 2002 Page 92 of 117  to go back to I do think that we run the risk of getting behind if we move only in 25 basis point   steps Just counting that out, it’s clear that it could take quite a few meetings before we got back   even to undoing the easing since September 11    Well, we could  I’m not in favor of moving between meetings unless   there is some significant reason in the incoming data to do that  At any rate, an intermeeting   move would give us steps of 50 basis points, and whether they come individually in 25 basis   point increments I think is much less important    I’m certainly inclined to go that way, too  But I can imagine data coming   in that would suggest that things are moving a whole lot faster than we anticipated and that a   move of 50 basis points would be appropriate    Mr Chairman, I think the evidence is that the interest arbitrage condition   holds very closely for these currencies where you have free capital movements      This is a question that stems from a comment my Wal-Mart contact made   to me yesterday  Apparently there’s a longshoremen’s contract on the West Coast that expires   on June 1, and I didn’t know whether you were aware of that or not  He said that Wal-Mart feels   there’s a 50-50 chance of a strike by those longshoremen sometime in June and in anticipation of         May 7, 2002 23 of 81  that they plan some accumulation of inventories of imported goods  They bring in a lot of their   merchandise from Asia  That would obviously affect some of the short-run dynamics of both   inventories and imports  I thought that might be going on, and I wondered if you knew anything   about that situation    All I’m saying is that it could distort the numbers that we’re looking at in   terms of both inventories and imports  And if that is happening, we need to know that    Mr Chairman, I’ve talked with a variety of business people all around the   Eighth District in the last six weeks  The overall tone of their comments is that the economic   situation just doesn’t feel as positive as implied by the GDP number reported for the first quarter    It just doesn’t seem to fit  In my view what probably is going on here is that growth of final   sales after all was modest, and an environment in which inventories are still being liquidated,   though at a slower rate than in the fourth quarter, is hardly one that feels very buoyant  So I   think that’s the way to reconcile the GDP number with the tone in the business community   My FedEx, UPS, and JB Hunt contacts in the transportation industry all reported that in   very recent weeks—and I talked to several of these people yesterday—the tone was much softer   than in the early part of the year My contact at Hunt, the trucking company, mentioned   scattered examples of companies such as Home Depot, Wal-Mart, and Anheuser-Busch   scrambling for capacity to ship goods  The last, for example, needed a rush shipment of bottles               May 7, 2002 52 of 81  from a plant in Florida to its brewery in St Louis  He attributed those types of capacity   problems to the significant decline in trucking capacity because of all the bankruptcies in the   industry last year and I suppose continuing this year  My sources at FedEx and UPS both noted   the ongoing shift of demand from express products to ground transportation  Their express   products are not doing well, a fact they attribute to ongoing efforts by companies to save money   in light of profit pressures Interestingly, FedEx and UPS both are seeing significant growth in   their business in Europe and in Asia Some of the numbers they cited I thought were interesting    FedEx Asian business—and it’s driven by business within Asia, not between the United States   and Asia—grew 17 percent year over year; for its European business, growth was 14 percent   year over year And UPS had an increase in intra-Europe business of 12 percent year over year    So they’re both seeing some strength in Europe  As I noted, both UPS and FedEx have seen   their customers shifting to ground shipments rather than express shipments, primarily in response   to profit pressures In the same vein, every one of my contacts—not only in the Eighth District   but also at very big national companies—commented about the pressure on the cost side from   health insurance and casualty insurance premiums  They have seen cost increases in the   neighborhood of 20 percent for both types of insurance  On the capital spending front, Wal-Mart   is continuing to increase its capital expenditures, which are up 9 percent from last year  The   company is increasing square footage in its stores 8 percent and anticipates total sales growth of   14 percent this year About 5 to 7 percent of that year-over-year sales growth is expected to be   in same store sales  So I think the overall view is that business conditions are improving, but my   contacts don’t see any signs of really significant improvement until later in the year  Thank you     Agree    I think most of us agree that, in the long run, money growth determines   the price level I don’t think there’s any argument about that  But certainly money growth is not   very helpful for predicting inflation in the short-term periods that we work with around this table    I think one of the problems here is that, with all the difficulties of the Phillips curve, we need a   horse to beat a horse We need something better but we don’t have a framework that is a whole   lot better And the framework that emphasizes money growth, although I’m probably the one   who gives more weight to it than almost anybody else around the table, just doesn’t do the job   that needs to be done over the short horizon   We all agree from the debates of the late 1960s and early 1970s that there is no   equilibrium relationship between the rate of inflation and the unemployment rate  What we have           June 25-26, 2002 39 of 179  here is an effort to make the change in the inflation rate depend on the labor market in some way,   let’s say the unemployment gap and some other variables  Now, there is no theoretical structure   behind that, as is true of adjustment mechanisms in general  For example, in the investment   world there are some crude regularities—adjustment-cost arguments that try to motivate   investment—but there is nothing that we would regard, I think, as worthy of being elevated to   the rank of theory behind any detailed empirical models   It is certainly true that the equilibrium unemployment rate—call it the natural rate—does   depend on institutional features of the economy and the labor market  That is part of what is   going on here; we’re trying to figure out what some of those features might be  And that’s   perfectly consistent with what we know or think we’ve known for a long time  I would view the   discussion of the role of productivity growth in the same way  It makes a lot of sense to me that   firms would understand the effects of the productivity changes that are taking place a lot more   quickly than the employees and, therefore, that we would get a result that would fit this way  We   might extract some empirical regularity, but I certainly wouldn’t want to go very far in relying   on it It might help us understand what has been going on, but I certainly wouldn’t want to   mortgage my house on the basis of such a relationship, if I may put it that way   I would offer an observation that the staff endeavor—certainly in what we have seen   before us—seems to put a lot of effort on the institutional features in determining the natural rate   of unemployment  I would hope that there is at least as much work underlying this on what I   would call employment rate or participation rate issues because it seems to me that some of the   more striking recent developments relate to the fraction of the working age population that is   employed  We may have some interesting issues ahead of us, with changes in the proclivities of   people over age 65, a category for which I am now qualified, to continue working  So we may           June 25-26, 2002 40 of 179  find that the unemployment rate itself will not be telling us a lot of the information that is   available out there     I also think that what we call lack of pricing power depends critically on the assumption   of entrenched low inflation going forward In my view, inflation expectations are a critical part   of this phenomenon, and that, of course, comes back to the way in which monetary policy is   conducted And the way the change in the conduct of monetary policy shows up in this model is,   I guess, with a change in the beta and gamma I suppose gamma particularly would be getting a   lower weight over time in the equation in exhibit 2   One can see the importance of expectations just by thinking about what has happened   recently in Argentina  No one would want to project what’s going to happen on the day the   currency board disappears One would not want to project inflation on that day on the basis of   any of the variables—such as the unemployment rate or the recent history of inflation—in a   model like this There would be a powerful change in the outlook as a consequence of   something that had happened, and one could not project inflation in any reasonable way based on   conventional macroeconomic variables of this kind     I make that observation because this Committee, unfortunately, in the space of a   relatively few years is going to be dealing with the transition of the chairmanship  And that is   going to set the stage potentially for a significant change in the outlook for the economy    Certainly there will be a natural amount of uncertainty  Trying to extend the policy we’ve had in   recent years and the expectations of that policy to a new chairmanship will be something critical   to the way things evolve in coming years    May I offer an observation on pricing power?  If you think about what   happened in the medical area in the mid-1990s, the change in competitive conditions pushed   down the rates for hospitals or at least controlled them  But clearly prices can’t be pushed down   so far that it sends companies into bankruptcy  What has happened in more recent years is that   there has been a lot of consolidation among hospitals and their rates have gone up substantially    We’ve seen very big increases And there doesn’t seem to be any problem with pricing power on   the health insurance premiums that most of us are paying for our employees these days Those   rates are going up and up; we’ve seen increases of about 20 percent a year for a couple of years   now So it has to depend on the competitive conditions and also on the productivity that allows   companies to stay in business with prices that keep being shaded down        June 25-26, 2002 48 of 179  If we look at airlines today, we find that some of the major airlines are in very serious   condition, on the brink of bankruptcy I didn’t read this morning’s newspapers, so maybe   somebody has already filed today!  I don’t know On the other hand, airlines like Southwest and   Jet Blue that have a different production process are doing just fine  So it’s got to be a   combination of competitive conditions and productivity that allows the price declines to still   yield profits so that companies stay in business      I don’t disagree with that except that there is a significant change from the   trend in the mid-1990s  For example, if medical prices today are going down per unit of value   delivered, they’re not going down as fast as they were five years ago  That’s my only point   there    Exactly And another example would be universities; we’re seeing a lot of   tuition increases now State universities in particular are putting through increases because of   the pressure on state budgets I don’t know whether there’s a productivity story you want to try   to tell there [laughter] but that’s certainly a different—    Those are real price increases    Thank you, Mr Chairman  The contacts that I talk to emphasize over and   over again that the picture has not changed very much from the time of our last meeting  In fact,   as I reflect on the situation, I can’t remember an intermeeting period in which less has changed in   terms of the overall outlook for the real economy, though obviously there have been   developments in the financial world that really are newsworthy  To reinforce a point that some   others have made, we, too, hear frequent comments about the weak condition of state and local   budgets I think that probably will be a factor depressing spending by state and local   governments for quite some time     My contacts at UPS, FedEx, and Wal-Mart all stressed a noticeable change in the labor   market in terms of a lower turnover rate or increased retention rate  Full-time employees are not   leaving as frequently as they were in the past, and as a consequence, these companies are   reducing the use of part-time help because they have more full-time employees  All of these   contacts pointed to that as being a marked change in the situation over the last year  My UPS     and FedEx contacts both said that they see some real signs of recovery in Asia and Europe, with   outbound traffic from those areas clearly picking up  The volume of shipments from the United   States to Europe and Asia, however, is not picking up  My Wal-Mart contact had an interesting   observation about Argentina He said that Wal-Mart has about eighteen stores in Argentina, and   with the banking system closed, they have problems paying employees  They are sending   armored trucks directly to the stores and paying wages in cash    June 25-26, 2002 97 of 179  So, my Wal-Mart contact said that things were going fairly well in Argentina except   for the financial and banking sides The level of activity, measured in terms of the volume in   their stores, looked okay   I think that’s about all I want to say in the way of a review of current conditions  I would   like to offer the observation that clearly the economy is working through a number of   adjustments, especially on the financial side, in light of all the uncertainties about the accounting   problems  We continue to get distressing stories along that line    There has been a significant decline in longer-term interest rates  There is a self-  equilibrating process going on That decline in long rates is certainly going to help to bolster   housing and probably consumption through the traditional channels—or what have become the   traditional channels of refinancing and other means of extracting cash from increased home   values That will no doubt provide some support for business fixed investment; it will encourage   that to come along  When the environment improves and becomes more buoyant, we will start to   see rates on longer maturity instruments go in the other direction  That will be part of a self-  stabilizing or self-equilibrating process as well  And it’s exactly that process that makes it, I     June 25-26, 2002 98 of 179  think, easy and fully appropriate for us just to sit here and let the market do as much of that as   possible I believe there’s no compelling reason for us to change policy until the underlying   situation changes quite a bit  Thank you    I have a comment on page 14 of the Bluebook—the box that discusses the   market reaction to policy surprises  I think there’s a lot more that could be done in that exercise    In particular, I think there’s a better way of doing table 1 versus table 2  Instead of partitioning   the data by date, I’d use the size of the policy surprise as measured by the change in the federal   funds futures market  A change of 5 basis points or less really is no surprise, but a change of   5 basis points or more would be  That would be a better way of presenting this analysis    That’s absolutely right  That’s why I’m suggesting that you partition   these observations I used 5 basis points because our research indicates that that’s about the   ambient noise in the federal funds futures market    I support the recommendation    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Over and over again from people who come   through the Bank and from those I meet in traveling around the District, the very common refrain   I hear on the cost side is that health insurance and other insurance costs are causing a lot of   problems  Labor turnover is down, and labor is readily available  I hear that repeatedly  I’d say   that the pessimists are only mildly pessimistic and that the optimists are only mildly optimistic    The overall view is sort of blah  But I think it’s important that it’s blah and not yuck!    [Laughter] Slow growth seems to be the expectation     Based on the comments I hear from contacts at some of the big firms that I call,   inventories are reported to be slim  My contact at Wal-Mart said that the company has sold out   essentially all its summer merchandise  My FedEx contact reported that all of his customers   indicate that inventories are slim  Probably the most interesting thing I learned from my recent   phone calls had to do with developments abroad  Obviously, South America has severe   problems  But a number of people I spoke with pointed to good performance in Asia  My   JB Hunt trucking contact said that their domestic business is very slow but they see a lot of   demand for capacity to move goods out of the West Coast ports  So the goods are coming in for   the fall and the holiday shopping season My FedEx contact indicated that his firm’s volume   from Asia to the rest of the world was up 25 percent in a recent month compared with the same         August 13, 2002 32 of 92  month last year For goods of European origin, business is up 15 percent on a year-over-year   basis And my UPS contact has the same judgment on that  So I reason from that information   that a lot of goods are flowing into this country from abroad  That would, of course, also fit with   the import numbers that we got for the second quarter  And the expectation seems to be that that   will continue  Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support the recommendation to keep the   federal funds rate where it is, but I’d like to associate myself with the position that Al Broaddus   spelled out for the balance of risks statement  Mr Chairman, I interpret your commentary as   saying that from what we know now and based on our best guess about the future, the federal   funds rate will probably stay about where it is in the near term  I think that a balance of risks   sentence biased toward weakness will be read by the markets as an indication of a rate cut to   come  That’s my prediction as to how the market is going to forecast    It seems to me as a first step that the press statement could indicate that the evidence   suggests that the economy has downshifted to a lower growth path  I think that the outlook for   growth is still positive but it’s lower than in the previous forecast I’d also like to point out that   there is ample room for long bond rates to fall  There is still an unusually large spread between   the federal funds rate and, let’s say, a ten-year Treasury bond as a benchmark  It seems to me   that we could accomplish what we want to accomplish by trying to convey that our present view   is that the policy target for the funds rate is likely to remain in its current neighborhood for a   longer period than we had previously thought That should at least help to reflect—I think   accurately—what our position is  And if the market reads it that way, it should help to bring   down longer-term rates  But I am concerned that the balance of risks toward weakness will be   read by the market as a forecast of a cut in the funds rate at the next meeting or the one after that    I just want to offer a quick observation  You talked about the tremendous   oversubscription on the Japanese Treasury securities despite little or no yield on those   investments  Given that there’s an obvious alternative, which would be US Treasuries that have   a positive yield, there must be an overwhelming view in Japan that the yen if anything is going to   appreciate, not depreciate, against the dollar  Otherwise one would think that there must be some   important institutional constraints or the Japanese would be putting money in Europe or the   United States    Unless one is convinced that the yen is going to appreciate over the long   run against the dollar Otherwise it just doesn’t fit      It doesn’t make any logical sense either    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I want to concentrate on anecdotal information   that has some forward-looking element to it  I hear the same sorts of reports of a mixed situation   and feelings of uneasiness that everybody else has mentioned  Just briefly, let me note with   regard to the housing industry that we had a luncheon with real estate developers and builders   and I did not detect, in that group anyway, any tone of excessive optimism or bubble if you will    I thought there was a substantial air of caution and an understanding that business was good but     September 24, 2002 57 of 115  it wouldn’t necessarily always remain that way  So for what it’s worth, that’s my assessment of   the mood in that industry  Maybe it just reflects Midwest conservatism; I don’t know     As you may have seen in recent press reports, Wal-Mart and other retailers have a   somewhat downbeat forecast  Wal-Mart had sales growth of 4 percent, and my contact at the   company pointed out that that was against year-ago figures that were depressed by the events of   September 11  He also noted that about 1 percent of Wal-Mart’s growth is estimated to be   coming from K-Mart because of the latter’s continuing difficulties as it operates in bankruptcy    Wal-Mart had been experiencing 6 to 7 percent growth, and they just don’t have a clue as to   what is causing this downshift  They track sales very, very closely  One thing I find interesting   is that they do know there’s a paycheck cycle  People tend to go shopping when the paycheck   comes in, so sales generally rise at midmonth and at the end of the month  My Wal-Mart contact   said that they interpret the recent more pronounced paycheck cycle as suggesting more liquidity   constraints on the part of consumers  People can’t afford to shop until the paycheck comes in     Inventory levels at Wal-Mart and other retailers continue to be in excellent shape  Looking   ahead, Wal-Mart has not changed its orders for the holiday season, but Wal-Mart managers   believe from talking with suppliers that several other large retailers have cut back their orders for   the holiday period   My contact at UPS reported a downward revision in their forecast for the air package   express business  Their expectation for next year is that volume will be basically at year 2000   levels, so they’re not expecting much growth there  They are anticipating having to lay off 200   to 250 pilots along with other aircraft crew, and they are reducing new aircraft orders for the next   three years from ten to eight per year  My contact said that they would have reduced those   orders by more but it was too expensive to get out of the option contracts they had entered into      September 24, 2002 58 of 115  They are in the process of parking twenty aircraft soon by sending them off to the desert  These   are old aircraft ten 727s, eight DC8s, and two 747s  He expected that those planes would never   fly again; UPS is taking them out of service because they just don’t need the capacity any more    He also noted that customers want more discounts, so the pricing environment is pretty rigorous,   and UPS is expecting downward trends next year in terms of the pricing situation  My contact at   FedEx was a bit more optimistic  I think FedEx has developed some business through the United   States Postal Service, which is working very much in their favor, and they are expecting a good   fall season For the peak fall season they anticipate that volume will be up 2 to 3 percent relative   to last year That would be the first genuine growth in two to three years according to my   contact A representative of JB Hunt Trucking Company told me  that his firm has yet to see the   usual fall pickup in business and that their customers are nervous  Volume is a bit stronger or a   bit weaker, and there certainly is no upward thrust in it  So I’d say that the overall view from    these scattered reports is that people see the economy as essentially flat to slightly up currently   and they don’t anticipate any change in that situation in the foreseeable future  Thank you    Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation  Let me outline a few   thoughts that I had as I walked into our meeting this morning  I started with a question Will   growth momentum develop soon?  You mentioned that we might know in a few weeks or   perhaps in a few months  Clearly, we have heard a lot of negative reports  It’s not that the   economy is sinking but just that the momentum isn’t really there  If the answer to my question is   “yes,” that the momentum can be reasonably expected to develop, then we need to be patient    Alternatively, at some point presumably our patience will become exhausted  In fact, we might   even look back and wish that we had been a bit more impatient a little sooner  So an option is to   attempt to give the economy a kick in the rear end to get it moving rather than just waiting   Now, we do seem to be faced with a general malaise, particularly in the business sector  I   often try to think about what’s going on by asking myself what real surprises I can imagine—        September 24, 2002 90 of 115  what two standard deviation events or data are we confronted with—that would change the way   we view the outlook I think there are two, really  You mentioned one  productivity I would   add what has been going on with long-term interest rates, particularly the real long-term rate of   interest In fact, those two developments together produce a puzzle  If we look at most of the   real data, relative to the forecasts that we made last spring, they are one standard deviation or    less—that is, the data are not coming in all that much differently than one could reasonably   expect There are no big surprises in GDP, industrial production, and so forth  But the   productivity number is a surprise  And, of course, that mirrors, I’d say, a modest downward   surprise in employment growth  With output coming along more or less in line and with   employment growth being minimal, that gives us a productivity surprise   By the same token there has been a rather substantial decline in the last six months in the   ten-year bond rate, for example; the ten-year indexed bond rate is down about 100 basis points    That is, rates other than shorter-term rates have come down a lot, too  So, we have a productivity   surprise, which presumably one firm after another is looking at, and yet one way to read the   decline in the expected real rate of return is that the long-run growth prospects for the economy   and productivity growth have been marked down I don’t know how to reconcile a decline in the   real rate of interest with a step-up in productivity growth  I think that’s a puzzle   I do believe that we need to be open to a rate cut in the future  As you were talking about   the possibility of an intermeeting move, it occurred to me that if we get what I’ll call an Iraq-  related event, some geopolitical shock, the stock market probably is going to react to that news   before we do And one of the issues we’re going to have to face is whether our action would be   viewed as bailing out the stock market  I think we have to be very careful about that because I   just don’t like being in the business of responding to the stock market  Thank you     September 24, 2002 91 of 115   I would just comment that there is always a risk that something you say   will lead people to read between the lines and will raise more questions than you’re able to   dispose of  That’s obviously a risk  I would also say that the two dissents will prepare the   market for the possibility of future action, probably in a way that’s quite clear and does not raise   any other potential problems    My question arose before the housing discussion started, but let me just   comment briefly on housing Part of what may be going on in that sector is the “tear down”   phenomenon  A lot of housing starts come from tearing down perfectly good houses in   neighborhoods like my own and replacing them with McMansions  I think we see that   happening in the close-in suburbs all over the country  I’ve heard that it may account for perhaps             November 6, 2002 20 of 122  300,000 housing starts on a national basis, which is really an enormous number  In other words,   these starts are not producing new units    In the pre-FOMC briefing, at the end of the charts and tables, chart 3 listed   four items that are affecting the longer-run outlook  The fourth one is that “the gloom that   currently is a restraining influence on business expansion will gradually lift next year”  I have   the sense that we are relying more on that than we usually do  Following along from Cathy’s   question, it seems to me that we know about a lot of individual sectors where there’s really a   great deal of retrenchment taking place  Obviously structures are one; we’re not going to see a   boom in structures  It will be quite a while before we will see that sector and others such as air   transport, airlines, or aircraft coming back; they are all going to be in a retrenchment phase for a   long time  We’ll see parked aircraft brought back from the desert before we see the building of   new aircraft  Power plant construction seems to have been revised down; because of the scale of   power plants, the construction involves a rather substantial amount of investment  It seems to   me that, if we’re wrong about this assessment on the gloom lifting, then clearly the economy is   going to be a good bit slower than we’d like Relying on that—“animal spirits” is what Keynes            November 6, 2002 21 of 122  called it—as the basis of the forecast concerns me  I understand why it is in there, and I don’t   have anything better to offer, but I am very uneasy that that’s where we are    Thank you, Mr Chairman  My Wal-Mart contact tells me that   Wal-Mart’s expectations for sales growth have been revised downward  He’s now expecting   sales to grow at the low end of the 2 to 4 percent range  Growth in same-store sales for stores   open a year or more came in at 3 percent for September, which was particularly disappointing   given that the comparison was with September a year ago  He said the weakness seems to have   started in the second week of July and has been going on long enough that it looks as if sales   growth has been downsized I asked him particularly about total sales  He said that Wal-Mart’s   square footage is growing at a 9 percent annual rate—apparently they’ve been on that track for   some time—but the deceleration in total sales matches the deceleration in same-store sales    They don’t get a different picture on that basis   He noted that the company is seeing a more pronounced mid-month paycheck cycle    Many people who shop at Wal-Mart are doing so after they receive their paychecks  When   company analysts see a more pronounced cycle, they interpret that as meaning that people are   more liquidity constrained and are delaying outlays until they get their paychecks  Moreover,   this pattern is evident even in expenditures on food  He didn’t know quite what to make of that   because ordinarily food purchases are spread rather evenly over the month   He also said that one cannot underestimate the impact of the dock strike, though in his   view Wal-Mart was better prepared than most other firms  He indicated that the dock workers   are working at about 60 percent of their usual speed, which I think would fit with what Bob   Parry was saying earlier, and that the backlog will not be cleared until late November perhaps at                  November 6, 2002 47 of 122  the earliest Nothing that gets on ships in Asia now is likely to arrive in stores on schedule  In   his view there’s a lot of seasonal merchandise that will end up either being sold at distressed   prices or being put in storage by some retailers to be sold next year  I don’t know whether that’s   going to distort the inventory numbers  The categories affected include electronics, apparel,   shoes, toys, Christmas decorations, and that sort of thing   My contact at JB Hunt trucking said that the trucking business coming from the West   Coast is more or less back to normal, though that’s not really consistent with what Bob reported    To describe the overall economy my contact used terms like “wishy-washy,” “has no vitality,”   and “is tentative” He reported that June was the strongest month this year and that business is   slower now than in June, whereas usually his peak period is in the September-October time   frame  So, he’s had a less-than-normal seasonal change in the recent period  The retailers he   talks to, including Target and Wal-Mart, are not all that optimistic  He used an expression I   hadn’t heard before, commenting “as they say in Arkansas, not much pumpkin,” whatever that   means  [Laughter]   My FedEx contact reported that his company has seen a significant softening in business   since late September  On some days in October express volume was actually below prior year   levels The shippers FedEx people talk to expect a less busy holiday season than previously   anticipated; they expect the holiday peak to be less extreme than usual  He also emphasized that   the West Coast dock strike is having larger effects than expected  Of course, a fair amount of   goods are being shipped by airfreight at substantially above normal costs—items like auto parts   and so forth that can be shipped at these higher prices on a temporary basis  He mentioned   especially that their international business is strong coming into the United States and that intra-  Asia business is also strong, while US exports are still on the weak side  He said there’s a         November 6, 2002 48 of 122  distinct softening in the business  The slowdown is not a dramatic, “oh my God,” type of event,   but it is a noticeable softening As with UPS they, too, are expecting a less robust peak in their   business in late November and December   My UPS contact said that his company has now reduced its 2003 calendar year forecast    Asian business is currently booming because of the dock strike, and UPS does not see an end to   that until late this year; UPS is expecting fairly good growth in Asia, both within Asia and   between Asia and Europe Plans for further reductions in their workforce have not yet been   announced—so, as with all these comments, you should not talk to outsiders about them—but he   says they expect to furlough crew members or to introduce early retirement packages  That   reflects a reevaluation of their prospects for next year; which involves having to cut their budget   as compared with the 2002 budget by 2 percent  They do not plan to put special aircraft in place   for the holiday season; they often hire planes and crews on a temporary basis  Their ground   business was actually down 2½ percent in the third quarter this year in comparison with the   previous year He said it was the first year-to-year decline in his twenty-eight years in the   business UPS capital expenditures are at $19 billion this year and planned expenditures for   next year are $20 billion They are expecting to buy twelve new aircraft, down from the   fourteen originally planned They would have preferred to reduce the number to ten, but the   nature of their contracts with the manufacturers makes it too expensive to cancel the contracts  I   asked him what UPS thinking was regarding the effects on the company should there be a war   with Iraq He said that they have standing arrangements with the military for the military to take   UPS planes for airlift needs, and the same is true with FedEx  He noted that there are three   stages to this process They are currently in stage one where UPS is providing one wide-body to   the military on an ad hoc basis, typically on weekends when the plane is not used anyway  So at            November 6, 2002 49 of 122  this point there’s not too much effect  He indicated that even if they went to stage three, where   the maximum number of planes would be taken by the military, UPS would be able to keep its   domestic network going  The planes would come out of the international network  However, he   said restrictions on flying probably would be so severe should they get to that stage that the   domestic network would be mostly down    When I read Part 2 of the Greenbook, I was struck by the fact that indicator after   indicator and data for sector after sector—with the exception of housing—seem to be coming in   at a disappointing level or somewhat below expectations  It made me think about the old-  fashioned wind-up alarm clock You wind it up, and when the alarm first goes off, the bell rings   vigorously, and after a while the sound just tails off  In terms of economic activity, the bell is   still ringing, but it’s not very loud or vigorous anymore     In thinking about the current situation, I asked myself this question  Is monetary policy   really expansionary?  There was a long discussion of this type of issue thirty years ago in the   whole debate of aggregates versus interest rates  I think we all decided at that time that interest   rates, of course, reflect the combination of supply and demand  And if demand is weak enough,   an interest rate target could be holding up interest rates rather than pushing rates down  In my   view, one indicator worth looking at in this regard is the pattern of money growth  I understand   all the caveats that are necessary When I look at money growth trends, there has been a clear   tapering off in the last few months  Money growth over the last six months, as measured by both   M2 and MZM, has been in the neighborhood of 9 to 10 percent  I would feel much more   confident that policy is truly expansionary if those numbers were more in the 12 to 15 percent   range But they certainly have been tapering off in recent weeks  That’s all Thank you    Mr Chairman, I support the recommendation to cut the funds rate by   50 basis points I agree with the argument that 25 basis points would lead to market expectations   that another 25 is coming, and I think it’s much better to act decisively  Yes, it’s probably true   that some people will say in reaction to 50, “Oh my God, the Fed thinks the economy is really            November 6, 2002 92 of 122  very weak” That may well be the interpretation of some  But I think the reaction of others—   that we are acting decisively as we have in the past—will overwhelm that concern   There are always risks We’ve talked a lot about the downside risks and what a pickle we   would be in if they were to accumulate  On the upside risks, I think it would be absolutely   delightful to deal with upside strength, [laughter] but we’re not discussing that situation  There   is no question that we would be able to increase rates in time  We have a lot invested in inflation   credibility, and this is the time to take some return on that capital  I just don’t think there’s any   issue on that whatsoever   I would not myself go for the balanced risk statement  I believe the market interpretation   of the balanced risk statement would probably have two pieces to it  First, that we’re making a   statement that we’re finished reducing rates  As I see it, that would minimize the chance that the   reduction would carry into longer-term rates  Second, it may appear awkward if incoming data   remain weak over the next few weeks, which I don’t think is beyond the realm of possibility at   all The balanced risk statement would then raise questions as to our judgment about the outlook   because I think it would be interpreted in the light of the data we see in coming weeks  So in my   view the best course would be to retain the tilt toward weakness  To introduce something new   that appears to cut in the opposite direction of the 50 basis point cut would be more confusing   than helpful to the market  So I’d simply leave that part of the statement alone    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I have a couple of questions I’d like to ask  If   we were to compare the forecast this time with the forecast last time using the market-based   funds rate line in your alternative scenarios, I take it that not very much has changed  Am I   reading you correctly? I didn’t pull out my previous Greenbook to verify it, but I think last time   the nearer-term market forecast on the fed funds rate was down from where you had it, and this   time it’s the other way around    They are more pronounced this time  So if we were comparing the two   forecasts, there has been a little improvement in the market’s outlook for GDP, employment, and   so forth, but not all that much?    Okay My next question is about two rather outsized numbers that caught   my eye The less important one is the surge in M3, which was concentrated in institutional   money market funds  It’s a big number Do we know what’s going on there?  And second, what   do you make of the productivity surge?  That’s obviously a very important issue, and the   productivity number is really quite large  You didn’t say very much about that, it seems to me    Yes, but except for the refinancing issue, there does not seem to be any   statistical anomaly that you can put your finger on    So it’s not just a one-quarter phenomenon?    Yes, a year of remarkable numbers    But the funds obviously are not coming—not entirely anyway— from   other M3 assets    Do you have any idea where the funds were coming from to the extent that   they were from outside M3 assets?    Thank you, Mr Chairman  When I came in this morning, I thought one of   our problems today might be that many of us would be leaving the building early and the press   would see us and wonder what we were doing this morning  But we seem to have solved that   problem!  [Laughter]   My Wal-Mart contact—and obviously that company is intensely interested in the issue of   consumption behavior—reports mixed currents that their people find puzzling  I’ve commented   in previous meetings that Wal-Mart watches very closely the pattern of spending over the course   of the month and has noted a paycheck cycle There’s a tendency for retail sales to pick up just   after people receive paychecks, with a bigger cycle at the end of the month and a smaller cycle in   the middle of the month  Ordinarily there is no particularly noticeable midmonth cycle in sales   of items such as food and pharmaceuticals  Recently such a cycle has been appearing, and   Wal-Mart interprets that as a sign of consumer distress  Apparently at least some households   aren’t able to spend on food on a steady basis but are waiting until they get their midmonth   paycheck On the other hand, that’s not consistent with the fact that sales of discretionary items,   electronics, and fashion apparel—    Well, at least Wal-Mart’s version of fashion apparel  How long has it   been since you’ve been in a Wal-Mart?  At any rate, those items are continuing to sell fairly well    So, there are these crosscurrents At any rate, my contact was concerned about whether            December 10, 2002 59 of 87  households are getting somewhat stressed, and the pattern of food sales was one factor he   pointed to in particular   My contacts at FedEx and also at the trucking company, JB Hunt, both said that not   much has changed in recent weeks The outlook for next year is about the same as it has been  I   asked my FedEx contact particularly about the Middle East situation  As you know, both FedEx   and UPS have contracts with the Defense Department that allow aircraft to be diverted for cargo   lift to anyplace in the world  The word that he has from the Defense Department is that the   number of planes likely to be diverted would be small and would not have any effect on   domestic business because there is plenty of excess capacity in that industry  So in his view   nothing draconian is likely to happen in that regard  There may or may not be military action in   the Middle East, but his best guess right now is that even if there were, the direct effect on the   US economy is not likely to be severe Of course, the psychological effect is a different matter    I’ve been in Europe, and I spent a day at the Bank of England  Incidentally, I was   pleased to be the first person from the FOMC to congratulate Mervyn King—in person anyway    Officials at the Bank of England are very, very concerned about price increases in their housing   market  House prices have gone up about 25 percent in the last year  They view that as a   housing bubble, as something that has the potential to cause a lot of problems in the future when   the bubble collapses Certainly they are looking at it that way rather than as a sign of a great deal   of optimism   On the Continent, I attended a conference at the Bundesbank  The gloom there is hard to   pierce People are extremely pessimistic about being able to come to grips with the structural   rigidities that exist; they don’t know how they will ever get a political agreement on policy,   given all the restrictive rules they have  In Germany, of course, there is a lot of budget pressure          December 10, 2002 60 of 87  They’re in danger of piercing the budget guideline of a 3 percent maximum deficit  For what it’s   worth, which is probably not very much, there are a lot of high fashion shops in Frankfurt, and   all the manikins are dressed in black  The displays are barely relieved by any color whatsoever   except for the Christmas decorations in the shops      In terms of the national outlook, the Greenbook forecast makes very good sense on a   central tendency basis Al Broaddus talked about some of the downside risks, but it’s important   to understand that a central tendency also has upside risks  At some point in the next year or two   I think we are likely to see a lot of things coming together that in retrospect anyway might be   called a boom or, at least, a “boomlet”  There will be a change in mood  I believe we will see   positive developments in the stock market, employment growth, corporate profits, and other   areas coming together at some point  That’s the history in our economy, and I just want to be   sure that that’s on the table and not forgotten  We need to remember that that is a very real   possibility Thank you    Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation, and I promise that I will   never reveal that I observed the Chairman speechless on one occasion  [Laughter]     Let me carry on from this conversation and turn it just a little  If we   compare the optimal rule and the estimated rule, the optimal rule is much more aggressive  It   probably involves a lot more reversals, and the funds rate would look a lot less smooth if we   drew a chart of it  Let’s say we use the output from the models that have all the private-sector   expectations rolled into them—expectations reflecting knowledge of the rule that the central   bank is following  If one were to plot a one-year, two-year, or five-year rate, I suspect that there   wouldn’t be much daylight between the rates under the estimated rule and the optimal rule    That’s my guess because even the amount of persistence we’re talking about with the estimated   rule indicates readily enough that there’s not much difference in terms of a longer-term rate  So   if we think about policy being transmitted through interest rates, it’s not going to make much   January 28-29, 2003 33 of 195    difference—in the way the economy works in terms of growth, employment, and other real   variables—which rule is used  Let me just leave that expressed as an assertion for the moment     Now, if that’s the case, it seems to me that a critical dimension of designing the rule   precisely in the environment of uncertainty that we face is to promote a good rational   expectations equilibrium where the private sector truly understands what we’re doing  That’s a   dimension that you didn’t really explore or discuss, but that’s a critical part of this whole subject   because we’re trying to produce this rational expectations equilibrium where the market comes   to expect the right things from the central bank  One of the problems with a very aggressive rule,   which tends to result in a lot of reversals, is that many people are going to find our policy rather   confusing; they will have difficulty trying to figure out what the central bank is doing  From the   point of view of promoting an understanding in the private sector regarding what the policy   really is, I think there’s a big benefit to having a certain amount of smoothness in the funds rate    That’s because—this is my guess now—it will be much easier for the private sector to   understand what our policy strategy is  That was not addressed in this analysis, but it seems to   me to be a critical part of the problem of trying to design a policy that we should follow     I think there’s inevitably a great deal of learning and evolution involved   here in terms of furthering the completeness or sophistication, whatever you want to call it, of the   markets’ understanding of what we’re doing  The environment is very different in that respect   from what it was thirty-five years ago, let’s say  So part of the problem in trying to model this is   January 28-29, 2003 35 of 195    that the world does change and evolve over time, and time and learning go only in one   direction—at least we hope they go only in one direction  I don’t know where to go with that!    [Laughter]     May I make a very brief comment on this point, although I’m jumping in   out of turn?  The way in which dealers manage their positions is going to depend importantly on   what kind of policy changes they think are conceivable  If they live in a world where the rate   changes by 25 basis points most of the time, with moves of 50 basis points on occasion, that’s a   very different world from one where the change could be much larger, perhaps 200 or 300 basis   points at a shot  The transition from one world to the other is going to be an awful problem and   may involve some catastrophes along the way  But the dealers will learn to live with a different   environment  It’s just that the transition could be extremely difficult     There’s a lot more communication with the markets than just the intended   fed funds rate itself  One of the things that I find striking is that this Committee and, of course,   particularly the Chairman have really been remarkably clear and coherent about a whole variety   of things on which it’s possible to be clear and coherent  He enjoys talking about obfuscation,   but that’s not in fact what the markets most of the time take away from what he says  I believe   that’s an important point  It’s one thing that separates the success here, I think, from the   problems that some other central banks have had because the predictability that we’re talking   about is not there for some of those other central banks  There is some literature on that   Let me mention something that I find interesting  Roger talked about the fact that the fed   funds futures market the day before a meeting most of the time has it right  One of the things   that Bob Rasche and I have done is to go back and try to figure out how that happens  If one   looks at any particular fed funds contract at the beginning of its trading—let’s say when it starts   to become active three or four months in advance—that forecast that far in advance is often not   very accurate  What happens if you follow this day by day is that you see that the information   coming into the market moves that rate in a very sensible way most of the time  So let’s say the   fed funds prediction starts out too high and then it converges to where we actually go; it’s a   consequence of new data such as a weak report on industrial production or employment and a   whole raft of other things  It turns out that about 80 percent of the large fed funds futures   changes are a consequence of information of that type and about 20 percent are a consequence of   statements or testimony—primarily from the Chairman or occasionally from other members of   the Committee  So a coherent picture of how the policy process works is obtained not just from   the response function that economists build into their models and work with in their equations    January 28-29, 2003 58 of 195    It’s also a consequence of the way the Committee—and again I emphasize particularly the   Chairman—has articulated what it is that we are doing     Thank you, Mr Chairman  After these very large issues I have a rather   mundane one  I’ve been struck in recent weeks and months by the movements in commodity   prices, and I noted particularly the chart on commodity prices on page 36 in Part 2 of the   Greenbook  It looks as if the commodity price increases really took hold perhaps a little before   the exchange rate started to move  To what extent are these dollar increases in commodity prices   outrunning what can be explained by the exchange rate per se?  That is, is a worldwide increase   in commodity prices, as measured in euros and other currencies, taking place; and what are the   implications, if any, if that observation is correct?     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Unlike Ned Gramlich, who used a football   metaphor, I’m going to use a boating metaphor  I think the economy is like a high-powered   speedboat moving forward; however, we don’t know how far forward the throttle is  There’s a   rope over the stern—this is the war anchor—but we don’t know how big that anchor is and to   what extent it is holding the boat back  The boat’s speed will change when and if the war anchor   is lifted  We don’t know exactly how this is going to play out, but it’s possible to imagine the   rope being severed and the speedboat shooting ahead  However, what we observe in the data is   the forward speed of the boat  We don’t know to what extent that speed is being held down by   that anchor—it might be a really little anchor—or how much of the speed is due to the   fundamentals of the economic situation  I do think that, at some point, we’re going to find   ourselves scrambling in an environment that could be very different from the current one     I think the staff did a spectacular job, by the way, in describing the outlook and   presenting a very thought-provoking and cogent exposition of the considerations and the risks    January 28-29, 2003 129 of 195    Nonetheless—if I could switch the analogy here a bit—if you’re skiing on a mountain that may   experience an avalanche, you may think you’re safe, and in fact you may be safe  But when that   mountain starts to rumble and that avalanche comes down, you’re going to have to stop and take   stock and try to figure out where you are  We don’t know how the markets are going to respond   if and when the bombs start to fall  I can think of a wide range of possibilities there  What   seems to me to be most clear is that the situation is extremely fluid and we really don’t know   how all this is going to play out  So while I think the staff did a great job of looking at the   fundamentals, we actually don’t know how the situation is going to unfold  What will be critical   for us is to form a sound policy response which, of course, may be not to do anything until we   have some resolution or a greater amount of information on the situation   From people I talk with I hear phrases like “flat loan demand” or descriptions of the   situation as “spotty” or “mixed” Those are the types of comments one hears over and over again    I think that’s the tone of the reports around the table today; it’s what all of us are hearing  I   talked to my Wal-Mart contact yesterday, and he said that some very peculiar features have   emerged in the retail business  One is that consumer behavior is tilting toward chicken away   from steak  By that he means that there’s a widespread phenomenon of people buying more   goods at lower value price points  We see this also in the reports we get from FedEx and UPS    There’s a substitution of ground for express services, for example, as people look very hard for   ways to economize  I think it’s a very generalized phenomenon     But strangely enough, at the same time that Wal-Mart notes this movement toward   chicken and away from steak—a behavior that is true across almost all lines of their business—  consumer electronics, which are viewed as involving highly discretionary types of purchases, are   also strong  My Wal-Mart contact says that his firm just doesn’t understand what’s going on   January 28-29, 2003 130 of 195    there  I was amazed when he told me that Wal-Mart has computerized every single one of its   sales tickets for the last nine years  It’s a mind-boggling database  They analyze the data to try   to understand what they can about consumer behavior, for example, in terms of the mix of goods   people buy  He says this recent pattern is a mystery; they don’t have an explanation for it         I’ve been pressing my contacts on their capital expenditure plans  Wal-Mart takes a long   view  They have a business strategy with a fairly long time horizon, and they’re not changing   that strategy one iota in terms of the investments they make in new stores and warehouse   facilities and so forth  I asked my contact at FedEx particularly whether they are expecting to   move ahead some of their capital expenditures to beat the expiration of the incentives in—what   is it—September or so of 2004  He said that their planned expenditures are essentially flat this   year over last year though there are a lot of expenditures they would really like to make  He’s on   the edge of springing for $250 million to $300 million of outlays, primarily in the technology   area  In particular, they’re studying the prospects for bringing some outlays forward into 2004   that would otherwise have come in 2005  I think that’s something we would want to continue to   follow closely to try to understand what these numbers mean as we go through coming quarters     I support both, Mr Chairman     I have a brief comment on that  There are a lot of news reports about   companies canceling their contributions to 401(k) plans as an economy move  That might lead   individuals to reduce their contributions, which would tend to bring the saving rate down  I   don’t know how extensive that is, but we certainly hear reports that many companies are moving   in that direction now   March 18, 2003 24 of 101      Thank you, Mr Chairman  What we hear repeatedly around the District   are phrases such as “muddling along,” “on hold,” and “wait and see”  Bank loan demand is flat    It’s very difficult to know—I don’t think anybody can tell—how much of what we’ve been   observing is a consequence of war fears and how much of it reflects underlying uncertainties    I’ve been pressing my contacts about their capital spending plans and in particular trying to find   out if people are thinking ahead to the expiration of the tax incentives in September of next year    In general, people comment that they are not taking that into account yet, and capital spending is   flat  My UPS contact says that UPS capital expenditures are for repairing or replacing   equipment as necessary but there is no growth in the company’s capital expenditures spending    However, my FedEx contact said that FedEx does plan to buy trucks very aggressively to take   advantage of the investment incentives  He expects that perhaps 5 to10 percent of FedEx capital   outlays in 2004 will reflect spending being moved from 2005 into 2004 to take advantage of   those incentives   I believe there is a way to think about the national picture that may be useful  Think   back, for example, to the middle of last week when the Greenbook was being put to bed, which   was before the Thursday stock market rally  Let me put this in a very overstated, extreme way in   order to make a point  If we view a lot of the data as reflecting the means of a fairly wide   distribution, then maybe there’s a 50 percent probability of a really good outcome—call that a   10—and a 50 percent probability of a very weak outcome, flat or something like that  Call that   weak outcome a zero  The mean is 5, but in fact there’s not much probability weight on 5 as the   actual outcome; it’s spread out at these extremes, and that is a very unusual situation  Now, what   we’ve seen just in the last few days is a quite substantial surge in equity prices, a drop in the   price of oil, and a big increase in the value of the dollar—a large one-day move yesterday that is   March 18, 2003 40 of 101    very atypical  Those developments may well indicate that people are now putting more weight   on the outcome we called 10 and less weight on the outcome we called zero  If this way of   thinking about the situation is useful, it means—given that in coming weeks we will know more   about whether the outcome is likely to be closer to the 10 or the zero—that perhaps the best   course for us at this point is not to try to guess  If we guess wrong, the action we took based on   that guess will not have been very appropriate  Thank you     Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation on the intended federal   funds rate, but I have a question about the other two aspects of it  I agree completely with your   rationale and your discussion about the difficulty of assessing the balance of risks  What I’m   concerned about is that people in the markets didn’t hear our discussion on that and it may be   very difficult to convey our meaning  I think we want to be careful that we don’t create any   uncertainties that produce more problems than we’re trying to solve That’s one concern I have    My second concern relates to the issue of heightened surveillance  I think the markets   understand that we’re always on the job  Therefore, my concern is that people may look at that   and think we’re likely to do something in response to an event when in fact the event falls short   of a situation in which we would want to act  So my concern relates to how we accurately   convey our intent     I have a question about the construction of one of the graphs on page 3    At the bottom left you show the dollar value of the euro issues  Are those converted at the   exchange rate of the month in question?     If we look at July ’01, for example, the height of that bar is about the same   as the previous bar, which I guess is for April ’01  But in fact the dollar price of the euro was   quite different at those times  So if you depicted the values in euros, the bars on the right-hand   side would not look quite so high relative to the others, right?  That would mean that the most   recent bars would be converted at $112 or $111 or something like that       And the bars some time back would be converted at $103 or something   like that  I don’t know exactly—my memory of those rates is not that solid  But the point is—       Oh, I know they are I’m just saying that it might be more useful for our   purposes not to plot the changed dollar price of the euro with the actual euro issuance    Presenting that in euro terms might be a little clearer for our purposes     Thank you     I have two quite different questions  In the Greenbook there was a   discussion of the different picture of the labor market provided by the payroll employment data   and by the unemployment rate  The Greenbook explanation of this focused on the participation   rate  But it looks to me as though the divergence in the payroll and household employment   series is larger than we usually see  Since the end of the recession, assuming that occurred at the   end of 2001 roughly, payroll employment is down in total about 1 million, and household   employment is up about 13 million or something like that  I know these series differ, but it   May 6, 2003 21 of 115    seems to me that the gap is larger and more persistent than usual  What can you tell us about   that?     I guess the implication of what I’m saying is that the behavior of the   unemployment rate would not look quite so peculiar if you focused on household employment   rather than payroll employment because such a big gap has opened up there     Right   May 6, 2003 22 of 115      Well, the strength in the household series is not huge  It’s just that there   has been a substantial gap between the two series     My other question is—     My other question is really quite different  The forecast depends not   insignificantly on the analysis related to the macroeconomics of fiscal policy  Of course, there’s   a very old debate about that  On the tax side particularly, one view obviously is that tax cuts   don’t do much of anything for short-run activity  Can you talk a little more about the confidence   intervals around the estimates of the effects of fiscal policy?  There are two issues  One is what   kind of tax bill we might get  The other is, given some assumption about the macro effects of   that over the next eighteen months or so, what sort of confidence intervals do you put around   that?  Certainly over the years a position has emerged that says those effects are vanishingly   small     That’s a total over ten years?     By the same token, in the consumption area there are transitory effects as   well     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I want to concentrate my comments on   anecdotal information that is very, very recent because the formal data we have now are almost   entirely from the period when the war was still in progress  My contacts suggest that there is a   more optimistic tone, but I’m wondering whether that optimistic tone reflects more a sigh of   relief that the worst didn’t happen rather than any genuine optimism  Everyone emphasizes that   they don’t see any evidence in the data right now; there is a sense of greater optimism but   nothing actually going on that suggests a pickup     May 6, 2003 39 of 115    I talked with my Wal-Mart contact yesterday  It was about 500 pm on Monday, and as   is usual, he had data through a good part of the day already  [Laughter]  He said there is no sign   of any significant increase in consumer buying  Weekend sales were 28 percent above the   previous year for comparable stores, and the data so far for Monday didn’t indicate anything new   going on  He said that there is no evidence of any postwar bounce in consumer spending on the   kinds of items that Wal-Mart sells  There was no weather explanation; weather has been normal   in most of the country, including tornadoes in the Midwest at this time of year     I’ve also been trying to press my contacts on the capital spending outlook  My UPS and   FedEx contacts both emphasized that they’re not buying any new aircraft  They are giving up all   of the options they had previously to purchase aircraft  My UPS contact made a comment that I   thought was rather interesting  UPS is even looking at paying the penalties to give up firm   orders because the price of used aircraft has come down so much that it might be cheaper for   UPS to go ahead and pay those penalties  Of course, for any one company the purchase of used   aircraft is a capital outlay, but it is not an increase in capital spending for the economy as a   whole  That may be a point that has more general applicability as we try to interpret anecdotal   reports about capital spending going forward because there is an awful lot of idle office space   and equipment and so forth  In particular, I’m thinking about structures where from a company’s   point of view they are spending more—and they tell us that—but it doesn’t show up for the   economy as a whole    As I look at the national outlook in terms of the actual data, those data are almost   uniformly on the weak side with minor exceptions  The positive information is mostly the   financial market information—the stock market as well as bond market spreads—and, of course,   oil prices also  I think we should all be aware that while a better tone in the securities markets is   May 6, 2003 40 of 115    a positive development, we know that later this week or next week all that could disappear in a   flash  The bottom line for me is that there is no sign at all of a postwar bounce in the information   that we have  Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Let me start at a little different place than you   did, but I’ll come back  When I came in this morning, I had been thinking about how to assess   the potential costs of lowering rates when in retrospect that proved not to have been necessary or   desirable versus the costs of not lowering rates when in retrospect we wished we had done so   sooner  I must say that on that calculus I think the costs of delay are greater at this point  It   seems to me that if we were to ease policy today and in retrospect that turned out not to have   been necessary or desirable, I’d be quite happy  That’s because we’d be dealing with a situation   in which the economy is stronger than expected and coming along nicely and that would be   May 6, 2003 87 of 115    occurring in an environment where the inflation environment is very stable  So I don’t think the   costs of dealing with that would be all that high   With regard to market expectations, we have quite an unusual situation  I haven’t gone   back and looked at the data, but I think in our history of recent years it is quite unusual to have a   very high probability of a future action built into the market but no action built in for the current   meeting  Second, as the first page of graphs in front of us shows very clearly, as of the end of   March or early April the market had built in a high probability of a change in May but now has   taken that out  So in terms of market expectations, we’re dealing with an unusual circumstance    I believe the market is going to interpret the language “The Committee believes that, taken   together, the balance of risks    is weighted toward weakness” as code, if you will, or a forecast   that we are highly likely to cut rates at our next meeting  The question will arise immediately as   to whether the cut is likely to be 25 or 50 basis points  That uncertainty will arise and will be   discussed right away  So to some extent not acting today but putting in this language will   surprise the market in the same way that the market would be surprised by an action today  It’s   not as if we totally avoid that market surprise      I view this as a perfectly satisfactory solution because, if the market has a high degree of   confidence that a change in rates is coming, in terms of the effects of monetary policy it doesn’t   really matter very much whether that change comes now or six weeks from now  The term   structure is affected almost exactly the same way except for the very, very short-run maturities   That six-week interval can’t make any difference for a ten-year bond  So I think this is an   acceptable way of making it clear that we are very likely to be easing policy unless we see a lot   of evidence that the economy is picking up steam     Mr Chairman, I have a question  After he leaves are we allowed to talk to   him about this paper?  [Laughter]     Let me try to link the discussion about our situation with the point that   Roger was raising about Japan because I think the Japanese experience does provide some   important lessons  I don’t have the data in front of me, but in the early ’90s the money stock   actually fell in Japan for several years running  Japan made the same mistake at that time that   we did in the early 1930s, when the Federal Reserve and many others thought that policy was   becoming easier because interest rates were going down but when, in fact, the central bank was   pulling liquidity out of the system  Certainly one important lesson from both the early ’30s in   the United States and elsewhere and from the early ’90s in Japan is to pay some attention to the   aggregates in these extreme circumstances   Second, another key feature of the Japanese environment, although not so much in recent   months, has been a very important and binding exchange rate constraint  Japan has never felt   comfortable pursuing a policy to provide liquidity that might have the consequence of allowing   the yen to depreciate substantially against the dollar  I think that was widely understood in   June 24-25, 2003 28 of 211    Japanese society, and there are probably a lot of informal ways in Japan of ensuring that their   currency does not depreciate that are not so applicable in our environment  But that’s a type of a   price constraint, if you will, that prevented the Japanese from going as far as they might   otherwise have gone in pursuing a quantitative target   I think it’s very important to realize the very basic point that we can’t fix both the price   and the quantity  If the price—the federal funds rate—gets down to zero, in my view we really   don’t have any choice but to concentrate on the quantity and to force a lot of liquidity into the   system  In fact, there’s a rather interesting symmetry in the situation  When the inflation rate is   relatively high, it also turns out that interest rates can give misleading indications because of the   confusion as to how much rates are being driven by changes in inflation expectations  Countries   that have gotten into inflationary problems can have great difficulty running policy in terms of   interest rates; the central bank really has to control the amount of liquidity it is creating  Interest   rates, as I think we’ve learned through a lot of experience, work well as a policy instrument in   the broad intermediate range  But when a country has an inflation problem or a deflation   problem, the central bank had better pay a great deal of attention to the quantity of money   As for the problems in the markets as they relate to the viability of money market mutual   funds and so forth—if we have to choose, I don’t have any doubt as to what I’d choose, and that   would be to let the money market funds go  It would be inappropriate to try to save the money   market funds and pursue a monetary policy that doesn’t fit the needs of the aggregate economy    That doesn’t make any sense at all  I think we need to say very openly that we’re not going to   try to save an institution or industry if that action produces or could potentially produce   substantial damage to the economy as a whole     June 24-25, 2003 29 of 211      That sometimes happens, yes  [Laughter]  But I think the danger of a very   quick collapse, if you want to use that term, is easy to overestimate  I believe there’s likely to be   a lot more continuity in the process  First of all, we’d probably find that there’s a range of   money market mutual funds with different expense ratios, and it would not be too hard to   imagine that some of the management companies would absorb some of those costs for a while    Others might institute fees for processing checks  So there would be continuity  The banks have   the same situation, of course, with deposit accounts that in most cases don’t have any service   charges  The banks are going to need to start charging monthly service fees to handle deposit   accounts if rates remain very low for a long period of time     I thought that the staff discussion of the importance of the exit strategy was extremely   important  If we do something, we’d better figure out how we’re going to get out of it and what   the issues involved in that process are  That’s part of the problem with a policy that simply says   we’re going to peg the funds rate for some relatively long period of time or that we’re going to   move out the term structure and hold the one-year rate at zero or at 35 basis points or whatever    June 24-25, 2003 30 of 211    It’s very hard to get out of that  The more we get into targeting longer-term rates, the more   directly responsible we are for capital gains and losses that people realize when we change the   rate that we peg  What we want in my view is for the market essentially to be responsible for   making those judgments and not the central bank     So it seems to me that the best way to go if we get into this situation—and I agree with   Cathy that it’s not likely—is to focus on quantities, making sure that we force a lot of liquidity   into the system, and let rates go where they will  That will mean that the federal funds rate   frequently will trade right down at zero  That’s a consequence, and if we’re not willing to accept   that consequence, then we’re not going to be able to carry through on a policy that’s oriented   toward forcing liquidity into the system and targeting some quantities  That’s where I come out    I believe it’s very important before we get too deeply into the institutional detail to start with the   very simple proposition that we can’t fix both the price and the quantity  At some point we may   have to choose     I have a very brief comment about managing expectations  First of all, we   don’t want expectations that are formed now at our urging to be falsified by events  That’s not   good for anybody  I view that as extremely important, and I think that’s in part what Ned was   talking about  We need to be vague regarding the things about which we can’t be confident  We   don’t want to make statements that we really can’t be confident about  In particular, there may   June 24-25, 2003 55 of 211    be even an inherent contradiction in our expectations for interest rates and our expectations for   economic growth, for example  We think that expectations that short-term rates will be low for   some time to come will bring down long rates and foster a revival of the economy  But if we   have a vigorous economic revival, rates can’t stay as low as they are currently  So there’s some   inherent contradiction there, and I think we have to be very careful about how we discuss that    When we talk about managing expectations, it’s going to be very helpful to be quite explicit in   our thinking  We need to ask “expectations about what?”, and we ought to think about whether   those expectations are consistent with how we want the market to form its expectations     I’ll pass  I was going to talk about the disclosure issue, but I’ll pass at this   point   June 24-25, 2003 84 of 211      Thank you, Mr Chairman  My contacts in the transportation industry—at   UPS, FedEx, and a very large trucking company, JP Hunt—all report that current volumes are   essentially flat  They don’t see any improvement as yet  The way my FedEx contact put it,   there’s no increase in the number of packages on the belt at this point     Looking ahead, my UPS contact said that, in talking to their customers, he didn’t see any   signs of an increase—nothing more than the usual seasonal increase—during the busy fall   season  My FedEx contact was a bit more positive  In fact, I wrote down what he said, which   was that he was “pretty bullish” on the fall and beyond  I pressed him on what that really meant    He said “pretty bullish” means that he’s a bit more optimistic about modestly improved activity,   up from flat  [Laughter]  I also talked to him about capital spending plans, and I want to make a   point here that I view as quite important, and I think it bears on the interpretation of the survey   evidence as well  The capital spending plans for UPS and FedEx are both essentially flat, year   over year  Aircraft purchases are an important part of their spending plans, but they’re not   buying any new aircraft; all of their purchases are used aircraft from passenger airlines  They   put those expenditures into their capital spending plans, and that’s what they report to us  It does   not involve new production  Now, it’s true that we need to absorb some of the excess capacity in   industrial buildings and transportation equipment and so forth before we see a pickup in   production  But we want to be careful that we don’t interpret these reports as meaning that the   planned spending is going to feed directly into new production because some of it will simply   involve the absorption of excess capacity that already exists in a number of areas     June 24-25, 2003 102 of 211    I talked twice to my Wal-Mart contact, first on June 12, when he was particularly   interested in what was going to happen over the weekend; and I talked to him again the   following Monday  What he said on June 12 was that it doesn’t look pretty  That’s the way he   started off his remarks  Wal-Mart is seeing signs of what they interpret as liquidity pressures on   the household sector  People are buying more from need than from want is the way my contact   put it  As I’ve said a number of times in the past, Wal-Mart looks carefully at the way in which   spending is related to the receipt of paychecks  There’s a midmonth paycheck cycle, and   Wal-Mart is seeing more spending around the time when paychecks arrive  My contact also   mentioned that their new smaller grocery stores—I think they’re called New Market stores and   they’re much easier to get into and out of than the big Wal-Mart stores—are getting more traffic    While they don’t have many of these New Market stores, there is an increasing frequency of   shopping at these smaller facilities and a declining frequency of shopping at their large super   centers  Wal-Mart’s interpretation is that customers want to get in and out of the stores quickly   to get the items they have to have, like toilet paper and diapers, and are not so interested in   shopping for more discretionary items    My contact said that Wal-Mart is not optimistic that the tax bill will have a measurable   effect on their sales because most of the benefits are going to higher income people and not to   those who do the bulk of their spending at Wal-Mart  That was Wal-Mart’s expectation anyway    He also indicated concern about an inventory overhang because orders were placed some months   ago and the goods to be delivered will exceed what Wal-Mart views as the likely demand over   coming months  So he thought they were going to end up with more inventory than desired     Let me make just a couple of comments on deflation  I think several different aspects of   this issue need to be sorted out  On the demand side, to the buyers of goods, what is important,   June 24-25, 2003 103 of 211    of course, is not the price now relative to the price last month or last quarter but the expected   price in the future  That is how price is tied in with whether one is speeding up or delaying   outlays  I’m talking about the interaction between the prices and the quantities purchased  If   you think the goods are on sale, you may purchase them earlier than you would otherwise  If   you think the goods are going to be priced even lower next month or next quarter, you may delay   your purchase This applies only to goods that are storable, not to perishable goods or services   You can’t really store tomatoes  Maybe you can store tomato consumption utility, but you can’t   store the tomatoes themselves  So in terms of the behavior of buyers, what matters is the   durability and the rate of obsolescence  I went back and looked at the behavior of the durable   goods price index and the consumption of durable goods  What is interesting is that durable   goods prices have fallen in every quarter since the second quarter of 1996  They’ve been   declining for a long time  Of course, some of that involves high-tech goods, such as computers,   but part of it is automobiles  So it’s not that declining prices per se reduce purchases  If prices   are declining in a way that doesn’t lead to expectations of dramatic future declines, it may not   cause people to delay purchases  Prices of high-tech goods have been declining for a long time,   and people continue to buy them   On the producers’ side of the market, the issue applies not just to goods but also to   services because no producer wants to put in place expanded operations to produce services or   anything else if he doesn’t think he can recover the cost  So the expectations of future prices   relative to current prices apply across the entire range of goods on the producer side  There the   productivity part is critical—productivity and, of course, future production costs in general,   including wage costs and all other costs  If a producer believes that he can recover those costs,   even though the product prices are declining, then there’s no reason to pull back from the market    June 24-25, 2003 104 of 211    So the price story clearly interacts with the productivity story and the expected productivity   story  It is possible to have a perfectly reasonable equilibrium at high levels of employment and   production and with ongoing price declines, provided that the expectations of productivity   growth are adequate to support the continued investment in productive facilities  I wanted to   make that comment about deflation  I think the deflation story is not the total story with respect   to the current demand and production outlook  Thank you     Mr Chairman, I support the 25 basis point reduction, and I think your   discussion about the statement is right on the mark  It does leave open, of course, a possibility of   another 25 basis point cut in the future  That’s part of the purpose of doing it this way  That   being the case, we will get questions about where this easing process might end—whether   there’s a possibility of another 25 beyond that  In addressing those questions we could punt and   say that we’ll cross that bridge when we get to it  I don’t believe that would be the wise thing to   say  I think we need to be talking in much more definite terms about what it would mean to   move to a so-called nontraditional policy  It’s not that we expect to get there, and we should   emphasize that  I certainly don’t anticipate that we will get there  But I think we need to have a   coherent view of what it would mean if we did  That’s because such a policy regime is not over   June 24-25, 2003 146 of 211    the horizon as a remote possibility from the perspective of the marketplace but it’s actually out   there on the horizon as a genuine possibility  In my view the market understanding of what it   would mean is very, very weak  I don’t think people know what it would mean  If we do get to   that point, it will be important for us to make sure that money growth remains substantial, and I   would want to emphasize that we will pump funds into the system to be certain that happens    That’s essentially what it means if the funds rate actually goes to zero from time to time  I think   we need to talk about that because people will be asking us about it       I would argue against that on the ground that it will raise a lot of questions   about what that means in these circumstances  I’d leave it alone     Thank you, Mr Chairman  From a wide variety of contacts in the Eighth   District, including fairly large firms like the May Company and Enterprise Rent-A-Car as well as   a lot of small companies, the overall assessment of the business situation is along the lines of   “not yet”  It’s not that the economy is sinking but just that there’s no real surge of activity as yet     On a somewhat more hopeful basis, my contact at JB Hunt, which is one of the largest   trucking companies in the nation, said that intermodal transport business—that’s the piggyback   business with trucks and trains—is up 15 percent this July over last July  The higher traffic is in   the form of manufactured goods going westbound and imports from the West Coast coming back   eastbound  On the regular trucking side, no dramatic change has occurred, but business is a bit   better  The pickup started in the last third of June and seems to be continuing into the early days   of August  Again, I would emphasize that he described it as an uptick, certainly not a surge     August 12, 2003 48 of 110    My UPS contact said that he had just gotten back from Asia and that a noticeable pickup   was taking place in Japan; that’s how he led off our conversation  He characterized business in   the United States as essentially unchanged  My FedEx contact started off by saying that there   was no change in activity for them, no sign of inventory restocking  He does not expect to see   any particular change before the fall or beyond  Again, the tone was more hopeful, but nothing   really solid is in the works   My contact at Wal-Mart said that to him the data do not look as good as everyone seems   to think  Wal-Mart’s sales in July got a fair amount of press, but he noted that it’s relatively easy   to see improvement based on comparisons from last year because of the weak numbers a year   ago  He commented that Wal-Mart is not seeing very much from the childcare tax credit checks   that have gone out  Wal-Mart will cash those checks for customers  For checks cashed at their   stores, about 15 percent of the funds are being spent compared with about 25 percent of the   rebate checks that went out two years ago  As for the paycheck cycle that I’ve talked about   before, my contact reported that it was as pronounced in mid-July as in the one in May, which   was as pronounced as any for five years That is, people are coming in to shop when they get   their paychecks, which suggests that spending is liquidity constrained  He also said that the   company’s growth in sales is about two-thirds from increased traffic and about one-third from   increases in the amount being spent per each sales ticket  He prefers to see the proportions   reversed because that would indicate stronger underlying demand rather than that customers are   being taken from competitors  In my contact’s view, Wal-Mart’s inventories are in pretty good   shape, at only about 1 percent above the desired level  He thinks that other retailers are probably   somewhat more excessively overstocked than Wal-Mart and that inventories in the retail sector   August 12, 2003 49 of 110    in general are probably a bit above desired levels  So he did not foresee any inventory surge in   the near term   On the national level, I believe the Greenbook forecast makes a lot of sense  I view that   forecast as the median best guess, but I always like to think about the distribution around that   forecast  For the first time in several years, my own sense of the distribution is that it’s skewed   more to the right of that median  I think there’s more of a possibility of upside surprises  I’m   not saying that’s my best guess, but I think there’s more room for upside surprises than I’ve felt   for a couple of years  I’d point, for example, to the possibility of inventory accumulation, maybe   not right away but as we move into next year    I’d also like to emphasize the importance of corporate profits numbers going forward  If   we see some good corporate profits, I think that’s going to loosen the purse strings on capital   expenditures, and it’s going to make the stock market perform better  A virtuous cycle of all   sorts of things could flow from an improved corporate profits picture  So I think we’re on a   good track  I believe the takeoff is going to be slow, but to me the prospects ahead of us seem   much improved  Thank you     Mr Chairman, I support the recommendation to keep the federal funds   rate where it is  Let me talk briefly about the communication process  Ahead of communication   strategy logically comes the policy substance  We have to know what it is that we really want to   communicate, and I think sometimes that’s part of our problem  First of all, it’s easier to   communicate a policy decision—what the federal funds rate is going to be—because we pick the   number  And it’s relatively easy to explain the reasons for that decision in terms of the   background of the recent data  It is much more difficult to communicate conditions under which   we might change the rate in the future—the response rule or the policy rule, if you will  It’s the   regularity or predictability of the response that the market really wants to know because to a   great extent that determines what people will do and affects the decisions they make  I don’t   August 12, 2003 77 of 110    think we’re necessarily of one mind around the table about what our response rule will look like    I will tell you what my view of it is in a very general form in the current situation  I think we are   likely to want to keep the funds rate at the current level unless we see a very good reason to   change it  That is, I believe we would tend to hang back from changing the rate until there is   some compelling reason to do so  If the economy is weaker than expected, there’s a lot of room   for longer-term rates to fall, which would provide more monetary accommodation without our   doing anything  I think we’re unlikely to want to raise rates quickly to fight inflationary   pressures because we’re not likely to confront such pressures in the immediate future  But I feel   quite strongly that we should not commit ourselves to any given length of time that the rate   would remain where it is  In sum, I believe it is very difficult to explain the policy response   function that we might follow looking ahead   So my instinct on this is that we should minimize—absolutely minimize—the   foreshadowing of likely future changes in policy and concentrate on what we are doing right   now  Therefore, I would prefer to see the balance of risks statement provide no hint about future   policy in terms of a final sentence about the two risks taken together  It seems to me that the   market is going to read that as a forecast of the probable future direction to policy, whereas I   personally think we ought to be telling the market that we’re going to be on hold at a 1 percent   funds rate for the foreseeable future      Cathy, if I understand what you’re saying, you’re recommending that we   simply drop that last sentence?     I would associate myself with that position—whether or not it’s yours     Dropping the last sentence would be a good idea in my view  I read that   next-to-the-last sentence as a pretty clear signal that we’re going to be on hold for the foreseeable   future because of the concern about a possible further decline in inflation  Making the statement   very, very terse, which dropping that last sentence does, seems to me to send a signal that we’re   going to stand where we are—that we’re satisfied with the current stance of policy and that’s   where we’re going to be  I think making the statement very terse in and of itself sends that   message     Bob McTeer had to depart to catch a plane     Mr Chairman, if I may, I’d like to follow up on the discussion that Tom   Hoenig—      Okay  Let met try to sharpen this issue by saying that I think we need to   make a clear distinction between two types of comments in our press statement  One type is a   hint or guidance about the likely level of the federal funds target at our next meeting or the one   after that and the other is a conditional statement about where the funds rate might go depending   on how the economy evolves     Well, I guess I’m saying that I didn’t think that distinction was very clear   in what Vincent had put on the table   2  I prepared two charts and, if I may, I’ll pass them around  There are   certainly enough for everyone at the table and probably for those sitting on the perimeter as well    I’ll wait until the charts are distributed  The purpose of my exploration here was to try to get a   sense of how frequently the economic situation has changed over the years, even over a span of                                                    2 The materials used by Mr Poole are attached to this transcript (appendix 2)   September 15, 2003 18 of 78    three months, so that we decide to move the funds rate or the market anticipates that we will   move it  That’s the purpose of this chart  If everyone has a copy, I’ll try to explain what it   shows   To try to keep things as simple as I could, the basic data I used were from the federal   funds futures market  I’ve plotted the daily quote on the business day closest to the fifteenth of   the last month of the quarter and the contemporaneous forecast in the futures market as indicated   by the trading for the contract that is three months ahead  So for the March 15, let’s say, the   contract for March is the current, or actual, rate  Then there’s the futures rate as of March 15 for   the June contract  Okay?  The red dots show what the market was anticipating on that three-  month-ahead horizon  The black line shows what I’m calling the actual change  It’s the   difference between the current month’s contract—let’s say the March contract as quoted on   March 15—and the June contract as quoted on June 15     What is fairly clear is that most of the time the market predicts a rate change over this   three-month horizon of about 25 basis points, and often it is quite a bit less  But over time there   are many cases in which developments have pushed the rate a good deal more than that  The   reason I used three months was that it—or something in the range of three months to six   months—seemed likely to be what many people think of as the “foreseeable future,” in terms of   the language that we’ve used in the balance of risks statement  So I’m saying that even over a   three-month period, which is not all that long, historically lots of things have happened that have   led the Committee to change the funds rate  The chart on the other side of the page is just a   scatter diagram of the same data; it shows how far off the actual is from the predicted rate   defined in this way     September 15, 2003 19 of 78    The point that I’m getting at here relates to whether providing a tilt is helpful  When we   talked about the tilt language—I guess it was in late 1999—I was one of those in favor of the   decision we made at that time to announce the tilt at the conclusion of each meeting  I favored   doing that because I thought it would provide guidance to the markets, looking ahead, as to   where our policy might be going and what our thinking was  But I’ve since come to a different   opinion on that because so often something happens in the meantime to change the situation to   such an extent that providing that guidance has as much chance of misleading as of helping the   markets    I think this is a topic that we should spend some time on  To what extent do we want to   provide information such as the tilt statement or a hint that is more or less specific about the   future path of the federal funds rate in an unconditional sense?  Trying to explain how we   logically will respond to new information is an extremely important function, but I think that’s a   difficult concept to get across  That’s the topic that I was chomping at the bit to talk about     It’s only a three-month horizon     I think the reason the scatter is as narrow as it is reflects the fact that there   are a lot of observations when not much is going on and the market doesn’t expect much, if any,   changing  The first part of 1997 was such a period, when the rate stayed in a very narrow band   for a while  Obviously, the 1991-92 period was quite different, as was 1994, although the market   anticipated some rate changes in ’94 once the FOMC started to move the funds rate  In fact, the   rate changes outran what the market had anticipated by a fair amount  Remember, what I have   September 15, 2003 20 of 78    charted here are changes  In the last year or so, the market has not expected us to change the rate   very much, although on a couple of occasions we did a good bit more than the market   anticipated     When I read Dave Lindsey’s history of FOMC communications, I was struck by the   historical experience going well back  Dave covered a long period, and most of it was before we   began to issue a policy statement; but hints about the future direction of policy were given at   times—primarily by the Chairman in speeches or testimony The instances when the FOMC got   itself most tangled up had to do with setting up expectations in the marketplace about what future   policy moves were likely to be  We had the biggest difficulties when those expectations were   not realized or when they tended to put the Committee in a box because of a sense that we had   made some sort of a commitment and circumstances changed so that following through didn’t   seem the wisest thing to do       With regard to anchoring expectations, I absolutely agree with respect to   the long-term inflation rate  I think anchoring those expectations is critically important  But   September 15, 2003 22 of 78    you’ve yet to convince me that anchoring expectations on the number of basis points the federal   funds rate is going to move over a period of a relatively few months is constructive      No, I don’t draw that conclusion because even if we didn’t say anything   about the probable direction of the federal funds rate, the market would have some understanding   of how the economy is likely to evolve  For example, there’s a lot of persistence in real GDP   and employment changes  So the market has some understanding as to the probabilities of where   the economy is going to go and, therefore, where interest rates are going to go  And, of course,   that’s what is built into the term structure of interest rates at any moment in time  There is also   an extensive volume of literature—and Governor Bernanke can help me with this—on exactly   how the expectations model of the term structure of interest rates works  Clearly, the term   structure reflects market expectations about where rates are going to go  That was true before   1994 and would be independent of anything that we might have said about that  But what I’m   concerned about is that we want those expectations to respond to the incoming information as   accurately as possible            Yes, of course     I would say that providing guidance on our thinking about the direction of   the real economy and the inflation outlook is constructive  What I am concerned about is   providing guidance about the likely level of the federal funds rate at the next meeting or the one   after that     I’m trying to sharpen that distinction     And depending on how the economy evolves     May be going     A point that I don’t think has come up yet is the fact that we’re talking to a   number of different audiences  With regard to our political accountability—talking to the   Congress and the general public—I think we do just fine, and I believe the current publication   schedule for the minutes fully serves that audience  In terms of talking to the markets, Cathy and   Jamie mentioned the traders, and I’d certainly like to draw a distinction between the traders and   the portfolio managers  The traders make their money from reading tea leaves, hot tips, and   understanding little nuances  What they really want to know is what our thinking is about the   federal funds rate at the next meeting or the possibility of intermeeting changes in the rate  They   don’t very much care about why or the underlying reasons    To speak to the point that Gary talked about, moving up the release of the minutes, I   think the argument against that is that we’d really be speaking to the traders who are trying to   divine what we are going to do at the next meeting  They care about the policy action rather than   about the underlying rationale for the policy  So actually I think there’s a real advantage in   separating the minutes, as well as some of the logistic issues that we’ve talked about, from the   specific meeting to which they apply  That allows the minutes to be interpreted by those who   care about trying to understand the reasons for the underlying policy and not just the action we   took at that particular meeting and a forecast of the action we’re going to take next     I would also emphasize that we’ve used the words “formulaic” and   “boilerplate” in this discussion  Those words have negative connotations, obviously  What   we’re talking about is standard language with a standard meaning  So I want to be sure that we   don’t convey any of the negative connotations  I think that’s quite important   September 15, 2003 60 of 78    In my view, separating the balance of risks into the inflation part and the growth part is   important, but I agree with Mike that we really need to stress-test the language  I think we’re   going to have a problem at some point saying that real growth is too high or the unemployment   rate is too low  We have to make sure that we know what we’re going to do when we get to the   point that we’re concerned about undue pressures on resources—or however we want to phrase   it     I have a lot of misgivings about the third sentence  I forget the exact terminology, but we   use the words “on balance,” and I think the market reads that simply as our hint about what   we’re going to do at the next meeting  So I would like to take that out     There’s language in the Bluebook on page 10 that we’ve used for a long   time      There’s something to be said for consistency     The language in the Bluebook on page 10 under “directive wording” is   actually broken into two parts  The second sentence starts “To further its long-run objectives,”   which refers to the objectives specified in the first sentence     On this same point, I’d like to throw out an option to consider, though I’m   not sure that I’m even in favor of it  I think it’s going to become generally known that we’re   going to continue our discussion of communication issues in January  What I worry about is that   this paragraph coming out in the minutes released on Thursday is going to generate a whole lot   of questions  When are they going to do it?  What are they thinking about?  Why is this here?     I understand that  The question I’d raise is whether we couldn’t diffuse   some of the sense of immediacy—the expectation that we might make some changes at the next   meeting or some time relatively soon—by simply saying that the Committee agreed to continue   this discussion at its January meeting  That would take the immediacy out of it     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The discrepancy between the market   assumption and the Greenbook assumption for the funds rate path is as large as it has been in a   long time  So I would like to come back to a point that I’ve argued before, which is that the   Greenbook baseline ought to be conditioned on the market’s expectation of the federal funds rate   path  I say that because the market’s expectation is consistent with the term structure of interest   rates and all sorts of other data that are incorporated in the starting point, so to speak, for the   forecast  Using the market assumption would seem to me also to have the advantage of getting   the Board staff out of the business of making an assumption regarding the path of the funds rate,   which I understand is necessarily awkward  The alternative simulations could then be built   around that market-based expectation  The staff could say, for example, that if one thinks the   Committee is going to stay with a lower federal funds rate longer than the market anticipates,   September 16, 2003 25 of 106    these are the consequences for the outlook—with perhaps symmetrical consequences on the   other side  In any event, we currently have one of the largest discrepancies between the market’s   view and the Greenbook baseline that we’ve seen for a long time   There’s also a covariance here across the various things that might happen  I’m   guessing—just guessing—that the reason for the market’s expectation could be a stronger   baseline outlook for investment  That would be a reason that credit demands would be growing   and the economy would be strong, and it would be a logical basis for the expectation that the   Committee would likely respond by raising the federal funds rate  I know we’ve talked about   this issue before; we’ve actually had some correspondence about it  Nevertheless, I would put in   a plea for you to reconsider the baseline that you use for the Greenbook assumption     I’m certainly not arguing against receiving your best judgment  I’m just   saying that I think your best judgment would be better displayed by taking the market   assumption as your baseline Then you could show that the consequences going forward are as   you suggested in this case and that’s the reason you don’t think the economy is likely to evolve   that way  I believe that would be an easier way of structuring that argument  That would be my   preference      There would be a way, in principle at least, of getting some evidence on   this  I don’t know how far back in the past we could look at the Greenbook assumption for the   funds rate and compare it systematically with the contemporaneous market assumption to see   which one turned out to be closer to the way things evolved  Certainly, if the evidence on that is   decisive, to me that would help to make the case that at least the baseline outlook should be   structured one way rather than the other way  I know that in the earlier Greenbooks the   assumption wasn’t displayed explicitly  There was obviously some assumption there  It may   have been more conventional; I don’t know  But in principle one could get a handle on which   method is likely to be more useful      Thank you, Mr Chairman  My Wal-Mart contact was at pains to tell me   that business isn’t as good as it looks; same-store sales seemed better because of weak year-ago   data  Wal-Mart had been anticipating a 3 to 5 percent gain in August, and the actual increase   was 66 percent—so it was a little better  But he indicated that the underlying improvement,   abstracting from weak year-ago data, was more in the 50 to 80 basis point range  He made a   number of specific observations suggesting that Wal-Mart’s clientele, at least, continues to suffer   a lot from liquidity strain  He dated the pickup in sales as beginning in July, which he attributed   to the cut in income tax withholding  He didn’t think the child tax rebate checks had done very   much for retail sales  When Wal-Mart cashed those checks for its customers, only about   14 percent of the money was being spent at the store  Some of it was spent on typical big-ticket   items—say, a down payment on a TV or something like that—but surprisingly, the second most   frequently purchased item on their sales tickets was a money order  Apparently people were   buying money orders in order to pay other bills—that was his interpretation  He said that a lot of   small items, such as cereal and prepaid phone cards and so forth, were also on the sales tickets   My Wal-Mart contact reported that survey data suggest that consumers are still quite   concerned about economic issues  In a survey taken in July 2002, 46 percent of the respondents   noted concerns that had something to do with the economy as opposed to, say, the war on   terrorism  In July 2003, a higher proportion—51 percent—cited economic worries  In terms of   the more detailed answers, fear of job loss was cited by 8½ percent of the respondents in July   2002 and by 138 percent in July 2003; the comparable figures for concern about personal   September 16, 2003 52 of 106    financial stability, were 115 percent and 168 percent, respectively  So these economic concerns   continued and indeed were higher than they had been in the past     My contact also reported that people are still shopping at the opening price point  They   buy the cheapest item in a line of shirts, for example  And focus group information suggests that   people are increasingly shopping at what he called the dollar stores  Moreover, shoppers are   buying smaller packages of items such as diapers  I don’t know how many diapers there are in a   pack  [Laughter]  I haven’t shopped for those for a long time  But apparently people are   becoming more hard pressed financially, so instead of buying a regular-sized package they buy   one with few diapers even though the cost per diaper might be higher  They don’t want to make   the outlay for the package that costs more  His general message in citing these types of   anecdotes was that a lot of consumers are constrained by liquidity pressures   My UPS contact reports that nothing much has changed  In particular, UPS is not seeing,   as it sometimes does, special charters out of Asia where a company will hire an entire plane to   bring in garments, computer equipment, leather goods, or items like that  On the other hand, my   FedEx contact said that business very clearly is picking up  He noted that for the first time in   eleven quarters there is now positive growth, year over year, in the domestic express business,   and he said that activity in the pipeline is robust  FedEx has just finished reviewing information   on 200 accounts, and 90 percent of them are projecting increases in shipments in the coming   period  The ground business is also picking up  He said that he sees some signs that customers   are rebuilding inventories  He used the term “a significant pickup,” which is a rather different   message than the one conveyed by the other respondents I mentioned  In the trucking business,   my contact at JB Hunt reported that he sees a small but definite pickup  “A little breeze in the   air” was the way he put it  So things are looking better there as well     September 16, 2003 53 of 106    Let me make just a few other very brief comments  I want to reinforce a point that Jamie   Stewart made about whether the economy is likely to stall out if we don’t see employment   growth  Obviously, we all want to see employment growth  But if employment remains about   where it is, let’s say, I don’t understand why that should lead to the economy stalling out  We   will have continued income growth through wage growth  And with productivity increases we   should see very good profit growth, which should certainly support expansion of capital   spending  I note that money growth as measured by both M2 and MZM remains healthy, at   about 8 percent in the last twelve months and 10 percent in the last six months  So its growth is   rising  As I look ahead, it seems, to me anyway, that the time is eventually going to come when   this pervasive air of caution is going to give way to a fear of missing the boom  I don’t know   how long that transition is going to take, but at some point I think we’re going to see that switch   in attitudes  In such circumstances, the business environment could change relatively rapidly     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I certainly support the recommendation that   we keep the funds rate where it is  Let me try not to get into the wording issue but discuss what   September 16, 2003 83 of 106    in my view is the substance  First, I want to talk about the probability distribution rather than   just the word “risk” for the moment  On the inflation rate my own view is that the probabilities   going forward are roughly symmetric around the average inflation experience of the last six to   twelve months  I believe the situation is different from what we had in the spring because there   is a noticeable pickup in activity  On growth, I think the distribution is roughly symmetric   around the consensus forecast  But I also believe that growth modestly above the consensus   forecast is both desirable and sustainable  I don’t think that would cause us any problems; in my   view the economy has room to run at a faster rate  So I don’t regard an upside surprise—  provided it’s not an outsized surprise—as a risk to the sustainability of the economic advance     I agree that it’s important to try not to rock the boat but to attempt to evolve this   language  My preference would be to work at this by going in a slightly different direction    Given my view of the probabilities, I would go for balanced risks on inflation because with the   price stability outlook my view is that the probabilities are more or less balanced  I do believe   that, going forward, the risks to price stability on both sides are relatively muted  So in the last   sentence, I would say something along the lines that we can “maintain an accommodative policy   for the considerable period in which we expect the risks to price stability to remain muted”  That   makes the accommodative policy conditional on the maintenance of low risks to price stability     I won’t destroy my notes as I usually do after each meeting     Is there any regular pattern or expected pattern in Japan as to what fraction   of the intervention is sterilized?     So essentially the mechanism involves full sterilization of the exchange   market intervention except for this period of a few weeks?  The way you described it, that’s how   it sounded to me       Okay     Thank you     I agree with Jack that we need to do some hard background work and have   an extended session in January to review where we want to go on this  One dimension of this on   the table is the issue that Ned raised at the outset having to do with objectives and whether we   can usefully sharpen that language  I think another very important dimension that we need to   address is the extent to which we want to foreshadow or hint about the future policy direction    My own view is that whenever we regard the risks as unbalanced—I’ll say seriously unbalanced   just to make my point clear—we should move the funds rate right away  We should move it at   the meeting when we recognize or make an assessment that the risks are seriously unbalanced    So my preference would be that we use the balanced risk assessment as the explanation for why   the adjustment did not take place at the current meeting and that we never have an unbalanced   risk assessment going forward—or at least not seriously unbalanced  If the risks were that   unbalanced, my position is that we already would have adjusted policy  At any rate, I consider   this an important dimension that we need to focus on  I don’t think we can come up with the   appropriate language around the table today in a situation like this but that’s another aspect of   our communication policy that we must spend time on   October 28, 2003 97 of 126      Obviously there’s a whole continuum here     I understand that, of course  My concern is that making a statement that   the risks are unbalanced and yet not wanting that to be interpreted as a hint about the probable   direction of policy is a very difficult language act to pull off  I think the market routinely views   the unbalanced risk assessment as a hint about or at least some probability regarding the future   direction of policy     I’m uncomfortable doing that because my view is that the policy   adjustments are primarily driven by surprises or by the new information that we can’t predict    That’s why I believe that providing these hints causes problems more than it helps  I’m just   saying that that’s something we need to discuss     We need to reach some agreement on that  I’m not trying to say that we   can come to an agreement here today  But I think some people want to provide that hint about   October 28, 2003 98 of 126    the likely direction of policy  I did when I first came here  But I’ve changed my mind in living   through issuing these statements as to whether or not those hints are really constructive       Would the proposal be not to have any statement after a meeting even if   we change policy?  Would we let everything ride until we publish the minutes?  If we’re going to   have a statement anyway, we’re still going to have a struggle with the wording of a statement      Well, that’s easy, if there’s no explanation     Is this the stress test?  [Laughter]     Dave, on the monetary aggregates—both M2 and MZM show no net   growth over the last three months, and bank credit has actually declined a bit  Is there a story or   anything interesting behind those observations?       Thank you, Mr Chairman  You may have seen several weeks ago a Wall   Street Journal article on the transportation industry  Given that several major transportation   companies are located in the Eighth District, I thought I would comment on that industry  My   FedEx contact said that he was not as bullish about the outlook as the view conveyed in the Wall   Street Journal article  He said, in particular, that the higher-value business—the more expensive   goods that are often shipped by air—does not seem to be coming back though the lower-value   ground business is rebounding more quickly  He provided some data on the ground business that   show fairly striking increases in growth  In the middle of this year, the ground business at FedEx   was about 1 percent above year-ago levels, and it’s now running in the neighborhood of 6 to   7 percent ahead of last year’s figures  Moreover, my contact indicated that FedEx is expecting in   the first half of 2004 year-over-year increases in the 10 percent range  He says he is much more   October 28, 2003 37 of 126    confident about growth than he has been for some time  It’s not that the expected growth is all   that high but that it seems a good bit more certain that a solid recovery is under way  He expects   the growth in express business—air shipment only—to increase from the current 1 to 2 percent   on a year-over-year basis to about 4 to 5 percent by next spring  So he anticipates a pickup in   that segment of the business as well     FedEx had a five-year expansion plan to double its ground capacity  UPS, of course, is   the major company in that business, but FedEx has been catching up in recent years  FedEx   officials had been discussing deferring some of that capacity increase but have now decided to   proceed with their aggressive expansion plan  Business is continuing to shift from express to   ground  That’s a consequence of the push toward lower-cost shipments but also reflects the fact   that the speed of ground delivery has improved  That is, the features of the ground network have   been improved, and packages can be delivered more quickly than before  So in terms of speed,   it’s more competitive with the delivery schedules that have been available in air shipments for a   long time  The weakest part of the business is in outbound express from the United States    FedEx continues to have a big imbalance of shipments, with much more volume coming in than   going out The firm sees the international situation as quite strong, especially in Asia including   Japan  In fact, the situation in Japan is looking much better  Business is lagging in Latin   America, however, and is hurting in Europe primarily because of slow growth in Germany  As   for the labor situation, Fed Ex has very low—in fact record low—turnover in its employment   force, particularly among lower-skilled workers, such as package handlers  The company sees   no wage pressures in either the lower-skilled or the more-skilled levels of its staff  In the latter   category, for example, a lot of pilots are available     October 28, 2003 38 of 126    My UPS contact said that, for the first time in well over two years, they are seeing strong   growth as they go into the fourth quarter, which of course is the big holiday season—growth that   will exceed the expectations they had earlier in the year  He anticipates that the fourth quarter   will be very, very strong  UPS reports that computer companies are increasing their shipments   and that shipping for the mail order business is strong  My contact pointed out, however, that the   UPS numbers are somewhat affected by the fact that shippers signed a lot of contracts in 1997   right after a strike, so as those contracts now roll over, UPS is picking up some of that business   again  The company’s numbers look a little stronger as a consequence  The cargo industry in   general is very busy, partly because of military lifts to Iraq, but my contact indicated that the   military business is not the whole story at all     Let me turn to the trucking industry  My contact at JB Hunt said that from his   perspective the Wall Street Journal article substantially overstated the strength in the   transportation industry  My Hunt contact has not seen a major turnaround in any area of Hunt’s   business  The freight business is a little stronger than last year, registering an increase of about   3½ percent in volume  Their intermodal business—the piggyback or rail–truck combination—is   much stronger now on a year-over-year-basis, but that reflects the fact that the West Coast ports   were shut down a year ago  Moreover, based on what he knows about the situation among   competitors, he sees no indication of a surge anywhere in the trucking industry  Some stories of   tightness in that market might be coming along, however, as a consequence of the reduction in   capacity  A lot of trucking companies have gone under, and drivers continue to be in tight   supply  He noted also that, on January 4, new rules for drivers go into effect that increase the   required rest periods or reduce the maximum number of hours of driving  He saw one   calculation that these changes will require 84,000 new drivers nationally  Apparently there   October 28, 2003 39 of 126    aren’t that many drivers around ready to be picked up  So if that number is correct, we might see   at least some temporary disruption until some of us decide to seek a more lucrative occupation!    [Laughter]  The old rules that are being changed, by the way, have been in place since 1939     I might share an observation from a member of our board about a company named   Kimball International  What I remember about Kimball is that it used to make pianos, but   apparently it now manufactures high-end office furniture  He said that Kimball has experienced   a surge in orders for office furniture in just the past four weeks  Orders were “picking up at a   rapid pace” is the way he put it  I thought that was an interesting piece of information   I recently talked with my Wal-Mart contact—at the end yesterday afternoon actually—  and he said that September sales had been a little stronger than expected  Wal-Mart had been   anticipating a year-over-year increase in same-store sales of 3 to 5 percent, and it came in at   56 percent  He pointed out, though, that the weather had been unusually good in September  He   said that retailers often use weather as an excuse to explain low sales, but he was citing weather   as the reason that Wal-Mart had a better performance than had been anticipated  September   came in somewhat below August, however; but as I think I mentioned last time, August sales had   been significantly stronger than anticipated because of the large volume of clearance goods   For October, Wal-Mart had been expecting an increase of 3 to 5 percent in same-store   sales, and to date—as of yesterday afternoon—sales for the month were up about 47 percent    He noted that two-thirds of the sales gain is coming from increased traffic rather than the average   size of the sales ticket  My contact views that as just an indication that Wal-Mart is taking   customers from its competitors  He continues to see evidence of significant liquidity pressures in   the household sector  For example, a predominance of items in the shopping basket continues to   be concentrated at the opening price point of various product lines  Moreover, the midmonth   October 28, 2003 40 of 126    paycheck cycle that I’ve talked about before is still evident and in fact is more pronounced than   at any time in the last three to five years  People are shopping when they get their paychecks,   and that’s true even for purchases of food and pharmaceuticals  So Wal-Mart interprets its data   as an indication that households remain liquidity constrained     My contact believes that there has been some improvement but that it is “stalled” at an   increase in growth of about 50 to 80 basis points  He does not see sales growth getting better and   better week by week  There had been a pickup around the middle of the year or sometime in   August, but he sees no ongoing signs of higher growth  He said that inventories are generally in   pretty good shape  Some items are a bit understocked and some a bit overstocked; apparel   particularly was a little on the high side  But inventories overall for Wal-Mart are close to   desired levels  As for the outlook, compared with some other firms whose views he was aware   of, he thought Wal-Mart was among the most optimistic and had the most solid commitment to   continuing capital expansion  At a lot of other companies that he was familiar with, plans were   on hold and there were no anticipated increases in capacity at all  The only capital spending   occurring or in prospect was directed toward productivity improvement and not capacity   expansion  Thank you, Mr Chairman       I was going to comment that I think the minutes that will come out on   Thursday are going to help a lot  On page 14 there’s some important language that emphasizes   that the “considerable period” has to be interpreted in the context of the evolution of the   economy, not in the context of calendar time  I believe that language is going to help to get us to   a much better position in the future  I would also note that there’s an old saying that the best tax   system is an old tax system  I think that’s probably true of communication strategy as well  We   need to develop a standard strategy  If we’re going to be reviewing our communication policy at   some length later, it’s best not to have a whole series of changes along the way until we complete   our review  In the meantime, we should let the issue sit as quietly as possible     Presumably part of the answer there is that the capital flows of private   investors have declined substantially  A lot more of the capital flows are official than was the   case last year or the year before, and official capital flows are not motivated by the same rate-of-  return considerations that private capital flows are  I have a question about the Japanese   holdings of US dollar assets  How much of that is held in the central bank?  What happens   when the value of the dollars is measured in yen?  The Bank of Japan has incurred a substantial   loss on those assets  What happens as the Bank of Japan’s capital position deteriorates?  Is there   a possibility that the Bank of Japan on paper could show no capital?  They’re also at risk because   they hold a lot of government bonds that are subject to declines in price if the Japanese economy   really starts to move     Well, I think there are two questions  One question is whether it matters   to the economist; the other is whether it matters to the market  I think I know the answer for the   economist  I’m not sure I know the answer for the market, and that’s why I asked the person   who knows   December 9, 2003 9 of 133      We have this issue potentially as well  Our issue is complicated a bit—or   differs from the issue in Japan—because we have member banks that are shareholders and I   think that under the law the member bank capital is actually at risk under the Federal Reserve   Act  I’m asking the question particularly for Japan, but it does apply to us, too     Of dollar reserves?     Well, there was an article in the Financial Times  That article also pointed   out something that I thought was quite interesting  It said that the Bank of Japan is moving away   from valuing its balance sheet on a current market value basis and toward valuing it on an   amortized original cost basis  That, of course, would protect the appearance of the balance sheet,   though not the reality, should there be a large depreciation in the value of their government bond   holdings     December 9, 2003 10 of 133      I’d like to see a proposal that’s pretty close to A—I’ll call it A prime—  that would focus on the reasons for the policy decision at the meeting and would have a minimal   amount of forward-looking elements  So when we judge the risks to be roughly balanced, we   leave the federal funds rate alone  When we judge that the risks are becoming unbalanced in a   particular direction, we either raise the funds rate or lower it, and that risk assessment would be   the explanation of why we took the action we did  That’s point number one—that I think we   could recast A along those lines   Second, I would urge that the stress-testing take the actual situations we faced at the   meetings of, let’s say, the last five years and determine what we would have done with regard to   the statement at each of those meetings  There may be some scenarios you would want to stress   test in addition to that  But I would like to see history rerun, if you will, to see what the   statement would have looked like in September 1998 or whatever under each proposal   December 9, 2003 116 of 133      I have two questions on the inflation outlook, and I’ll put them in the   context of the Phillips equation, which has an inflation expectations term, a gap term, a shock   term, and a disturbance term or random term  You talked about the inflation expectations terms    You talked some about the gap term  Certainly from Orphanides’ work we know that there can   be a lot of hazards in that gap  I’m wondering if you could comment on the standard errors   associated with that gap calculation  There are different views about what potential output is and   also, of course, exactly where we are today  But you didn’t talk at all about the shock term and I   think that a significant part of the R2 of a standard Phillips equation is coming from the   commodity and exchange rate shocks  What are the magnitudes of those, and what is the speed   with which those effects are transmitted into the price indexes?  Can you give us just a rough,   ballpark idea on that?     Whichever way you want to express the gap     That’s for the total or the core?     Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  My contacts have somewhat different views   on the situation  A number of people have said that the economy just doesn’t feel like one in   which GDP growth is 82 percent  I think there may be some explanation for why the perception   doesn’t match the data  On the trucking side, my contact at JB Hunt reports that they are seeing   a modest upswing in business though not a huge improvement  He notes, however, that drivers   are in tight supply     My contacts at FedEx and UPS have a considerably more buoyant outlook  At FedEx the   word is that all arrows are up by a fairly substantial amount  FedEx is expecting a good holiday   season  Even the express business is showing growth in volume and revenue at this point  It was   not earlier  Moreover, based on contacts with customers, FedEx expects further increases in   growth  FedEx anticipates that, for the next six months, express business will be up at a   December 9, 2003 42 of 133    4½ percent rate, ground business at a 10 percent plus rate, and freight at a 9½ percent rate  My   contact at UPS started off by saying, “We’re getting the doors blown off with volume”  He   noted that a lot of the volume is driven by sales over the Internet and by phone sales for holiday   season packages  So the retail firms shipping packages to people are driving that volume  In   fact, the volume has been great enough that the huge automated facility in Louisville has been   operating at capacity on a number of days  UPS actually has added legs to its aircraft, sending   some of the packages to other facilities to be sorted because the Louisville facility is operating at   capacity  My contact said that UPS has been revising up its projections for the holiday season    Business in Asia is picking up tremendously, and in Europe the projection is for 8 percent   growth in business next year  In South America, no growth is expected, nor is much expansion   anticipated in Mexico either   I talked twice recently to my Wal-Mart contact  He also started out by saying that the   economy doesn’t feel as if it is growing at an 82 percent rate, and he noted that Wal-Mart   suppliers agree with that assessment  In my conversation with him last Friday morning he said   that Wal-Mart had never been particularly optimistic about the holiday season this year and that   its sales experience has been about as expected  There are a number of press reports about   holiday sales being less buoyant than the optimists had hoped  My Wal-Mart contact pointed   particularly to what to me is an interesting phenomenon regarding the so-called retail blitz, the   day after Thanksgiving  He said that once the parking lots are full—and that was true for   Wal-Mart this year—the only way their stores can post increased dollar volume is if consumers   are buying more-expensive goods, particularly the consumer electronics that have the bigger   price tags  But given the deflation in consumer electronics—he said those prices are 15 to   20 percent lower than last year—it requires a huge increase in volume for the dollar sales to go   December 9, 2003 43 of 133    up  Retailers in particular look at dollar sales; they make their comparisons on the basis of   dollars, not so much on volume  He was very optimistic, however, about the first quarter—  anticipating substantial effects from the tax refund checks that will be going out because of   overwithholding of income taxes  We must have some estimates of how big that is going to be    We didn’t talk about that earlier     I think there are a couple of puzzles in the national situation  I see lots of very buoyant   data, but I find the financial data—the actual declines in the money stock and in bank credit—  quite unusual and something of a puzzle  I’d also note that the latest employment report showed   a very large discrepancy between the household and payroll surveys  The payroll survey gets all   the press  In the last two months, taking the two months together, payroll employment was up   194,000 whereas household employment showed an increase of 103 million  That’s a very, very   large discrepancy  Now, we know that the payroll survey has problems picking up births and   deaths of firms  So if we are in a period with a lot of births—new firms coming along—it’s   possible that the payroll data are not picking up some of them  We won’t know until   February 2005, I suppose, because in February of next year we’ll get the benchmark revision   through March of this year  So we’re not going to know that for quite some time   My Wal-Mart contact pointed out that its Sam’s Club sales are very, very strong  He said   that Wal-Mart has been emphasizing sales to small businesses  Small businesses buy a lot at   Sam’s Club; they stock up on supplies, including items such as toilet paper and paper towels  He   noted that business memberships at Sam’s Club have been rising at double-digit rates  A year   ago the growth in business memberships was flat, but a surge in the number of business people   taking out individual or business memberships began about nine months ago  My contact says   that the evidence is clouded, however, by the fact that Wal-Mart initiated a big promotion with   December 9, 2003 44 of 133    small businesses  So it is unclear whether the surge is just a reflection of the promotion taking   hold or of some fundamental change in the small business sector   I agree with a couple of earlier comments that the inflation risks now are surely   symmetrical and not tilted to the downside  Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The way I tend to approach this is that I want   to be very clear in my own mind about what I believe before I try to talk about how to   communicate it  So let me start with what I believe   I think that the inflation risks are balanced and that the output risks are balanced  I   believe there is a lot of room for the economy to grow  I don’t think we’re likely to press upon   any speed limit issues, and in my view even very robust growth is not likely to cause imbalances   that are going to get us into trouble  So in that sense I think we could have output growth   significantly above—I hope not below—the Greenbook forecast without causing problems     I realize that a lot of people are concerned about the zero bound issue, although as I think   most of you know my personal inflation target is perhaps at the bottom of the range deemed   desirable by Committee as a whole  At any rate, for those concerned about the zero bound, I   think that issue is going to arise primarily in an economy that is weakening—one that needs the   support provided by pushing real interest rates down below zero  That doesn’t seem to be the   December 9, 2003 95 of 133    prospect  Therefore, if in the next year the inflation rate stays below what one would like as a   long-run target, it seems to me that it’s very unlikely to cause any problem in an economy that is   growing robustly  In my view, there is some risk that inflation could run above the rate in the   Greenbook forecast, and that could cause us a lot of pain  I think that could be a difficult   situation to deal with   I agree that this is not the right time to start raising rates  When I walked in here my view   was to try to change the statement along the following lines  In the paragraph reviewing our   assessment of the current situation, I would say that the inflation risks are balanced and that the   output risks are balanced  In that case we wouldn’t need to indicate which is the predominant   concern; we could just eliminate that sentence altogether  I’d also delete the “considerable   period” sentence altogether—making the statement a very lean and spare one—understanding   that removing that sentence probably would produce a negative reaction in the markets this   afternoon  But people would get over that  Then we’d have a chance to explain at greater length   what is really involved here—that this is not a typical recovery period because we are starting   with such a low rate of inflation and there is no immediate need, given what we now know, for a   policy response  That would get rid of the problem all at once, and we would not have to deal   with it again  We’re going to have to deal with it again as long as we leave that phrase   “considerable period” in the statement  So I think this might be a good time just to be done with   it, which is the position I had when I walked in  Thank you     Mr Chairman, I have a question and a comment       I didn’t see a reference in the memo to a warehousing limit, but maybe I   missed it  Is there a dollar limit on warehousing that this Committee votes on?     That’s in there  So there’s a $5 billion limit?     If I may, Mr Chairman, talk just a little about that?      I spent a lot of time digging into the history of this, reading the   memorandums of discussion from the early 1960s and the transcript—I think from 1990—when   warehousing was discussed at length by the Committee  I want to discuss the wisdom of our   having that warehousing authority  If we look at the domestic portfolio, the Federal Reserve Act   prohibits the Federal Reserve from buying obligations directly from the Treasury, though there is   a $3 billion emergency line, if you will, that the Treasury can call on to sell obligations directly   to us  And I think that that’s a sound provision  We do not have an obligation to buy—and in   fact, we cannot under the Federal Reserve Act—unlimited amounts from the Treasury  The   problem on the warehousing side—given the history on this and given that the Treasury clearly   has the lead responsibility on international issues—is that, when the Treasury comes to us and   says it wants another $5 billion, we can find ourselves in a box under present circumstances  I   think it puts us in a very awkward position   In my view there’s something to be said for making the warehousing limit $3 billion,   which would correspond to the $3 billion emergency amount available on the domestic side  I   think that would send the right message—that the Treasury does not have an unlimited line on   the Federal Reserve  My goal would be to try to prevent our being in the situation where,   because the Treasury takes the lead on the international side, somehow the view is that we’re   supposed to ante up whenever the Treasury asks us to  That’s the awkwardness that I see in this   situation     Right     I’m not proposing that we redo that by the way!  That was a very long   discussion, and it took a good deal of time just to read it       That’s fine     No, not at all     Dino, I thought this memo was superb, and I learned a lot from it  But I   want to mention two arguments not discussed in the memo for why being in the GNMA market   might be attractive to us  I realize that we certainly don’t need GNMAs for the original reason   that we embarked on the study  First of all, developing and maintaining in-house expertise in   this market may be helpful in carrying out other parts of our responsibilities, particularly in the   bank supervision area because banks hold a lot of this paper  It’s obviously a very huge market   and a complicated one, so I think there is a case on that ground for having expertise in that   market The other thing that strikes me is that we may end up in a somewhat adversarial   relationship with the GSEs in regard to the housing issue  So from that perspective, there may be   something to be said for being involved in supporting housing through a Ginnie Mae portfolio     We’re using the word “evolution” here  If I could use a genetic analogy, I   think we want to be careful that we have some highly selected breeding and not random   mutation  [Laughter]  To begin my remarks, let me reflect a bit on how we got to where we   are—some of the past evolution  Originally, of course, there was no statement issued at the end   of the meeting, not even a release of the policy decision  I think it was in the early ’80s that the   Committee started to vote on a bias or asymmetry in the directive, but that was not released until   a few days after the next meeting  Then in 1994, almost ten years ago to the day, the Committee   agreed to release its policy decision on the day of the meeting  Initially the practice was to make   an announcement when there was a change in the intended federal funds rate and no statement   otherwise  So, clearly, the original idea was to provide an explanation of what we had done and   why  After all, a decision to keep the intended funds rate unchanged is also a policy decision,   but we did not have a statement at the end of every meeting  So the original idea was to explain   why we did what we did  A little after that we made the decision—and I think this was after I   came on board—to release the bias statement  Subsequently the bias was viewed as a problem,   and we substituted the balance of risk statement for reasons that we discussed at length  I won’t   go into that  Now we seem to be focusing on the balance of risk statement, and to me we’re not   focusing adequately on the explanation of why we acted as we did and what the background was   for our decision    There have been many expressions of unhappiness with a formulaic approach or standard   language, so I raise this point  To me the problem is not so much with standard language but that   there is no way to construct standard language or any other kind of language that does a good job   on a forward-looking commitment—or quasi-commitment or whatever it is—regarding where   policy is going to go in the future  But I do think it is quite possible to come up with some   January 27-28, 2004 36 of 238    standard phrases or summary phrases to describe the policy decision that was taken  Now, that’s   not the issue the working group investigated  What it did investigate and what I think is being   revealed in this discussion is that it is very hard to come up with standard language—and I’ll   predict any language—that we would regard as satisfactory in terms of the forward-looking   nature of the policy decisions  I think we need to provide forward-looking information about   where we expect the economy to go and that probably has to be nuanced depending on the facts   case by case and meeting by meeting  But I believe that we ought to be able to come up with   some standard language that says, for example, that we decided to raise the federal funds rate for   this basic reason or we decided to leave it alone for this basic reason     Thank you  I’m quite skeptical of early release of the minutes  Let me   say that I start from the position that the minutes must absolutely be true to the transcript that is   going to be released five years later  We can’t have a discussion of an issue that might be   sensitive and leave it out of the minutes entirely; somebody will look at the transcript later and   say that the minutes just didn’t reflect what happened at that meeting  So I think that’s a very   important consideration   As I think about my own experience, not too long after I came here in 1998 we had the   problem of the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund and the related upset in the   securities markets  If I recall—and my recollection may be wrong, but that doesn’t matter for   this purpose because we could imagine it taking place—at our August meeting of that year we   had some discussion of what was going on at that fund  And we had an interim conference call   discussion before the September FOMC meeting  If we had released the minutes for August on   some standard schedule along the lines of what is being considered now, they would have come   out just at the time that all hell was breaking loose, if I may put it that way, in the financial   markets  Now, unlike Governor Bies, I think there are times when it’s very constructive to be   January 27-28, 2004 58 of 238    quiet and not to say anything  Even if one has a scheduled speech, there’s a way of giving a   speech and not saying anything about the FOMC and monetary policy  I think we’ve all been   there  But if the minutes are coming out and they’re going to be true to the transcript, we may   not have any choice but to say in the minutes what went on at the meeting  So, that’s one of the   reasons that I come out against early release of the minutes   There’s also a practical issue that was not discussed in the working group’s report; I don’t   know whether they considered it, but I think it would need to be considered  What happens if we   want to have an interim meeting a couple of days before or a couple of days after the date the   minutes are to be released?  How does that complicate our situation?  Does the release of the   minutes then muddy the message that comes from a policy decision at an interim meeting?  Or if   the minutes are released a couple of days before an interim meeting, what do we do?  What is the   release schedule for minutes of an interim meeting because, as I recall, those traditionally are   attached to the minutes of the earlier meeting?  I don’t know whether or not those issues were   discussed, but it seems to me very important that we think through how we would handle those   types of situations  I’m quite skeptical about moving up the release of the minutes because when   we look at all this carefully, I think we’re going to find a lot of very sensitive and potentially   unfortunate interactions of that kind     I would make two changes and two changes only  One would be to   substitute the core PCE for the total  I emphasize substitute  If we do both, we have an implicit   energy price forecast in there, and I don’t think that’s useful  Second, I think we ought to be able   to survey the Committee members for any changes in their forecasts a week or two before the   testimony, or whatever is practical in terms of the schedule for doing it  And maybe we could   put a footnote in the MPR that these are the Committee’s forecasts as of whatever the date is    Those are the only changes I would make     It may be a statistical monstrosity, but it’s much better to leave it there   than to have the Congress demand the staff forecast  So we should just leave it alone     And that’s still very important, so let’s leave it     First, I want to thank Dave Stockton and Dave Wilcox for the memo they   prepared in response to my request  I thought it was very helpful  Without going into it, I will   say that I think it provides mild support for my position, but that’s another matter  [Laughter]    January 27-28, 2004 108 of 238      This was in response to my request that the Greenbook forecast be   conditioned on the market’s federal funds rate assumption rather than the Greenbook   assumption  It’s a very good memo, and I think that it explores the issues in a very fine fashion    I’ll just repeat my summary that I think it presents a case for my position    I want to pursue that same issue in the context of the current period by thinking about   where the economy is going to be at the time of our June meeting  Let’s suppose that the   Greenbook forecast comes true between now and then  What we would be looking at in the June   meeting is five months of data on payroll employment with gains averaging 200,000 a month    That is a million more jobs—5 x 200,000  So we’d have a million more jobs, some depreciation   of the dollar, and the prospect that by the end of the year the gap will be almost entirely closed    Yet we have a forecast that is built on the assumption of no response in the federal funds rate   before roughly a year from now  Now, obviously, the market’s funds rate forecast has moved   back and forth  The December employment number itself made quite a difference in the   market’s view  But if we get a series of monthly increases in payroll employment averaging   200,000, quite frankly I find it hard to believe that the market is not going to be forecasting some   policy response  I think that scenario fits in nicely with the subject of the Stockton and Wilcox   memorandum, and I would like you to respond to that     If I may make a follow-up comment  The issue to me is not so much who   wins the horse race  Obviously, we can point to particular cases where one approach is superior   by looking at the statistical evidence you present  In fact, in recent periods I believe the market   forecast has been perhaps ever so slightly better but not significantly different  For me that is not   the issue  It’s exactly what you just said—that if we were to condition the Greenbook baseline   on the market forecast, then it would display very clearly what is different in your view from the   market expectation     Let me also refer to another example, which was the beginning of the recession  In that   case the market was predicting declines in rates before you were  If you had used the market   view as your conditioning assumption for the forecast, you would have asked the question, Is the   market detecting some weakness in the situation that we don’t see?  That was the key question at   that time, just as the key question now is whether the market is picking up the possibility of   either some inflationary pressure that we don’t see or a boom that is going to outrun what is   currently our best guess regarding the economy’s performance  It seems to me that using the   market assumption would help us to focus on those very key questions     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ve talked recently to most of my usual   contacts  My Wal-Mart contact said that he views the situation as a bit confusing  I’ve   mentioned before the midmonth paycheck cycle that has been evident in the pattern of sales at   Wal-Mart  Wal-Mart had sales on January 16 that were 12 percent above sales on January 14 as   January 27-28, 2004 126 of 238    a consequence of the arrival of paychecks in the middle of the month  My contact said that the   ratio is about as large as they ever see; a normal number is more like 4 percent or even zero when   the economy is really strong  However, overall sales in January so far are coming in at the top of   the expected range—about 5 percent above year-ago numbers for same-store sales  Wal-Mart is   concerned that, if job creation does not occur soon, their sales growth may taper off because in   their view the consumer is liquidity constrained    My UPS contact said that UPS had, in his words, “an explosive December”  Business   was well over projections  International shipments, especially electronics from Asia to the   United States—as well as computers and TVs—were extremely strong and particularly so in the   four or five days before Christmas  He said that fuel prices are going to play a major role going   forward, although UPS is significantly hedged against the price increases  To give you an idea   of the magnitude of the miss here, UPS had planned on jet fuel at about 84 cents a gallon, and it   is coming in at 99 cents per gallon, a significant upward revision  UPS expects to be passing   along that higher cost in fuel surcharges, although there is a lot of customer resistance    Nevertheless, he said that it looks as if it is going to be a great year  They are expecting a super   year in terms of growth, but they are managing costs very, very tightly, deferring projects until   the point where they just have to do them  He also reported that they are seeing headhunters   prospecting for UPS employees to move to other firms; I thought that was rather interesting   My contact in the trucking industry at JB Hunt said that business is much better now   than it was last January  Volume is running about 8 percent above January a year ago, and the   increased activity is across the board by region and by industry  But he said it is a bit hard to sort   out how much of this is a consequence of the improving economy and how much is due to the   reduced supply of carriers  A lot of the trucking companies are no longer in business  At the end   January 27-28, 2004 127 of 238    of last year, I talked about the fact that there were new constraints on the number of hours that   drivers can drive  I asked my contact if there had been any impact from that and he said “no”   because the Department of Transportation has permitted a two-month delay in the enforcement   of the new rule  JB Hunt, by the way, also has imposed fuel surcharges    Our contact at Bank of America said that the bank has been experiencing a moderate   pickup in small business lending and that middle-market lending has flattened after sustained   declines  Larger commercial lending has yet to turn up    I would like to comment briefly on two other issues relevant to the national outlook  We   had some discussion earlier about the employment numbers  Bob McTeer raised a question   about the household employment series, which had to do with statistical population controls, and   an issue on the payroll number, which had to do with births and deaths of business firms  An   enterprising staff member in St Louis, Kevin Kliesen, contacted four states—New York,   California, Georgia, and Texas—from which he was able to get some data on new   incorporations  One of the problems is that the payroll numbers in the birth–death models,   which apparently resemble fancy ARIMA models, are not tied to current information on actual   firm births, which would be relevant at the present time The Texas numbers applied to the first   eight months of last year and were converted to an annual rate  In all four states, new business   incorporations grew at a slower rate in 2003 than in 2002  I think that sample at least tells us that   there is no smoking gun in terms of the payroll survey failing to pick up new firm births  If these   numbers had gone the other way, that would raise more questions in my mind     I want to comment briefly also on the inflation outlook  Bob Rasche and Jeremy Piger   did a very nice memo for me on this subject  They used a standard Phillips curve equation—a   Bob Gordon type of equation, which I don’t think is too far from what is in the Board staff’s   January 27-28, 2004 128 of 238    model—which makes the rate of inflation dependent on inflation expectations  They did their   analysis in several different ways, on the CPI and on other measures  The Gordon models and   the Rasche and Piger model have a distributed lag on the actual rate of inflation, a gap term, a   shock term, and a random term  That is a pretty standard formulation  Now, suppose you leave   the gap term out of the equation and then compare that equation with one that has a gap term in   it  If you compare the standard error squared—you can sort of convert that to an r-squared kind   of measure—it turns out that the gap adds, depending on exactly how you measure it, only   perhaps 8 to 15 percent to the total predictive value  A lot of the variance over the sample period   comes from the high inflation years in the 1970s, when we had some big swings, and that is   when we saw a major impact from the shock terms as well—the food and energy prices   What I am driving at here is that a great deal of the inflation picture—most of what we   can talk about systematically—is tied to the gap term  But historically some very important   changes in inflation have come about that can’t be explained that way  We shouldn’t forget   about that fact if we start to get some rise in inflation  The significance of that will depend on   how one wants to interpret the expectations term  If you think of it as just a pure distributed lag,   then you get a lot of warning about rising inflation because the expectations feed through slowly    On the other hand, if you think about that as econometrically proxying for expectations that   could move pretty quickly, we could find ourselves in a situation in which we would have a   surprise  We could have more inflation on our hands than we would predict right now  I just   want to emphasize this point  Most of our discussions have focused on the gap term, but   historically that’s not where we find most of the predictive value in an inflation equation      Mr Chairman, I support the recommendation  If in nine days, when we   get the employment report, it’s a weak one—I hope it’s not—much of the increase in interest   rates that we will see this afternoon will go away, but we’ll be out from under the “considerable   period” language  If we remove the “considerable period” language after we see a strong   employment report, I think it will be taken as an announcement of an action at the next meeting,   which is a move we might not want to make  Removing the “considerable period” phrase gives   us a lot of flexibility, and I think it’s the right way to go     As I understand it, Mr Chairman, someone has to move for approval of   the Desk’s transactions, and I’ll volunteer for that duty       It’s a lot easier than talking about the exchange rates     I have a question about page 10 in Part 1 of the Greenbook, which has to   do with the assumptions on labor productivity through 2005  You have productivity growth   dropping to only 16 percent from 30 percent in 2004 and 53 percent last year  I asked Bob   Rasche to look at the time series properties, and it looks as if labor productivity growth is pretty   close to a random walk  Obviously it can’t be literally a random walk  But you have a major   drop in 2005, and perhaps you could explain where that comes from   March 16, 2004 19 of 107      An implication would be a major swing in unit labor costs next year   compared with this year, and presumably that might affect the inflation outlook  At any rate, I   think this is a fairly important part of the outlook for 2005  Growth in productivity of   16 percent, of course, is equivalent to the miserable 1974-95 average  I understand the   argument for it   March 16, 2004 20 of 107      But, of course, it also feeds into the employment outlook     Except for the second half of last year, we haven’t had the typical   recovery surge  So in one sense we may not be very far into the expansion phase of the cycle       This is obviously part of the ’05 projection, but I was very interested in   where that came from  Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  My reading is that, in general, demand is   coming in on the high side of expectations—not dramatically so but modestly so  My Wal-Mart   contact said that he does not recall a time in the last ten years when the situation was more   confusing  The internal data that Wal-Mart has from the paycheck cycle and other information   suggest that demand should not be as strong as it actually is, with sales coming in at a pace   200 to 225 basis points higher than had been expected  My contact said that they have   reluctantly increased guidance on sales to 4 to 6 percent, but they are nervous about that   prediction  He also said that prices for general merchandise are falling at a rate of about   1 percent, but they had been falling at a rate of about 3½ percent  So, price changes are still   negative, on average, but not by as much as before   My contact in the trucking industry said that the January–February period was much   stronger than last year; the two months together were about 8 percent higher, and for February   March 16, 2004 37 of 107    business was up 9 percent  The availability of drivers is very tight  He said that his firm is   increasing its capital spending this year over last year; planned expenditures are $250 million for   2004 versus $180 million last year   Probably the most upbeat of my contacts was from FedEx  He said that they see a very   clear, progressive strengthening of demand  Year-over-year monthly comparisons for its   domestic express business thus far in 2004 were January, down 21 percent; February, up   21 percent; and so far in March, up 40 percent  Ground business was up 05 percent in January,   46 percent in February, and 8 percent in March  So he sees progressive strengthening there  He   also reported that the sales staff sees the pipeline as full, with both current customers and new   customers  FedEx is now, for the first time in a while, discussing expanding its capital   expenditures They had expected their capital spending to be flat but are now talking about   increases of 10 to 12 percent  He also said, in terms of international business, that for the first   time in this recovery period the year-over-year change in US outbound traffic is now positive    He pointed out, too, that they believe they’ve about reached the limit of output increases with   their existing labor force  They anticipate hiring more workers, although they haven’t done so as   yet   UPS did not have quite as robust an outlook, but business is generally stronger than they   had anticipated  One of the most interesting comments I got from my UPS contact, though,   involved the growing burden of security-related costs  He said that he himself now spends about   20 percent of his day on security issues, and a lot of his staff members are also very much tied up   with security matters  The Transportation Security Administration is digging in deeper with   various requirements  He cited as an example that their truck drivers are now required to—or are   supposed to, anyway—lock the truck door when they go up to someone’s door to deliver a   March 16, 2004 38 of 107    package  That’s to ensure that nobody drops something harmful into the truck while the driver is   gone   I’d like to make a general comment on inflation  In terms of the core inflation measure,   obviously the idea is to take out the price changes that are temporary  But a good part of what   we take out—food and fuel prices—is not temporary anymore  The long-run oil futures are up   substantially over the last two years—by $5 a barrel or something like that  For all practical   purposes, that part of it, looking forward, is now permanent and not just temporary  There’s   something to that; I understand that  The food part of the inflation measures is heavily   influenced, of course, by the dollar because food involves commodities that are traded in world   markets  And the best guess on the dollar is something close to a random walk  I think one   would have to say that the best projection on the dollar is that it will remain about where it is   now, though I know the Board’s staff believes some further depreciation is in order   As I look at the kinds of things we would identify as inflation shocks—where the effects   should be about worn off—they are almost all in the same direction  Some examples, obviously,   are fuel, commodity prices, health care costs, property and liability insurance—a lot of   companies talk about that now—and security costs  All of these are shocks, and they may be   about worn off  But the fact is that they are all shocks in the same direction; I don’t know of any   for which the prices are moving down  So I think we should not ignore the possibility that we   have an inflation environment that’s gradually going to be turning more adverse  Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support your recommendation for minimal   change  I would, however, move to balance on the inflation statement, and I’ll tell you why  In   my view, that is certainly an accurate reflection of the probability distribution  In fact, while I   believe that the risks are close to balanced, my own judgment is that the probability of a ½ point   surprise on the upside is a bit higher than that of a ½ point surprise on the downside  I also think,   though, that the effect of that change in our statement is going to be totally dominated by the   next employment report  We saw how large the reaction was in the bond market to the February   report  If we have another weak jobs report—or whichever way the number goes—I think it’s   going to overwhelm the effect of that minor change in our inflation assessment  In short, to me   balance is an accurate reflection of the risks with regard to inflation, and I think the impact on   the markets of our stating that is likely to be quite transitory     Mr Chairman, may I ask a question?  It seems to me that we ought to consult   with counsel as to whether the so-called inclination to vote could be regarded as being the   equivalent of a vote and could create a problem in the future  I think that’s something on which we   should get some expert legal advice     Okay  So it’s perfectly okay to put it that way?     Thank you, Mr Chairman The contacts that I usually call have a generally   upbeat view on the state of the economy  My FedEx contact emphasized particularly that his   company is reviewing its capital expenditure plans The fiscal year for FedEx begins on June 1, and   they are expecting capital expenditures in fiscal ’05 over ’04 to be up about 20 to 25 percent, and all   of that growth is for capacity expansion  He also emphasized the importance of the fuel situation    FedEx is concerned not only about fuel prices but fuel availability  They’ve been looking closely at   whether they need to put in place some storage for jet fuel particularly, but so far they don’t see any   significant availability issues  The firm’s contacts with its customers suggest that the latter have a   positive outlook and that inventories are going to be rebuilt  Many even expect some scrambling to   meet demand given the lean inventory situation   My UPS contact gave me some data on air cargo from the Air Transport Association    Domestic air freight in the twelve months ending February 2004 was up 92 percent, and air freight   for the first two months of this year over the first two months of last year was up 6 percent    May 4, 2004 26 of 112       International business was up 10 percent February over February, and the expectation is that the   March data will be very strong  My contact said that check traffic out of China into the United   States is growing at an exceptional pace—up 60 percent in the first quarter of this year over the first   quarter of last year  UPS is not planning to add to its capital expenditure plan at this point     The main point that I get from my contact at JB Hunt is that there’s a lot of upward   pressure on prices for truck shipments  Hunt has been able to increase truck shipping rates for   thirteen straight quarters; those rates are up 18 percent in the last three years and 6 percent over the   last four quarters  Driver supply is extremely tight, even tighter than in the period prior to the   recession, and the rates for drivers are going up  At the beginning of this year, drivers’ rates were   increased from 30 cents to 32 cents per mile   My Wal-Mart contact emphasized that the March–April sales data are always difficult to   interpret because the date on which Easter falls varies from year to year  But cutting through that   ambiguity, sales appear to be on a growth track of about 5 percent  He continues to believe that   those at the lower end of the income distribution are stressed financially, as underscored by the   paycheck cycles and other information the company looks at, but he thinks those with higher   incomes are doing quite well  Wal-Mart has been growing about 8 percent per year in square   footage, and its new stores have been doing very well   I want to make just a brief comment regarding the national economy and the inflation   outlook  I asked one of my staff members to make a different kind of calculation than we normally   do based on the PCE data  Usually the core inflation measure excludes changes in energy and food   prices, but I wanted to look at the ex-energy part because energy has been the dynamic component   in terms of what has been going on recently What I asked my staff member to do was to take total   PCE and substitute long-term energy futures—crude oil futures prices—for current energy prices   May 4, 2004 27 of 112       and run that calculation  It seemed to me that PCE ex energy—or more precisely ex the energy   curve—might be a useful way to look at the inflation data  That calculation results in an inflation   rate that is about ¾ percentage point higher at an annual rate, averaged over the last four quarters    So I think inflation was not really as low last year as we thought it was because, by concentrating on   the core inflation measure and taking energy out all together, we were not picking up the fact that   long-term energy futures had gone up quite a bit   In my view, the inflation risks are skewed to the upside at this point  I interpret the staff   forecast, which I think is fine as a point estimate, as a median or mode of the probability   distribution  And it seems to me that the probability of, say, a ½ percentage point inflation miss on   the upside is higher than the probability of a comparable miss on the downside; I’d say the same for   a 1 percentage point inflation miss  I note that money growth is rising again after falling in the   second half of last year  A couple of people, including the staff, have made comments about   inflation and the gap along the lines that the gap may not be as large or the natural rate of   unemployment as low as we might have thought  A way perhaps of estimating the natural rate is to   look at what happens to inflation  But that’s not really helpful in terms of trying to understand   where the inflation rate is going because the essence of this problem is to try to predict the inflation   rate  The gap may be input to that, but it’s not going to be constructive to turn this equation the   other way around  That’s not going to help us to understand inflation  So I just wanted to offer that   comment  It does seem to me that the inflation risks are rising  Certainly there is a lot of   commentary in the marketplace to that effect  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I was going to raise a question that goes right to   the point that Vincent was just making  The critical issue is not how the market will respond this   afternoon but how best we can create language that will align our reaction to the data and the   market’s reaction to the data  As Roger Ferguson mentioned before, obviously we’re going to be   responding to the incoming information  I think he said it goes without saying     So I think it might help to give some sense of that—to modify this language   and say something like “with inflation low and resource slack and given the economic outlook”—   to emphasize the point that, if the economic outlook changes as a consequence of the incoming data,   then of course it makes sense for us to reconsider the pace at which we would remove the   accommodation  I’d put it in those terms  Between now and our next meeting, we’ll have two   employment reports, and I guess we’ll have two CPI reports  If  each of those suggests a revision to   May 4, 2004 75 of 112       the outlook such that the outlook for activity is one standard deviation higher and inflation the same   way, that would be quite a major change  And I think it would require us to react a little less   gradually than we might otherwise  I agree that gradualism makes a lot of sense if the world comes   out according to the staff forecast  But if it doesn’t come out that way, we don’t want to lock   ourselves into a market assumption that we’re going to be moving gradually, it seems to me Thank   you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I want to make a couple of points  First of all,   with regard to long-term inflation expectations, I’m going to use an analogy with the federal funds   futures market  Take the reading for September in the futures market  We interpret that not as   providing us with any evidence about the state of the economy other than the market’s expectation   of what this Committee is going to do  I think that’s the only information we can extract from that   observation  By the same token, I think the long-term inflation expectations that we extract from   the inflation indexed bond is really a statement about the market’s expectations on what this   Committee is going to do over a period of years  We can’t extract any real information relevant to   May 4, 2004 98 of 112       understanding underlying inflationary pressures  It’s really a statement about what this Committee   is likely to do  And once the indexed bond starts to move, the information, just like the September   futures reading, will represent the market’s changing view about how the Committee is going to   react in the future  Once it starts to move—if it moves to the upside—I think it will mean that we   are beginning to lose credibility  That’s the way I would interpret it   Second, I agree with Bob McTeer regarding the inflation risks  The problem we have is that   it’s not very transparent to use language that is ostensibly is about the state of the world and our   forecast as a hint about our probable future policy stance  That to me is unfortunate  I don’t think   there’s anything we can do about it right now because I understand that the two-step move would   send that signal  However, I think it’s unfortunate that we have mixed-up language here that in   principle ought to be about the state of the economy or our assessment of it but it is interpreted as an   indication of what our policy stance is going to be   I share the view that going cold turkey in taking out “patience” is probably   counterproductive, given the history of “a considerable period,” “patience,” and now “measured”  I   think the market is going to read “measured” as a nuance on “patience”  I’m concerned about that,   and I think we need to try to find a way to extract ourselves from this kind of language  I would like   to see language along the following lines substituted at some point  “The Committee expects that   its future policy stance will depend on the future pace of economic growth and developments   regarding inflation risks”  That’s just a statement that our policy is going to depend on the incoming   data and, of course, the implications of the data for our assessment of the risks going forward    Having a very plain statement along those lines is to me a good substitute for the current language    I don’t think we can just eliminate this language cold turkey; that’s going to cause all sorts of   questions and misunderstandings  We have to substitute something eventually  And I would try to   May 4, 2004 99 of 112       substitute something that gets us out from under the “considerable period,” “patience,” “measured”   progression  Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman I’m going to talk primarily about conversations   I’ve had with those on my standard list of contacts  My Wal-Mart contact said that June sales had   come in a bit weaker than anticipated, which I think was widely reported in the press  His estimate   for sales growth in June is now in the 2 to 4 percent range, and the company had been expecting 4 to   6 percent  He attributes the weakness in June as due primarily to cool weather in many parts of the   country, which has reduced sales of seasonal supplies like air conditioners and that kind of thing    Wal-Mart’s estimate for sales growth going forward is 3 to 5 percent  My Wal-Mart contact   reported to me results from a recent Gallup poll of consumer attitudes that I think Wal-Mart   commissions Gallup to do on a regular basis  Number 1 on the list of concerns was rising gasoline   prices, cited by 23 percent of the sample  Numbers 2, 3, and 4 were health care, the general   economy, and fear of war  Number 5 was unemployment—fear of job loss—with the portion of   respondents mentioning that down to only 13 percent of the sample compared with 26 percent a   couple of months ago  That was quite a dramatic change in attitudes on that issue  He also said that   general merchandise prices are still falling slightly but less rapidly than in the past; the buyers   believe that most price increases for this year are already in place  The figures I mentioned earlier   June 29-30, 2004 112 of 203          were for same-store sales Wal-Mart continues with expansion plans to add about 8 percent per year   in square footage, which is unchanged from earlier expectations  That means that their hiring plans   reflect about 8 percent employment growth for the company  My contact notes that they have had   no problem finding sales associates  About 80 percent of their labor force is full-time, whereas it’s   usually about 60 percent—the consequence of very low turnover in their labor force  So labor   supply is plentiful     As for the transportation industry, my contact at FedEx said that his firm has very strong   earnings—“incredibly strong” was the term he used  FedEx is projecting a 25 percent increase in   earnings for fiscal ’05, which ends on May 31, 2005, over fiscal ’04  He attributes about one-half of   the increase in earnings to gains in volume, about one-quarter to pricing, and one-quarter to cost-  management and productivity  FedEx business outbound from Asia to the rest of the world is up at   an 18 percent rate in the fiscal quarter ending May 31—that’s on a year-over-year basis—while   outbound traffic from the United States is up 8 percent  That’s quite a dramatic change because   US outbound shipments had been very, very low  US ground business is up about 12 percent    Fed Ex has seen a substantial increase in its freight business, which is less than its truckload   shipments  My contact said that demand is incredibly high and it’s basically across the board—  including retail and manufactured parts that are going into the production chain—and across the   board geographically  FedEx is operating at capacity in its freight business and will be increasing   its capital expenditures by 20 to 30 percent in fiscal year ’05 over fiscal year ’04  Only about   10 percent of that is replacement investment, and the rest is capacity expansion  I think the   expansion will improve growth in the express business—the high priced business, which had been   lagging because it was being replaced by ground shipments  FedEx is anticipating growth in the   express component of its business  That grew 2 percent in the last quarter, which was the highest   June 29-30, 2004 113 of 203          growth they’ve seen in five years  The company is expecting to add capacity in the United States to   handle the rapid growth in international business  My contact noted that traffic exiting China was   up 50 percent in the last year, and he sees very strong momentum to growth there  He has heard   reports of inconsistent rail service  Apparently one of the reasons some shipments are being   diverted to air delivery is because of problems in the rail network   My UPS contact said that the economy is changing—“shifting into higher gear” is the way   he put it  Outbound Asia volume is exceeding expectations  Business in Europe is not as strong but   is also exceeding expectations, as is US traffic, both inbound and outbound  He described volume   as well above expectations everywhere  He said that the express business, both for households and   businesses, is strong  He indicated that the growth in business demand for express may reflect the   very lean inventory situation  He reported that international capacity is very tight  UPS is replacing   smaller aircraft with larger ones  He said that they are in negotiations with the pilots’ union    Apparently the contract expired in December, and they’re in mediation  The pilots are asking for a   40 percent first-year pay increase, and UPS is offering 6 percent  So they’re pretty far apart  My   UPS contact also indicated that they are anticipating some problems in obtaining part-time workers   in the very busy fourth-quarter period  And they are expecting a very large turnover in their labor   force in the next five years due to retirements of pilots and mechanics  To give you an idea about   their expectations for volume in the high-demand fourth-quarter period, they are expecting to lease   twenty-nine aircraft just for that period compared with thirteen last year   My contact in the trucking industry, from JB Hunt, said that he viewed the economy as not   hot but warm  Business has been up and down  He didn’t quite understand some of the   fluctuations, but a noticeable improvement really took hold in the late fall  He said that Hunt   trucking volume in the intermodal business—that’s the piggyback rail business—was up 15 to   June 29-30, 2004 114 of 203          17 percent from April to May  He indicated that some of that might have been related to problems   with Union Pacific  The railroad reported to him that they had misjudged the strength of the   economy and were short in manpower and equipment, and they believe it will take the rest of this   year for them to catch up  He also reported that CSX has had service problems  Pricing is pretty   strong on the truck side  Prices are up about 7 percent year over year, and maybe 2 percentage   points of that is fuel surcharges  Also, the supply of drivers is extremely tight    A Wall Street contact said that he believes the general view on Wall Street is that the Fed   has gotten behind the curve and will be looking very carefully at the inflation reports going forward    As for my view of the national economy, I think there is a very solid upward momentum to   real activity  It appears to me that transportation demand has taken a lot of the companies by   surprise  That’s my interpretation  On inflation, my best guess is a modest increase of a few tenths   rather than the modest decrease projected by the staff  In terms of point estimates, that probably   represents half a standard deviation  So the projections are not very far apart—probably half a   standard error apart—in terms of the accuracy of the forecast  But I also believe that the inflation   risks are quite substantially skewed to the upside over the next few quarters  And I would note that   what’s going to happen in the next few quarters is largely independent of any current policy   decisions, both at this meeting and in August  I think we’re more likely to have upside surprises on   inflation, and that’s a risk to us  Thank you     Do you want to start a go-around on this issue?     I guess I can accept this statement  I must say that I’ve been sitting on a very   pointed fence for a long time on this issue about language  Would it be reasonable to ask Vincent to   circulate in advance suggested language for our August meeting—to give us some idea about what   we are going to do about this so that we can think about it ahead of time?  I think there’s a sense   around the table—certainly I feel this way—that we’ve got to get out from under this language   somehow  And I think we need to spend some time on this       If we adopt the proposed statement, I think it would also be appropriate—   perhaps in the monetary policy hearing, Mr Chairman—for you to in some way emphasize this last   sentence that has been added to the statement  I don’t know how to do that exactly  But I just   worry that an implied commitment to the market of moving 25 basis points per meeting could leave   us with continuous declines in the real federal funds rate      All I’m saying is that I think the way this plays out is going to be influenced   by the degree of emphasis placed on the one sentence rather than the other sentence       I hope that we can put a lot of emphasis on the importance of the data in   driving what we do and try to back off from that implied commitment      This is sort of the great-grandchild of “considerable period!”  [Laughter]   June 29-30, 2004 151 of 203            Thank you, Mr Chairman  Almost all my contacts said that they had nothing   new to report; essentially the story was the same as last time  I would mention two things that are   perhaps a little different  My Wal-Mart contact said that the pace of sales in August has definitely   downshifted  The Wal-Mart public story is an expectation of 2 to 4 percent growth in same-store   sales, but apparently internal estimates are much closer to 2 percent than 4 percent  Wal-Mart   officials were very reluctant to revise their estimates publicly to 1 to 3 percent, which is what they   might otherwise do, because they thought that might give too pessimistic a picture  They are   expecting some pickup in September and October, more to the 3 to 5 percent growth range    Several of my contacts spoke about the rail congestion  There seems to be a real bottleneck   in US railroads these days, and the congestion has actually reduced capacity  Because the average   train speed is down, that means that the capacity to move freight is down  My contacts expect the   problem to continue through this year because, of course, as we move into the fall more goods are   moving on the rails  So the situation really won’t get straightened out until the early part of next   year   I think the staff outlook for the economy makes good sense; I agree that interpreting current   developments as temporary is right  As for the employment report, the back-of-the-envelope   calculations I’ve done on the seasonal factors suggest that, if we had used last year’s seasonals, the   number of jobs created in July would have been 80,000 higher than reported  I’ll just throw that out   as something to think about  Obviously, that doesn’t fundamentally change the picture, but if we   had gotten 110,000 new jobs instead of 32,000, the picture would have looked a little different    That’s all I want to report  Thank you     Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation completely  I think, as Ben   put it, that we need to stay on track  The only suggestion I would have in terms of the statement is   that I think there a number of things besides energy prices that may be responsible for what we’re   seeing in the data  I have a whole list of them written down here  Therefore, I would strike the   sentence that says “this softness likely owes importantly to the substantial rise in energy prices”  In   August 10, 2004 75 of 103          my view there’s a laundry list of things including, for example, uncertainties about the situation in   Iraq  Of course, that’s tied up with energy prices, but it goes beyond just energy  My only other   comment would be that it wasn’t clear to me from what you said what happens to the language   under the assessment of risks in alternative A, which adds the phrase “and sustainable economic   growth” at the end of the last sentence  Were you proposing to include that?     Okay  I have a preference for including it on the grounds that, if we get   another employment report and perhaps other data of the sort that we’ve already had, we might   want to pause in September       I understand that  But my preference would be to condition the market to   that possibility and read that as it stands  I don’t feel strongly about it, but I’m explaining my   preference      So moved      Thank you, Mr Chairman  It’s hard to remember an intermeeting period   when less happened—where economic developments were more predictable and more stable—  than this one  So I want to concentrate on a few pieces of information that I picked up during   this period   My Wal-Mart contact focused on the weak August sales in their stores  He conducted a   survey of all Wal-Mart store managers to determine when schools in their communities opened    It turns out that a lot of schools open on a schedule that is tied to Labor Day and many do not    By comparing sales at stores in the two groups, he determined that the late Labor Day had a fair   amount to do with the slow August sales that Wal-Mart reported  He estimated that the total   impact was about 90 basis points; that is, August sales relative to August last year were reduced   by almost 1 percentage point as a consequence of this pattern of school openings and the late   Labor Day  I thought that was rather interesting, and of course, it may mean that September   sales will be somewhat stronger   The other comment that I thought was interesting—and this is not totally new—has to do   with the transportation system  My trucking industry contact at JB Hunt said that his firm is not   investing in any new capacity  Actually, the number of trucks is flat to down slightly  Margins      are not particularly good, so they’re not investing  A major difficulty is getting drivers    Nationally, as we know, a lot of trucking companies have gone out of business, and rail capacity   is not expanding either  So he thought we might end up with some strains in the transportation   of goods  Obviously, we know that the transportation of passengers is getting quite messed up as   well because of all the airline bankruptcies  Those were the only two comments that I wanted to   offer  My contacts said that things are rolling along about as anticipated and that business looks   generally good  Thank you   September 21, 2004 40 of 100            Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation for increasing the intended   funds rate by 25 basis points and for the statement as written  I’m reminded of something my   mother used to say when I was a child  I grew up in a family of four children with lots of   cousins around, and she would often say, “Children are to be seen, not heard”  And I think that’s   true of monetary policy today  We should be as quiet as we can possibly be  In fact, as a general   rule, I think one of our goals should be to make policy very noncontroversial and predictable,   and we should not raise issues that don’t have to be raised  So I support this proposal   completely     Mr Chairman, do we need to move approval of the domestic operations?     Karen, there are two themes in your discussion that I’d like you to comment   on a bit more to try to reconcile them  On the one hand, you say that the increase in energy prices in   the last year to year and a half has been driven primarily by increases in worldwide demand  Then   on the other hand, you say that the price increase we’ve seen is a reason to mark down forecasts of   demand  So, it’s a question really of whether the demand curve is shifting—and prices are high   November 10, 2004 20 of 107    because the whole demand curve has shifted out as a consequence of higher growth—or whether   we’re sliding along the demand curve     Thank you   November 10, 2004 21 of 107      Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll start with the report from my Wal-Mart   friend  He began by saying that Wal-Mart sees demand as “really weak”—that’s the term he used    August same-store sales showed the lowest growth rate Wal-Mart had seen for some time, and   September–October sales were also weak  I think the company has announced its October numbers   publicly  Year-over-year sales growth in October was 28 percent, including the clubs, but for   Wal-Mart itself the figure was 20 percent  So he believes, given the demographics, that the lower   end of the income distribution that typically shops at Wal-Mart is “stressed,” as he put it  Going   forward, Wal-Mart is projecting increases of 2 to 4 percent in same-store sales; their current point   estimate is 29 percent   November 10, 2004 29 of 107    My contact in the trucking industry said that the economy is doing okay but is not booming    In his view, if the economy had been booming, there would have been real problems in the   transportation sector because of problems in both rail and trucking capacity  He noted that a truck   assembly plant is now shipping trucks down the assembly line without tires  Apparently there’s a   shortage of truck tires at the moment  I assume that’s just a spot issue  He said that his company   itself had not had any difficulties in terms of the availability of tires  He indicated that retailers   expect a normal holiday season  He said that the West Coast dock situation is about unchanged and   that rail service remains poor but is not getting worse  He also reported that the truck rates they   were able to charge in the third quarter were up a little over 9 percent year over year   On a more optimistic note, my contact at FedEx said that FedEx sees continued strong   demand in every sector  The company’s ground business is up about 16 percent year over year, and   domestic freight is up about 14 percent  And significantly, I think, FedEx is adding substantially to   its capital spending plans for next year, anticipating an increase in capital expenditures of 20 to   25 percent  The company has not seen any wage pressures but is expecting to see some  The   toughest employee to find at this point is one with accounting skills—a development no doubt   related to Sarbanes–Oxley, which is tightening the market for those skills everywhere   My UPS contact said that the company is hiring aggressively for the peak holiday season    They’re even hiring new pilots for the first time in some years  The labor market for IT   professionals has tightened according to my contact at UPS  He noted that they are seeing the first   significant change in direction in the IT skills market that they’ve seen for some time  UPS has   revised up its volume projections for next year  In fact, they’ve made two revisions just in recent   weeks, particularly in their international business and especially in shipments outbound from Asia,   much of which of course comes to the United States   November 10, 2004 30 of 107    For the first time I called a contact at a West Coast software firm, and he said that their PC   forecast is running at just a modest level, unchanged from where it has been recently  Somewhere   in the neighborhood of 7 to 10 percent is probably the easiest way to characterize it  I thought the   most interesting thing he said was that in their view the labor market had become “brutally more   competitive”—that’s the phrase he used—in terms of hiring software engineers and also general   management talent  He said that they are getting lots of resumes but maybe only one in forty   applicants is worth hiring  And he noted that his firm has been affected by the reduction in the   number of visas for talent that can be brought in from abroad  I think that’s about all I want to say   in that regard   One issue that I have been spending some time on is trying to understand what we might   mean by the “normal” real federal funds rate  If one goes back over history, that rate is extremely   variable  But compared with history, I think we’re probably getting more or less into the range of   what one might call “low normal,” though I don’t think we’re quite at normal yet  I just wanted to   say that, if you scan the data since the Korean War, no matter how you cut it, what is most   impressive is just how variable the short-term real federal funds rate is  Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support your recommendation both for the   increase in the funds rate and the statement  I’d like to offer just a couple of other observations    The reason the communications process is so important is that it’s highly desirable that the market   and the Federal Reserve read incoming data the same way and that the interpretation is a correct   assessment of the significance of the incoming data  That’s not so easy to do but, as Cathy   Minehan pointed out earlier, we certainly don’t want to run the risk that the market’s assessment is   simply flowing from what we have said about future policy actions, which when we get to the point   of taking action may not reflect our own assessment of the data that have come in  I think that the   statement will have to evolve, as you suggest     I’d also like to mention that I think the greater diversity of views around the table reflects   the fact that the probability distribution of where we’re going to go has become considerably more   spread out  Or I’ll state it this way  My own probability distribution is considerably more spread   out  If I think about where we were six months ago, I thought it was extraordinarily unlikely that   we were going to remain at 1 percent on the funds rate  But my own view of where we’re going to   go has become more spread out, and where we’re going to end up six months from now, I think, is   going to depend much more on the data that we get in the next six months than anything that I can   now put into my forecast  So I think that that divergence of views probably reflects each one of us   becoming more uncertain as to where we’re going to go     Thank you  Let me start with three preliminary comments  First, I   congratulate the staff on the way this experiment was conducted  I think that we’ve learned a lot   from it, and I think that the early drafting of the minutes, in any event, will survive and should   survive  So I want to start with that observation  Second, as noted, I do not favor early release of   the minutes  But I do regard the issue as being fairly closely drawn  I want to be clear that my   opposition to early release is not based on a slippery slope argument  I don’t see that early release is   going to lead to other demands for information that would be harmful  So I’ve decided this case on   its own merits  In my view, early release reinforces a favorable posture of openness but does not   create substantive improvement in communication  Also, early release has risks and could not be   easily withdrawn if it is unsuccessful  Instead, the outcome in that case, I believe, would be to make   the minutes more vague and, therefore, less useful than they are now   Here is the structure of my argument  Our aim in communications policy should be to move   in the direction of perfecting the rational expectations macroeconomic equilibrium  The key to   better communications for political accountability is continued policy success  Any change in   communications policy that may on the surface appear to enhance political accountability but, in   fact, interferes with policy success will not, in the end, serve the purpose of enhanced political   accountability  In particular, miscommunication with markets will damage rather than enhance   political accountability  The problem of improving communication for the purpose of improving   monetary policy outcomes is reasonably well defined and will be the basis of my argument   December 14, 2004 73 of 118           Now, to move in the direction of perfecting the equilibrium, an important goal is to   encourage market reaction to new information that matches the FOMC’s reaction to the same   information  The issue is not primarily the market’s reaction to new information between one   meeting and the next but, instead, to new information over a span of quarters and even years  We   want the market and the Committee to assess monetary policy implications of information the same   way  The flow of new information is continuous  The Committee meets at discrete intervals    When the market reacts appropriately to new information, the economy has an important built-in   stabilizer  This goal is quite different from conditioning the market to expect a certain policy   decision at the next FOMC meeting  Such conditioning may be necessary and useful, but it should   not come at the expense of enhancing the market understanding of the fundamentals of monetary   policy   Here are some principles that I believe should apply to the minutes  First, it is extremely   important that the minutes be faithful to the transcript  Eventually, the two will be carefully   compared  Second, the minutes should not themselves be a market disturbance  Markets may react,   of course, to the minutes, but the reaction should be helpful and not harmful to the achievement of   policy goals  My concern is not undue attention to the minutes but misinterpretation of them  The   issue is not whether interest rates will respond to the minutes but whether the response will be in the   correct direction and amount  If there is never a market response to the minutes, then we can   conclude that the minutes are not providing useful information     I’m convinced—and this is the third principle—that there are times when the most   constructive thing the FOMC can do is to remain quiet  Minutes released before the next FOMC   meeting will always be an event  Minutes released on the current schedule are, at most, a minor   event to the market  I think we should be careful about periods like the fall of 1998, when Long-  December 14, 2004 74 of 118           term Capital Management was imploding  For example, the minutes of the meeting of August 18,   1998, contained this sentence  “In the view of one of these members, the trend in monetary growth   along with indications of rising speculative imbalances and excesses in various markets for financial   and nonfinancial assets called for a prompt firming of monetary policy”  Would such a statement   have been helpful in providing clear guidance to the market as to how the Committee would likely   respond to developments in the financial markets?  Would the statement have been ignored as it   represented the view of only one member?  I’m quite sure that the sentence would not have been   helpful  I don’t know whether it would have been ignored  Suppose the Committee were closely   split in such circumstances, and it was not just the view of one member  Disclosure of a close split   would not be helpful  Could the minutes be true to the transcript without disclosing the split?  I   think we all agree that we can coalesce behind the majority view on a Committee led, of course, by   the Chairman, but we do not want to stifle discussion of competing views around the table  In short,   it is not hard for me to imagine circumstances in which the expectation of early release of the   minutes would inhibit discussion  I would feel more comfortable about early release if the staff had   reviewed the transcripts and minutes for the last twenty years or so, looking for examples of   discussions that might have been awkward under a policy of early release   Now, I’ve said that early release of the minutes will be a market event  What I mean is that   the minutes will be an event in the same way that the Chairman’s testimony is an event  I believe   that the focus of market attention will be on the implications of the minutes for the policy action at   the next FOMC meeting  The current release schedule for the minutes has the advantage of   focusing attention on the Committee’s thinking and not on the probable policy decision at the next   meeting  The advantage of relying on speeches and testimony—rather than minutes with a fixed   release schedule and the constraint that minutes must be faithful to the transcript—is that speeches   December 14, 2004 75 of 118           and testimony can be crafted to be more or less explicit, depending on circumstances, and they can   be adjusted right up to the time of delivery  Quite frankly, with early release of the minutes, I   believe that in circumstances like the fall of 1998 the openness of discussions at the FOMC meeting   and/or the nature of the minutes will be affected   My view on the nature of market attention to the minutes under early release is that the   financial press talks mostly to traders and traders care little about anything other than the very short   run  Traders want clues about the Committee’s likely decision at the next meeting, and they really   don’t care very much about the fundamentals of monetary policy  Providing clues about our next   meeting ought not to be our main interest in communicating with the markets   I’ll finish with some unresolved issues  We’ve already talked about what happens with   minutes of meetings held between regularly scheduled meetings  And incidentally, we might find   ourselves with a problem of how we justify a delayed release rather than a three-week publication   schedule for those  Could the Committee discuss the possibility of an intermeeting policy action as   it did at its meetings of December 19, 2000, and March 20, 2001?  Those discussions were disclosed   in the minutes of the meetings  I think the Committee could not discuss the possibility of an   intermeeting consultation unless the special meeting was going to be held before the release date of   the minutes  To release minutes in which there is a discussion of the possibility of a policy action   before the next regular meeting would create market uncertainty that would not be constructive     In sum, I do not believe that early release of the minutes will assist measurably in   communicating the fundamentals of monetary policy, working toward further perfecting the rational   expectations macroeconomic equilibrium  I believe that early minutes will be read primarily for   clues about the Committee’s probable action at its next meeting  Finally, I believe that early release   will at times be a market disturber, when the Committee would be better off remaining quiet    December 14, 2004 76 of 118           Moreover, I think it will inhibit the discussion of certain issues at regular meetings  However, let   me restate my view that the issue on early release is closely drawn, and I’m not predicting disaster    And I do believe that a Fed posture of openness and transparency is appropriate  Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  My contacts are essentially saying that they   could just replay the tape from our November conversations  The situation is not much changed;   the outlook remains pretty favorable  Let me comment particularly on some evidence on demand in   the labor market  When I was talking to my contacts at the time of the last FOMC meeting, a   number of them noted the strength of demand in the technical area—both IT and accounting—and   demand for MBAs  So what I did this time was to call placement directors at two MBA programs,   and I thought those conversations gave me some interesting insights into what’s going on in that   regard  One of the programs is what I think we’d call a first-tier MBA program  The number of   companies that came to that campus reached a recent high of 222 in the fall of 2000  By 2002, the   number had dropped to 126  It was 149 last year and 169 this year  So there has been a very   substantial increase in the number of companies coming to hire  A contact at a second-tier program   had the same kind of information, with the number of firms recruiting on their campus up 12 to   15 percent over last year  Particularly noteworthy was the fact that consulting firms are coming   back into the market, which hadn’t occurred for a good long time  At the lower skill level, my   Wal-Mart contact says that they continue to have loads of applicants for positions as associates   December 14, 2004 18 of 118           when they open new stores  So I think that the labor market is beginning to tighten at the upper skill   levels   On the overall outlook, I agree with the Greenbook, subject to the usual caveats about   standard errors  I think it’s important to understand that the expansion is not fragile  I think there’s   a growing amount of business confidence, forward planning, and maybe even very early signs of   exuberance when you look at the recovery of IPOs and at merger and acquisition activity  And the   demand for employees at the higher skill levels suggests that companies are really gearing up, with   a pretty solid outlook going forward   I do think that the inflation risks are tilted slightly to the upside  I don’t foresee an outbreak   of inflation, but if we’re going to see a miss there, I think it’s more likely to be on the upside than   the downside  If we view changes in oil prices and exchange rates as exogenous shocks—and   certainly the timing has to be viewed as exogenous—then we would expect over time a gradual   absorption of the pressures that are coming from them  Those effects look pretty pervasive; they are   spread throughout the economy  I think a better view of what’s going on here is that oil and   exchange rates should be regarded as fundamentally endogenous variables and that they reflect an   environment of expansionary policy continued over a sustained period of time  I believe we’re on a   good course to prevent that from getting out of hand, but those are two very, very important   influences on the price performance of the economy going forward  The pass-throughs occur   slowly, but they do occur eventually  Therefore, I think we should not relax simply because recent   oil prices are off their highs  The long-term oil futures are up about 50 percent or more from where   they were a few years ago  So there has been a very important fundamental change, I think, in the   economics in that market  Thank you     Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation  I would note, given the   expectation I think we all have that another 25 basis points may be appropriate at the next meeting,   that any change in wording is going to send a mixed signal that will be confusing  So I support   alternative C    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’d like to confine my remarks at this time to the   points that you raised a few moments ago  The importance of the long-term nominal anchor is great,   and I think it has a lot to do with enhancing productivity and the other things that Governor Bies was   talking about But I think it’s very important for stability in the short run that expectations be closely   tied to that long-term anchor—that is, expectations about long-run inflation—and that those   expectations not be pushed one way or another by current events   One of the things that was so clear in the 1970s was that short-term monetary policy actions   or inaction led to a destabilization of the longer-term expectational environment  When that   happens, it puts severe constraints on the short-run policy options available to the Committee  One   of the great benefits of very solidly established long-term expectations is that they provide the   Committee with a lot more freedom to react to short-run disturbances of all different sorts without   upsetting the expectational environment  I think that’s a very great benefit in terms of short-run   stability To me, one of the advantages of an explicit FOMC inflation objective is that it would                     February 1-2, 2005 22 of 177  assist in anchoring long-run expectations and make them less reactive or potentially reactive to   short-term events, including policy decisions that are made for purposes of short-term stabilization    No, I agree with Ben Bernanke that evidence in this area is very, very hard to   come by  But I’m saying that is one of the benefits I would see, basing my view mainly on—    One thing that I do know, and I can speak to evidence in this sense, is that   since the Korean War, meetings of this Committee have often focused at particular times on a   concern that policy actions would be viewed by the market as upsetting the inflationary   environment  When you go back and look at the minutes of these meetings—particularly around   business cycle peaks, when the economy was already beginning to turn down—the Committee was   typically slow to ease policy even though there was an understanding that the business cycle peak   was at hand or at risk or had even passed The reason, and you see this again and again in the   discussions around this table, was concern that a premature easing—what the FOMC participants   would call a premature easing—of policy would affect expectations in the market and would,   therefore, aggravate the inflation problem that the Committee had been dealing with    So I can point to evidence that that happened numerous times around this   table    It is not evidence that an announced target would help to anchor expectations    I’m making that judgment on the basis of what I think I understand about the process    But I do think that well before 1979—in the whole period since the Korean   War—one sees over and over again at business cycle peaks that this Committee was very concerned   that it would upset the inflation expectations environment by acting prematurely   If you’re asking for evidence, I think there is one case, strangely enough, on the other side   That was when we were getting the funds rate down to 1 percent The inflation rate was low and   there was uncertainty in the marketplace about what the Committee’s inflation objectives were  And   it was at that point that the language came into the statement regarding an “unwelcome further   decline” in inflation, and—    That was qualitative That’s correct    Right    I think in that case that if we had previously announced a range, the market—   well before inflation got close to or below the bottom of the range—would have been saying that the   FOMC will be responding The market would have been expecting us to move the funds rate down   because inflation was getting down to or below the bottom of the announced range   The one other case is not a US case but Japan I think the Japanese have also suffered from   not being very clear that they do not want deflation, particularly as the situation developed in the   early 1990s The markets were left quite at sea in trying to figure out where Japanese monetary   policy was going to go    Yes, they probably still are    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I spoke very briefly earlier and made just a few   short comments  I have three points I want to make  Vice Chairman Geithner has raised one of           February 1-2, 2005 58 of 177  them  I believe this issue about succession—which I think you can argue either way, but I don’t   intend to argue it one way or the other—is important  The new Chairman might want to put his or   her stamp on this issue of inflation targeting and communication  So that’s something we should be   clear about   As for point versus range, I think in principle the long-run average should be a point or a   very narrow range There should be a broader range for the year-by-year number on the short run  It   does make a difference in the long run, however, whether the average inflation rate is 1½ or 2½    That’s 100 basis points and that is quantitatively significant  If there were any quick transition of   expectations from one to the other, it would be a source of disturbance  So I think that range ought   to be narrow There are various ways we could narrow it, but I think a range of 100 basis points is   troublesome   Lastly, I think there’s a way of showing proper deference to the Congress on this and making   some progress  We could note the fact that the CBO’s [Congressional Budget Office] economic   assumptions, which underlie the budget, include a CPI forecast of 22 percent in the out years  I   think it has just been reduced to 22 percent; it had been at 25 I think we could say that our   expectations and our policy direction are intended to be fully consistent with that long-term outlook    We could say that without getting ourselves tangled up into precisely what price index we’re talking   about So, we could note that the Congressional Budget Office, an agency of Congress, has this rate   of inflation underlying all of the long-term budget projections    Thank you, Mr Chairman  When I talk to my business contacts, I try to let   them, first of all, tell me what’s bothering them  Sarbanes-Oxley and health care costs rise to the top   of the hit parade there; that’s about all they really want to talk about Certainly, Sarbanes-Oxley is   causing a significant increase in accounting and audit budgets, and a lot of senior executive time is   being devoted to it Nevertheless, the costs associated with that legislation are not going to show up   in unit labor costs It involves a big increase in the audit budget, but that’s a tiny, tiny fraction of                 February 1-2, 2005 109 of 177  total outlays So it’s a diversion and a nuisance—a pain in the neck for many people, including   ourselves   When I tried to extract views by asking contacts if they were concerned about certain   issues—for example, labor availability—the answer was typically “no”  They feel labor is readily   available except for occasional specialties, like auditing [Laughter] The only group for which they   really see a bit of tightening, I think, is IT [information technology] professionals  But concern   about labor availability is not general; it’s spotty So if you’re opening a new retail store, you’d   probably find several times over the applicants for the number of associate positions you have  I got   the same kind of reply about concerns regarding wages and labor costs generally   The one thing I have seen is a modest upward revision among my contacts in expectations   for their companies  A contact from a computer firm with a large international business reported   that his company has revised upward somewhat their expectations for global growth  From contacts   in the package delivery business we heard reports of some orders for new aircraft  They see   continuing strong growth in the volume of traffic from Asia, so that’s leading to some expansion   there The overall impression I get is that things are very, very well balanced  There are modest   upward revisions in plans and expectations   I think the expansion is proceeding and is, in fact, unusually free of significant bottlenecks   Things seem to be working out in an extremely orderly way  I don’t even have any minor quibbles   with the staff outlook, but I would like to emphasize the following point, which comes from the fan   charts depicting the forecast confidence intervals I think the staff’s forecast is a very, very sound   central tendency But when I look at the table showing the confidence interval around the   Greenbook forecast for real GDP this year, I see a point estimate of 39 percent and a confidence   interval of 22 to 55 percent Our life is going to look quite different if GDP growth is either 55 or   22 percent But that is the sort of confidence interval that comes from the history of Greenbook   forecast errors So, I think it’s extremely important that we keep our minds open to various   shocks—symmetrically on both sides  This is not an asymmetric world; shocks could come on                             February 1-2, 2005 110 of 177  either side Moreover, I think it’s important that we provide that message to the markets so that the   markets don’t assume that we are locked into a particular path  The path that we’re on makes a   whole lot of sense given what we know now But we don’t want to condition the market to think   that we’re locked into that path independent of shocks and disturbances  I’ve written down a list of   various potential shocks and disturbances We can all do that  We’ve talked about some of them    The ones that will come and bite us probably will not be any of those that are on the list  They’re   probably going to be total surprises Thank you    I support the recommendation and the reasoning  [Laughter]    Karen, you noted the enormous role of China in raising energy demand   worldwide Could you give me a sense of the energy demand in India?  India is obviously a low-  income country, but it is now growing quite substantially  It’s a large country In both parts of   the Greenbook, there is only a very limited amount of information on India  You do have data   on Korea and Taiwan, and I’m wondering if we shouldn’t be adding to our store of knowledge                                            March 22, 2005 19 of 116  here in future Greenbooks I would think the absolute size of India would be sufficient that you   would want to start tracking India as well as Korea and Taiwan, and so forth    Good Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  One of my business contacts, my Wal-Mart   contact, started our conversation by saying that the situation is rather strange—his word  Spending   coming out of the Christmas season has been higher than anticipated—with same-store sales about 4   percent higher on a year-over-year basis—and they’re not sure where this strength is coming from    They are anticipating about that same strength, or maybe even a bit more, going forward  He noted   that their inflation situation is not a concern Their prices overall are flat; food prices are up a little   and prices of nonfood items are down a little  The labor market is very stable; Wal-Mart is having   no problem at all hiring associates at their stores     My UPS contact noted an expansion of their capital spending He said that business from   retail mail order firms is very strong  He indicated that his company has some labor concerns  They   may be facing a strike later this year—a possible pilot strike is the concern, I think—and they are                    March 22, 2005 48 of 116  doing contingency planning for it They do not believe that the rest of the industry has the capacity   to fill in, should UPS be shut down   My FedEx contact noted also an increase in capital spending, up 15 percent for this fiscal   year over last fiscal year He indicated that about two-thirds of that is for expansion of capacity and   about one-third for productivity enhancements  Also, he said that they had no concern regarding   labor availability Fuel prices, obviously, are a concern for them     My contact in the trucking industry had contrary information  He said that demand is softer   than anticipated and that there has been a switch from prebookings for truck shipping services to   last-minute bookings  He also noted that the driver shortage is getting worse and worse   A contact in a major software company said that sales had come in a little soft relative to   their expectations but attributed it to Intel coming up short on inventory—I think particularly on   notebook computers  Apparently Intel was surprised by demand that was higher than anticipated    Also, I might mention that a contact in the banking industry noted that C&I [commercial and   industrial] loans year-over-year are now positive and accelerating and that there appears to be a lot   of momentum    Let me turn now to some comments about the economy in general  We have in place a very   broad-based and robust recovery Business fixed investment is taking hold and taking the lead  I   think it’s highly likely, of course, that employment and income will grow, which will provide   support for consumption, as the Greenbook emphasizes  So even if we had a welcome increase in   the saving rate, we’d probably see continued strength in consumption     The Greenbook contains—and we continue to hear elsewhere—a lot of comments on energy   prices In my view, it’s very important that we think of energy prices as being demand-driven  This   is not a supply shock situation; there’s a worldwide demand increase  It may be, for some purposes,                       March 22, 2005 49 of 116  appropriate to think about what the world would look like if energy prices had not increased and   how much gets taken off growth  But I’m not sure that that’s quite the right way to look at this,   because the situation is being driven fundamentally by demand  It’s not that output is being   constrained by energy; it’s that vigorous output growth is driving up energy prices   As for labor compensation, productivity gains are holding down growth in unit labor costs    That’s a source of great stability     Let me make a general point about this expansion that really took hold roughly six quarters   ago Relative to US business cycle history, this expansion has been one of the most orderly and   best predicted The forecast errors are astonishingly small—much lower than the usual standard   errors that we see—and I think that has a lot to do with the very well-balanced and orderly nature of   the expansion This expansion is about as surprise-free as we ever see I think our policy goal   should be to maintain the orderly nature of the expansion as far as we can, and, of course, that   includes as an essential element maintaining the stable inflation environment     I think the staff forecasts for both real GDP and inflation make a lot of sense  As point   forecasts, they’re as good as one can find I think the risks around the GDP forecast are probably   pretty symmetrical, but I do not believe that the risks around the inflation forecast are symmetrical  I   view the inflation forecast more as a median of the distribution than a mean  I think the distribution   is skewed to the right—that there’s a substantially higher probability that we could have a ½-point   upside surprise than a ½-point downside surprise on the inflation outcome  That’s all I’ll say at this   time  Thank you    It’s important, as we’ve said before, that the minutes be true to the transcript,   but it’s also important that the statement be true to the whole process  We don’t want to say   something now that’s going to be misleading  I think the minutes need to convey the difficulty that   the Committee has had in coming up with alternative wording that is not misleading to the market,   and that that’s the reason for leaving the statement as is  The minutes can try to give a full   explanation   Around the table there’s probably a majority—I didn’t do a count but I’ll make a guess—   who believe that the inflation risks are tilted to the upside now from whatever the point forecast is                                          March 22, 2005 85 of 116  At least that’s the way I’d put it I believe that is probably the majority sentiment  So, strictly   speaking, saying that the risks are balanced isn’t an accurate reflection of the views around the table   In any event, I don’t think we can solve this issue, as you’re emphasizing, at this point  But   the minutes need to explain very carefully the difficulty the Committee has had with the wording for   the statement  And the minutes should note that this will be on the agenda for the future to make   sure that we have statements at the conclusion of the meeting that are accurate and do not mislead    I think that’s the only practical alternative at this point    No, I would just keep it as is I agree    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support the 25 basis point increase I want to   emphasize a point that Don Kohn brought up  Since our last meeting, the forward market estimates   on the funds rate are up by 25 basis points If we had perfect control over the term structure of                                March 22, 2005 93 of 116  interest rates or all the forward forecasts, in terms of the impact on the 10-year rate, there’s a perfect   substitution between an extra 25 basis points now and an appropriate move out in the future   The advantage, I think, of pushing it out in the future is that it keeps the current increases on   a very predictable path, which I believe should be a goal in and of itself If we were to move 50   basis points—and this may come up in the future—I think there’s an argument for doing it when it’s   a clear response to some new piece of information  But to do it almost out of the blue is going to   create a lot of uncertainty, and the market is not going to know why we are doing it or what to make   of it if it’s not a clear response to something new in the information set  So, given that there is this   substitutability between that and the extension of the 25 basis point increases, it seems to me we   should work in the latter direction rather than take the market by surprise  I don’t know of any good   case where creating uncertainty for its own sake is advantageous I think we want to go very much   in the other direction If at some point we move by 50 basis points without a clear case for doing so,   it is going to be very hard to gauge or forecast the likely effects and impact of that  Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Let me start with information from my contacts at   FedEx and UPS My contact at FedEx says that they’ve seen no indication at all of any slowing, nor   do their customers see any sign of a slowdown  At UPS, both the ground business and express   business are coming in a bit below plan  Part of the story on the express business, interestingly   enough, is that the number of mortgage refinancing documents they’re shipping is way down    [Laughter] Both companies have very impressive expansion plans under way  For its fiscal year   beginning June 1, FedEx has planned a 20 percent increase in capital expenditures  That plan   actually has been in place for the past six months, and they’ve now done the final budget  UPS is                                    May 3, 2005 54 of 116  hiring 20 to 25 pilots a month, of whom perhaps five are replacement pilots for those who are   retiring So, both companies have very aggressive expansion plans   My trucking industry contact, on the other hand, says that business is soft Volume is down   2 percent for April on a year-over-year basis The intermodal business is down 5 percent, April over   April; he notes that it was the first decline ever in the intermodal business in the 15-year history of   the company  And he says that the declines are widespread across the country and across industries   My Wal-Mart contact says that same-store sales are coming in at the low end of   expectations He believes the main reason is that the purchasing power of those in the part of the   income distribution that shops heavily at Wal-Mart is simply being drained substantially by high   energy prices I think that’s a familiar story     In almost no case, with scattered exceptions, does anyone report any pressures in the labor   market, either on wages or the availability of labor  The exceptions typically are for those with   special skills, like accountants, which we’ve already talked about Another job category that is in   short supply, and has been for a long time, is truck drivers   On the overall economy, I think the recent inflation data—and I’m echoing what a lot of   others have said—have been on the high side of expectations and the output data on the low side of   expectations In my view, our uncertainty about the outlook going forward is somewhat greater than   it has been My best guess of a point estimate does match the Greenbook forecast  I think that’s a   good central tendency, but, as I emphasized, my uncertainty on both fronts has been rising  I think   the inflation risk is clearly asymmetric on the upper side  I’m not so sure that there’s all that much   asymmetry on the output side   The fundamentals on inflation appear to be sound  We have continuing modest wage   increases, and we seem to have continuing good productivity growth  Financial conditions are not                                    May 3, 2005 55 of 116  highly inflationary, at least as measured by the aggregates  M2 growth has been coming in below   the growth of nominal GDP; MZM has actually been about flat in the last six months and up 2   percent year over year So, on the quantity side, I don’t think there’s evidence of a highly   expansionary monetary policy  But I think there are lots of reasons to be nervous about the inflation   risks I would also point out that one of the clearest indications of the increased uncertainty about   the outlook is the length of our discussion about the staff’s forecast Thank you    Mr Chairman, I have an alternative D, which may not be appropriate for   today, but it might be helpful in some future meeting, so let me pass this language around  While   that’s going around, I’d like to say that I agree with Jack Guynn that we have a real problem in terms   of the coordination of the statement and the minutes  When the minutes come out in three weeks,   they’re going to have to reflect the fact that there is widespread uncertainty around the table And   somehow I think that ought to be in the statement, because that is really part of the outcome of this   meeting    Oh, it will appear in the minutes  But I’m saying that I think it ought to   appear in the statement, because, otherwise, the statement would not truly reflect what happened at   the meeting  Anyway, I wanted to make that point—that the minutes coming out in three weeks                                 May 3, 2005 86 of 116  could give a different impression from the statement  In my view, coordinating the two is very   important  And I think that’s the point Jack Guynn was raising a few minutes ago   Some elements of my alternative D are in the alternative C language in the staff handout  As   you know from the memo I distributed, I think the “measured pace” language is becoming less and   less useful And I believe that accurate communication is both terribly important and terribly   difficult I would like to see us come out—if not today, then at some point—with language making   it very clear that, depending on the incoming information, we would be open to either a 50 basis   point increase, if the inflation environment seems compelling, or a pause  I’m concerned that the   market expectation we are creating of a move of 25 basis points at our next meeting is going to get in   the way of either of those outcomes  That’s essentially my pitch here, and I have tried to craft in   alternative D a statement that emphasizes our inflation concern but at the same time leaves open the   possibility of a pause  That was my strategy in the way I formulated this   But I think there is a problem  If we have a statement this afternoon that the market   subsequently views as not really consistent with the thrust of the minutes that come out in three   weeks, I think that creates a problem for us and for the market    What I’m saying is that for our present meeting I think the statement needs to   take account of the fact that we currently have a greater degree of uncertainty about the outlook for   both inflation and output That’s my concern    I’ve said my piece    I’d like to comment also on the policy discussion  It seems to me that to do   this analysis correctly, the central bank really has to think about intervening more or less all the time   because, if you have a one-off policy response and you promise that you’re never ever going to do it   again, it perhaps would not be all that useful  So it seems to me that policymakers would need to   think about routinely having asset prices be a consideration in policy analysis   I think that would be a terrible idea, and let me explain why  Let’s look at it from an   optimal control point of view and suppose hypothetically that we have a policy instrument that is   absolutely ideal It has no side effects, is completely independent of the federal funds rate, or the   macro policy instrument, and has perfectly predictable effects  That’s the ideal from a control-  theoretic point of view  In that case, if the central bank were adjusting such an instrument and   setting capital values, it seems to me that that would change the whole nature of the pricing   mechanism in asset markets  And I think it would be a terrible idea in a market economy to have a   government agency setting capital asset values  That’s why I would not start to go down this route;   I believe it is really a dead-end    But the point is that there could be a little bubble component or a big bubble   component  Obviously, policymakers wouldn’t apply the instrument when prices are regarded as   reflecting the fundamentals, but the instrument would be continuously available  The whole point   of such an instrument would be to keep the price right at the fundamentals  But then that would                                               June 29-30, 2005 34 of 234  change the whole nature of asset pricing in a market economy  I think a proper policy analysis   really can’t be done on a one-off basis in cases such as the stock market in the ’90s or house prices   today    Essentially, it’s the same problem that arises with wage and price controls    Having that as a policy instrument that is sometimes used and sometimes not used completely   changes the pricing mechanism in a market economy  I think that problem applies in spades to   stock prices, equity prices, and bond prices  With house prices I think the problem is a little   different, but I believe the same basic principle applies    There’s ample room, I think, for understanding the housing market within   what you phrased as the standard policy  But I think going after asset prices directly is something   very different  That’s the point that I’m trying to make    Just for the hell of it, I’d like to offer the hypothesis that property values are   too low rather than too high [Laughter]  If you believe that Treasury indexed bonds are a good   measure of the real rate of interest—and we were getting into this discussion—the real rate of   interest has been cut in half in the past five years  For any asset with a perpetual stream of returns,   like land, the capital value has doubled  Now, it may well be that the issue is with the indexed   bonds and not with the housing prices  It may be that the right way to state this hypothesis is   instead to say that the conundrum is that there’s a disconnect between the prices of some of these   assets   In any event, if we are going to be in a world in which the real rate of interest is truly much   lower than it was before—if that is going to be the situation for some time to come—then it seems   to me that we could expect some long-continuing appreciation of land values in particular    Residential structures have a very long life, so they are almost priced that way  And let me link this   analysis to the tear-down phenomenon that Mark Olson was talking about  I’ve been told—I don’t   know the data here—that houses replacing tear-downs may account for about 300,000 units a year,                                                 June 29-30, 2005 58 of 234  which is a significant part of new building  Maybe someone knows the data on demolitions and   replacements  I don’t    Okay It’s a significant part of total new construction  And I know in the   community where I live—I thought this was real estate hype when we bought our house—we were   told that we had bought the land and got the house for free  But that’s just about the case, because   the houses in my area—a subdivision built in the 1960s—are being torn down, and houses with   3,000 square feet are being replaced by houses with 6,000 to 8,000 square feet on nice one-acre lots    So the land value is significant   On this question about what is really happening to land values in urban areas, I don’t know   whether the data are available to answer that  I suppose a detailed look at real estate records and tax   records, if you had enough resources to do it, would enable you to look at properties where the   houses are being torn down and replaced with new homes  And that would probably give you a   pretty good measure of the underlying value of the land in those areas  In any event, when real rates   of interest come down, one would expect to see increases in the value of the land relative to the   structure  So one would expect, I think, to see more teardowns  I gather that, though it’s not a   brand-new phenomenon, the scale of it is probably much increased in recent years from 10 or 20   years ago   At any rate, I offer those observations because, if we are in a world that is going to have   much lower real rates of interest for some time to come, one would expect to see the price-to-rent   ratio go up Maybe this line in the chart has another 40 percent to go to get to equilibrium!   [Laughter]                                           June 29-30, 2005 59 of 234   If I’m right, you won’t need me to buy it    I want to take up the issue of oil sticker shock and particularly the distant   futures prices  The revisions over the past 18 months or two years have really been extraordinary—   essentially a doubling in the long-term price of oil  My impression is that the market revisions have   been driven probably by upward revisions of the impact on oil demand associated with long-term   growth in China, and perhaps India as well, and also questions about production capacity in the   Middle East  Some of the reserve numbers have been revised down, and that sort of thing  But I   haven’t seen much discussion about the long-run demand elasticity  You’d think that with this big a   price change that would be an issue—and also elasticities of alternative supplies of which I suppose   the most important over a horizon of five years would not be nuclear but coal; the latter has                         June 29-30, 2005 101 of 234  possibilities of significant expansion  What do we know about the longer-run demand elasticities   that might start to come into play over the next few years and that might check this upward   momentum in the long-run price of oil?    I understand that with alternatives like shale and that kind of thing  But how   about the more conventional alternatives, which I guess would be coal, by and large?  There must   be expansion opportunities there; it’s important for generating electricity    What about on the demand side?  What do those longer-run elasticities look   like?     What would the demand elasticity be in the United States?  We passed those   through pretty quickly    You think it’s even as big as minus 1?  Over the horizon here, these long-  term futures—that’s six years out—you’d probably get a good part of that over a six-year horizon, if   it’s viewed as a permanent—                        June 29-30, 2005 103 of 234   Thank you, Mr Chairman  I want to start by saying that I thought the staff   presentation was very comprehensive and very sound, including the discussion of risks and standard   errors So I congratulate the staff on a very fine job there   Let me just summarize very quickly key anecdotal information that I have gathered  First of   all, my sense from my contacts is that the real economy is growing moderately, continuing the   growth of about the past year or so  Second, labor supply of hourly workers is plentiful  There are   lots of anecdotes of that type, but a dramatic example is a new Wal-Mart store opening in San   Diego, where there were 10,000 applicants for 400 jobs  That’s a very typical story; the margin   may not always be that big, but it’s a very typical story  I get the same kind of information from my   contacts in the transportation industry  The only exception there seems to be truck drivers, a   position for which qualified applicants seem to be in chronic short supply    Third, managerial and technical skills are becoming in somewhat short supply  A contact   with a major software company told me that their outsourcing to India was actually more a matter of   the supply of those skills—with many of them just not readily available in the United States—rather                               June 29-30, 2005 135 of 234  than the cost This is, I’m sure, for standard sorts of software code writing  Another item in that   vein is that later this year we could see a strike of UPS and FedEx pilots  There are ongoing   negotiations  The contract expired some time ago, or at least became available for a reopening   some time ago  And the pilots apparently are quite far apart from the companies in those   negotiations   Fourth, I don’t think there’s any doubt that energy prices are having a significant effect on   the purchasing power of, let’s say, the lower half of the income distribution  Wal-Mart has been   talking about that for some time in terms of their same-store sales  But another very interesting   Wal-Mart anecdote was that they’ve observed among their own employees a reduction in health   care utilization—that is, fewer doctors’ visits—but an increase in emergency room visits    Apparently employees are struggling some to make the co-payments and that kind of thing, again   emphasizing the stress that exists in many lower-income households  That’s where I’ll stop  Thank   you    I support the recommendation on the policy action and the statement    I’d like to ask about the labor force participation rate  You show a   sustained downward trend, and I think that has a lot to do with the elimination of unused   resources in the labor market, because your projection is for the labor force participation rate to   stay about constant But you have the trend participation rate moving down to about 66 percent,   which is more than a percentage point below where it was for about three or four years in the late   ’90s Could you talk about the reasons for that projection?  What is bringing down the   “equilibrium”—I guess that would be the right term— participation rate in the labor market?     This is participation for everyone over age 18?    So it includes that part of the population that is above age 65?  I’m talking   about the definition of the rate      But your trend rate is down more than a percentage point from the level   that was sustained in the late ’90s    By about ½ point, I guess    Right    Thank you, Mr Chairman  My contacts led off almost universally with   comments such as “Things look great;” “Everything is steady-as-she-goes;” and “All business   areas are strong”  And I’d just like to fill in a few observations here   My Wal-Mart contact—and as I think you know, Wal-Mart has been very concerned   about the drain on purchasing power because of gasoline prices—said that they now believe that   last year the company had underordered goods at the upper price point levels That is, they had a                            August 9, 2005 60 of 110  product mix that was too skewed toward the low end, and the part of the income distribution that   buys the low end merchandise is still struggling with gasoline prices  So, to some extent, their   overall sales performance last year was simply a consequence of the mix of goods that they had   on their shelves They have changed that mix of goods  He used as an example the fact that 22   percent of the TVs they’re selling now are high definition digital TVs  That’s a rather big   percentage for a company like Wal-Mart   An interesting comment from my UPS contact was that they are now struggling to obtain   enough aircraft, in good part because of their expansion in China  That expansion is not just in   the import/export business—they’re entering the internal Chinese market  He said that they have   no aircraft available either for purchase or lease until 2008  UPS and FedEx both have filled out   their fleets to a very considerable extent by taking aging passenger aircraft and converting them    But the converters are all working at capacity  So, UPS will keep in service aircraft that are 30   to 40 years old Obviously, those planes are much more expensive to operate, and UPS would   like to replace them with new aircraft but will make do with these older ones  Both UPS and   FedEx said that they’re expecting a very good holiday season, but they anticipate having plenty   of capacity   A contact with a major software company said that they’re a little skittish—“very   cautious” was the term he used—about the large enterprise business but that other sectors of their   business are doing quite well   It seems to me clear that the economy has a very good head of steam  I would argue that   monetary policy is not highly expansionary at this point  Rates have gone up a lot, and the   market anticipates that rates will continue to go up  I’m one of the few people, I guess, who look   at money numbers anymore, but for what it’s worth—and I think it’s still worth something—                         August 9, 2005 61 of 110  [laughter] MZM is up by slightly more than 1 percent in the last year and has been about flat in   the last six months M2 is up a bit less than 4 percent  That’s not consistent with highly   expansionary monetary policy   I would say, however, that there is a disconnect arising between the anecdotal reports and   the econometric estimates and analysis on the state of the labor market  When I talk to contacts   in my District, they say over and over again that they have no problem with labor availability and   that there is no wage pressure, except in isolated cases  For example, my UPS friend said that   they are having ongoing negotiations with the Teamsters and are seeing some job actions  So   there may be some issue there  But except for a few scattered examples—such as truck drivers,   as I’ve mentioned before—my contacts say that they just don’t see any problem with labor   availability And that’s not just at the low end, but at all skill levels, though there may still be   some problems hiring accountants  But even that’s not something that they bring up voluntarily   when I talk with them  Again, they see no significant wage pressures  So I think there’s a   disconnect here between the anecdotal information and the econometric information  I don’t   know what to do about it, but I’d make note of it  [Laughter] Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman I support the recommendation for 25 basis   points, and I support the recommendation that we repeat the statement  I would have two   suggestions on the rationale part of the statement  First, in row 3 I would eliminate the word   “gradually” and just say “labor market conditions continue to improve”  Second, in row 4 I think   the syntax would work a bit better if there were two sentences reading “Core inflation has been   relatively low in recent months, but pressures on inflation have stayed elevated  Longer-term   inflation expectations remain well contained”  I just think it reads a little better  Paradoxically   perhaps, I think that repeating essentially the same language actually gives us maximum possible   flexibility in the future  Anything that we might try to change would open up the possibility of   misinterpretations in the market   Looking ahead, I think it’s going to be simple at some point to add to the statement or to   have the statement say that monetary accommodation has been substantially removed  The   tricky part—the tough issue that we will have to deal with—is whether in the future we will want   to have some forward-looking guidance    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I want to focus on a couple of anecdotal   reports on the weak side of the projections going forward  But I don’t want this to be   misunderstood; the general tenor of reports I’ve heard is clearly on the positive side                        September 20, 2005 68 of 117  I do want to say also that we seem to have merged the first and second go-rounds, so I’ll   just take note of that [Laughter] I’m not going to break that pattern either   According to my contact at Wal-Mart, the company estimates that every $10 per barrel   increase in crude oil costs them about 100 basis points of same-store growth  In fact, Wal-Mart   is cutting back purchases for the holiday season  Wal-Mart suppliers are also concerned about   the strength of holiday sales, and Wal-Mart is in the process of negotiating price concessions in   anticipation of weak sales  I think that more or less fits the message from my colleague to the   right Wal-Mart is anticipating a significant effect on corporate profits from the hurricane, both   because of the damage and also because of the voluntary contributions that many companies   have made   I have a contact in a large software company who said that they are very concerned about   weakness in the large enterprise sector of that business on a global basis  They don’t understand   exactly what’s happening there, but they believe large enterprises may be making a genuine   effort by to cut back on spending, perhaps because of the cycle that companies went through    They had delayed purchases and a lot of them have come back  But now they have filled their   needs and are slowing down   My UPS contact said that they’re looking at an unexplained shortfall in the last two   months in volume and revenue projections coming out of Asia  They don’t know why that is   happening One other thing that’s going on with UPS and FedEx both is that they’re in the midst   of labor negotiations that are beginning to become nasty, with pilots disrupting service  An   example cited was this A pilot lands a plane, knows that something needs to be fixed, but   forgets to notify anyone until shortly before the plane is scheduled to take off  That then causes                            September 20, 2005 69 of 117  a delay So there are some so-called job actions by some very strong-willed pilots  I think this is   true for both UPS and FedEx, and it could lead to some disruption during the peak season   As I hear people around the table—and I think we’ll hear the same from those who have   not yet spoken—we’re all very adamant that the fundamental course of policy going forward not   depart from controlling inflation  So, looking out over the next year, Katrina will have an effect   primarily through the energy sector, because the direct disruption is a pretty small part of the   total economy   What we have is a supply disturbance in energy overlaid on a fundamentally strong   demand picture that has been driving up energy prices worldwide, and I don’t think we know   exactly how big that disruption is going to be from the supply side  And it’s not just gasoline; I   think heating costs for fuel oil and natural gas will be a bigger bind for consumers  Once we   start paying winter heating bills, the discussions about sales being hurt by high gasoline prices   are going to be displaced substantially by discussions about the cost of heating   I would like to state my own view in favor of a pause  At least I think we ought to get   that case on the table I want to reemphasize that we need to retain our longer-run concern about   inflation I think we can be completely clear about that in our statement  The statement would   say something along the lines that as the uncertainties are resolved, we would then anticipate   resuming the “measured pace” of rate increases   But I would also like to address the policy question by focusing on how best to deal with   a number of possible outcomes  To some extent we tend to focus on the forecast in terms of a   point estimate, and I think the Greenbook does a good job with that  But there are substantial   uncertainties about the forecast—probably even greater uncertainties in the near term than                      September 20, 2005 70 of 117  looking out a year because it’s a question of how fast the reconstruction takes place  Huge   federal involvement may actually slow things down in the near term, because people will be   waiting to see the money and may delay spending to rebuild and replace  I don’t really know   But I’d like to focus attention on the following  Suppose, on the one hand, we have a good news   scenario where things fall into place better than we might have anticipated and, on the other   hand, a bad news scenario where things are worse than we might have anticipated  How would   today’s policy decision position us best for dealing with those various possibilities?   Clearly, if we raised rates today, it would fit nicely with the good news scenario  And we   would continue removing policy accommodation with however many more moves are needed in   the future If we have a bad news scenario and we paused today, that also would fit well  On the   other hand, if we raised the funds rate today and have a bad news scenario, we might find   ourselves in a position where we would feel compelled to pause later  Then we would be in a   situation where people would question why we didn’t pause right after the hurricane when all the   uncertainties were in place  If we paused now, we would have made the correct call, if you will    And as the uncertainties are resolved, we would then go back to raising rates  So, it’s that kind   of calculation that leads me to come out in favor of a pause  I think with the proper wording of   our statement we will be able to resume our rate increases in a timely fashion  Thank you    Mr Chairman, I retain my preference for no change but I note that the   market has priced in almost a 100 percent probability of a 25 basis point increase today    However, it has reduced the fed funds trajectory in the future and, unless the statement and the   minutes change the market’s view, I think it’s important that we make clear that that’s not   necessarily the path we’re on By just increasing the funds rate 25 basis points now, if it does   not change market expectations about the future, I think we will not be doing the full job  In any   event, as I say, I retain my preference for no change but with a very clear statement of concern   about inflation and the highly likely need for more restraint in the future    I’d like to renew a plea that I’ve made a couple of times over the years  I think   everybody in this room believes that a vigorously competitive international sector is good for   growth and, therefore, I bristle when you talk about that in terms of a drag on growth and a negative   contribution to GDP You’re talking about an arithmetic way of adding up the GDP account  But   what’s happening is that vigorous growth in demand is being partially met from abroad, and that’s   not necessarily bad for growth  So I bristle when I hear it put this way because some of this ends up   filtering into our public discourse  And even though we may understand that we’re talking about   the arithmetic statement of the GDP account, it seems misleading  So I want to mention that    Secondly, and this goes in part to the question President Moskow asked, we   have somewhat of a mixed situation in terms of the forecast  When I first came in 1998, there was a   staff forecast of the stock market  In fact, I remember that at the time the stock market was forecast                                  November 1, 2005 24 of 114  to go down, and many aspects of the Greenbook forecast were predicated on a decline in the stock   market  Of course, eventually the stock market did go down, but it didn’t go down in 1998 or 1999   Now we have, I think, an appropriate standard type of assumption here  The stock market is   forecast on a sort of equilibrium basis, and we’re not independently trying to have a stock market   forecast We do the same thing on oil prices  But we don’t do that on some other important parts of   the forecast, such as exchange rates and the federal funds rate   To me, the most useful baseline forecast would be to put together the Greenbook on a   consistent set of assumptions on those kinds of things  Then I’d value the staff input as to where   they believe the federal funds rate, the exchange rate, and everything else will likely come out   differently from the expectation in the market  But to me we have a somewhat muddled situation in   terms of the internal consistency here  Dave Stockton and I have talked about this several times   over the years, but maybe there could be a survey of the Committee on what we would find most   useful as the assumptions for things like exchange rates, the stock market, oil prices—all of those   things where there are market forecasts available  What would be the most useful to the Committee   in terms of the baseline assumption for the Greenbook?    I don’t know whether I’m the only one who would find that useful  But at any   rate, I offer that proposal    But I think you could set up whatever standard you believe would be most   useful and stick to it consistently over time and then explain how your views may differ from the   standard assumption that you use  That’s more or less what you do with a number of things  And I   emphasize the stock market as a very important example because of the influence of wealth on   consumption    If I could respond very quickly, something is going to look very strange one   way or the other when the views are very different  And what can look strange now is a course of   long-term interest rates that is not what’s in the market  So something is going to look strange one   way or the other  The question is What is the best way to convey the staff’s view about where the   world is going?  What is the clearest way and what is most useful for the Committee?    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Let me say at the outset—to try to put some   organizing structure into my anecdotal reports—that the reports on activity are almost uniformly on   the strong side  And I think the reports on inflation are almost uniformly on the upside rather than   the downside  There is somewhat of an asymmetry to the reports I hear                                            November 1, 2005 59 of 114  Let me talk about Wal-Mart first  Before the hurricanes, let’s say in early August, Wal-Mart   was anticipating growth in same-store sales of about 5 percent year-over-year  So they would have   expected October to come in about 5 percent above October of last year  Once they saw the   hurricanes and had other information, including the big spike in energy prices—of course, they   believe that energy prices have a major impact on the income available to the people who shop at   Wal-Mart—they were expecting October to come in at about 1 percent  In fact, October same-store   sales rose by about 4 percent, excluding gasoline  So sales were much stronger than they would   have anticipated, given the information that they had  Moreover, they saw a pickup in demand for   higher price point items  In various discretionary categories, such as televisions, for example, more   of the higher-priced goods were being sold   I have a contact with a large West Coast software company, and that company is disappointed   in the large enterprise segment of its business but is seeing surprising strength in the consumer   sector, including a shift in the consumer sector toward more expensive equipment  The example   cited was that in the back-to-school market for the high school and college segments, there were   more purchases of laptops, which are more expensive than desktop computers   My contacts in the package-delivery industry are anticipating a very strong holiday season;   indeed, they are expecting demand in the peak week prior to Christmas to outrun capacity  The   expectation that they will not have enough capacity in place is due in part to the rapid growth in   Internet sales and the home deliveries associated with that  Also, they pointed to a particularly large   unexplained increase in business in the Chicago area recently, both inbound and outbound  They   have no idea why  I said I would consult with my colleague on the FOMC to see if he has any   insight  So maybe during the coffee break he can tell me what’s going on in Chicago  I don’t think   the World Series was enough to create this outcome  [Laughter]                                      November 1, 2005 60 of 114   Another example that I thought was quite interesting was that UPS is actually   shifting its over-the-road shipments away from the piggyback rail system to long-distance trucks in   order to gain shorter transit time  My contact said that the railroads are simply unwilling to put the   investment into their track and equipment and operating systems to match the delivery times    Obviously, it’s much less fuel-efficient to ship by truck, but the pressure on delivery times was   leading UPS to switch its operations in that direction   On the price front, my Wal-Mart contact said that general merchandise prices are still falling a   little bit Food prices have been up about 1½ percent over the last year  However, Wal-Mart noted   that its suppliers—I think this would be primarily domestic suppliers—have indicated that they   expect to take some price increases after January 1, although not enough to completely cover their   cost increases  Wal-Mart is not seeing price increases on goods that are sourced abroad, particularly   from China of course  Wal-Mart has continued to absorb increases in transportation costs and   utility costs That’s the story for retailers generally  It’s obvious that they’re not going to absorb   those costs forever, but they have been doing so temporarily  My Wal-Mart contact also noted that   their construction costs for new stores and other facilities are rising in a range of 10 to 15 percent     And in a recent luncheon in St Louis with local real estate people, house builders, and others   in the business, many said that they also see substantial upward pressure on construction costs  It’s   not just the cost of land—or ground, as the homebuilders put it—but materials and labor costs are   under substantial upward pressure   One other thing that I thought was interesting came from my contact at UPS, where they’ve   just completed—I think the negotiations are completed—negotiations with their pilots  Apparently   the pilots had no increases at all in 2003 and 2004, but UPS is going to pay retroactive increases in a                                         November 1, 2005 61 of 114  lump sum  And I suspect that these lump sum payments will escape inclusion in the ECI   measurement, given the way the ECI is put together  I see Dave Stockton shaking his head  The   other thing that was really quite surprising is that they are paying signing bonuses for new airplane   captains of $45,000 to $60,000  You would think, with all the pilots being released from the   passenger airlines, that they wouldn’t have any trouble hiring pilots  But apparently the strength of   the union is such that it has been able to work that deal as part of the settlement  UPS is anticipating   that their pilots, now making $190 per hour, will be up to $223 per hour in 2006  They will be the   highest paid pilots in the industry   The one other thing I would say is that I share the Greenbook forecast, but I do believe that the   inflation risks are asymmetric  It’s much easier for me to imagine a ½ point forecast error with   inflation coming in on the high side, rather than the low side, of the point forecast  I think that’s   where I’ll stop now  Thank you      Please don’t  [Laughter]    Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation on the rate and the language for   today  I’d like to make just a couple of other points  There has been a lot of discussion in the   newspapers and among people I talk to about the influence of the remarks in our speeches regarding   our concern about inflation risk  That clearly, I think, has made a difference to market sentiment   And with respect to the neutral rate, I hope that we don’t start making statements that we   regard the neutral rate as being a narrow range or a number  These calculations come from a model   One way of looking at this is that if the neutral rate has averaged about X over some historical   period, we might anticipate that that would be the average going forward  However, the rate that is   consistent with equilibrium at any moment of time has varied a lot  If we look at 2002 or 2003, for   example, the rate was low and yet the economy was barely moving forward  If we look at 1983,                              November 1, 2005 100 of 114  that was a period of vigorous recovery from the 1981-82 recession, and the real federal funds rate   was about 6 percent  So the rate that at any moment of time is consistent with equilibrium can vary   widely, and I hope we don’t give the impression that the neutral rate is some narrow little target   toward which we are likely to go  We talk about it as an average of historical experience  I think   we could really be misleading the market as to where we’re likely to end up if we leave the   impression that it’s in the neighborhood of 4½ or 4¾ percent or any other such number that we   might mention   Secondly, I’d like to point out that the Greenbook forecast for the core PCE inflation rate next   year, fourth quarter to fourth quarter, is 23 percent  And there is a view abroad in the marketplace   that some members of the Committee have an explicit target range in mind for that measure of 1 to   2 percent Others will say that by revealed preference the Committee has made clear its preference   for an inflation target of 1 to 2 percent  And if we, in fact, consistently start getting year-to-year   inflation rates that are noticeably above 2, we are going to produce a market reaction that we need to   be aware of—one that may well be ahead of us—and understand where that may take us  Thank   you    You commented on currency growth slowing down as a consequence of   domestic issues, but is it still true that about half of our currency is held abroad?  Probably a lot of it   circulates in places like Russia that have been unstable  So, one explanation could be that there’s a                                          December 13, 2005 8 of 100  growing stability in some of these areas that have been heavy users of dollars and that some of this   currency may be flowing back  That’s just a guess    Two-thirds?  Okay    In terms of the seasonal?    I want to go back to the conversation with Karen  It seems to me that it would   be helpful in the Greenbook to have much more analysis of the capital account than we do  In the   Greenbook Part 1, there’s a brief mention—you repeated it now—of the growing current account   deficit  And I think we all understand that things that can’t go on forever won’t  But on the other   hand, we might be able to have an idea as to some growing tensions there if we understood more   about what’s going on with direct investment and, say, how much of the capital flow is simply   passively financed by governments that are pegging their exchange rates, like China and others                                     December 13, 2005 19 of 100  There is definitely not much analytical material on the international capital account  So I   would have a suggestion for more information there because the capital flows so dominate the   shorter-run effects  A particular question in that context is  How much of the strength of the dollar   this year might we attribute to the special tax break for this year? Certainly, corporations have been   moving capital back into the United States  I don’t know quantitatively how important that is   I also have a suggestion for David  Looking ahead, the major share of GDP growth is going   to be from the supply side of the economy  We’re at close to full employment  And if you look at the   Greenbook, the analysis there is very heavily weighted toward an understanding of demand factors   By my calculation there is, at least in one place, a half page on productivity in the labor market  But I   think as we look ahead, we need a deeper understanding of the determinants of such things as   structural productivity growth and labor force participation  So I would make a plea for beefing up   that section of the Greenbook Part 1    My plea, obviously, is not so much about that specific event, but about the   analysis of the capital account in general, because I think it really does make a difference how much   of the capital flow is direct investment  And what’s going on there I think is very important for   understanding—    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ve been debating whether we should characterize   the expansion as vigorous or solid  I decided that it’s vigorously solid  [Laughter]   On the consumption front, to give you an idea how strong demand is, my Wal-Mart contact   says that 30 percent of the TVs they sell are now digital, up from 5 percent last holiday season  They   have greater sales also of other higher-end—medium and premium—price points  And he says that   inventory, if anything, is on the short side of desired levels, particularly for the higher-end items   A pervasive theme in my discussions with business people is that construction costs are rising   rather rapidly  Wal-Mart says 10 to 15 percent, and that seems to be generally true across the   economy, according to my contacts  The transportation industry, I think, is stretched at this point   For quite some time there have been problems with rail transportation of coal  Our contacts with a   power company in the St Louis area said that they’ve been able to build stocks of coal at power   plants but the level is still well below the normal, desired level   A contact with a major trucking company said that they have no plans to increase capacity in   their truck business, which is about 30 percent of the total  They plan a 5 percent increase in capacity   in the intermodal area—that’s the piggyback business—and 10 percent capacity expansion in the   dedicated truck business, which involves trucks for particular companies like Wal-Mart   My UPS contact said that they have been stretched quite tightly this holiday season; he   mentioned that DHL has been having severe operational problems at its Wilmington, Ohio hub  UPS   could not find extra lift, as they call it, on an ad hoc basis and had to have work-arounds to have   enough capacity to meet the demand  UPS is planning to expand its China-to-US capacity next year   by 26 percent, which reinforces what Richard said a few minutes ago   There is a risk of disruption because of strikes  UPS—and FedEx is right behind—is coming   to the end of the negotiation with their pilots, which has not been going well  The pilots in those                            December 13, 2005 49 of 100  companies are now the best paid in the industry because the passenger airlines have reduced pilots’   pay The pilots’ union is apparently adamant in wanting a larger piece of the profits of the company,   so I think we should not by any means rule out the possibility of a strike at UPS early next year  My   contact there said that the level of frustration within the company about the various job actions by   pilots is very high Pilots have been calling in and saying, for example, that they’re fatigued and can’t   fly, and they have caused a lot of disruption by tactics of that sort    I think those are the only comments I want to offer  Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support the 25 basis point increase  In my view,   leaving “measured” in is wise because it provides continuity with past statements  Also, I think taking   it out would be read as a hint to the market that we would seriously consider a 50 basis point increase    And I don’t think that’s necessary or desirable   I am inclined to believe that we should replace “is likely to” with “may,” and my argument   goes this way  This is a chess game, and we have a bunch of moves ahead of us here  In terms of the   likely policy adjustment in January, I’m not willing to bet my house—or even the equity in my   house—but I am willing to make a $100 even-money bet that we’ll want to raise the funds rate   another 25 basis points in January  But as we go out further and look at March, I’d probably not make   a $100 bet but a $30 bet  And for May maybe only a $10 bet  And the question is When is the best   time to replace “is likely” with “may”?  If we do it now, we can pretty much recycle the same   statement, if we want to do so, whereas if we were to substitute “may” for “is likely” in January or   March, the market will ask what kind of signal that is  I think the reading would be “They are going   to pass and not raise the funds rate next time”  That may not be the signal we want to send  On the   other hand, if we leave in the words “is likely,” at some point we’re going to be faced with the   problem of wanting to pass on a rate increase but having said in the previous statement that an   increase “is likely”  So that would be my argument for substituting “may” for “is likely” at this   meeting    I don’t disagree with that, and that’s why I said I would be willing to make a   substantial bet that we will want to increase the funds rate in January  And I think it would be   unfortunate to send a signal otherwise  But I am worried about the sequence of these statements and   the advantages of making minimal changes in order to avoid misleading the market  What I’m saying   is that there is a tension between those two objectives     Thank you, Mr Chairman  What strikes me from my conversations with my   contacts is the growing confidence that they do not see major risks on either side, that there are   reduced standard errors around their projections  Very few had comments or concerns about   inflation outside of energy, which, of course, is on everybody’s mind   I’d like to make an analytical point that actually comes from my UPS contact  I think I   mentioned at an earlier meeting that UPS is moving its business off the mixed rail—the piggyback    January 31, 2006 51 of 106    That move is a consequence of the fact that the railroads are unable to speed up delivery times,   which in turn is a consequence of the railroads’ decision that it is not worth the capital investment   that would be necessary for what for railroads is a relatively low-yielding business  UPS is also   working to maximize the return on its own capital  The company is very disciplined about adding   capital and is planning to price low-yielding business out of its network  That is, for the low-yield   products, they’re going to raise prices expecting that the business will go away  My contact at UPS   said that he thought that the strategy would not really be successful and that they will probably be   looking at substantial increases in capital spending in ’07, once they find that they have optimized   their existing plant, that the volume doesn’t go away when they try to raise the prices on it, or that   not enough of it goes away  And I think that this phenomenon might be more general in our   economy  Companies are very disciplined about their capital investment  But as the economy   continues to expand, they’re going to run out of ways to optimize the existing capital plant, and we   will see investment coming in stronger over the next couple of years  That’s an observation that   may have more general application   I support the Greenbook’s forecast, plus or minus a quarter of a standard deviation    [Laughter]  Not worth worrying about  Instead, what I’ve been trying to do is to make lists—and   these could be much longer—of risks on the high side and the low side  On the high side, I would   point to commodity prices, which are high and have gone up a lot, and growing strength—as I just   commented—in business fixed investment  I mention high money growth, because I don’t think   that the rapid money growth is fully explained, and it certainly has frequently been a precursor of   higher inflation   Some indicators on the other side—we talked about housing, the possible reversal of the   unusually low saving rate, the behavior of the yield curve, the risk of oil supply disturbances  Most   January 31, 2006 52 of 106    of oil has been demand-driven, but supply disturbances because of the problems in the Middle East   primarily—Africa as well—could certainly produce a significant downward shock on economic   activity and upward shock on prices  No doubt these lists could be amplified, and I think it’s   probably worth spending more time thinking through the risks and how to respond to various events   than it is trying to optimize the forecast and get that last quarter of standard deviation exactly right   Mr Chairman, many around the table have commented about their experience serving here    I will, of course, echo those  I would like to put a little different angle on it  Of the people who   have had a major impact in my life, you are certainly one  I mark on the fingers of one hand the   people who have had extraordinary influence on me  You have influenced me mostly in my   professional life but also in many aspects of leadership that go beyond economics and policy in a   narrower sense  So I thank you for that  I am also looking forward to continuing to learn from you    I understand that you have some books, at least in your head  And given my interest in making sure   we have clear communication, I have a suggestion for a title for your first book  And it is in line   with some books by your predecessors  So I suggest “The Joy of Central Banking”  [Laughter]    And I suggest that your second book be “More Joy of Central Banking”  [Laughter]     Do you have someplace to go?  [Laughter]     I support the increase of 25 basis points at this meeting  I would like to add a   third question to the two that Vince gave us at the top of exhibit 2  What language creates the best   basis for smooth transition of future language?  Every time we make a change, it gets parsed,   examined, cut, read between the lines, and so forth  So part of my motivation in suggesting the   reversal of those two sentences was to make what I thought might be an easier transition in the   future  Clearly, it’s a very fine point, but that’s what we end up dealing with in order not to provide   any signals that we didn’t really intend
