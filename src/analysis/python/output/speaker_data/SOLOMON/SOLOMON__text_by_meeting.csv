1439,1980-04-22,SOLOMON," That's close to the peak  The difficulty of the non-oil- [producing] LDCs in borrowing sufficiently and the need to draw down reserves will probably lessen the pressures for diversification out of the dollar On the other hand, the probable failure of the substitution account negotiations may increase diversification pressures by the OPEC countries My own view is that right now the best estimate is probably that we'll be nip and tuck with the Germans on the external current account deficit The picture is not as optimistic as it was when we thought a couple of months ago that our deficit would be significantly lower than the German and Japanese deficits I agree completely with Scott that in the short run, meaning in the next month or two, there is likely to be pressure on the dollar if the decline in interest rates moves very precipitously But I think the outlook in the longer run, a few months from now or later in the year, is sufficiently reasonable that we're unlikely to have any major dollar pressure of the kind that we saw in October 1978 But in the period immediately ahead of us, as these interest rates move very sharply--if they do--I think that will cause us problems  On the other hand though, Chuck, until the inflation rate does begin to go down, the reasonably stable dollar is one of the few things we have going for us It is considered an anti-inflationary influence to a modest degree, so I    4/22/80  think we would be well advised to try to make sure, as best we can, that any decline in the dollar is a reasonably gradual one  Not to resist a decline, but [to ensure] that it is a gradual one  Well, that's the privilege of a new boy I want to second very strongly what Fred Schultz said I think we ought to stick with the ""B"" targets and accept the March-to-June targets that fall out I'm perfectly willing to see a decline in interest rates, but I really would urge you not to permit too precipitous a decline I would like to suggest, in view of the fact that the staff is projecting a 16 to 17 percent funds rate as compatible with the alternative B targets, that we ought to have a    4/22/80  phone consultation if it looks as if the funds rate is moving down very precipitously and significantly penetrating the 16 percent range The reason I say that is because, like Fred, I feel that people judge our credibility--at least all the people I speak with in New York--not simply by a mechanistic adherence to the aggregates They also judge our resolve and our credibility, particularly given the fact that they have had considerable skepticism about it in the past, by interest rate movements as well And I believe in your October 6th statement, Paul, you did say that this was not a mechanistic formula and that judgment would be used Interest rates should go down They will go down It's not going to do any damage to the economy if the decline is somewhat more gradual So, I would hope that we would have a phone consultation if it looks as if they're going to go significantly below the 16 percent level that the staff is presently projecting as consistent with those ""B"" targets  Wouldn't it be a little better to set a borrowing level of about $1-1/2 billion plus emergency lending and any special contingencies since, as I understand it, included in that $1-3/4 billion is that uncertain situation and we don't know what else may arise?  As we did the projections we thought $1-1/2 billion would be more consistent with the projections But we defer to Steve, if he feels that his 16 to 17 percent assumption and staying on alternative B is more consistent with $1-1/4 billion  I'm not as experienced as the rest of the people at this table, but it doesn't seem to me that we need a formal decision in this regard We ought to give the Chairman an indication, as he himself suggested I guess, that when the funds rate gets down to the 16 percent range, more or less, he would initiate a consultation I don't think that requires any kind of formal instruction And at that point it really is a question of making a judgment on what is happening not only in terms of the fed funds rate and the interest rate picture but on the aggregates and the rate at which reserves should be fed to the System I think it's just a prudent measure to take, and I hope we would all be able to combine on asking you to pursue that  May I ask a question? If the fed funds rate goes below 16 percent, will that make the 3 percent surcharge on the discount rate sustainable? Would there would be a large amount of pressure to take that off as not being appropriate? I don't know enough about this-- "
1460,1980-04-29,SOLOMON," Are you waiting for reactions?  This is Tony Solomon Let me say a few words about how we see it here in New York First of all, I think it's important to say that the market viewed the April [money] numbers as largely reflecting technical problems endemic to April Market participants don't expect us to change our posture as a result of the April figures and they would be very surprised--and I think disappointed--if we were perceived as overreacting to these one-month    4/29/80  developments The market is really looking for some resistance And in view of the fact that the April M-1A drop clearly goes beyond anything that can be explained by the economy, we are projecting a substantial comeback for money growth for May and June So it seems to me that we've got to follow a fairly prudent policy here and not overreact I would like to suggest that we put a downward limit of 14 or 14-1/2 percent [on the funds rate] for the next two weeks, after which we could meet or confer again This involves a borrowing assumption of no lower than about $800 million to $1 billion, which I think Steve would feel would be consistent If we resist going below 14 percent, the fed funds rate would average about 14-1/2 percent next week probably That's all I have to say at this point, Paul  I think it makes a lot of sense, Paul, to work on that borrowing assumption of $900 million    4/29/80  But isn't it possible, even with a borrowing assumption of $900 million, that we will still have a very precipitous decline in the fed funds rate due to uncontrollable factors? The question that I think we are still left with, which we should face up to, is do we want to show some resistance in that area "
1479,1980-05-06,SOLOMON," Paul, this is Tony Solomon I think we ought to move the funds rate as gradually as we feel we can Even though I feel that we will end up with 11 percent, I would hope that we could operate for the next week or so at slightly above 11 percent So I would like to recommend that we put the floor at 11 percent I don't have any strong feeling on the ceiling  I really feel that it's not a question of catching up with the market Whatever action we take will influence the market We have to be perceived as moving fairly gradually and prudently And I would hope that everybody feels as well that we want to retain the perception that the Fed is not changing its policy [of fighting inflation] So it's really important to show a sense of prudence and gradualism in this [so as] not to precipitate further sharp declines in the market rates by people seeing us move so abruptly to a level as low as 10 percent I would hope we would move down to 12 or 11-1/2 percent in the next week or so and maybe stay there for a week, and then move to 11 percent if necessary    5/6/80 "
1504,1980-05-20,SOLOMON," That doesn't solve the question of [how] we reach agreement between the two central banks  But that means we would have a mechanistic formula whereby whichever side is more anxious to hold the currency up prevails Even though there are departures from time to time between the Bundesbank's thinking and ours, if the dollar were too strong by their standards, during that period of time there would be some divergence between us, which would have to be combated with telephone calls and that sort of thing But the more typical condition is one where the dollar is on the weaker side and, as we have seen in the last few weeks, we get relatively good cooperation from the Bundesbank I have the feeling that would continue to work better than to switch to the kind of approach you are outlining, Henry I also am reluctant to have the main burden for supporting the    5/20/80  dollar put on the United States more than it has been We have been playing our role and doing our share in the last year or two It's not benign neglect But I think it is important that other key central banks also play a major role, and I am afraid that the implication of your suggestion is that the United States would end up being the sole supporter of the dollar I would rather live with the difference of view between us and the Bundesbank during periods of strong dollar activity than start a whole chain of events moving whereby we end up being the sole supporter of the dollar  We can explore that more There are some disadvantages It will become known that the Fed is staying awake and is willing to intervene in the Far East markets The key point is that it will be known that the Fed is willing to intervene in the Far East markets and is doing 24-hour intervention A 24-hour monitoring may make sense, but I don't think we want to accustom the Far Eastern markets [to our] playing too big a role; that view would tend to be encouraged if they begin to see more and more Fed intervention in those markets On the other hand, whenever we have thought instability was likely, Scott or Gretchen have put people on to monitor [developments] And we have where necessary, and a bit reluctantly, [unintelligible] role in Singapore as compared to New York and to some degree Europe  I support the recommendation I spoke with the Swedish Governor when he called me and he emphasized that they would only be drawing [on the line] as bridge financing for periods of up to about two months And if we approve Scott's recommendation, I think we should tell them not only that the increase is only for one year but that each time they want to draw, they would have to check with us and tell us what actions they intend to take and give us a firm indication of the time period in which they intend to [repay the drawing], probably up to a maximum of about two months I think there is a larger reason for going along with this, which is basically that Sweden dropped out of the snake; it is not a member of the EMS And to some extent their request to increase their swap with    5/20/80  the United States tends to symbolize something we haven't seen in recent years, namely that the United States is the pivot and plays a critical role in the international monetary system I think there is virtually no cost for us And not only would we be cooperating with a G-10 country, but in a subtle way [the swap line iincrease] would tend to underline the fact that the United States has a critical role I would recommend it  Well, I asked them that They have  They do not have the ordinary kind of swap line with the Bundesbank Scott, do you want to explain what that arrangement with the Bundesbank is?  For most of them, each time a central bank wants to [draw on] a swap line we have some discussion as to what the conditions would be and what the period would be Normally in the past, though, swap drawings have been made for six months or a year This would be somewhat unusual Our conditions would be tighter in that this is bridge financing and would probably not be for more than two months  Yes, Sweden is a good credit risk I think the only risk, if you want to use that word, is that it becomes    5/20/80  awkward later on with other countries if we do apply conditions and they ask why we didn't apply them to Sweden Our posture always has been, even if the country is a good risk, that we want to be in a position of applying reasonable conditions Now, in the case of some countries--  It's an asymmetrical relationship We don't exactly play the IMF role, but it is true that in the case of some countries that are less creditworthy--take Mexico--we would want to know what their stabilization program was and what the policies intended to get them out of trouble were going to look like before we would let them make a [large] drawing on the swap In the case of Sweden, we can't say that this should be bridge financing [until they could get funds from] the IMF because they have only, I think, $4 billion in external debt; it's not a country that one would push to the Fund We have to give them some direction But there is some danger, if we don't have some sense of the conditions, that we will have more difficulty with other countries in applying conditions when they are really needed I think that's the reason for having some understandings, rather than the risk of not being repaid  Yes  Well, remember, there is political importance to their not being in the European Monetary System The Germans were furious when [Sweden] dropped out of the snake That [furor] has died down and there's reasonable cooperation, but I think they would look to the supplier of the currency in which they keep their reserves since they are not members of the EMS Now, we could always make it a condition, but I would advise against it, that they ask for a similar swap line with the Bundesbank  Yes, and it has a swap line with the BIS  They have drawn on it, with BIS agreement, but they have not gotten agreement from the BIS to increase the swap line  They are aware that we would have to publish this increase within a very short period of time and also that we would have to publish any operations under the swap line with the usual lag of one month  The increase in the line from $300 million to $500 million would only be for one year As for an actual drawing, they would advise us ahead of time that they would be drawing on it and there would be a 3-month limit to the bridge financing    5/20/80  They are terribly dependent They have the highest per capita consumption of gasoline--imported gasoline --in the world We happen to have some domestic [production] Also, this recent wage settlement of 11 percent does not improve their competitive position, although it doesn't worsen it If you look at the weighted basket of currencies against which they keep their exchange rate, the wage increases in those countries on a weighted basis also work out to [an average of] around 11 percent There's a major rethinking going on in Sweden; I think they are at a pivotal time About 65 percent of their GDP goes through the public sector and there is an increasing reaction against that There is a feeling that they've got to come up with a tough energy policy and that they have to shrink public sector expenditures A whole new debate is beginning  Yes They have probably the highest standard of living in the world and they owe only $4 billion The current account deficit, they believe, will be between $3-1/2 to $4 billion; I noticed that the Board's staff thinks it will be closer to $5 billion They do not have any creditworthiness problem But unless they change their policy, I think they will be in trouble in two to three years  Let me ask a question Aside from any constraint that may arise in the lower end of the fed funds rate range, isn't it the directive of the Committee to the Manager to achieve the target on nonborrowed reserves, given the Committee's borrowing assumption? If the actual borrowing level comes in lower than the assumed borrowing level, is he supposed to take additional compensatory action to go higher than the target on nonborrowed reserves in order to compensate? I didn't assume--  -11-    5/20/80  It's possible, but there's no clear--  If you assume that we have a mortgage rate of around 12 to 13 percent for the rest of the year, do you have any projections as to what the level of housing starts would be later in the year?  As a relative newcomer to this Open Market Committee, I've been struck by the very frequent reference to losing our credibility if we don't stick to the targets It seems to me, first of all, that the target is a range and that it's perfectly appropriate to come in at any part of that range, if we can, rather than to zero in always on the midpoint But the larger issue is that we seem to have a misunderstanding of what the Committee's October 6 decision was I thought the Chairman said publicly that there would be somewhat more emphasis on targeting monetary aggregates and less on  -25-    5/20/80  thefed funds rate and that judgment would be used; there was not a mechanistic formula If that is a correct understanding of what he said, and if he was reflecting the decision of the Committee at that time, then quite clearly some people in this Committee are not on line with the public articulation of [that decision]  Okay, I stand corrected but I think my point is still a correct one You did say that it was not a mechanistic formula and that judgment would be used Now, in a world where there is so much uncertainty, I recognize that there is a good possibility that we will undershoot but there's also a good possibility that we will overshoot I don't believe the Federal Reserve System is so different from any person or institution in the policymaking arena that they should ignore the importance [of the maxim] that in a world where there is great uncertainty the prudent thing to do is to move gradually  Larry Roos said that our commitment was to gradual changes in the money supply, although his recommendation was to use the faster path to get [back on track] by September It seems to me that we need to consider the public's perception of us as central bankers, with a world of great uncertainty on both sides We need to maintain a certain public perception and level of confidence in what we are doing rather than make what others see as very major changes We may think that we are being consistent But as Fred Schultz said, the outside world does not [understand] what we are doing in terms of this very sharp volatility For us to move to supplying nonborrowed reserves-- particularly since there's an assumption of virtually no borrowing if alternative B is accepted--at roughly a 9 percent rate is completely inconsistent with any responsibilities we have toward the long-run objective on the money supply, which is our principal objective as central bankers And, hopefully, there is a connection in terms of the rate of inflation My understanding was that the Committee had as its long-run target a desire to edge down the money aggregate targets as occasion permitted in order to achieve a long-run reduction in the rate of inflation I am concerned about our terms of reference in our discussions here where everybody's position is completely predictable, including mine And I frankly don't know how we break out of this situation But if there's no room for judgment--if it's going to be get back on path even [if reserves have to] increase at a rate of 9 percent over the next few months, then it means with an assumption of no borrowing that the Manager will be committed to achieving the nonborrowed reserve target And he probably will achieve that That would not necessarily result in the aggregates behaving exactly in line, in proportion, but they will certainly go in that direction The second point I want to make is How can we expect to maintain interest rates at lower than everybody's expectations regarding the lowest likely pace of inflation? There is nobody who assumes that the rate of inflation is going to be below 10 percent even by the end of the year  Well, then I take it back There is one person Even Bill Miller said that he would hope to get it down  -26-    5/20/80  to 10 percent by the end of the year And we're talking about maintaining short-term rates at lower than the rate of inflation What is going to be the reaction of long rates, which have the biggest impact on the real economy, if there's no confidence in the Fed as the guardian of monetary prudence and a strong anti-inflationary effort? We're going to get a perverse reaction When we raised short-term rates as part of the November 1st package, there was a greater confidence that the Fed was coming to grips with the problem of inflation, and long rates actually declined If there is a widespread perception that we are running a short-term interest rate policy with rates significantly below the rate of inflation, I think we're going to have a perverse reaction in the long markets And that will have a more damaging effect on the real economy So, I would hope that the Committee would opt for a more gradual approach in this area of great uncertainty Therefore, I would urge that we adopt alternative A or something lower than the midpoint area And I would hope that we would not endorse a fed funds rate floor which is significantly below the rate of inflation, as some people here have suggested  I interpret what you're recommending to mean that we will take a look at it when it reaches 9-1/2 percent before a decision would be made to move down to 9 percent Is that what you said?  Is that what you call being specific?  I think it's a bad precedent to start being that specific in the public record I'm not arguing now for any particular policy I'm just talking in terms of the long run  I vote for keeping Steve's language I think we'll get into less trouble later on  Well, you have taken the fed funds range that is consistent with the staff's alternative B  In fact, if you want to make the switch, I think we could do it the other way  I don't think that represents a reasonable compromise I am sympathetic with the Chairman's need to form some kind of consensus, given the difference in views That tips it very heavily toward the view you expressed earlier, Chuck; it's not a reasonable compromise  Your proposal, Nancy, says what about the aggregate targets?  I'd go along with that in the interest of a consensus "
1526,1980-06-05,SOLOMON," Yes  I'm informed that it has gone up $3 billion since the 2nd of April  The market has seen the Desk enter earlier at 8-3/4 percent It has seen the Desk enter at 9 percent I think there's a general impression in the market that that's the area of our floor but it's an impression of a fairly wide range in terms of the floor It seems to me, even though I've been rather strong in my arguments against precipitous declines, that it's perfectly comfortable to let the floor stay in an area that would be somewhere in the present range I think the 9-1/2 percent would be interpreted --if the market were to see us entering at that rate in a consistent way--as being somewhat higher actually than it believes [the floor] to be So I don't have that much difficulty living with your earlier proposal that if necessary we come down to the 8-1/2 percent level But if there is more support for a more cautious approach among other members of the Committee than there has been in the past, then we might suggest to the Desk that it continue basically operating in this range around 9 percent  Larry, are you aware of the fact that we are hitting our reserve path?  We have been hitting our reserve path But the economy is somewhat weaker and the monetary aggregates are not performing in relation to that reserve path as we had assumed [they would] at the last Open Market Committee meeting  I think that's a fair statement  I think it's a good idea  We here in New York feel that that kind of strategy makes a lot of sense If you have nodding heads on the Washington side, I think we ought to go with that "
1555,1980-07-09,SOLOMON," Mr Chairman, I think it's worth emphasizing one point, which is that the reluctance of the Bundesbank to intervene directly in support of the dollar on as large a scale in the last few days--which means depressing the D-mark--is [related to] the fact that they are at the bottom of the EMS So there is this contradiction and dilemma for them Basically, cooperation with them on intervention had been very good,  But they have this dilemma, and they are very, very aware of it  No, we didn't have $28 billion, Nancy We would have had $30 billion, but that included $10 billion of Carter notes Of the $10 billion of Carter notes, we actually ended up selling--I don't remember the exact figure  No, it's $9 billion  Yes, but then they start coming due about every 6 months for about 2 more years, Fred, because I originally put them out with 3- and 4-year maturities Then we had scheduled them at 3-1/2, 4-1/2 and 2-1/2 and 3-1/2 So a whole series is coming due The question of availability depends on how we look at our debt Looking at it very short term and ignoring the fact that we owe this money and are going to have to get it somewhere else later on, we still basically have sufficient resources We have quite a few billion dollars, although in previous periods when the dollar came under heavy pressure we spent as much as $5 billion a month [in intervention] This problem is getting more and more serious, and I think in our considerations of domestic policy we probably have to be a little more sensitive to it than we have been in the last few months  But [I'd point out] one thing I assume the members of this group are aware that there is one quasi- phony component in our current account calculation We are figuring in for 1980 $40 billion of services income from abroad In practice, we are only going to get about half of that because we are counting as services income for the United States all profits earned abroad by American companies, even if those profits are reinvested abroad Therefore, in terms of what crosses the exchanges, we still need about $20 billion of capital income to validate a so-called equilibrium current account I think I've made my point clear If I haven't--  Yes  It's $15 billion, not $20 billion this year?    7/9/80 -5-  We've had some substantial increases in SAMA purchases of Treasury obligations But I don't think we are getting the same percentage of their investable surplus  The psychology, Ernie, is that [selling gold] seems to be much more effective if it's a component of an overall package of forceful measures than if it is done by itself In the present climate it would look like a major act of weakness And that might spur some additional dollar selling unless we did it on an enormously massive scale, not just the levels that we have before On the other hand, if the situation gets to a point where once again we have to begin thinking carefully of a package, then along with some monetary policy measures it would be appropriate and add to the effectiveness--this is my own personal feeling--to do some substantial gold selling And in that situation I think the Congress would understand that We'd have less of a political problem also So I think both factors operate  Your point is that the mopping of the reserves is justified not just by the weakness in the foreign exchange markets but also by the reserve path  Well, I think you would be justified in going on to say that it might create--I don't know how to phrase this but you'd have to handle it cautiously--dangers for the future  It seems to me that the question is not what assumption the Federal Reserve is making in regard to tax policy, but how you will answer questions on policy recommendations that the Committee will ask you Substantively I certainly agree with Lyle Gramley and a lot of others that the responsible thing to say-- and I hope you will say this, Mr Chairman--is that the size and the composition of the tax cut should be considered early in the year However, I'd like to make a point which I sometimes think the American public doesn't quite understand [regarding] why, if everybody says a tax cut is inevitable next year, it shouldn't be legislated now So I think you have to point out two factors One, that the tax cut and the composition of that cut can't significantly affect the course of the economy for the rest of the year; and secondly, if you choose to, and you may not choose to, that the politics involved in an election year are not conducive to the kind of carefully studied and deliberately planned tax cut that is appropriate  I also feel that wage-price guidelines, even though they have not been very effective in the last two years, are an absolute essential I think it's appropriate to point out that they worked in periods during the '60s, that there will be an opportunity for whichever Administration is in power to start with a fresh slate, and that certainly if they can be made much more effective they will add both to a better recovery and higher employment as well as a lower inflation rate And they should go hand-in-glove with consideration of the tax-cut policy  As far as the aggregates go, I also share the overwhelming consensus [developing] here that we should not change the aggregates for 1980 But I think it's important to point out at least that we  -44-    7/9/80  expect M-1A and M-1B to come in toward the lower end of their ranges If we don't say that, we may get a very adverse market impact  As for 1981, I am similarly concerned about what the market impact will be both in domestic markets--[that is], long-term market rates--and the foreign exchange markets if we fail to say or at least to imply that there will be some edging down of the targets In a certain sense, it has almost become widely expected of the Federal Reserve I'm not disregarding the substantive problem that Nancy and Chuck pointed out, and I realize that we shouldn't lock ourselves into anything Certainly we should not be specific, but I am a little concerned about the market impact If we were to fail to [say something of that nature], that would be a noticeable omission, and I would hope that with your usual skill you will be able to waffle I hope you will bear in mind that we are talking with one eye on the market I guess that pretty much summarizes [my views]  I think that captures it exactly  One possibility would be to say that our presumption at this very early stage is that the Committee will wish to continue its long-run fight against inflation by some gradual reduction of the aggregate targets but, given the uncertainties on all these technical aspects such as the shift in the demand for money and a few other things, we feel it's definitely premature to come up with even tentative or preliminary [numbers]  Do you ever formulate the preliminary targets for [the year ahead] in relation to the targets rather than the performance?  That was my presumption until I heard Bob's comments just now Of the two choices you've put to us--hope to get [growth] down but heavily qualified as against being neutral--I prefer the [former] My reason is that if it's heavily and sufficiently qualified, it's not a constraint on our flexibility to do what we decide later on has to be done in view of the situation at that time But I think it will come as a bit of a shock to the market if we are neutral, for the reasons I [mentioned] earlier So it seems to me that in this imperfect world we live in, we're better off making a bound in the right direction even though it's qualified enough so that we reserve the flexibility of the Committee to do what it thinks best--  Coming back to this proposed waffle Before you ask for a show of hands you ought to make people understand what the alternative is--the second thing they're going to be asked to show their hands on--which I gather is a completely neutral statement  Okay Even though I welcome the adherence of Chuck and Lyle, I'd like to--  Well, what you said in your reformulation of Steve's [wording] is that consistent with our long- run policy, we would like to see the aggregates lower in '81 as well, but we don't know if we can make it for such and such reasons What I would like to suggest we say--again because I'm thinking of the market impact, which could be very damaging to all of us--is that consistent with [our long-run policy], it is too early for us to indicate anything specific because there are too many caveats and we just don't know where we are going to come out In other words, to say to the market that we don't know if we can make it--  The Open Market Committee will be known as the International House of Pancakes!  I'm trying to refresh my memory--  In the operational paragraph do you have to give pinpoint percentages for the third quarter or could you give a range? The way I read the language for the third quarter it says at annual rates of _ percent, __ percent and _ percent [for M-1A, M-1B, amd M2]  Well, I'd go along with Bob Mayo's suggestion, which Chuck supported, about taking the arithmetic average between ""B"" and ""C""  What do we do about M2, though? That's all right for M-1A and M-1B  The logical one to move would be France because she's also at the top of the EMS  They have a correlation between money supply and the rate of inflation Both are running 13-1/2 percent  But we're so close to the logical level of, say, 10 percent that it would make a lot of sense given the enormous instability right now in the exchange markets We've spent $600 million [in exchange market intervention] in the last three days; we ought to consider moving half a point, rather than a full point We don't have the kind of spread that we had before  Two points?  If we get the discount rate down in two moves, to 10 percent, they may very well be in the same range We don't know what the fed funds rate is going to be  I don't understand Henry's point If I understand you correctly, you feel that maintaining the 8-1/2 percent floor [on the funds rate range] would give the impression that we've eased policy Why?  But the funds rate hasn't been at the floor After all, we're always looking at the weekly averages The weekly average has run 9 to 9-1/2 percent in the last few weeks We haven't been at the 8-1/2 percent floor even though we've been following the reserve paths  If the staff is anywhere near right, ""B"" assumes we get to 4-1/2 percent [M-1A growth] by December and ""C"" assumes we get to 3-1/2 percent by December If we're taking a middle figure, we're definitely coming in somewhere along those lines, as Paul said, consistent with the earlier statement we agreed on  It's an asymmetrical equal weighting  SPEAKER(?) Sure! What is that?  I think that's a very respectable position  After all, the very fact that it's a fairly general statement and a very preliminary one makes it more logical that it was a consensus view rather than a vote  It's not ""committed"" [The Chairman] will use that earlier language that we talked about  -73-    7/9/80  I find it ironic that we've reached agreement fairly quickly on 1980 and the next quarter and we're having so much trouble on the longer term with very general language We basically have had three points of view expressed There are those who would like to say simply that we'll be reducing the aggregate targets next year There's the other extreme, which stays basically neutral and says we don't know yet And there's the middle one, which you put forward, which shows some bias and some hope but not a commitment [to reduce the targets] and says that the situation has to be assessed at the time It seems to me we ought to take a vote on all three or get enough people to raise their hands in support of the middle ground  There's just one minor technical presentational point, which I think is worth calling to your attention The way the operational paragraph has been drafted, by putting M2 for the first time down at the bottom of the paragraph instead of saying M-1A, M-1B, and M2, it will give the markets the impression that we're downgrading M2 That's not the intention from the discussion, I gather What was the reason for that switch?  Paul, I would suggest that we present projections assuming no tax cut and then go on to say that if there is a tax cut of, let's say, $25 to $30 billion, then the picture would change How it would change depends upon the composition and the timing of implementation because that makes an enormous difference as to how much stimulus would occur in fiscal '81 I'd give them some ranges There is a good deal of uncertainty depending on the composition of the tax cut, so I'd make that a little more general  But the unemployment figures don't look that bad This says without a tax cut the range is 8-1/2 to 9 percent but with a tax cut--depending upon the composition--it probably would be a percentage point lower than that for the fourth quarter of 1981 So it's down to 7-1/2 to 8 percent  Well, we're not saying that we shouldn't have a tax cut We're saying we should wait a while and see what the numbers are going to be  That's why I said earlier that you have to stress that the composition of it and possibly the magnitude will be affected by events in the economy over the next few months  Shouldn't the Bluebook have a paragraph in it about the fact that the reaction of the financial markets may throw this whole scenario off? "
1576,1980-07-25,SOLOMON," This is New York In our judgment [the adjustments] are a little lower than the Board staff's estimates We have -2 percent for M-1A and plus 1 percent for M-1B I think the question Henry raised of whether to have a short letter--  I think the question of whether we should have a short letter with an attachment as against the five-page letter should be looked at after you send us the draft I think it's important in the letter not to protest too much about the arbitrariness of the NOW adjustments We want to do it sufficiently to make our point, but on the other hand we don't want a lot of newspaper stories that say the whole targeting process is becoming meaningless because of the excessive arbitrariness of all the NOW adjustments  I think there is some advantage to that  Paul?  What about seeing what the Committee's feeling is--or what is your own feeling--about making the range as suggested 1/2 to 1 percent? "
1601,1980-08-12,SOLOMON," I think to some extent we can take some cheer from the fact that there is this much sensitivity to interest rates It really reflects a neutral view about the likely movement of the dollar The fact that we're running virtually in equilibrium this year and Germany and Japan have such large deficits offsets a traditional pessimism about the dollar There is a neutral view and, therefore, we get very large movements of money in response to very tiny differences in interest rates If [market participants] still had the same pessimistic view of the dollar that they had over most of the period in the last three years, then I don't think we'd see this much sensitivity to interest rates We'd see consistent pressure on the dollar  Peter, to what extent have these dealers who are under water hedged in the futures market when they met their underwriting responsibilities? Is it now fairly prevalent among all of them to hedge their positions?  What lag is there on their reporting their positions in the futures market?  We have to have the flexibility to send some kind of policy signal if our situation requires it And if we were to have a completely symmetrical automatic relationship, we'd be tying our own hands  I don't understand what Lyle means by taking M2 out  Well, from what I understand, the way the staff calculates the reserve paths, it is basically a qualitative correction of a path constructed primarily on M-1 If M2 is moving up very rapidly, it's not given equal weight by any means  We're still left with the fact that at the end of the year the public and the Congress are going to see what the behavior of M2 was in relation to the targets  I hate to disappoint the Washington Post editorial [staff], but between ""A"" and ""B,"" I prefer ""A"" [even    8/12/80  though I'm a New Yorker] I have a slight preference for splitting the difference, as Dave Eastburn suggested, and going with a $75 to $100 million borrowing assumption But--  Yes, and that would give us for July to September [6] percent for M-1A, [about] 7-1/2 percent for M-1B, and 9 percent for M2 with, as I say, a $75 or $100 million borrowing assumption But if the consensus is for alternative A, I'd go along with that I certainly prefer it to alternative B  I don't think there has been much-- let me use the word ""distortion""--in domestic monetary policy by international considerations in the time that I've been on the FOMC There have been some considerations of timing, maybe a 1/2 point difference from time to time on the low end of the fed funds range It hasn't been very significant  But if we assume only $75 million in borrowing, we are going to be supplying more reserves  I have no reason to assume that our [estimate] is any more correct than Ed's, but our calculation is that alternative A does not involve even a slight increase in interest rates It might involve a slight decrease in interest rates, depending upon the assumption  As contrasted to alternative A  I think we are trying to walk a balance here because we don't want a perception in the markets that there has been a shift in policy If it does work out that the fed funds rate is at the floor--that we have to move toward the 8 percent floor--which I would be willing to live with, particularly combined with the intermediate target between ""A"" and ""B,"" we would be flirting a little with a possible adverse reaction in the long market There  -42-    8/12/80  could be a perception of a definite easing If we go for alternative A, we might be well advised to keep the funds floor where it is  I would rather [not] lower the floor to 8 percent, Chuck, if we [went with] the compromise  But we never know So if we are going to be perceived as planning our targets on M-1B, and M2 to some degree, I think it makes some sense to be a little cautious  If I had a different last name, I'd tell you it was truly Solomonic! "
1639,1980-09-16,SOLOMON," My reason was very simple At that point Proxmire was opposed to intervention and so was Henry Reuss And the Exchange Stabilization Fund of the Treasury, because of paying off the Roosa bond guarantees, was beginning to run in the red--  It's finally back in the black because the IMF drawing added to the resources, and the extra interest has helped on that But at that time we were in the red and we would have gotten a major reaction from the Congress plus a very high level of unhappiness being expressed by both Proxmire and Reuss on intervention as opposed to free floating So I said the timing was bad even though I agreed in principle I think the conditions have changed now Proxmire and Reuss are much more reconciled to a managed float and are not that unhappy with it, and the Exchange Stabilization Fund balance sheet has moved back into the black Under those circumstances, I assume the Treasury would not object  Even though you're right that it hasn't been [the case] in the current [period], I still think there is a residue of misunderstanding about the Desk's operations I hear that from all of my visitors--that the Fed is giving conflicting signals They don't understand [our new procedures] completely no matter how much Paul has said on this That's why we were thinking that a technical explanation by Peter and his people to the dealers, with the press listening in, might make a lot of sense But it might be wise to wait on the timing of that until we sense that concern increasing again At the moment things are quiescent  But he's quoting dealers, too And some of the dealers who were critical a couple years ago are more relaxed  [Unintelligible]  We have had volatility in both Why can't they criticize us for both?  Could I differ with that? I see problems with that There are times when, given the unpredictability of the markets, if we are in there too quickly making adjustments, we could be whipsawing the markets And we will get all kinds of complaints about the unpredictability of Fed policy I don't think there's any across-the-board rule of thumb that we can adopt on the frequency of adjustments I think we have to leave it to the judgment of the people who are [tracking] this on the Board staff and at the Desk, regarding the chances that a certain movement will get reversed and whether we should move [immediately] or wait a day I just don't see any other way of playing this  -10-    9/16/80  Am I correct in associating the increase in employment with the reduced rate of decline in real output? I get an impression that probably no productivity gains are going on  When people talk about the underlying rate of inflation corresponding to the average hourly increase in labor costs in the industrial sector are they assuming flat productivity?  -12-    9/16/80  In our financial report for the Redbook, we included the views of some key financial experts in New York And Henry Kaufman in those remarks is predicting a double-dip recession  We're estimating in New York that the fiscal year 1981 deficit, brought up to date with all the recent adjustments, is around $61 billion Most of the people in Wall Street are also estimating a deficit in the $60 billion area  That has in it a tax cut which represents basically the consensus [unintelligible] Remember, we have the Reagan tax cut, the Carter Administration's, and the Senate Finance Committee's [Our forecast] is based more on the Administration's [proposed] tax cut It also includes the cancellation of the import levy tax and the withholding tax on interest and dividends, which revises the estimates And there is a revision involving improved revenue because of the earlier bottoming out of the recession I understand that the Administration has updated its estimate only to $41 billion so far What they did was simply to take the mid-session figure of $298 billion and add the adjustment for the economic renewal package and the failure of the bill on withholding tax on interest and dividends Having said all that, I don't see how we could oppose for substantive reasons, aside from the momentum, a moderate tax cut I think a moderate tax cut makes sense I agree with what I believe is the general feeling in the country that it ought to be focused in a more structural sense to promote investment and hopefully, although I'm not very sanguine about it, some improved productivity The impression in the press, Paul, was that you took the line in your first appearance on tax matters that a tax cut probably would be advisable this year but was premature to consider at the time [of your Congressional testimony] and ought to be studied carefully I had the impression, maybe an erroneous one, from the press that in your more recent appearance you seemed to be opposing any tax cut There was an implication of that more than the emphasis on timing and composition in your earlier appearance Is that an accurate press [account]?  Right But at the same time, given the increase in the tax burden and given the psychological attitudes in the country--and I'm not talking about politics in the narrow sense of the term--there will be an enormous loss of confidence in this country's future and in the vigor of the growth of this economy if people feel that they simply have to accept this increasing tax burden with no relief in sight As I said earlier, I strongly support not giving any relief in across-the-board personal income tax cuts, even though those [taxes] are terribly onerous But I think we have to do something to show that we're working toward a tax policy oriented toward structural improvement in the economy I suppose it is analogous to my feelings on productivity It's not a question only of tangibles, things one can quantify It gets get into social, cultural, psychological, and work ethic attitudes around the country In an intangible way the people's perception of the tax burden and what government is doing about it is a very important substantive factor in the economy And I don't think we can just look at the numbers and say Well, it's $60 billion and, therefore, because we know it's going to make monetary policy tougher we oppose it Obviously, if we can bring down the expenditures side, that would be great But I don't believe it's going to happen because of the defense component, no matter who gets [elected] We have a choice among various unpalatable alternatives If we can do something to get the spending side down, fine; everybody agrees on that But the issue still is Where do you stand on the tax cut?  Gee, I hope this room isn't bugged! The Federal Reserve predicts a second recession [after] next year  The discount officers tell me that they are reluctant, since the banks have been away for so long, to get right back to the same level of disciplined access  I can't change my mind set that quickly First of all, the volume of New York borrowing isn't that big My impression, without remembering the numbers, is that it's not  -31-    9/16/80  the usual proportion of nationwide borrowing But we have been in recession And it hadn't even occurred to me, Paul, that we should start using moral suasion other than the normal level of trying to discourage--  I didn't know that those estimates were circulated You're right about the New York numbers But the difference is not in real GNP estimates It's almost entirely in our assumption that there will be a reversal in the shift in money demand, wholly for transactions balances--that as people become increasingly sensitized to inflation they will reduce their holdings of non- interest bearing or low interest bearing transactions balances  On the other hand, let me point out that the Washington figures have been more correct than New York's for the last two months This difference in assumption has been there for two months now  I'll try to be almost as brief as Governor Rice I think we can best hit the balance we're looking for, in terms of both the credibility of policy as perceived by the markets and the country on one hand and our concern about aborting the modest recovery, by an intermediate solution I'd like to suggest something that isn't too different from what Chuck Partee suggested I think we ought to have borrowing of $700 million, 4-1/4 percent for M-1A, 6-1/2 percent for M-1B, and 8-3/4 percent for M2  8-3/4 percent Even though I'm indifferent on whether we have 8 to 14 percent on the fed funds range or the extended one, I think it's unnecessary to extend it, and we may be giving some policy signals unintentionally I don't really see much advantage [to changing it] On balance, I would say we ought to stick with 8 to 14 percent  Let me say a word about my feelings on credibility I'm sorry to take longer than I intended but [let me say a few] more sentences on this When I talk to people in the markets, they are not questioning our credibility or the steadiness of our policy at the moment There is a vast underlying skepticism that we will stick to this policy later in the year or early next year, but at the moment I think they are impressed They have seen a very substantial rise in interest rates as the aggregates have moved up and they have not seen us try to stop that So I don't think we have a credibility problem at the moment We have the constant suspicion that we will buckle at  -40-    9/16/80  some point but [market participants] don't feel we have done so or are in the process of doing so at this point If the projections turn out to be anywhere close to accurate and we take these intermediate targets and and the borrowing level we've talked about, I think we will end up with interest rates somewhere in this range in the short run And if necessary, we can tighten up later in the year when the pressure comes on So that is what I would [do]  Mr Chairman, may I make a suggestion, building on what you've said? If we go for what you call a ""neutral"" or what some of us have called an ""intermediate"" solution, we might take a leaf out of what we did earlier in the year but on the opposite side We might say that if the aggregates come in somewhat lower than the intermediate targets, we won't adjust the reserve path accordingly but would accept that  [Yes, not] quite so quickly We would accept them So if the opportunity offers itself, we'd err on the side of not pushing in reserves  That's right  SPEAKER(?) That's what he said  No, it brings us out to somewhere [unintelligible] than if in that situation we had put in ""B""  That's what we've been doing the last few months, in effect  -46-    9/16/80  Everybody or the voting members?  Do you want that much flexibility, Peter?  I'll go with either  Chuck, my suggestion carries forward on what Henry just said I don't understand why you say that a very minor nuance--that if the opportunity arises, we tolerate an undershoot--is worse than alternative B  But Chuck, if there is a weakness in the figures, the markets will reflect that Therefore, we have a small delay in not correcting the undershoot but it isn't as though we're going to be pushing up--  You don't want to target on the funds rate, you just want to raise it! "
1664,1980-10-21,SOLOMON," Another way of putting it is that we're seeing a market reaction to a much more sensible and balanced German policy There used to be an impression that more than any other single objective the objective of German policy was a strong and appreciating Deutschemark People are seeing now a Bundesbank policy, pushed by the government as well, toward an easier domestic monetary policy even with a large current deficit and even though the mark tends to be toward the lower end of the EMS I think the Germans ought to be congratulated for following a more balanced and less single-minded policy It certainly is helpful in terms of world stability as well as in terms of the US dollar Do you agree, Mr Chairman?  But I would agree with the implication of Henry's point I think this time there ought to be more emphasis on accumulating deutschemarks and building Treasury balances And then if it goes that far, we could always raise the limit here and not let the rate go as much as we did last time, Paul  Well, Chuck, the only answer I can give you is that I think we know a little more about what is a desirable--to use a dirty word--target range than we do about monetary aggregates and interest rates  The Germans are running at an inflation rate of 5 percent or less and we're running at 10 percent or whatever rate you want to call it Eventually there will be a reversal of this movement I do not think that we get points--we ought to let the dollar rise sufficiently so that traders do not tend    10/21/80 -5-  to be bearish on the dollar They can be caught off guard But on the other hand, unnecessary volatility on the up side which one knows is going to get reversed later is not helpful It goes beyond the point of keeping the traders off balance And I think we have shown in the last couple of years that a more activist policy in regard to the exchange markets is a useful policy So we don't have to have an exact sense of what an equilibrium rate is to know that at some point we want to limit the volatility on the up side and take advantage [of opportunities] to restore balances  Okay Why don't we see if there's any objection to it?  I think it makes a lot of sense to do this I assume that you will touch base with the Treasury and that you will [negotiate] on behalf of both the Federal Reserve and the Treasury--that's my understanding with the Treasury--unless Treasury voices [a contrary view]  Could we authorize now on an interim basis a move up to, say, $1-1/2 billion in D-marks?  It seems to me that the--  It is possible that one of the options that could finally prove most satisfactory to the Treasury and ourselves in regard to their cash problem [would] also involve charging this against our own balances It would be useful to have a higher limit on DM holdings because [that is] one of the options, although it is not likely [to be needed] Warehousing doesn't require it It seems to me that if there's no opposition within the Committee  -10-    10/21/80  it just makes sense to put ourselves in a position where we do have some extra margin And an interim authorization to hold up to $1-1/2 billion in DM seems to make some sense  I don't think it's important whether it's $1 billion or $1-1/2 billion Since Chuck feels so strongly about it, let's keep it at $1 billion  We can go up to $1 billion  -11-    10/21/80  The psychology of this [unintelligible]  I know there's no exact answer, but what are the best estimates of the length of the lag?  But that's based on pre-1974 data?  Following up on what Fred said, I think we're in a major quandary because I think the way the country interpreted our October 6th announcement was that we were going to pay a price in terms of volatility of interest rates but the implication was that there would be much more stability in the growth of the money supply We have seen at least in a year like this--and possibly, although I hope not, even in a year when the underlying economy is not quite as volatile--that we don't have that kind of control for the reasons we were talking about So I think we built up expectations that we can't meet now And there's also an impression increasingly getting around that it's not so much a lack of political will or resolution by the Fed but that the Fed basically doesn't have the ability to control the money supply, which is your point But, Fred, if we stress too much that we can't control the money supply in the short run, it can give a very undesirable impression of the Federal Reserve's [impotence] among those in the public and in the business and even the financial community who are naive about [the extent of] our ability to control the money supply  That's the whole point, Larry There has been a supposition that if we are willing to let interest rates go without any limit whatsoever, we can achieve more control over the money supply I think the results--plus the analytical discussion we have had in miniature this morning, with our discussion of the lags and other things--have shown that one can't draw that conclusion  You mean because of the misestimation of NOW accounts?  But that doesn't remove the need to make a decision  Yes But let me follow up on what Fred said at the end It seems to me that we ought to go for the targets of alternative A but we ought to put the borrowing level close to that of alternative B I would suggest $13 billion That can always be reviewed later, but with a $13 billion [initial] borrowing assumption presumably we would not get any significant upward pressure on the fed funds rate if the other projections are correct Now, both alternatives may be completely unrealistic and we may just be swept over by this situation Taking these funds rate assumptions that are consistent with the aggregates, it seems to me that we may pay some enormous costs if a month from now when the minutes of this meeting are published they show we targeted alternative B [growth rates] for September to December, which clearly indicate mathematically that we have given up on M-1B Its growth would come in at 7 percent fourth quarter-over-fourth quarter, with the upper end of our range being 6-1/2 percent I think the public would not understand that At the same time, we are in this dilemma, and any significant rise in interest rates right now would cause some proverbial problems to the economy So my instinct is basically the same as Fred's, and I would reach toward a combination as I indicated  You're right; we made that error In part we made that error not only because of ideology but because of the economic forecast Nobody expected this early bottoming out of the recession We may have had a causal impact on the earlier bottoming out of the recession by letting interest rates drop too quickly I agree with you that we were letting them drop too fast  We miscalculated, though If we had known that the economy would turn up in the third quarter, I don't think we would have pumped in reserves as much as we did  I think one thing we have to bear in mind is that none of us really has any confidence in the forecast It could come in at that level or it could come in much higher or much lower Al Wojnilower in New York is saying it's going to be a stronger recovery [than generally forecast] Other people are talking about the double-dip The forecasts are all over the lot Under those circumstances, it seems to me that we have to start off fairly cautiously in terms of not wanting to see any major movement of interest rates But I do think we have the credibility problem; Paul obviously feels that I may be exaggerating it But I am concerned about a September-to-December intermediate target that would make us open to the charge that we actually targeted growth fourth quarter- over-fourth quarter that is higher than our target range It seems to me that in this very unsatisfactory situation there is no good answer and we should compromise because I agree with Paul that the differences between ""A"" and ""B"" are not that significant I think they have a public relations importance The difference between $1-1/4 billion and $1-1/2 billion initial borrowing is not [much] more important than the $60 million reserve difference between the ""A"" and ""B"" [alternatives] I think there has to be a mix, and I've made a specific suggestion I don't know what alternative specific suggestions there are  You're going to say that all these banking structural reforms that I recommended have complicated--  We should really go back to an average of the two M1 measures  Yes, in your November testimony, if you are going to hammer that point--  I think you're going to have to hammer it in for defense if for no other reason And maybe you ought to indicate to the [Congressional] Committee that the reformulation of the '81 targets will have to be much more explicit  I agree; I won't argue I wouldn't dissent from your proposal, Paul It's sufficiently balanced and it meets the needs  And you'd move the fed funds range to 9 to 15 percent? "
1690,1980-11-18,SOLOMON," I second that very strongly Chuck, it's a different kind of world in the last few years and will be increasingly so First of all, I would hope that we are not going to be living permanently in a world where our interest rates are so ridiculously high compared to those of other industrialized countries I hope we will find ourselves in an improved domestic economic situation Under those circumstances, once that artificial stimulus [in interest rate differentials] is removed--to have a spread of 9    11/18/80  percentage points between Eurodollar and Euro deutschmark rates is incredible--the dollar is going to go down very, very sharply  Yes, but what I am assuming is that there will be some moderation, but only partial, of inflation There will be a much larger drop in interest rates at periods of time because of the way we've seen history [work] on this  Maybe next quarter Nobody can be sure of these things, but I suspect we will see disproportionately large reverse movements in the dollar I think we have to have a very substantial volume of our own foreign exchange resources to cope with such a situation If we are always drawing on swap lines every time we have to move in, the other countries can call the tune on us much more easily Having our own resources will make us a little more masters of our own policy I am not sure I see why you are concerned about this I would not place the emphasis on intervention being a good thing because of the interest rate policy moves one can therefore avoid to some degree Your concern relates to intervention to accumulate foreign exchange resources more than--  May I comment on Chuck's second point, the exchange risks? Of course, we have the same exchange risks when we borrow on the swap lines to support the dollar I would argue, Chuck, based on my experiences at Treasury, that the exchange risk is much smaller if we have substantial resources of our own We are almost sure to make money on our present operations We are buying the mark at a time that it is weak  I know it is weak  Well, one can't see it completely There could be a Middle Eastern war, which would upset the situation But if--  Okay But if you extract from military [conflict and other] extreme assumptions, in economic terms with inflation in Germany now running 3-1/2 to 4 percent and with the miserable [inflation] record we have, when our interest rates come down--which they will to some degree though I am not saying they will come down a helluva lot--we are going to see some major reverse flows I think you will find that we are in a better position to minimize our exchange risk and maximize our gains if we have a stock of resources than if we are forced to start borrowing It's just a longer-run plan basically And it is a more comfortable situation for the people who are actually managing this There is no mathematical proof of this, but I feel that most people in the Treasury and in the foreign exchange area in New York would agree with me that this is the way to operate in practice We have not done badly at all in the last few months on this whole question of exchange risks and profits and loss And one can be a better manager when one has--  Well, I think 193 is not sustainable  Yes, but they're still short [of their objective] by about a billion dollars  They wanted the increase because Governor [Wohlin] felt that they might have to draw on the swap line The $200 million line was extremely small, so we felt it would be a gesture of cooperation to increase it to $500 million and it would give him a little more clout, so to speak, in talking with the Swedish government about what he felt were certain inflationary policies that were putting the Swedish currency under pressure And this was a way of reinforcing his position He felt that there might be a need for it The last time I saw him at the BIS last week he  Yes It is not a burning issue, but it seemed like a useful gesture of cooperation at that time  -14-    11/18/80  Oh, yes We approved it  It is doable in one way, because I have looked into it If we publish the weekly seasonally unadjusted figures and only make our seasonal adjustment calculation once a month when we publish the seasonally adjusted figures for the month, then we are okay under the Freedom of Information Act But if we don't publish the seasonal adjustment and still prepare it internally, then we could be subject, although with a time lag, to a Freedom of Information request  Yes, but there would be all different kinds of seasonals; [they would be] all over the lot  Well, one can make a persuasive argument that the weekly seasonal adjustment is so unreliable that it shouldn't even be prepared internally, and we could prepare it on a monthly basis [only] Therefore, I don't see that anybody would have to face this issue My lawyers tell me that--  I think that's true, Paul Peter Sternlight also feels that the market is reacting to the weekly numbers in a more moderate way Even so, it is interesting that three more public-minded and important market participants in New York in telephone calls to me over the last couple of months basically made the same suggestion that John Balles has made They believe that the weekly figures are inadvisable and are causing much more volatility in the market  I'd like to ask a question also Am I correct in assuming that when when you talked about being in the lower half [of the ranges] in the coming year that that would be based on the actual fourth quarter of 1980 and would not attempt to correct for any overshooting?  -22-    11/18/80  I am not recommending that because it would seem to complicate things even more if we were to change the practice How are we going to adjust for the NOW accounts [in the effort] to understand all these changes? But I was just wondering if you think we will be under political pressure or internal pressure to in some way absorb the overshoot  If we have a wide funds rate range, then it's the borrowing assumption that determines the nonborrowed reserve path, not the reverse  Where we are is $2 billion  I would prefer a $16 billion borrowing assumption and the specifications of ""A"" My first instinct would be a fed funds range of only 13 to 17 percent, but I am worried  -37-    11/18/80  that if things don't go as expected, we might find that the 17 percent upper limit would force the supplying of very large amounts of reserves, more than the Committee would want So my instinct would be not to lock ourselves into the 17 percent but make it 13 to 18 percent with some flexibility in judgment regarding that 17 to 18 percent area It seems to me that we ought to try to stay within the 17 percent, but if in consultation with the Manager it looks to you as though that will require supplying more reserves than is advisable, there ought to be sufficient flexibility in the directive for you to make the judgment to go up to 18 percent  You mean by telephone?  There is also some advantage, Chuck, to leaving it at 13 to 18 percent with the Chairman understanding that the Committee hoped it would not go beyond 17 percent, simply because when the directive is published the market may overinterpret in a negative way the fact that we narrowed the range So, strictly for the directive, I still would favor 13 to 18 percent but with an understanding that, if possible, not to go beyond 17 percent  Then we'll miss ""B""  That's what I mean Taking the staff's view, we'll miss ""B""  Yes, but that's not your proposal This is for 20 percent; yours is for 17 percent  They're very vocal, Ernie  Yes "
1711,1980-11-26,SOLOMON," Paul, this is Tony Solomon Can you hear me?  I think the recommendation is a wise one; I think we should go to 18 percent The market view is that we are already in a 17 to 18 percent range, and it seems to me that we really have no alternative  Paul, we are seeing a rise in the overall level coming from the [unintelligible]--not significantly, just one or two Districts Are you getting the pressure that we are?  Paul, to answer your thoughts, another [dimension] of the changing nature of the window that I foresee is that the multi-bank holding company fringe has developed in recent years, especially in our District and a few others with a lot of very large multi-bank holding companies They see a little less of the money and avoid the surcharges relative to [what is] implied [by their liquidity needs] In fact, Citibank in New York may not [unintelligible] holding companies We have a lot of [unintelligible] themselves in December "
1731,1980-12-05,SOLOMON," Paul, do you want comments?  Okay I think this is a reasonable proposal as long as it's going to be in the record Otherwise the New York Fed would be in danger of being [on the hot seat] for a greater period of time  Sure, and we can see what the situation is next week  What does that mean, Dave? If you mean by [unintelligible] reserves?  I assume that we would accept the period of undershooting, if we get to that point, for sufficiently    12/05/80  long that we correct some of the overshooting that we had in the second half of this year  I agree  In answer to Henry, I think the chief advantage of your approach, Paul, is that we don't know now whether to raise it to 19 or 19-1/2 or 20 or even 21 percent for that matter This may be a very involved situation, and I think there is a chance that it will settle down in the course of the week If we were to move [up] and raise it to 19 percent, we might have to meet again  -10-    12/05/80  Tuesday or Wednesday to raise it to 20 percent So, there is some advantage in this approach, even though normally I don't think it is a good way of addressing a problem "
1750,1980-12-12,SOLOMON," New York Okay I assume that will be in the official records, Paul "
1775,1980-12-18,SOLOMON," It doesn't work like that for the Treasury Assuming that they have the resources in the Exchange Stabilization Fund, then the decision is made ad hoc There is not a self imposed limit, assuming the resources are available Now, the ESF has limited resources which they expand by warehousing with the Fed, up to the limits that we permit  Well, they bear the exchange risk if they warehouse    12/18-19/80  I think it's about $2-1/2 billion  There's $2 billion left  No, I've testified on it before  Yes What is left is mostly SDRs  It would probably make more sense to do that later on, Paul, when the markets turn around But, Ted, why does the Treasury carry in its formal balance sheet the IMF drawing of $2 billion as a negative? We still have $1-1/2 billion, roughly  So it's a negative item for the ESF but not to the Treasury as a whole  And there is a fourth set When Arthur Burns was here, he would sometimes give a daily limit to the New York Desk He discontinued that after a while But there is also some consensus between the Treasury and the Fed and the Desk as to some broad range of tactical day-to-day type limits  Mr Chairman, let me make what I think is the positive case for this I arrived at this view pretty painfully at a time when I was handling this at the Treasury As a practical matter, we are very reluctant as a government to sell large amounts of gold when the dollar is under attack If we don't have substantial balances of foreign exchange, which we accumulate as market opportunities offer, as part of this leaning against the wind strategy--I'm not talking abut pegging the rates, obviously, and the record shows that we haven't pegged rates--then we have to go into debt immediately There are various consequences of that First of all, the markets are constantly aware that we don't have our own resources and that we are going into debt It affects the credibility of our intervention There are always speculations on whether we're going to run out of resources and whether the Germans will increase their swap debt [given] that we're dependant upon Germany's good will at that time I am focusing on Germany because that's usually where the issues arise Secondly, we would show a better profit position if we had our own balances because then if the dollar weakens, we sell balances and only go into debt when the dollar is much weaker--if we've used up our resources--rather than going into debt immediately The same [is true] on the up side So it tends to improve the profit- loss picture; we can't guarantee a profit, but it improves the prospects of one [We have more] credibility in the markets because  -11-    12/18-19/80  of the independence we have, in terms of not having to submit to any conditions from other central banks or other governments The fact is that we have more of a say in the judgment as to whether the exchange rate is overshooting or undershooting by a very large amount--again, I'm not talking about pegging--rather than leaving that intervention position entirely to the foreign central bank  All these factors are very powerful reasons, in my view, why we should accumulate a very substantial position Now, one can argue Why not let the Treasury do that? First of all, the ESF has limited resources, even though it can be supplemented by warehousing But there are limits to that They can't warehouse more than they have the resources for Secondly, we have less to say If the Treasury is going to have the only resources, then the Treasury is going to call the tune on international monetary policy alone Thirdly, it's very important in terms of the market impact and to the Congress that the Treasury and the Federal Reserve be in this jointly This has been the view of every Administration that I can remember Being in that kind of joint position, we both derive strength from the other Finally, I must say that the previous Congressional objections to a more active policy disappeared at the time of the November 1, 1978 [program] with the overshooting on the down side, when the collapse of the dollar was so strong that Proxmire, Reuss, and the others strongly supported us when we put together the November 1st package I told them at the time that the implications of that were that we would build balances as market opportunities permitted They both said they recognized that and they thought that was appropriate At the time I said that to Bill Miller who was Chairman of the Federal Reserve, and he was supportive  For a country our size, and with the dollar being the principal foreign currency for transactions and reserves, one can argue not that we need $8 billion but that we should have $30 or $40 billion if we are not prepared to sell gold in large quantities Now, nobody is talking about [accumulating] that [much] I think the chances of the market permitting us to accumulate those kinds of reserves [are remote]; it's just out of the question But it might be feasible to accumulate $8 or $9 billion or something in that area And I would hope that we would go along with the Treasury and would agree to increase the line substantially The immediate operational question--we don't have to increase the limit too much if there is an understanding that from time to time the limit can be raised--is whether we can go ahead with, say, a $1 or $2 billion increase now But it seems to me that the long-run strategy is what the FOMC ought to consider  John, on that I'd say first of all that we simply lean against the wind and let the market pressures show up in terms of the direction It's the magnitude of the [market] move that we try to lean against in the short run The record shows that very clearly in the last two years since November 1, 1978 Now, when we get to a situation where we have something like the November 1st collapse, then of course we have to intervene massively We have not done that There have been substantial dips in the dollar in these two years during which we simply leaned against the direction The traders themselves feel that there is a stabilizing influence if the central banks are in It doesn't mean we have to be in every day There have been many long periods of time when we haven't been in at all It can reach a situation, though, where there is a very clear consensus within the government, and even in the markets, that by God this [market move] just has gotten momentum and is out of control, and it's not reflecting the fundamental factors That still leaves an extremely broad range in which we would, if they were very large movements, simply lean against them But we would let the movement go in the direction it's tending to go It does not involve a conception of where the rates should be It does involve a conception of how far [the markets should move] in either direction, when we begin to get into an area of extreme undershooting or overshooting But as I say, the only really massive intervention we did was in a short period of time--a two-month period starting November 1st up to December of 1978 --and then [the markets] turned around beginning in January It is just the facts of life And the markets themselves like that kind of stabilizing force because there is just too much at stake Now, in terms of more basic economic considerations, it is also true that if the dollar collapses too far, aside from any financial problems that can create, it really does feed inflation If the dollar over-values too far--again I'm talking not about making narrow judgments but very broad judgments--it hurts our competitiveness and we end up with major balance of payments problems So there is some kind of rough sense Also, the markets really don't believe that central banks are completely indifferent to exchange rates over some broad area They think we have a target When we practiced what they call benign neglect, they thought we wanted a continuous weakening of the dollar No matter what we said, they thought that was what we wanted, in effect  -13-    12/18-19/80  In addition to Ted's specific point, there is a more general statement that I think ought to be made We'd be more independent of the external environment if we had our own resources in terms of [implementing] domestic monetary policy If we have a very serious decline in the dollar, which goes too far, and we don't have the resources, then we've got to yank up interest rates And we may not wish to do so Lyle Gramley [can speak to this], for example; he was on the Council [of Economic Advisors] when this was a serious problem So I think that is the larger truth, which swamps the technical effects And even the technical effects, I think, are very easily manageable in an economy as big as ours--and I've talked with Peter Sternlight regarding this and his open market operations  Then we'd have to sell the SDRs to a government; we'd need to find one that would be willing to buy them  We'd have to sell them to a government in order to get the currencies to intervene in the foreign exchange markets We can't intervene with SDRs  Oh, no I had to negotiate pretty hard to get them to agree to the quantities of SDRs they would buy  -17-    12/18-19/80  Another disadvantage is that we have marks and yen, and if we had the SDRs, a good part of that would then have to be cashed into sterling and French francs, which we normally would not want to intervene in Eventually, if the evolution of the international monetary system is such over the years that the SDR becomes more and more usable, then the time may come when that's a very practical suggestion I think it's a rather attractive one in the long run to hold our foreign exchange reserves in SDRs But there are very practical constraints in the short run We wouldn't want to be at the mercy of other governments, particularly since they have a limited interest; they're not required in the Fund articles to buy whatever SDRs are offered them, whether we offer them directly or through the Fund They only are required to have a certain minimum holding and both Germany and Japan are past that limit  The profit-loss factor, which I mentioned and Scott mentioned, is only an incidental one in the sense that--  There's a view on the Hill, that if the intervention is accurate and reflects the fundamental factors, then we won't end up losing too much money; we'd probably make money It's a political fact of life to try, and it's attractive as well not to be in a loss position where that's possible But that doesn't influence or dictate in any way when we intervene or the scale of the intervention  Well, I spoke with the other day to get his feeling of the situation I'm just passing this along Their view is that  And in that they include the repayment of the swap drawing by us; that's they way it shows up on their books They're afraid that if they draw too heavily on their reserves, they will increase the pressure on the D-mark Secondly, through the Ministry of Finance [they are] selling D-mark denominated assets to the OPEC countries They also feel that this is a temporary situation--that there will be a turnaround because they keep pointing to their inflation rate of 5 percent, compared to ours They appreciate a modest amount of intervention by us, and they feel that what we are doing now is modest They are not asking us to do a large amount of intervention We really have made this decision in terms of our own interest, although checking with them to make sure there is no objection [It's the same] when the situation is reversed; we expect cooperation from them But if the Germans wanted massive intervention and we were opposed to that, it's understood that we wouldn't do it If the Germans wanted no intervention, obviously I think we would respect their wishes unless we ourselves had a view that we were losing competitiveness to such an extent that we insisted [on intervening] to protect our own interests But that's their view on the amount of intervention They feel that the [intervention] also has more effect on their domestic money supply We don't seem to have those [effects] for reasons that we can go into detail some other day But more effects on their domestic money supply arise when they do the intervention So, that is their view  Lower than the guidelines or the performance?  I don't think we do any service to the country let alone ourselves if we present long-run targets that are almost impossible to explain with these screwy numbers, no matter how much fine print and explanation we give I feel we would be perfectly justified and would get a reasonable reception if we said that we have a year of transition ahead in which there are going to be major and unpredictable shifts in NOW and ATS accounts and, therefore, during the year ahead we'll be targeting a broader monetary aggregate Then we would publish once a month the results of our broader aggregates Of course, the components that make up M-1A and M-1B are still in those published numbers, but we don't have to publish them as such People can reconstitute them but there would be a difference in press treatment We've examined pretty carefully whether there are substitute targets We looked even at the monetary base; we looked at total reserves I, at least, came to the conclusion that those alternatives were worse than simply targeting a broader aggregate in this year of transition I feel also, as Lyle Gramley does, that we didn't help inflation any by letting interest rates go to such extremes as we did this year It doesn't help to go to 20 percent for one or two months and then down to 10 percent for a couple of months I think we have to pay much more attention to real interest rates and factor that more into our policy decisions I also agree with quite a few people that we have to accept the base drift--that the targets for next year would be incredibly restrictive if we started the new range from the the midpoint [of the 1980 range]  I tend to place enormous emphasis on this problem of communicating something simple, as Frank Morris said, and also targeting something that will enable us to have a better track record this coming year than we had [this year] I think targeting a broader aggregate is easier to defend than what was presented [in the Bluebook]--coming out with targets for M-1A and M-1B as well as the broader aggregates That's all I have to say on the long range  I'm willing to live with the substance of this--the 16 to 20 percent and accepting the shortfall I am a little concerned that the first sentence, by setting up the first-quarter targets as consistent with a kind of annual target, may be read by the markets as indicating that we are probably going to go ahead with the same annual targets that we set tentatively We we might correct that impression, which I think is a distinct danger, if we simply add to the end of the first sentence ""consistent with the tentative annual targets set at its meeting of July 1980, which will be reviewed""  You testify when--February 20th?  Let me note what my market contacts in New York say I went out of my way to hear [the views of] a very wide group of people during the last two or three weeks Even those who I might say are the strongest hawks in the tradition of the New York market sense are saying ""Don't tighten any further; keep the funds rate where it is"" I don't see that our credibility requires us to do any further tightening There may be periods of time in which the operations will work out so that the funds rate has to be somewhat over 20 percent, in the 20 to 21 percent range, but I gather it's possible that the rate will subside a little The language ""over time"" is loose enough that if we have to spend a large part of one week at 20-1/4 or 20-1/2 percent, that's permissible  We don't know  I think that would be better We don't really want to open up this discussion until we talk about it in the context of the longer run  Some Fed watchers might  Well, Paul, maybe those of us who prefer 16 percent would go along with 15 to 20 percent to get a larger consensus if there were an understanding that when it got down near 16 percent we would have a consultation  Well, does it look as if we have widened the range? The last range the public has--  But when do we publish the 13 to 18 percent?  I don't think we're going to be operating in the bottom part of the range and, therefore, I don't think we're stretching out the-- "
1808,1981-02-02,SOLOMON," But it's the banks individually, of course, that decide how much excess reserves they want to keep  One thing that hasn't been studied by the staff--and maybe it's worth studying in answer to the specific point that you just made--is how to avoid as big a component of subsidy and the criticisms, which may mount further as we get into the thrift institutions discount window situation It seems to me that we might consider having a surcharge--a frequency surcharge as we do now, although the timing could change--but that the size of the surcharge should be equal to the difference between the basic discount rate and, let's say, the average of the 3-month CD rate over the previous four weeks We wouldn't get as big a ratcheting effect from that and banks that come in too frequently would have their subsidy eliminated I think that might be worth some study  I think you reduce it  I think this discussion could be seen a little more systematically if we look first at what modifications [we could make] in the way we set the initial borrowing requirement, what modifications [to make] to the nonborrowed reserve path, and then see what residual kind of change, if any, is needed in the operation of the discount window The point you made is quite relevant We know that there is a tradition here and it disconcerts people if we keep changing things very frequently We achieve some of the same effect through the first two alternatives It would seem to me that we might give more weight in setting the initial borrowing requirement to what level of borrowing is needed or, in other words, what level of nonborrowed reserve path is needed to achieve the intermediate target and less emphasis to smoothing the post-meeting funds rate I've been as guilty as anybody else, or maybe more so And if we are going to try to come closer to the path, then maybe we can't afford the luxury of that kind of smoothing emphasis in setting the initial borrowing requirement I think that's worth talking about anyway  I understand the implications of it But I find myself in a very curious situation in that I happen to agree with Larry Roos that in the broader sense of the term the politics require some demonstration of a further improvement in the procedure Unfortunately, the only further improvement I can think of is trying to track the money supply more closely even though it probably means more interest rate volatility I don't have the bottom line magical, mystical, faith that some people do that when we get this money supply tracking very closely, for some reason interest rate  -42-    2/2-3/81  volatility is going to be reduced But even though I don't have that, I don't see any other way to go; the whole [prospect] of improvement seems to me to lie in that direction We can't make a partial regression toward more emphasis on the fed funds rate without looking foolish So, even though I don't like the bottom line, the dynamics of the situation are taking us in that direction Similarly, along with a more realistic initial borrowing requirement, I also would support the implied recommendation--maybe it's implicit enough in Steve's summary paper--that the nonborrowed reserve path be adjusted more promptly and more sharply Right now I don't know how to handle it Do we leave this entirely to the discretion of Steve and Peter, checking with the Chairman? Or are there some parameters or some guidelines--it's very hard to conceive what they would be--that the FOMC would want to give to the Desk and the staff on the size of the adjustment of the nonborrowed reserve path? It seems to me that these are the areas we ought to try to reach a consensus on first and then see what's left  I think, though, that we can reduce to some degree the size of the box, or the criticism that comes from being in the box, if we move to some arrangement whereby the bank that comes in the second or third time in too short a timeframe has to pay the--  I've been thinking that probably the best rate for an extended credit program for the thrifts would be the 3-month CD rate so that they get some earnings support but they're still paying a market rate If we move on the adjustment credit program to having a surcharge that was a lagged average of the 3-month CD rate, then we would also have something that seemed to make more sense for the rate on the extended credit programs It seems a little more rational, anyway, and less arbitrary  I was talking there about the extended--  There is one additional thing that is proposed legitimately and that's the question of whether, in the operating procedure, the reserve path should be adjusted if M2 is growing significantly out of line At one FOMC meeting we did suggest that the Desk place more emphasis [on M2] but in practice that is not really factored in to the way the reserve path is drawn  There are two ways of doing it One is to give 50 percent weight to M1 and 50 percent weight to M2, which in effect means that we're giving a much smaller weight to the nonreserveable deposit components of M2 But it's a clear arithmetical way Another way is simply to instruct the Desk that when M2 growth rates are deviating, a qualitative [adjustment] is [to be] made in the reserve path, leaving it to their judgment how much, but indicating that we do want a correction in the reserve path  What's the argument for that, Henry?  Just one more blow we're going to strike in favor of deregulation [or] simplification Okay  If we were to move to adopt new recommendations immediately, then I think Chuck's formulation would make more sense  I'm not sure, but--  I don't know how important all of this is  SPEAKER(?) Is it important?  Well, they do at 8 and 20 or 8 and 21 percent  On the down side wasn't 8 percent a constraint?  -57-    2/2-3/81  I'd have to agree with you anyway, but--  Well, I think there is consensus that we all want a meaningful discussion when--  With a few exceptions Well, I said a consensus I think it's a minor question as to whether to word it in the traditional way or to word it as in Chuck's approach  Will you feel a need to move that quickly, in view of the fact that we're still trying to iron out the reporting problems and the inconsistencies?  Are we going to have more revisions or more errors as a result of this move?  Well, why did we change in the first place? Didn't we originally--  Now you no longer feel the need to accommodate the banks?  -63-    2/2-3/81  Well, I don't really understand I can understand those of you who want to impose these extra burdens on the banks because you think it's a major improvement to [monetary control] but [not] those of you who think it's a very minor one I don't quite understand why we're so concerned about not increasing the burden on the banks in other areas but in this area it's okay We're going to get very minor monetary policy--  I'll join Lyle  I'm on the margin between moderately and strongly opposed  What are you going to tell your critics next year if you're going to take care--  At previous meetings, I had taken Frank's position But I've been thinking it through and I believe it's a little dangerous to target on M2 or some other broad version of [money] I think people will still be looking at the M1 components of the M2 number And we're still going to have to be open to much criticism Also, I'm impressed by Steve's earlier point It is a cumbersome variable to target because we can only operate on part of it So, my instinct would be to go ahead and target the same Ms that we did last year and adjust the targets for the NOW accounts We'd be publishing only the raw data and then periodically we would make a--  It's rather natural that we would end up trying to get a three-month correction, isn't it, simply because of the way we look at these, which is to see where we come in at the end of that quarter and then to try to get back on path?  Do you think he'd write a different newsletter if we did publish [the directive immediately]?  I wish to reinforce that The market participants whom I respect the most are saying that it's important to maintain uncertainty in the minds of the market participants to the maximum degree possible They say that the Fed move to a 6-point band created a healthy tone in that market I agree with Chuck that there are times when we'd be publishing a fed funds range that would reduce that uncertainty, and I think that would tend to produce unfortunate  -83-    2/2-3/81  results in the markets In a certain sense it would focus more attention also on the fed funds rate band if we published immediately  [Unintelligible]  Uncertainty in markets' behavior is absolutely a sine qua non Take the foreign exchange markets If you don't have people betting on both sides, you're going to have [in]stability in markets or movement in one direction Now, if you're going to have a government controlled market, fine It seems to me that that is not what you're talking about  In the staff material I think there are some good comments on that They point out that if we publish the raw data, without the seasonal adjustment, everybody is going to be making their own seasonal adjustments And then they're going to be watching other things to get a clue as to what Fed policy is and will pay more attention to the fed funds rate  Kichline When you give the Humphrey-Hawkins testimony, do you have to say anything about what we expect the public sector borrowing requirement or the unified budget deficit to be in fiscal 1981-82? Do you explain that as one of your assumptions?  The Reagan Administration so far is talking about a $29 billion unified budget deficit for fiscal year 1982  Exactly They have 3-1/2 percent growth in real GNP I think you are going to get yourself into a very strange situation there because one has to make some really heroic assumptions to get [the deficit] down [to that level] In fact, I think real GNP growth at 4 to 4-1/2 percent is needed to get that and one has to assume that inflation is down substantially  No, our view is not that different I'd say it's a little on the gloomier side But I would agree with Lyle that we're unlikely to get any improvement in the rate of inflation unless we see some unexpected developments in fiscal policy, to a degree that I don't think is realistic  No, I'm not talking about the receipts side; I'm talking about the spending side I'm sure we'll have a tax cut But I can't conceive that even by fiscal 1982 we will have the kind of spending cuts that will change expectations and interest rates [unintelligible] of the nominal GNP that our monetary policy [unintelligible] So, I don't see anything but a long slide ahead On the other hand, it may very well be that after another year or so of this, the Administration will accomplish a little [unintelligible] I think the fallout of all this, in terms of a recommendation for the targets, is that the amount of flak we would get if we didn't go ahead with a 1/2 point reduction [in the M1 ranges] would be enormous; and we live in a [unintelligible] type world None of us knows exactly what the results of this would be, so I don't think we have any real alternative, even though I think Lyle is right that we're not going to be able to show, at least in the next twelve months or so, any reduction in the rate of inflation  I know, but you saw the House Banking Committee study It said that the Federal Reserve was entirely to blame for inflation and that the Treasury deficit had no impact  I think monetary policy is going to be restrictive as hell Without making the problem any worse for yourself, even though I realize you are only talking about a quarter point in the case of the two aggregates--  You're creating a precedent, and it involves accepting the base drift What I'm afraid of is that the projections on interest rate levels may be right If we are going to be talking about interest rates levels as high as are projected here, or current levels, and then we make [our range] somewhat tighter, we may find that we can't stay the course any longer  There's also a problem that when it's a big adjustment, even the skeptics recognize that these screwy numbers are a result of the adjustment But when it is a very minor adjustment, then the skeptics are going to say we are trying to fudge the figures on the growth [of the aggregates]  -105-    2/2-3/81  I basically agree with what Roger Guffey has suggested the 1/2 point reduction on the M1 ranges We might consider a somewhat different approach on M2 and M3, however It seems to me that you could say to the [Congressional] committee  -117-    2/2-3/81  that, given the uncertainty with regard to the new instruments and the structural and transitional shifts, we want to widen the range We could widen it symmetrically and make it 5 to 10 percent instead of 6 to 9 percent Or, if we feel there would be too much criticism of the widened range, then I would say that we are keeping it at 6 to 9 percent but we will have a clearer fix on it in July Therefore, we are putting the committee on notice that we can't assess the effect of these structural shifts and these new financial instruments completely and that in July the numbers may be different and the targets for the rest of the year may be different  I'm not talking about the NOW accounts here I'm talking about the developing financial instruments--the money market funds or six-month money market certificates  It seems to me that even though one can borrow against a six-month money market certificate, at least at Citibank, some of the components of M2 such as that, which are growing fast, are much closer to investments than to money in the transactions sense Now, I know one can write a check on a money market fund but, even so, the people I see and speak with are considering these things and the rates paid on them to be much closer to Treasury bills, for example, than to passbook savings So, we're getting into a new area with this kind of instrument and it seems to me we can argue either for a broader range for this year or for temporarily keeping the same range and then reporting on it in July  Fred assumes that he can survive [without] impeachment! The [Congressional] committee--  Did we miss M2 by more than we missed the narrower aggregate?  As I suggested, I would widen the range by a point on each side, if we feel we can get away with it, in order to look neutral If not, then I would have to come out for the 6 to 9 percent  My experience with that Congressional committee is that Fred Schultz is 100 percent right What they're going to say is ""Look, you've lowered it a half point here and you've raised it a half point there; if you average them together, you haven't really done anything""  Do you think you're splitting--  Then we would be forced to say something about what we expect to happen because of large CDs  Maybe we should change that; maybe we should be a little more changeable in July  I don't think any of us would be arguing this so strongly if we didn't all have a feeling that we will be focusing on this much more--that this is somewhat of a precursor to the kinds of debates we're going to be having at all the meetings  Well, normally I would be suggesting that we at least raise the authorization because we only have $300 million left and it's a turbulent market But I think some discussions are needed with the new team at the Treasury to get their views I'm not quite sure of the legalities of this If we have that discussion and they are sympathetic to our raising it, can that be done by a telephone call?  The CPI in Germany went up what--a full 1 percentage point last month? I think the wholesale index went up 14 percentage point  The official forecast on the rate of inflation is simply that it's going to go up to about 4-1/2 percent, but the markets don't particularly believe it  Does it show up as a reduction in their domestic money supply when they intervene to support the DM?  I'm surprised at the difference in the fed funds range between alternative ""B"" and alternative ""C"" There is only a 1-point difference, given a rather substantial difference in the target  Are we going to get the initial borrowing assumptions that are compatible with these three alternatives?  -152-    2/2-3/81 -153-  My initial feeling would be something between ""B"" and ""C"" I think that to some extent we should accept the shortfall, but I don't think we now have to accept it completely My guess is that we would have a better chance of keeping interest rates roughly constrained and not going any higher if we had something between ""B"" and ""C"" I think we are showing enough restraint, and that would give us a little safety margin for later in the year  January is showing good growth  But in drawing up the reserve numbers, the staff needs a little [narrower] guideline I would think  They're not the same in ""C""  I think it's a mistake to lock ourselves in too precisely in terms of the directive For example, we have never spelled out in the directive the initial borrowing assumption, even though I know Peter Sternlight would like it There are problems if we try to lock this in We can and have instructed the Desk that it's the sense of the Committee that we want a prompter adjustment in the nonborrowed reserve path if we begin to see misses; but I don't know of any parameter we can give for a specific concrete instruction on that It's still going to be judgmental  Also, we're going to have a nice stagnantly stable economy!  SPEAKER(?) Yes  The economy may be getting a little stronger  We may want to help correct any misimpressions of the kind you mentioned earlier by saying ""recognizing the shortfall in December""  Then you would put the quarterly figures in the directive?  We fully agreed to what you proposed, Henry, shading from alternative ""B"" and ""C"" "
1837,1981-02-24,SOLOMON," Paul, this is Tony Solomon I agree with the substance of your analysis of the situation and the bottom line of your recommendation But since it's not clear that even an increase in the borrowing assumption and a lowering of the nonborrowed reserve path will necessarily keep us where we want to be while we wait out this peculiar situation, another possibility would be to modify the last meeting's directive to say that in view of the stronger growth in the broader aggregates and the fact that the narrower aggregates are somewhat distorted by the NOW account picture, we would permit some undershooting for a period of time And then we could consult again As I remember the discussion at our last FOMC meeting, even though it never got into the directive as such, there was some feeling in the group that it would be appropriate to permit some undershooting in view of the overshooting in the second half of last year But I'd go along with your more informal approach, if the Committee doesn't want to modify the directive "
1861,1981-03-31,SOLOMON," I don't have, possibly, a full historical understanding of the policy [that was in effect] before I was at the Treasury During the time I was there, it was understood that the Desk had flexibility [to intervene] in relatively modest amounts to counter disorderly markets, using its own judgment, and keeping both the Treasury and, of course, the Chairman informed And it was understood that on larger interventions there would be authorization I don't know whether we're moving in a direction now where, even on modest efforts to counter disorderly markets, there has to be specific authorization from both the Treasury and the Chairman, even in regard just to the use of Federal Reserve resources as distinct from the joint use of Federal Reserve and Treasury resources I don't know what the situation was prior to my joining the Treasury Was it that clean-cut that there had to be specific authorization?  Have there been periods of time, Paul, when there has been modest intervention to counter disorderly markets just using Federal Reserve resources?  Well, Mr Chairman, everything considered, I think it would be appropriate for us to agree to [extending] the increase if they request it They are a responsible central bank and I think it would be a little strange--we'd have to have a good reason and I can't think of what reason we would offer--to refuse such a modest increase  $300 million; the temporary increase is $200 million  As bridge money  What gets published the $8 billion?  Mr Chairman, it's a good suggestion It's strictly procedural [But] I think it would be a mistake to change the number; the markets might read something into that if we were to change the number I see no reason at this point,    3/31/81  particularly with all the discussion in the markets about a policy shift in the Treasury in regard to intervention, for us to feed that  The more meaningful limits are the informal limits  That's very appropriate  Even though we didn't explicitly discuss a return to path in the second 4-week period, it was formulated the way Peter suggested, and Steve also, that the flexibility was for as long as necessary and that when it was no longer necessary in terms of the fed funds rate, then it just automatically made--  At this point, there is no floor to the fed funds rate And it seems to me that in the future, if we continue with this operation, every time there's a telephone consultation and a decision is made to change the nonborrowed reserve path--ignoring the floor or ceiling as the case may be--then for the rest of the intermeeting period we are operating without a floor or without a ceiling  Well, I was a little confused immediately after the meeting until I talked with Paul a couple days later because during the consultation Paul had said--and everybody went along--that he wouldn't be particularly disturbed if the funds rate went as low as, say, even 14 percent and then there might or might not be a need for another consultation And yet we were required to add reserves when it was down to about 13-1/2 or 13-7/8 percent So, I was thinking that maybe we had a kind of rough floor set around 14 percent But then I realized, after talking to him, that the way he was interpreting this was that we basically didn't have a floor  Even though I agree that there's a lot of uncertainty as to how much the second quarter will weaken and how much increased strength in the real economy there will be in the second half of the year, I feel that there's a greater presumption of strength in the monetary aggregates Now, I'm not talking about April, but we're not likely to see the same velocity of circulation, and there are increases in defense spending and tax cuts of some kind coming long Therefore, it seems to me that to position ourselves as flexibly as possible, we ought to aim for a return to the bottom end of the range by June rather than to the midpoint However, even though that's alternative B, I think a $13 billion borrowing assumption would be just as compatible with that as a $15 billion assumption I'd go on to suggest that to the extent opportunities arise for a discretionary adjustment of the nonborrowed reserve path during the intermeeting period that we bear in mind the overshooting of M2 If that continues to overshoot in a significant way, that should be factored in Our analysis is that alternative B, even with a $13 billion assumption, probably means a rise in the fed funds rate of maybe a point or so from present levels That's a very rough guess, but we might have something close to the 15 to 17 percent range If you take the midpoint, it would be a marginal increase, but I don't think it would be that significant that it would cause a lot of reaction And that's the best position we can be in; I think it would be a great mistake to go either to ""A"" or to ""C""  I think we have two choices One is to take what we think it probably would be--let's say 15 to 17 percent--and then have a symmetrical range with enough room on either side Or we can deliberately put it off center from that 15 to 17 percent--let's say, John Balles' 11 to 17 percent--because we want to trigger a consultation at 17 percent I think we are better off continuing to have a 5-point range that is symmetrical [around] the most likely area it will be within because the Chairman can always call a consultation anyway  If 15 to 17 percent is the best guess of the staff [at the Board] and in New York, then we can talk about something like 14 to 19 or 13 to 19 percent  But isn't March fairly strong, Paul?  But isn't March M2 still running around 19 percent?  I would prefer 13 to 19 percent It seems to me a little more symmetrically placed around--  A more even pattern of borrowing yielding the same total as this week would probably give us a lower fed funds rate than the 15+ percent we're seeing, right? Therefore, if we're talking about keeping the present fed funds rate, which is around 15 percent, then--  Well, we would certainly have to  start off with it there Then I think we probably are talking about something closer to $13 billion than $11 billion  Even though I distributed the memo, on balance I would prefer that greater attention to M2 be done on a judgmental basis rather than a mechanistic one  I'm still bothered by something I want to be sure that everybody understands something, which is this My gut instinct is that if we set the borrowings low at $1150 billion, we're going to see a drop in the fed funds rate in the next week or two I realize that we'd be able to adjust it But do we  -56-    3/31/81  want to see at this point a market signal that we are easing monetary policy?  You mean with that $115 billion?  I prefer the 5-1/2 to 6  SPEAKER(?) You feel it has to be a single number?  Well, put me down for 5-1/2 "
1884,1981-04-28,SOLOMON," Paul, when we publish this on Friday, if that's what you intend to do, are we going to give it month by month?  But the week-to-week numbers that we've been publishing--  All right And in the future when we give the monthly adjustments for the correction of the NOW accounts, we would give it seasonally adjusted?    4/28/81  And that will be just once a month?  Paul, this is Solomon Is the staff taking one average shift adjustment assumption? Or are they taking it month by month as far as where the NOW accounts came from?  I'd like to ask Steve a question, too Forgetting about the seasonal adjustment of the NOW accounts-- looking at the regular-type seasonal adjustments--have you assumed as speedy a check processing by the IRS this April as last April or are you going back to the earlier pattern?  Okay  Paul, I have the impression from people I've been talking to in the financial market--not business people so much--who are following this very closely that they expect a significantly higher rate of real growth than the completely flat forecast that the staff had last time People here are talking about 1-1/2 to 2 percent real GNP in the second quarter Has the staff revised its forecast for the second quarter?  Well, let me make a general comment then It seems to me that there is a much greater probability of overshooting in the second half of the year, and I think we want to take as much advantage of undershooting as we can get in the meantime so that we don't repeat the pattern of the second half of last year It would seem to me, therefore, notwithstanding the big seasonal question mark for April, that it would be best to reduce the nonborrowed reserve path substantially, let the fed funds rate move up, and not be as timid and as late as we were in the second half of last year I think it's quite clear, even if the tax cut gets delayed until October 1st, that with defense spending building up the way it is and the very big real increase in business spending that we've been seeing we're going to have a heck of a problem later on So, my instinct would be to move quite vigorously, to the extent that we work out the adjustment of the nonborrowed reserve path  Henry, I think it's a little premature to move that quickly on the discount rate, given the question mark of April Right now we could lower the nonborrowed reserve path pretty strongly but at the same time keep an eye on the discount rate [The picture] may begin to sharpen and we could move then  That may be, when you add the foreign branches in The bond market and commercial paper market all together do not add up to a weak credit picture, though  Has any progress been made, Paul, on the regulatory proposal?  I've looked at the mutual savings banks in New York and for some of them the situation is going to be quite bad by the first quarter of next year A few of them, a handful, are going to have a very major problem  Some of them also are very unhappy about conditions that might be laid down such as salary [constraints]  When do you want us to consult, after publication of the bill? "
1904,1981-05-06,SOLOMON," What is the advantage of doing it that way?  Paul, you said in your language, if I remember correctly, that we expect interest rates to be roughly the same as in recent days Is that correct?  The recent weeks doesn't mean to me--  ""Recent days,"" right So, I guess nobody except us would know that that's 18 to 20 percent It depends upon how many days one looks at If we're talking about the last two or three days, then you're right But if we're talking about five or six days, then that would imply something lower than that  Paul, what if we insert into your language something that says we recognize that rates are likely to remain at the levels they have been in recent days and that makes inoperative the upper end of the range until the next meeting  Right But then what are you going to do at the next FOMC meeting? Are you assuming that we're going to come up with a range at the next meeting?  Well, if we're going down this road, it seems to me that an argument can also be made not to come up with a range at the next meeting  Paul, I don't have any trouble with the substance, but I find the wording a little elliptical to my literal mind If, in effect, we are making inoperative the upper end of the range between now and the next FOMC meeting, I'm not sure that this language carries the implication that at other times we would want it to be operative If you're that insistent about not wanting to project that emphasis on the fed funds rate, it does prejudice--and maybe rightfully so--the whole question of whether we have a fed funds range in the future or not, because I don't understand why you would have that concern now and you wouldn't have that concern twelve days from now  Yes, I think that language is an improvement It's a little less enigmatic  Okay  Well, in effect, what we've done--no matter what the language is--is that we've suspended the upper end of the range Does that require a vote or not?  I thought Murray Altmann said last time that what we did required that we be recorded  February 24th  SPEAKER(?) The last time we [went beyond] one end of the [funds rate] range "
1927,1981-05-18,SOLOMON," Last month the bond market had over $5 billion of [new] corporate issues At the time not only were bond rates high but it was a very disturbed market Except for a couple of trouble spots, there just seems to be enormous pressure for everybody to go ahead and engage in high levels of economic activity and just content themselves with Henry Wallich's point that after taxes interest rates are not that high That seems to be everything I hear up here in the financial markets    5/18/81  We haven't heard from any governors, I don't think Emmett  Governor Gramley  Henry  Chuck  But isn't it likely from what everybody is saying around the table that we're going to see monetary policy not being very effective as a general restrainer until some of the troubled areas have some dramatic failures? And then we would get a reaction in the rest of the economy  It's for 2 to 3 years  But they don't give 10 or 11 percent on a fixed rate mortgage for 25 years  The story that I've been hearing from people in the Midwest whom I know in the real estate insurance business is that they have this ""teaser"" rate I don't know what they call it You come in and get 10 or 11 percent financing for the first 2 to 3 years, during which time the builder compensates the thrift institution But thereafter the loan has to be renegotiated  John Balles  Either that way, Larry, or with an old fashioned crunch My guess is that it's more likely to be an old fashioned crunch If there aren't any additional comments, we'll move  -11-    5/18/81  on to Scott Pardee's and Peter Sternlight's reports Does someone want to make a further comment?  What I hear, and what my people's analysis suggests is likely, is that between two and four of them, of which a couple are very important, are calculating that they will have a crisis early next year They are also calculating the number of months they can take this; and, of course, if interest rates were to go significantly higher, that [crisis] might be moved up a couple of months  But I'm talking about two to four coming in early '82  But there are a few others that would--  Some of the big investment banks who are financing some of the mutual savings banks with RP financing are forcing, quietly, a reduction in volume First they tried to do it by simply raising the price on charges They weren't getting enough response; the mutual savings banks were paying these higher and higher spreads Now they have begun to exercise some ""window guidance,"" you might call it, cutting back on the line But they are trying to do it slowly so as not to trigger [a crisis]--so they wouldn't get the blame for any kind of financial problem  Maybe we'd better get moving along There is one point I should mention I'm told that if anybody has any questions regarding the Board's examination of the System Open Market Account, Clyde Farnsworth and Dave Robinson are prepared to answer questions Otherwise, we won't bother with that and we'll just accept the report Does anybody have any questions on that? If not, we'll go to Scott  Any comments?  The comment is simply that Congress has been fairly consistent in its attitude and that there is statutory language which says that the principal responsibility for international monetary policy is with the President, operating through the Secretary of the Treasury There are no legal constraints on our operating with our resources but it would create a political problem, I think, if we were clearly doing it against the wishes of the Treasury  There are no legal constraints  Those are the instructions Volcker, Sprinkel and I had a conversation Scott was there, and [the Treasury] made it very clear that they want prior consultation before a dollar is spent They wouldn't give us any flexibility even on, I must say, relatively minor routine countering of a disorderly market Even though Sprinkel put in his testimony ""countering disorderly markets,"" which is our responsibility under the amended articles of the IMF as well as internal policy, in practice I don't think the policy has changed any from one of no intervention except in an emergency We'll just have to wait Henry was at that meeting also and he said ""We'll see [We'll wait] until such time as a foreign central bank requests the kind of cooperation that requires using our own resources to some degree or until the dollar itself turns around so there's a change of view"" It's hard to resolve this as an abstract policy issue I don't think there will be any change until a concrete incident or situation comes along that seems to indicate the other way  My own view is that they won't insist on that  -14-    5/18/81  I don't think they will try My own feeling is, even though  that this is being looked at--and it has an impact on the exchange markets--that they are unlikely to go to that extreme The only way to get rid of the balances without upsetting markets would be to do an off-market deal with a few central banks This would still alarm them and I think there would be political reactions The State Department does not think along these lines at all I think the State Department would go to the mat with the Treasury as it became more of a political issue I don't think the Treasury is likely to go as far as actually insisting on this  Yes Myer Rashish  Yes he was  Tom Andrews hasn't been confirmed, but Myer was confirmed and so was Bob Hormats That was my understanding It was approved by the Committee Jesse Helms did not say anything, but continued to object I assumed, since it was approved by the Committee about three weeks ago, that there was floor acceptance It is normally routine that within 24 hours the whole Senate--  After all, that's what the balances are there for--to cushion if we ever [wanted to] I'm sure that the Committee and the Treasury would not want to support the dollar at these levels; if the dollar started coming down, we probably would want to do something, but not in any significant amounts And that's quite a ways off yet  Roger  Well, it's our normal routine to touch base with the Treasury before a swap line is drawn on by a foreign central bank On the other hand, the Chairman feels, and I think he is absolutely right, that we don't want to put ourselves in the position of not having any judgment in these matters and creating more of a situation where the Treasury is giving us day-to-day instructions So, Volcker is planning to tell [unintelligible] that these swap lines are available I don't think that we will run into any resistance from the Administration as a whole Whether there will be some initial demurring by the Treasury I don't know, but I'm sure he also will advise the Secretary of the Treasury I don't know whether Ted wants to comment in this area  Where there's no large political or policy [reason] that would cause us to oppose a foreign central bank drawing on a swap line with us, I think we ought to play it in the traditional way that we've always played it And that is that yes, it's available if the need is there; if a country explains at the time that it comes in formally [with a request to draw on the swap] and gives us good convincing reasons, obviously we will go along That brings up the Swedish situation Did you comment on that?  What does that mean?  The Mitterand group is unlikely to permit a devaluation before the elections, which will probably be around the end of next month There's an increasing feeling, of course, among knowledgeable people--and even those who are not too knowledgeable--that this level of the franc is not sustainable and that if [a devaluation] doesn't come before the election, it will come after And there are implications that this will put a finish to the European monetary system or that even if it's preserved in its facade, it won't have very much meaning If there are no other comments, you may turn now to your recommendations  And they were not unhappy about it They recognized that in some circles that might be interpreted as a sign of strength When I told them it was unlikely we would [extend it], they didn't seem to mind at all Bill  For the currencies that we think we are going to use when we're in trouble we took action to raise the swap lines as part of the November 1, 1978 dollar support package In the others I guess we've been more or less passive  It went to $30 billion on November 1, [1978] I gather we have to take action to ratify the transactions since the meeting on March 31  Legally we don't need a resolution, I assume, on any transactions we do for foreign central banks Therefore, this particular action is going to be inoperative If there's nothing else, we'll turn to Peter  Comments?  Whenever we come [to the end of our comments] in this area, there's coffee available These transactions have to be ratified  It's almost standard practice for all the dealers now, unlike a year ago when only half of them did it, to hedge in the futures market  Now, they [can] hedge purposely  But they can hedge pretty well under government securities  There are a lot of dentists in the area  Well, unless the President told you this morning that he's willing to change his fiscal policy and have a balanced budget in fiscal 1982 by forgetting about tax cuts and cutting back on defense increases--  Unless you could tell us that, I feel that we have to go even further this way I feel we should take alternative C, but not the initial borrowing assumption of $3 billion I'd start off with a $2-1/4 to $2-1/2 billion borrowing assumption I think that we have to have a fed funds range going up to 22 percent And even that will be skewed; in other words, we are likely to be near the ceiling fairly quickly unless we are very lucky and we see much lower growth in May I recognize, if we do get something on the order of 5-1/2 or 6 percent [M-1B] growth in May, what this would require in June and that, therefore, pressure is likely to continue mounting over that period until the end of June It seems to me that we are better off to be very firm and vigorous in our responses early in the game I'm influenced not only by the strength of the economy--and there is a widespread feeling around the country, and certainly in the market, that with the exception of the troubled sectors the economy is very strong--but I'm also influenced by the fact that if the President's program goes through, even with a compromise on the tax cut package, the fourth quarter is likely to be much stronger, and the third quarter probably somewhat stronger, than the present quarter And in those circumstances we might have major problems [achieving] our fourth-quarter targets I feel we are better off trying to nip this now than trying to be more gentle in our approach; the latter approach is going to store up a lot of problems toward the end of the year That's all I'll say right now  In the financial markets, privately people will say that they don't see the difference between a Keynesian tax cut and a supply sider tax cut; it's going to be the same We are calculating internally within the New York Fed that the budget deficit this year will be above $65 billion and that for fiscal '82, if the President's program is enacted, it will not be $45 billion or less but it will be $75 billion I would say the majority of the big firms in the financial markets also are forecasting budgetary deficits very  -25-    5/18/81  much higher than the Administration or even than the CBO estimates So, that's a factor I think there would be a remarkable turnaround in psychology and attitudes if we had a more traditional conservative approach to the deficit question by the Administration  And would you take the associated borrowing assumption of ""B"" of $2-1/2 billion?  But the average of the last three weeks was about $2 billion  The way I read it, though, is that we would also be resistant to [M-1B growth] below 1-1/4 percent or whatever the number is, as long as it was consistent [with the target for the quarter]  If we discuss the central issue first, maybe this clause will fall into line more easily If we say 3 percent, we are going squarely for alternative B It's only if luck comes along that we are going to accept lower [growth] The consensus of the Committee was clearly for between ""B"" and ""C"" Some people had ""C,"" some people had ""B,"" and no more than one or two were between ""A"" and ""B"" I think 3 percent doesn't reflect the Committee consensus  It means, though, that the setting of our reserve path would be based on 3 percent, wouldn't it?  Well, initially  I would hope that we are trying to say that we'd [strongly] resist growth above, say, 2 percent or something like that, if we want to start somewhere between ""B"" and ""C""  I think there's a value in showing that we are determined and are trying to be very closely consistent with our previous short-run target It just adds to our credibility And, as various speakers have said, I would rather see the rate pressure now than later in the year It's obviously not a matter of life and death when we are talking about [a difference of] something like 1 percent, since we don't control it that closely In terms of what our target is, it seems to me better to be in a fairly tight position even if we are a little more relaxed on the initial [unintelligible] assumption  Or we can say ""2 percent or somewhat lower""  Speaking for myself, I feel that there is some value in referring back; I don't think it's enormous Either formulation, as spelled out here or with a separate sentence talking about accepting a shortfall in the more straightforward way is okay I think pretty much everybody would want to have X percent or lower at a minimum, and I think there's some slight advantage in referring back to that target for the period  It's swinging up and down  We're down to voting members?  Well, I think that's a mistake anyway If we are all saying that the purpose of the funds range is to trigger a consultation, then we should not imply so clearly that the Chairman can veto a consultation and in effect abolish the FOMC and run a one-man FOMC  But if you say ""persistently"" then don't you have to say that the Chairman will call for a consultation?  Oh yes, I know that I'm not talking about substance; I'm talking about images  I think Roger has a point that there is a danger We will, of course, publish the policy record from the earlier meeting and it has this language, which I think exactly summarizes our feeling about it Then if we come out with another directive, there is a danger that some of the Fed watchers may believe that we mean to change the significance of this paragraph on page 9 [in the March] policy record  Right And since the policy record paragraph on page 9 expresses exactly what we're trying to do, then it seems to me, even though I guess this may be too unorthodox, that we could simply refer here to that policy record paragraph  But couldn't we simply say, taking Lyle's language, for example, ""as called for in the policy record of such and such a date"" so it makes quite clear that this is simply a summary version of the larger explanation in the policy record?  No, I had meant--  I raised the question of whether it would be appropriate to have a reference in this one-sentence summary to this larger explanation in the policy record as consistent--  Well, Roger has my vote  No  You still don't have a consensus on 3 percent "
1968,1981-07-06,SOLOMON," Second heartily  But how many withdrew money on 24- hours notice, Steve, without writing a check?  You can set up your account right away  He started doing his operations at 19-3/4 percent; it bounced up a bit  Current account Under those circumstances, the dollar is going to start crashing and it has a long way to go And there is going to be very little [foreign central bank] cooperation I [heard] that at  The feeling is that one of the reasons don't ask for cooperation is first, that they don't want the United States to hold a lot of secondly that, when the dollar starts to fall, they don't want to have created a precedent whereby they would have to give us cooperation The whole tenor or the atmosphere [is that] the kind of cooperation we've had in the last few years with central banks has been seriously demoralizing This is what telling me also when I was in Europe I'm not saying that we are going to be able to do very much about it, given the Treasury's view, but I think it's not a happy situation at all  If we had had consistent and cooperative intervention both by the Bundesbank and ourselves, yes, they would be significantly lower because the foreign exchange market would be influenced by that to some degree And so maybe would corporations I'm not saying our intervention as such makes that difference If the psychology is not handled in such a way that the psychology of the traders is influenced by our cooperative intervention, then it's self-defeating But we had a problem also with the Bundesbank, which followed extremely erratic intervention policies They've gone as high as $700 odd million in one day and then the next day [have done nothing] For example, today the Deutschemark fell very rapidly and sharply and they didn't spend a dime On other days they will spend a lot of money I don't think that kind of intervention, even when large, is of any use at all It doesn't change the psychology of the traders [and reinforce the view] that it's a two-way street  There is a tendency always for the Europeans, and to some extent the whole world, to be super critical of us since we are the biggest economic force There's no question about that But I think the situation was very different in the fall of 1979 What they were looking for then was some meaningful monetary policy [action] that would promise to check our rate of inflation, which was running very high and was having an indirect spillover effect on the dollar There were no complaints in terms of the level of cooperation between central banks on intervention  Yes  Chemicals have been very prominent, but we're getting reports of some others, such as textiles  We won't be masters of our own domestic monetary policy if at that point it makes sense domestically to ease and we're running a $50 billion current account deficit and the dollar is reacting the way I would expect it to be reacting Even [though] last month's German current account and trade figures were disappointing, the Germans are fairly confident that they will come in substantially lower in '81 and with a surplus in '82 At some point the markets will turn around, and I think the extremes of this roller coaster are unnecessary We could be in a situation where we're going to need that kind of cooperation  Oh, I think they're more concerned about the immediate impact on their currencies There's a secondary level of concern among some of them, not among others, about the fact that in the longer run cooperation is going to be eroded Some of them, on the other hand, may be perfectly happy to see a major reversal of this, in which they would not come in and support the dollar as strongly [unintelligible] They feel that the present policy has freed them from that obligation Obviously, they're still going to support the dollar at some level because it can be very damaging to them for us to get too competitive on exports But this policy carries things to such an extreme, given the lag in the J curve effect that--  It's just begging for more and more amplitude in the swings Add that to the volatility of our domestic interest rates and it begins to have a damaging effect on the volume of world trade and the volume of economic activity Anyway, that's my view I don't know what to recommend, but we are confronted--  No, the German government would like to see cooperative intervention between the Bundesbank and the Federal Reserve The Bundesbank, or at least the head of the Bundesbank, is reluctant for the two reasons I mentioned One, he doesn't want to see the United States holding too many deutschemarks simply because it gives us more independence and we're less controllable; and secondly, when the dollar has turned around, he doesn't want us to be able with more moral clout to ask for intervention because of the fact that he had asked us to intervene earlier I would say that there's a clear split in many ways right now between the Bundesbank and the German government The German government's view is that one has to ignore short-term interests in the interest of stronger international cooperation There's quite a difference of view, which they're prepared to talk about, between them and the Bundesbank right now  Not in any formal sense But I think you're right if you're implying--assuming that our policy of benign neglect continues--that if there's a reversal and the dollar comes under heavy pressure and they are reluctant to support it with their own resources and we start supporting it by wanting to activate the swap line, it is possible there will be somewhat less enthusiasm and maybe more foot dragging on our activating the swap line  At a later time  I would guess--and Ted, I'd be interested in your guess--that a 9 percent decline in the trade weighted value of the dollar probably is going to be something like a 30 percent decline against the deutschemark  Now, a 30 percent decline is not collapsing in the sense of the whole financial system collapsing or anything like that, but I'm simply saying--  It's not only the Treasury; it's also the present management of the Bundesbank The two together I think probably make it less [likely] even if all of you feel very strongly on this side--if you all feel strongly as I do I don't see it, given the joint position [of the Treasury and the Bundesbank] Now, in a few months it may be beneficial--  Leutwiler, the head of the Swiss National Bank, said to me a couple of weeks ago that he feels that the more permanent disadvantage of the policy, as distinct from the Bundesbank position, is that the foreign exchange market will not be as easily convinced in the future that there is cooperation among central banks He feels that when the time comes when there is cooperation again, it's going to take a lot more money and a much longer period of time for that stand to have credibility and to have an impact on the exchange markets It is true that in the last year or two, when the exchange market would see the Bundesbank and the Federal Reserve acting in very close harmony, they would pay a heck of a lot of attention  Sure Current account deficits have to be financed But you would agree I'm sure, Henry, that there are short-term capital flows that, based on expectations and movements in exchange markets, can go way beyond [unintelligible] in the opposite direction, depending on the particular psychology  Nobody would expect them to support the dollar even under the tightest of cooperation at anywhere near these levels I don't mean to carry this too far Even though I may be among the most concerned here, Paul, I'm not recommending that you do anything about it and take on a confrontation in this area at the same time that we have other problems in domestic monetary policy It doesn't seem to make a lot of good sense at this point  Do you mean now that we're following a more and more [unintelligible] on the domestic scene we can get more [unintelligible]?  But not in deutschemarks  I don't think it's likely that we're going to have that kind of gradual change I think it's more likely that after a protracted period of these high real interest rate levels we will see a significant recession both here and abroad I don't know whether that will be in 6 months, 9 months, or a year, but at some point I think we will see a significant recession; inflationary expectations will get lowered and interest rates, both nominal and real, will come down But I don't know if we have any alternative to the policy that we're following I don't see any gradual way for this scenario to be different than that  Once Reg Q is gone completely and all deposits bear some kind of competitive market rates, it's mind- boggling to think of [where] to cut off the so-called money supply in terms of a coherent [measure of] transactions--  You've [talked to] lots of taxicab drivers!  Market people that I talk with feel that inflationary expectations are not down That's a view among their clients as well as their own view And, of course, that is corroborated by the long rates we see So, I come back to a very pessimistic view It seems to me that there's a good deal of likelihood that [the economy] will stay stagnant If the economy picks up in the fourth quarter the way some people feel it will, it will put a lot of pressure on interest rates And we will have had by then, unless we [see rates decline] in the coming weeks of this quarter, a protracted period of very high real interest rates It seems to me that some companies are getting to the limit of their abilities [to cope with these high interest rates] and there will be some failures I think this will change inflationary expectations and in the process there will probably be a certain amount of recession, too But that's a [scenario] that doesn't give us a gradual transition to a much better world  Mr Chairman, isn't it worth pointing out that the staff originally recommended a much higher M2 as being consistent with--  I disagree, Henry I think one has to discuss what one is recommending for '82 in discussing whether to revise the remainder of '81 or not If you want to revise the remainder of '81, you then are going to be much less willing to announce a further reduction [for '82], presumably, at this time  There's a further complication At least we in New York, Steve, are a little surprised by the interest rate levels projected to be consistent with each of these alternatives To me these interest rates are very much on the high side Certainly the market would think they are on the high side And since they're derived on fairly unreliable historical relationships based on the model, it may be that the market is less wrong and more right We ought to take with a grain of salt the interest rate projections; I'd think of them as being more the outside limit on the upper side rather than as the most likely result  What would you do for '82?  I'm embarrassed to say that I have changed my position every day in the last four days, as I looked at each of these permutations and combinations I was in favor of almost every single one that has been mentioned at one point or another And I must say I've come full circle I won't bother you with why I came full circle The disadvantages of each of these approaches are pretty obvious, but let me explain why I now would recommend that we stay [with the targets we have] for the remainder of the year The problem, I think we all agree, is primarily presentational Fred, even though I agree with much of what you said, I would disagree with you on the reaction of the market and the public If we leave the target unchanged for this year and say that we expect to come in at the lower end--I'm talking about M-1B obviously--I think that is better than lowering it a half point If we lower it a half point, the market will believe we're going to make an enormous effort to come in at that lower target because, otherwise, why make the adjustment? If we leave the target range alone and say we expect to come in at the lower end or possibly even undershoot given unusual situations-- velocity or what have you--I think the market would expect less of an expansionary policy from us in the remaining few months They would expect less of a repeat of last year There are so many disadvantages of adjusting any of this or fine-tuning that I'm not sure what we gain that is significant, and we constrain our hand for '82  -48-    7/6-7/81  We have a wide range of possibilities [for next year] because of this velocity question It seems to me, however--and here I would disagree with Nancy--that for '82 we still need to show continuity of policy and continued severe monetary restraint What I would do is give a preliminary view--emphasizing that it's very much subject to review if there are unexpected changes in velocity and as we assess the state of the economy--that we would cut the range for M-1B for '82 by 1/2 point and leave the M2 and M3 ranges alone, recognizing that we have not cut them for 2 or 3 years It seems to me that there are overwhelming technical arguments for that and I think they're fully explanatory Everybody knows about the surge in moneymarket funds, and in general I think we have convinced everybody that we have a very restrictive policy I don't think we have to worry about the fact that we haven't cut the M2 range in a couple of years There are good reasons, which everybody will accept So, that would be my recommendation  I would not lower it, right  Part of this whole credibility issue is a perception of a kind of simple-minded, if you want to call it that, approach If we ignored the recommendations of the staff last year to raise the M2 range for '81, at this point I don't see the argument for going ahead and raising it [now] I don't believe the innovations in financial instruments that we should expect next year are going to be such that we should have the kind of growth in money market funds that will put more pressure [on M2] I would not raise the range  Oh, I think it's reasonably tough In some ways, as I explained earlier, I think the markets are still focusing more on M-1B And as I said, perversely I'm afraid, if we lower the range a half point, the markets will expect us to make an even greater effort to hit it than if we leave it alone and say we expect growth to come in at the lower end  I'm not talking about the substantive decision on how we actually handle ourselves for the rest of the year, because we don't have full control of where we're going to come in I'm talking about my impression of the public reaction or the market reaction, which is that if we say that we're going to lower it a half point, rather than say that we're leaving it alone but we expect to come in at the low end, then the markets will expect a more determined expansionary effort on our part because we are fine-tuning the range  Than if we leave it alone and say we expect to come in at the lower end or even possibly undershoot  Let me say this, on the substance of it I feel that we should be careful not to [let growth] exceed the lower end and we should accept a little undershooting I don't think we'll get that much criticism because I don't see that it's going to be timed with a recession Obviously, if we were undershooting and we had a recession simultaneously, we would get an enormous amount of criticism  Well, we have every kind of therapist here  So you're recommending a full point reduction in the M-1B rate for 1982?  I'd like to make a parenthetical comment that may be of some use I encountered enormous resentment in Europe among government officials and central bank officials about our continuing to publish the weekly money supply statistics Maybe their reaction is much too excessive, but they believe that we unnecessarily encourage extra volatility above and beyond what our October '79 approach involved by our continuation of the weekly publications I just pass that along for what it's worth  I find that quite a few leading bankers in New York feel exactly the opposite  I don't think we can afford to do a repeat of last year and that seems to be a pretty widespread feeling in the Committee It seems to me, therefore, that we have to be fairly close to alternative C for the remainder of this year I would go for something between 6-1/2 and 7 percent [for M-1B] We could phrase it as ""6-1/2 percent or slightly more"" in the directive That would be consistent with a borrowing assumption of $1-1/2 billion in our view and would probably give us a fed funds range of 15 to 20 percent The midpoint of that is where we would likely come out, which would be a fed funds rate in the 17 to 18 percent area That would be my view, Mr Chairman  If there were a credible way of de- emphasizing the fourth quarter-to-fourth quarter growth to formulate the target--I don't know how--the right formulation would be year over year in some broad sense  The scary thing is the psychological pressure on us [depending on] where we end [in any] fourth quarter If we're seriously overshooting or undershooting, we're going to make three times the effort--or at least we're going to be under that kind of pressure psychologically--to make a much bigger response than is good for the economy, simply because it happens arbitrarily to be the fourth quarter and people will be judging us on the fourth quarter  It's becoming a seasonal pattern  We would argue somewhat differently We believe that borrowing of $1-1/2 billion implies a fed funds rate of 17 to 18 percent We'd be about a point--  I thought he said 19 to 20 percent  Are you still using a rough rule of thumb, Steve, that a $100 million difference in borrowing represents 1/2 of a point?  We believe that there have been some hang-ups in the fed funds market recently and that if we stay at this borrowing level we will see the fed funds rate get lower over a period of time--I don't know how long--at the same borrowing level  We could put a footnote in that we're not seriously thinking of getting to the top  That caveat on M2 may be very easily triggered  I don't object to it, but I don't want to underestimate the importance of that--  Even though M2 grew only 5 percent in each of the last two months, that's because M-1B was negative Therefore, if we get M-1B--  So, if the caveat is triggered--and it is very likely--we may end up seriously falling short of the 7 percent objective  What we need is an M-2A and M-2B--a transactions component, shift adjusted--  You mean 9 percent for the next intermeeting period  At that point, I think we'd want a consultation, if we really had a head-on collision between too weak an M-1B and too strong an M2, because of the caveat you're building in  Mr Chairman, would you want to consider that we would have an understanding on this M2 caveat but not include it in the published directive?  Would that create a precedent, Lyle, for later quarters when we don't want to put in a quarterly figure?  Right Given what we've been saying, I don't see how we're only going to get one point more growth in M2 than in M-1B  I prefer your caveat to spelling out 8 percent  I think you're right We have to keep--  He's just talking about calling it M1 rather than doing a shift-adjusted--  But on the nonbinding end of it  SPEAKER(?) On the floor, not the ceiling  You'd start it for next year, wouldn't you?  That's horrendous One would have to assume an increase in velocity of circulation of something on the order of twice--or 1-1/2 to 2-1/2 times--the normal secular increase in velocity of circulation That is too heroic an assumption to make, Larry The fact that we've come in comfortably so far is strictly due to this rather fluky situation If the staff is right and we don't see that, and we just have the normal situation continue for the rest of the year, if I'm understanding this right, we would still come in at about what--5 + 3, Steve? Is 5 the increase for the first half?  For the velocity of circulation  The growth plus the normal  -87-    7/6-7/81  Right The chances of repeating that situation don't look very good If I were a betting man, I would bet the chances are maybe 1 out of 5 that we're going to get that kind of growth in velocity next year  I think that much of a rise seems unlikely to be repeated next year because we won't have, I assume, as big a growth in money market funds starting from the present base as we had this year  Obviously there's no perfect solution, but I would argue that the right balance to strike is one that retains our credibility in terms of continuing to squeeze inflation Certainly there's a widespread perception in the country that the Federal Reserve is very strictly committed and dedicated to monetary restraint I think we can achieve that with only a 1/2 point reduction; I don't think we need a full point reduction There is a continuity in policy with a 1/2 point reduction and it lessens somewhat the problem that Nancy is talking about If we end up at the low end of the target this year, or even with some undershooting, we have to start from that point; we can't go back to where we were supposed to be Then it's quite a tight target So, my sense of balance between the expectations of the country for us to continue this policy in a persistent way and the danger that it's going to be too tight is to strike a balance with a 1/2 point reduction Now, I don't particularly care if we lower the floor a full point because I don't think that's the meaningful constraint I have a slight  -89-    7/6-7/81  preference for a 1/2 point reduction on both the floor and the ceiling But if you want to lower the floor a point, and you don't think we're going to get criticism because we're widening the range, [I could accept that] You were telling me that Senator Proxmire was pushing you to narrow the range  I don't think we should lower the ceiling a whole point That really is risking a major problem in the economy in terms of our not making--  If it doesn't cause any more problems to lower M3 a half point--  What about not doing it now but waiting to see the situation?  We earn our salaries!  Have you ever dissented before? Now is your time  And the press headline will be ""Volcker uncertain"" "
1984,1981-07-17,SOLOMON," Murray, this is Tony Solomon in New York When Paul gets there, I'd like to make a comment to give the FOMC members a bit of news But I want to wait until he gets on  He's there?  I just want to advise the members of the FOMC and others, Mr Chairman, as I've already advised you personally, that as of this morning Scott Pardee has resigned He is taking a position as Executive Vice President with the Discount Corporation And until his retirement day is effective, he'll basically be on vacation and straightening up his records Of course, Gretchen will continue to run the Desk until a final resolution is made as to who will be in charge  Do you think that will put the funds rate up around 19 percent?  Mr Chairman, this is Tony Solomon I tend to feel that Lyle and Chuck are probably right--that it's worth waiting a few more days--because even with the 10 percent growth that the Board staff is now estimating for shift adjusted M-1B for July, we're still running substantially below the lower end of the range And we will get anyway an automatic increase--  Not on the shift adjusted number  I have figures in front of me up here and they indicate that we're still significantly below  Paul, I was going to say that even without reducing the nonborrowed reserve path, we are going to get the effects of the automatic adjustments, which bring the borrowing up to $165 billion There will be some upward pressure on the fed funds rate anyway, as well as the psychological reaction to the figures And it seems to me that July is still so unclear that it might be worth waiting a few more days  I think Henry has a good point If we wait and see how much the funds rate goes up--it would be by tomorrow and Monday--then we would have a better feel for the situation "
2008,1981-08-18,SOLOMON," I think the fact that the Germans are claiming it was successful implies that they would like to use it as a precedent from time to time when it's necessary to have what they call a common dollar policy, particularly since we don't seem to intervene in what they consider a disorderly market  Normally we would have thought that  In fact, normally we would consider a 2 percent drop in half an hour disorderly [unless] there's a special reason  Most of the time  They did check the dollar from moving  -2-    8/18/81  No, it didn't move up after that At that point it was close to 257 and it has been down mostly around the 250 to 252 range And there were a couple drops down to around 247  Since they asked for the concerted intervention, they have to consider it a successful move in a certain sense It was sufficiently successful, I suppose it could be argued, that one can get away with calling it that  Actually, it was 170  We calculate that just the movement in July alone probably worsened our current account deficit next year by a further $8 billion Everybody is looking at this The Treasury and the New York Fed and the Board's staff are looking at a projection in the mid $30 billion area for the current account deficit for next year That's very, very substantial The largest one we've had was, I think, $18 billion; when I was over at the Treasury it was between $15 and $18 billion And even though markets now are not paying a whole lot of attention to current account surpluses and deficits, when the fashion and the mood change and they go against the dollar, we're going to see a lot of stories about this enormous deficit and our export orders just going [up]    8/18/81  Well, it would have been better It can keep American industry more consistently export oriented if we don't have such enormous swings, but that requires leaning against the wind And if we're not going to lean against the wind and we have [the dollar at] these high levels, when a decline comes, it may be better from a purely export competitive point of view if it comes in a month rather than over six months On the other hand, [a sharp move] is very demoralizing to financial flows and financial markets and politically as well, because it doesn't look as if there's much cooperation left in the system I think there are tradeoffs on that, Chuck There are a lot of people who will feel that a rapidly plunging dollar shows mismanagement by the Administration, and to some degree by the Federal Reserve, and is an indication that things are not right in the United States There is that view  I don't remember the details Isn't there a distinction between the rigidity of the overall ceiling and    8/18/81  the informal ones? The informal limits are somewhat less legally [binding]  There is a significant point or observation--at least it seems to me significant--that even though it    8/18/81  was grudging, the fed funds rate did come down somewhat while at the same time the whole spectrum of [other] short-term interest rates went in the opposite direction We don't seem to have as much direct influence over short-term rates as we did before There was a movement of the fed funds rate It's not clear what is causing this situation except I suppose some of the factors that Peter mentioned Not all of them apply at this particular point But I guess the heavy volume of Treasury borrowing is probably the biggest single factor  But aren't the other short-term rates still on the high side?  I think we are  Borrow from whom?  Even though it's very crude, suppose, based on a sample survey, we were to make an estimate periodically of the percentage of money market funds that really represents transactions balances And we'd do it for all these other new instruments Even though it obviously would be only a rough estimate, adding that by either folding it into M-1B or putting it out as a separate line--  Are you saying we should target total reserves?  So would our hotel owners in New York City Tourism has dropped by about 25 percent; hotel occupancy is way down  If we hit the 14 percent increase for M2 for August that the Board and New York staff are projecting, that takes growth up for the year to 9-1/2 percent? Or is it higher?  Well, whenever there is some strong growth, I'm told it means that weaker growth will always be projected in the subsequent period as a smoothing of the path I don't think it means anything at all, but--  Anyway, what you are saying I gather is this That if we got this kind of growth in August and we are running, say, 9-1/2 or 9-3/4 percent on M2, you wouldn't see any need to call for a consultation and a change in the signals But if M2 started exceeding what--10 percent--you would? What is your thinking here?  I'm talking about the long-term target, fourth quarter '81 over fourth quarter '80  Well, that's what I was trying to get from Paul At what point does he feel that the caveat bites? Is it at 9-1/2, 9-3/4, or 10 percent? It may not be triggered at all He may not have to face up to it  It says ""provided that growth in M2 remains around the upper limit"" We should have said, I think, ""remains substantially around the upper limit,"" but I don't think we can change it now  I would hope you wouldn't tell them that we increased nonborrowed reserves at the annual rate of 23 percent!  The sustainable monetary policy should have only half the country against you instead of everybody  I don't think this makes a lot of difference, frankly, on what we talked about--the most you could assume is that those of us who are more sensitive to interest rates might like to see them a point or a point and a half lower--because one can't have an impression that the Federal Reserve is sharply easing monetary policy I don't think the real crunch is coming now The real crunch is going to be next year when, basically, I think we are going to be blown out of the water Unless we can show an inflation rate decline to 5 percent, when the Administration is disappointed in all of its projections and we have a stagnant economy and the supply-siders are beginning to turn against us and everybody else is turning against us, it's quite clear that people will not understand why we are still continuing with such a high level of interest rates And it's going to be very hard to explain unless we can show an inflation rate of 5 to 6 percent and say ""Yes, we have a stagnant economy but look at what we achieved, and we achieved it in the face of huge budgetary deficits"" Aside from that kind of defense, I don't think we will be able to sustain this kind of monetary policy next year I don't think we are at the crunch yet, and I think it's a very minor decision whether we do-- If we really want to get interest rates down a point to a point and a half, we have to put in an initial borrowing assumption of about $12 billion or maybe even a fraction lower If we put it at $14 billion, then I  -36-    8/18/81  think we will have to add--and we probably wouldn't want to add--a 1 percent cut in the discount surcharge in order to get it down there But then we would be giving a policy signal We wouldn't appear to be following the market So, I don't have any problem in a certain sense with Paul's taking such a hard line as he is, but I just don't think this [policy stance] is going to be sustainable well into next year if we continue running such a stable, stagnant economy with certain sectors getting into a crisis situation  I think the difference is this This is the same point that Lyle has made, that Emmett has made, and that Chuck has made, I think We assumed last month when we set these targets that short-term interest rates would ease--very, very slightly, but somewhat Instead, short-term interest rates are higher even though the fed funds rate has erratically come down But even that is not down now; it has been running over 20 percent in the last couple of days, although the average is about 18-1/4 percent So, basically, we miscalculated the interest rate effect of the targets we set last time Now, I don't think we can set a target [that differs from] 7 percent, but we could--if we wanted to see some slight easing of interest rates--set an initial borrowing of about $12 billion  I keep one eye on it  That's 1-1/2 basis points!  But can we talk about the initial borrowing assumption?  -39-    8/18/81  What do you mean by ""everybody""?  I'd like to clarify something with Steve My understanding of the wording of the M2 constraint in alternative II is that it's completely different than the meaning of the M2 constraint in alternative I As I read alternative II, it says  -43-    8/18/81  ""Provided that growth of M2 remains around the upper limit of, or moves within, its range for the year, growth of M-1B at an annual rate somewhat higher than the _ percent specified above would be acceptable"" In other words, it permits an easier monetary policy on M-1B It does not say, though, the way alternative I does, which tracks what we did last month, that it's a cap Is that deliberate?  Right  I understand that  I respectfully disagree I can't think of anything worse than starting to use numbers on public television aside from the year-over-year number If we start talking about intermeeting numbers of 7-1/2 or 8-1/2 percent, or whatever it is, I just don't think people would understand that I think it's much more convincing if we talk in somewhat more general nonquantitative terms  But you're assuming that we're going to get it Suppose Paul says it's 7 percent or 8-1/2 percent and then we get something completely different, lower or higher?  I think that's all we can expect  SPEAKER(?) Yes  You mean in the policy record, not the directive  Yes, if we leave it out, a lot of the Fed watchers are going to think that that's a significant easing And I don't know--  Yes I'm almost surprised, Chuck, that you say that If we're talking about something like 93, 94 percent, isn't that around the upper limit?  -49-    8/18/81  [On] October 1st  Well, when we hit the two-year anniversary of October 6th or 8th or whenever--  Artificial factors affect M-1B too  If we come in at the end of the year within the target range on M-1B, we may not want to stress the artificial factors that much "
2037,1981-10-05,SOLOMON," We turned down    10/5-6/81  Well, let me make a point The argument that and, therefore, should have a swap line, has some weaknesses in it because becoming a member  Yes, they are  They're not Article VIII? I thought Article VIII meant simply that a currency is convertible  I see You mean there are certain types of formal exchange--  Oh, I see, even though in practice there are no exchange controls on at the moment Still, I don't think that ought to be the main reason for giving a swap line to Have they presented a reason other than prestige why they should have a swap line--a substantive reason?  So, if we went ahead with came in again, would this change your attitude about giving  one to    10/5-6/81  My [view] would be that unless there's a substantive reason, we open up more problems by agreeing to it I think we ought to be in a posture that unless it's one of the countries that we deal with [and is] important to the [effective functioning of the international] monetary system, the extension of a swap line ought to have a substantive reason behind it  That is possibly the correct--  I don't know how much this adds or how much light it throws on it I had a meeting with about a dozen business leaders in New York City and, even though they tend to be larger size businesses, many of them have companies or product lines that have been very adversely affected by current conditions The curious thing I noticed was that even the ones who said they were in great difficulty in regard to those particular product lines all said that there were other product lines that displayed some strength, as proof of the fact that they didn't feel they were near any cliff These are not huge companies; they are what I guess we call medium size companies; some have sales as small as $200 or $300 million But to a man all of them--even the ones who said that were [hurting]--said they hoped the Fed would continue its tight monetary policy They said they thought it would eventually work As I say, it probably doesn't throw any light on this, but it's the only contact [of this kind that] I've had  And now you can sell your tax credit  I tend to feel the way Fred feels At that same lunch of business leaders I raised this question What kind of wage increases do you expect to pay next year? And much to my surprise a lot of them who had factories that were in very depressed conditions said they had already quietly begun to renegotiate and were coming in with very low settlements For those who had factories that were doing much better, it was a different story But there was a rather selective approach; they were implying that if it was kept quiet, they were getting trade union cooperation in the area  -13-    10/5-6/81  You're right; nobody relates a wage increase to the fact that taxes are coming down  But the reaction in the Congress since they came back is exaggerated in terms of business opinion for the reasons that have been talked about The Congress is frustrated and is receiving an enormous amount of criticism, much of it having to do with the budget deficit And when members of Congress talk to you and other members of the Board here in Washington I think they are reflecting not a focused criticism of the Fed but a general criticism of conditions by their constituents I'm not saying that the Fed is exempt, not by any means, but I wouldn't interpret the Congressional complaints regarding how their constituents feel about the Fed and conditions as being focused on us That is the way it comes out of Congressional mouths I have talked to a few Congressmen up in the New York area and we got into this shading--  Steve, does it make sense to continue doing the adjustment for the shifts into NOW accounts?  What he said the second time he said the first time, too  Well, I'll just make a general comment  Yes, I understand The conventional Wall Street view that you can't get inflation down without a significant recession is still heard in the financial community, but they all admit that if it's a typical short, sharp recession--six to nine months of downswing--it probably won't do much for inflationary expectations People in the financial community and in the business community would expect that when the economy recovers the inflation level would then be back again at somewhere near the earlier level I feel very strongly--I think many of us do, and I think Lyle and Henry were both saying this although in slightly different sounding ways-- that we really need a sustained period of zero or very low real growth to change inflationary expectations And, politically, in terms of the tolerance for our monetary policy, it also is somewhat better than the roller coaster In addition, this time, given our present techniques, if we have a roller coaster in the real economy, we're likely to see the Henry Kaufman thesis prove true That if we have a sustained upswing next year, interest rates will go to levels even higher than they did in the earlier peak  From all that, I conclude that we should try to follow a policy that focuses on what interest rate levels [we need] over the next few months and what path we should take to give us an economy that is neither in significant recession--or not even in technical recession if possible--and yet avoids the kinds of conditions that will lay a basis for an explosion later on There is an enormous amount of pent-up demand I find [staggering] the amount of bond  -29-    10/5-6/81  issues that corporate executives passing through my office talk about being ready to start placing if interest rates come down just 2 or 3 points Now, obviously, some of that will recede when interest rates do come down, if they do, 2 or 3 points in the long end of the market; some of them will want to wait for another 1- or 2-point drop Even so, there will be an enormous volume of activity in the bond market and activity in the economy if we have too big a decline, if we repeat the 1980 pattern So, given the confusion in the aggregates--given the fact that we're undershooting one and overshooting the other and all these changes that have been talked about--it seems to me that we ought to be a little more sensitive to the implications of interest rate movements in terms of their impact on the real economy in order to achieve, hopefully, the zero or slightly positive real growth that we've been talking about  Well, following up on what I said earlier, and I think a lot of other people had the same kinds of objectives If one makes the assumption in this most uncertain of uncertain worlds that a gradual interest rate decline of a couple of points over the quarter provides the best chance of maintaining an economy that avoids recession and yet avoids an upsurge for the next quarter or so, then I would prefer the objectives of alternative B But I don't think we will achieve the objectives of alternative B if the economy is as weak as I think it is We have a curious situation If the economy is as weak as I think it is, we're not likely to get even the growth that is outlined in alternative C And, I don't want to see too big a drop in interest rates I don't know quite how to reconcile this It seems to me that we have to start off with something that is not a precipitous change in borrowing So, we have to start off with something like $800 million It's perfectly all right to have a target [for M-1B growth] between ""B"" and ""C"", say, 7  -38-    10/5-6/81  to 7-1/2 percent I don't think it's too meaningful It's more meaningful if we relax the constraint of M2 I wasn't quite sure how Lyle wanted to formulate the relaxation of the M2 constraint How did you want to formulate that?  Okay But I have a problem there because I think M2 is likely to be stronger than the 10 percent indicated here for alternative C I think it's still likely to be about 11 percent  Yes  Right  That's why I would recommend a fairly tough [floor]--in other words, a 13 to 18 percent range--in order to have a consultation Even 13 percent represents a drop of about 2-1/2 points and I think we ought to have a consultation at that point to avoid just following it blindly all through the quarter if it looks as if it's going to press way below 13 percent In summary, where I stand is a 7 to 7-1/2 percent target in M-1B, relaxing the M2 constraint language somewhat--although I'm not sure that we should put in a numerical target if there's another way of doing it--a 13 to 18 percent fed funds rate range, and an initial borrowing level of $800 million I don't think we're going to end up anywhere near these numbers if the economy is as weak as most of us, including the staff, think it is  Yes, that's right The reason I'm so confused is that we've pumped in nonborrowed reserves at the rate of 20 percent but we have had an increase of only 18 percent in M-1B And I'm thoroughly confused I know what I want in the way of objectives; I don't see how to have these paths lead us there  You don't have a very clean-cut alternative  Aren't they projecting $50 billion for the next quarter?  Yes  [We could] continue last quarter's intermeeting target of 7 percent I don't think it's very important, frankly, this time; it's not as important as the other decisions  I don't think it's a good idea to put the numerical target for M2 in the directive I think we ought to relax the constraint very slightly by saying ""at or slightly above,"" which gives us some leeway  Right, ""at or somewhat above the range"" So, I'd say we're talking about up to 10 percent I don't think we're going to hit the 6 percent [lower end of the range], so even though 10 percent is low if we were figuring on reaching 6 percent, I doubt we're going to hit the 6 percent with the economy as weak as it is  Why didn't it act as more of a constraint in August when M2 was growing at 121 percent? Why didn't it result in a change in the nonborrowed reserve path?  Based on the last quarter, you're saying that it was running at what, about 94 percent? Was that the highest it reached in August?  Steve, adjust it  SPEAKER(?) You want to publish an adjusted M2?  Is there another nonquantitative way, or non-numerical way, of formulating M2 other than with the phrase ""at or slightly above"" that I suggested earlier? Lyle, can you reach your objective without putting in a numerical target?  In addition to saying ""at or slightly above,"" could we leave that proviso and then go on to say that the Committee would tolerate an overrun in M2 due to the movement of funds from RPs into all savers certificates?  Yes, that's right That's a more concrete way  I'm just uneasy about coming up with some numerical target that we're not going to hit  It isn't clear This language simply says that it has to be evaluated That's why I said ""tolerate""  13 to 18 percent  We had excess reserves, Bill, because of the move to same-day settlement  I think the one comment that everybody agreed on here is that we didn't want a precipitous decline in interest rates I don't see why we can't have a consultation at 13 percent It's quite a move down from the current 15 or 15-1/4 percent level  Would you have a consultation at 13 percent even though the range is 12 to 17?  All right, that's a reasonable compromise "
2062,1981-11-17,SOLOMON," We had a long negotiation, you remember, with the Japanese; it was not so long with the Germans  Our biggest problem with the Japanese, which we finally solved, was not getting a market rate because their Treasury bill rate was But we finally worked that out I had to put a lot of pressure on the Ministry of Finance as well as on the Bank of Japan There are two different versions; but they're completely satisfied now with the arrangements over at the Treasury  So moved  Also, pumping in more reserves when the economy is weak to compensate for a [shortfall] will not necessarily result in an increased money supply What one may find is that it just causes a further drop in borrowing and more downward pressure on interest rates We may end up not being any closer to our monetary target and it may bring about a more precipitous [rate] decline  Yes, but there's a delayed effect  It may not show up for quite a few months  What's your peak-to-trough projection, Jim?  The people say that they're planning on a 5 to 6 percent wage increase next year But they are nonunion They pay relatively low wages; they [start with] the minimum wage, I think  So, he's not complaining about the shortfall?  Well, that's forthright, anyway  Well, [Roger] just said it  I think it's also fair to say that equivocation is in the eye of the beholder  I think the split among us is sharper today than it has been in a long time It turns, really, on the question of how much importance one gives to a moderate, orderly decline in interest rates as against a more rapid drop I'm concerned about the reaction in the bond markets if there were a rapid drop in the fed funds rate There could be a very negative reaction and this moderate decline that we've been seeing--and yields in bond markets have the best chance of influencing and bringing down mortgage rates-- could be cut off very abruptly if markets see a precipitous decline in short-term money rates I think it's true that many of us here are more concerned about declines in [real] interest rates when they threaten to drop too precipitously, in our judgment, and become negative But I don't think there's anything inherently immoral, let alone unaesthetic, Nancy, about asymmetry The--  Well, I'm not too sure; it depends on where our priorities are  I've never argued that there has to be a mechanistic asymmetry in conducting a complicated monetary policy In any case it, I align myself with Fred Schultz, Lyle  -28-    11/17/81  Gramley, Roger Guffey, and although he's somewhat elliptical, I think Jerry Corrigan, Henry, and a few others  I would argue that we should have something close to alternative C, say 6 percent, for October to December  No  Or 5 percent for September to December, if you want to use that, but I think it would be silly to formulate it that way in the directive Secondly, I also think a funds rate range of 11 to 16 percent makes sense because we've had this sharp decline of about 300 basis points in the fed funds rate And if it were to drop to 11 percent from 13-1/4 percent within the remaining six weeks of this year, that's a very substantial drop I would find it surprising that people would want to see it drop faster than from 13-1/4 to 11 percent within a 6-week period I believe that the recession will continue into early next year and that there will be further pressures to continue the downward [trend] of rates, which I think we have to accept My only point is that [the decline] be moderate and orderly or we will have a perverse reaction in the bond market Now, I would assume we would start with an initial borrowing of $350 or $400 million I also would agree that if growth in the money supply comes in higher, we could accept that The disadvantage of targeting higher monetary growth is that there's a greater likelihood that we will get a decline in interest rates at the front end of the period at a much more rapid rate, instead of spreading it out over a period of months in a more moderate way  Even under the present law, newly discovered natural gas will be fully decontrolled by 1985  The cheating must be enormous  We have a smaller--  Chuck, we have to give some verbal guidance on how much of a shortfall is acceptable  I agree with Chuck, but for different reasons My concern is that the markets will assume that we mean only a very modest shortfall if we say a shortfall will be accepted Secondly, I'm concerned about the [possible] interpretation of the caveat about declining rates We'd have to say at least an ""orderly"" decline of rates, or something like that, which doesn't imply that we're pushing gung-ho for that I think on balance there's less danger of misinterpretation if we use the other alternative--if we put in something like alternative C and say we will accept something lower than that  Then the fed funds rate is going to go [down] until we change it  Maybe we should simply say there are only six weeks left to go and there's no point in--  What does that $200 million difference mean in terms of the implied fed funds rate?  So, the real policy issue is the one we discussed Do we want a more rapid rate of decline in the early part, that is, in the next few weeks, or do we want to stretch it out and have a more moderated rate of decline? If we go for ""A,"" we're taking a bigger risk that we will have the pressure earlier  Well, I'm assuming the same range of $350 to $400 million If you construct the nonborrowed reserve path on ""A"" rather than ""C,"" then there's a greater risk that we'll get the downward pressure earlier and to a larger degree  Yes I accept that  Chuck, if we move in your direction to the 7 percent for October to December--I don't mean September, [but] October to December--would you accept a funds rate range of 11 to 16 percent?  -46-    11/17/81  Why do we have to keep the funds rate range at 5 points?  But everybody knows that the up side is academic anyway in the next five weeks So, why couldn't it be 11 to 15 percent?  I do, too The pressure we will get on rates will be significantly different if we have a shortfall And that's what the real issue is about today  The question is how far; that's the issue If it drops another 225 basis points in the next 5 weeks from where it is presently, that's quite a substantial drop If we go below--  We're probably going to need more decline in January and February, too, beyond that though  Or we'll have our consultation earlier if we agree on an 11 percent floor rather than a 10 percent floor  Well, I would go with Fred's proposal To me it's really important that we not repeat what we did last year That's the one time I dissented and I'd have to dissent again, I think, if the fed funds floor were put so as to permit such a sharp drop in the funds rate over a short period of time  The reaction to that would be very perverse in the bond market I'm convinced of it And I think that is much more meaningful to an economic recovery  -52-    11/17/81  That's certainly widening it!  Nobody is really going to believe that we're indifferent  Yes, but the language doesn't--  [Unintelligible] then we would have a shortfall [Unintelligible] the language--  I thought it was going to be ""7 percent or lower""  -56-    11/17/81  It's highly unlikely it would be higher  The problem is that if we don't use the 7 percent number, we then get into the formulation--if we don't want to change it in the middle of the quarter--in which the wording is so fuzzy that nobody really knows what it means If we want to  -57-    11/17/81  follow a policy of not changing target numbers during each quarter, that would have to become, I think, a consistent policy  I think the lesser evil is to put the 7 percent number down and not worry about the fact that we're changing  What is your projection for now, Steve, 5 percent?  Well, what we're trying to do is structure a compromise, Si We're most likely to hit alternative C or below, but that's not acceptable to a substantial number of people, Chuck and others So we've been trying to grope for a compromise in that area If we go back to your kind of language, even though it's confusing to the public, we'd still have to have a private understanding on how much shortfall--  It said the Committee had set aside--  Do you want a show of hands?  I'd say ""a symmetrically moderate shortfall in M1 and an overrun in M2""  This directive will get known as the 7 to 11  Is this the first meeting with no dissent this year?  END OF MEETING  -69-     "
2093,1981-12-21,SOLOMON,"  Well, as Paul said, there was a  feeling on that midmorning that if the mark reversed itself and the  dollar weakened--the mark was up to about 229 or 230--then it might  be appropriate [to intervene], depending on the conditions at that  moment  But that was in the context of the reaction to the Polish  move  I don't think that the Treasury or even you have a view as to  what rate change [constitutes a disorderly market], devoid of the  context in which the rate change comes about, unless maybe it comes  about very abruptly       But we have had bigger moves than  that       The markets attribute that to our  policy of nonintervention  In fact, I gather at the Federal Advisory  Council meeting you had in November that all the banks represented on  that Council criticized the nonintervention policy  At least that is  what Don Platten told me       It is always interesting to hear two  people report a conversation       That is what he told us [in New  York]      Well, people know what Beryl Sprinkel and Don Regan mean by a crisis and, therefore, they probably expect some intervention That is obviously clear and, therefore, maybe that is one reason the rates are--  The Japanese intervened very heavily  The banks had told their committees before the takeover that if the Poles did pay the interest, sympathetic consideration--that was the term they used--would be given to some new short-term trade credits of 60 to 90 days Not all the banks would do that, but that was the language they agreed on if the Poles didn't default And then everything got overtaken Nothing probably would have happened anyway, but any chance of a solution being reached certainly got wiped out temporarily by that takeover So, everybody is in disarray I don't know how many banks are going to move to increase their loan loss write-offs I checked around but nobody that I am aware of has done more than 50 percent as write-offs  A couple of banks said that they had increased their loan loss reserves by 50 percent of the Polish loans  Maybe you can get a better answer if you ask why they are projecting that, Larry At least when I've asked that specifically, the answer is Because it has gone up so fast, it ought to slow down  You said you assumed that retail sales would be going up somewhat nominally both this month and in    12/21-22/81  January The executive of a leading national retail chain said to me that they think the reasonably satisfactory pre-Christmas sales are the last gasp and that there is going to be a major fall in retail sales in January They had a poor October-November Since then they've done reasonably well with all these sales; they ran a 12 percent increase in nominal terms But they expect January to be extremely poor, for what it is worth Generally speaking, the business CEOs I've been speaking with, as distinguished from the financial CEOs, are much gloomier and expect a greater-than-average recession and, some of them [are especially gloomy] I'm not talking about the interest rate sensitive industries but, for example, car loadings on the railroads The head of one of those railway outfits said that it was the worst he'd seen in--I forget the period of time-- many, many years; it was worse than in the 1974-75 drop There is a lot of gloom and doom in the business community, whereas I think in the financial community there is an assumption that the recession will be more or less an average one  On the other hand, notwithstanding what I said earlier, I was talking with Citibank's board of directors last week and I went around the table and asked them what wage settlements each plant expected to make I was surprised that every single man at that table who headed a large company said between 9 and 9-1/2 percent  Most of them were unionized But when I asked them if they had any plants that were nonunion, because some of them were very [diversified], they said it didn't make that much difference in their company as a matter of policy Quite a few said, however, that they expected some productivity increases and that the net increase in labor cost might come in around 7 percent  But where the threat is clearly coming from imports in addition to the depressed economy, they tell me management has a much stronger case in getting labor to--  But I think there is going to be a significant divergence in the wage settlement between manufacturing and service industries  Isn't there a law that when everybody expects an upturn--if it looks unanimous--it isn't going to happen?  There is a widespread feeling among businessmen--they all volunteer it--that we have a dualistic economy that people are lucky to be in the service sector because they aren't going to have it very tough The head of IBM was telling me that business is absolutely booming They make a distinction between wage increases in the service sector as against the manufacturing sector It is the manufacturing people and the people who ship the bulky stuff who are talking about how serious they think the current situation is  That is why when they implemented that 1 percent reduction of the discount rate last month they combined it with heavy intervention  But they don't have the innovation and the technology--  Where would you cut the half point, from the top or the bottom?  -23-    12/21-22/81  I just was going to ask you a question if you have the urge to answer I can understand the case for not including retail RPs and I can understand the case for not including IRA and Keogh accounts [in M2] I don't understand what the rationale would be, though, if I understood you right, for [not including] institutional money market funds  We have heard good reasons why a wider range in M1-B makes sense There is uncertainty due to the innovation in technology impact, which is likely to continue On balance, weighing the pros and cons, I would leave M1-B where it is And I would leave M2 where it is rather than raise it if the Committee were to agree that we have to show a greater willingness to make a midyear adjustment if innovation in technology continues to bring about these shifts It seems to me that there might be some advantage in terms of this famous or infamous credibility problem, in foreshadowing that adjustment in the policy record of this meeting or a subsequent meeting as well as in the Chairman's presentation in February We can put everybody on notice and give it some concreteness and say it is not just a cop-out We can point to the divergence between M1-B and M2 and say that if this divergence widened because of innovation in technology, then we would be prepared to make an adjustment in the targets at midyear I think it would be a mistake for us to shrink from that If I thought we were going to shrink from that, then I'd say we really should go with Lyle Gramley's suggestion and raise the M2 target I should add, since I didn't make myself 100 percent clear yesterday, that I strongly support taking IRA and Keogh accounts out of M2 I guess they would go into M3; I am not quite sure whether they would go into M3 or into something else, maybe L  I still have some difficulty in understanding the rationale for excluding institutionally held, corporation held, money market balances in money market funds The fact that they average $125,000 whereas the average household balance averages $12,000 is logical; one is a business and the other is a household The motivation or the potential use of it as money--it is liquidity--is still the same So I am not quite sure I understand fully why one can make that distinction or what the rationale is  But an institutional CD, even if negotiable, does have a fixed maturity It's locked in for a period of time    12/21-22/81  Whereas this money in the money market fund can move in 24 hours  Or it moves to a checking account to finance transactions  That's because we are always afraid our credibility will be injured if we change But if we foreshadow it--put people on notice that we have a very clear, honest case on innovation in technology--and everybody is aware of it, we can begin to educate people more and make it easier for us  That's inherent in almost anything we look at Where's the money coming from, right?  It can't stop us from--  It's so clearly understandable by everybody that there's a rationale for taking it out  But last year didn't you accept the base drift in Ml?  On M2 the numbers are 98, 89, and 81 percent  Those are the equivalent numbers according to our calculations  Taking the November base to March, for alternative A M2 is 98 percent, alternative B is 89 percent, and alternative C is 81 percent  M1, as Steve said, is 52, 37, and 22 percent  What I would recommend, Mr Chairman, is taking the November base and liberalizing alternative B somewhat by rounding up the 37 to 4 percent I'd start with around $350 million of initial borrowing and lower the fed funds rate range by 1 point, which would bring it down to 10 to 14 percent or we could use 10 to 15 percent if we want to go back to the 5-point spread  Which is a liberalization of ""B""  Yes  Either 10 to 14 or 10 to 15 percent, I don't care There's some advantage in changing that range from time to time whether it's 4 points or 5 points I don't feel strongly about that But I do think the lower end of it ought to be lowered by 1 point and that the initial borrowing ought to be around $350 million  Well, the M2 number then becomes around 9 percent It's 89 percent technically, but if we round up the 37 on M1-B to 4 percent then it would be shading M2 to a little more than 9 percent  Well, I think there's a difference of view among the technical people as to whether initial borrowing of $350 million means a lower rate or the same rate as we've been seeing lately Borrowings have been running on average less than the $450 million We might ask both Steve and Peter to comment on what they think the implications are  Well, it might be temporary parking for Christmas  I should say that New York, for what it's worth, has a lower projection for December  You want all the decimals?  Assuming you go ahead with one or more of these three conceptual changes in the definition of M2, that would be effective at the beginning of January or what?  And making it retroactive?  We have to be consistent If the base is going to be M1-B unadjusted, then December has to be treated that way  If $300 million is going to produce what Steve thinks it will produce--namely, [a fed funds rate] a shade over the 12 percent discount rate--then I'd go with that That's basically what I was targeting for when I said $350 million So it doesn't bother me if--  Not that often, it seems to me, in the time I've been on [the Committee] It certainly makes us look a little sillier when we miss by a big amount if we put our targets in terms of halves  I don't see how we can target over 9 percent unless we more or less agree that we are going to raise [the long-run target for] M2  1982 brings a new Henry Wallich  I agree  In New York the market participants seeing ""around 4 to 5 percent"" will tend to assume that the ""around"" refers to the area between 4 and 5 percent And it gets us a little less precision if we just say ""around 4"" or ""around 5""  Would you like to read it?  That's not obscure, that's just--  Again, I just want to say that if we do 9 to 10 percent, then that does imply very strongly a case--and I think the markets will definitely read it that way--that we're going to come out in February with a revised figure that is somewhat higher than 9 percent on M2  We don't want to say that specifically Suppose we're wrong?  My concern is not with the substance We all know the difference is very small My concern is that I think we are loosing a certain sense of respect because of how outside people see these things They see an overrun in M2 They see us targeting 9 to 10 percent, which is over our preliminary M2 target It seems to me that there will be an immediate feeling in the market-- I don't see how we could avoid that--that we probably will move the M2 target up in February and there will be talk about some easing If we are willing to do that, all right; but I don't see how we can avoid that impression If we had had a shortfall in M2, sure, we could get away with 9 to 10 percent I don't see how we can escape that market reaction; if that market reaction doesn't bother you, all right, but--  You are talking about the short term "
2121,1982-02-01,SOLOMON," I have a question I understand that in most or all of these new wage agreements that are coming in at much lower levels, such as the Teamsters and others, there is for the first time a clause indicating that labor can reopen the contracts if conditions improve in the industry Do you know more about this? And to what extent is that likely, when recovery starts, to bring about a very sharp reversal in the downward trend in labor costs?  I'd like to offer a thesis As I see the data, the services sector part of the economy is likely to continue to be characterized by relatively high wage settlements and prices The divergence in the price trend between the services sector and the rest of the economy in the last year is remarkable In fact, in the second half of 1981, prices of services went up again at a 10 percent rate whereas [other] prices continued to come down    2/1-2/82  How much relief for interest rates do you get in your model with a tighter fiscal policy?  That's probably as good a guess as any because they certainly don't expect to get all of that out of the Congress  I find it interesting that the interest rate projections in the bond market that are consistent with your GNP scenario show virtually no change [The bond rate] is projected to be between 15 and 16 percent over a 2-year period What does that say about inflationary expectations and investors affecting the bond market at a time when you're showing such a sharp drop in actual inflation? How do you tie this whole thing together? Are you in effect saying that bond market investors are going to continue to have a fairly high level of inflationary expectations notwithstanding the major progress that you're assuming in '83 and '84?  I'm not disagreeing I just want to be sure that I understand what the man said  It seems to me, notwithstanding the rapid decline in the actual rate of inflation that you are projecting, that inflationary expectations will stay high for two reasons (1) the short-term volatility of rates; and (2) as two years go by, if we stay at 9 percent unemployment and very depressed housing conditions, etc, notwithstanding the progress on inflation, there will be less and less patience with that situation in the political arena If you add to that some changes in the election in '82 or changes in the polls of public opinion, then I think there is going to be pressure for reversing some of the spending cuts On the other hand, there may be some willingness to do something on the revenue side, so I'm not sure what the net effect on the deficit would be But I don't see any realistic scenario that assumes that the country will simply stay with this situation for two years, notwithstanding the very attractive drops in the rate of inflation I don't know what follows from that    2/1-2/82  because there are so many different possibilities as to what form the reaction would take  For the first three quarters, the average earnings per hour figure was coming way down while the compensation index was not And then finally in the fourth quarter, there was this delayed parallel trend movement in the compensation index For the first 9 months of the year, as I remember, we had a significant drop in average earnings that we did not have in compensation  Irv Auerbach?  Could we get an explanation from Steve on the seasonal adjustment? As I understand it, starting in '82 we're doing a common seasonal adjustment for demand deposits and NOW accounts Is that correct?  May I ask you a hypothetical question?  My hypothetical question is If you would apply to the NOW accounts the same seasonal correction that you applied to the savings, would you have had less of a bulge in January?  Well, the only thing I'd like to add, since it has been mentioned and I think it's significant, is that the bulk of Christmas sales came much later this year than in previous years And the bad weather in January also caused extremely weak sales Credit card companies with whom we checked emphasized that the sales were very weak That tends to give some logical common sense support to the view of various bankers that these are temporary increases Add to that the precautionary reasons that call for somewhat larger balances I don't have any hard proof, but my feeling is that a substantial part of this increase will be washed out over a period of time I do not believe that we could begin to attribute such a sharp increase to economic reasons--advance indicators of a very strong economic recovery There may be many factors involved; there probably are to get such a sharp increase But I think it's hard to conclude that a substantial part is not temporary  That's all part of the temporary thing  We did not find when we analyzed M2 into those components that pay market rates and those that are below market rates--and we analyzed the movements in these two [components] --that we could arrive at any better correlation  And last year [M2 growth] was 9 percent, virtually the same Nominal GNP was also up in a range of about 94 or 93 percent, as compared to M2 And I noticed that everybody's projections were in the 8 to 9 percent range for nominal GNP If that's one to two percent real growth, plus about 7 percent inflation, then one would think that we would come comfortably within the tentative M2 targets  Well, I think there is still a very good chance that we will see in 1982 some of the downward shift in demand for holding M1 that we saw in 1981, and I don't think we should be mesmerized by a January bulge We also should not be the least bit unhappy about coming in anywhere within the range and we shouldn't even be thinking in terms of midpoints given the shifting nature of these demands We may very well come in at the upper end of the M1 range if we don't get a significant or even partial repetition of what we saw in 1981 But I have no reason to assume that we won't get that In addition to money moving into money market funds and the substitution effect, we may also get a significant movement in the development of automatic sweep accounts, which also will tend to reduce the demand for M1 balances Therefore, my instinct would be to stay with the ranges because it's not clear to me that we have as little room as the January bulge would indicate Not only is there the possibility that part of it is temporary but there's also this other point that I just made So, I'd be inclined to stick with [the tentative ranges]  As far as M2 goes, even this last year I was a little unhappy about the tightness of the M2 range I pretty much come out the way Steve does in that I believe it's very likely that we are going to have less of a problem coming within the 9 percent [upper limit], although I agree with Chuck that we're probably likely to be at the high end of that range On the other hand, it wouldn't bother me at all if we came out at the low end of one range and the high end of another I think the midpoint stuff is absolutely nonsense in this imprecise world we're living in  So, on balance, if I were presenting the targets, I would point out to the Congress and the country that we may very well come in at the upper end of the range for M1, given the strong growth in January, if that doesn't prove to be as temporary as it might be But it's also true that if we get the kind of innovation and structural changes that we got in 1981 in M1, we could very easily come in toward the lower end of the range And I think the M2 relationship to nominal GNP is close enough; I don't think one can read too much from that 03 percentage point movement It's still very close and,    2/1-2/82  therefore, it seems to me that we could come in on that So that's why I would stay [with the tentative ranges]  If one were putting this is non- jargon, the way to explain it was just the way I think Peter started to do When we project a more expansive money supply, the reason we project that rates will go lower is that we are assuming we will supply the reserves But when it happens not because we're supplying the reserves but because the demand is going up, we don't supply those reserves because it's not in our path Then, of course, we get a different kind of reaction The rates go up instead of down    2/1-2/82  Steve, since we don't know the January figures--and we have done this before--why aren't we basing from December to March rather than from January to March?  Yes, I saw that, and I didn't understand why we would do November to March  Yes, but to me [a December base] just seems a little more logical, since we really know only 2/3 of January and we do know December And the numbers look more moderate if we go from December  If we get the washing out starting early in February, I don't think any of us has a problem If it doesn't work out like that, though, it seems to me that we might want to build in a little extra protection by setting the initial borrowing assumption at, say, $13 billion rather than at $15 billion because otherwise we're going to get a rise in rates, I think If we start with $15 billion for borrowing and don't get a decline, there's a greater risk that we're going to get a rise in interest rates We would give ourselves a little margin if we start with $13 billion  We're talking about the aim  The nonborrowed reserve path right now is based on the assumption of aiming for borrowing of $15 billion At the moment I'm assuming that we don't want to see a 15-1/2 percent fed funds rate I'm assuming that we're talking more about what we had hoped which was that $15 billion in borrowing would produce a fed funds rate of closer to 14 or 15 percent  Right, about 14-1/2 percent So, it seems to me--  Well, my instinct is based on our discussions in New York, to the effect that the psychology in the markets is such that if we aim at $15 billion and don't get any decline [in M1], we're probably going to end up with a higher funds rate than 14-1/2 percent And, therefore, I think there's some    2/1-2/82  advantage to starting with a modest safety margin in case we don't get the decline  Right, but if we're living with the January bulge, and I certainly agree that that makes sense, we're not trying to correct it in the very, very short run If we start off with $13 billion, basically what we're saying is that if all of the projections worked out exactly as projected, we would get back to the upper end of the target halfway between June and September Now, if we start with $15 billion, what we're saying based on the staff's analysis is that we would get back to the upper end by June  The way Nancy formulated it, it's basically a discretionary decision It seems to me that the advantage of starting with $13 billion as against $15 billion is that then we have a carry-through during the entire period of the lower base That's because we make the adjustments and the amount of change that results from the reality of the situation doesn't affect the starting point So, you get the carry-through effect of the $200 million increase in the initial nonborrowed reserve path by starting with borrowings of $13 rather than $15 billion I will live with $15 billion--in every other respect I agree with what has been put forward--but I'm just not sure that at $15 billion we will get 14 or even 14-1/2 percent [on the funds rate] I certainly don't think 14 percent is what it is likely to produce; it probably will be 14-1/2 percent at best And given the psychology of the market, we may not get that I just wanted to have a safety margin to start with If we don't build it in to start with, Nancy, then it becomes simply a discretionary decision at a later time And I don't see that--  Yes, there--  That would be interpreted in the market as dissatisfaction with the level, not as countering a disorderly or a very volatile market, I think Wouldn't you agree that that's the way the market would see it to some degree?  But that still comes back to a view about the level I'm not unhappy about this because it's a beautiful [chance] to finally get a change and a perception of a change in the Sprinkel policy I do think, though, that the market will be a little confused because when we've had these disorderly or volatile markets [before] we have not intervened and all of a sudden we are intervening in a situation--and this is a big movement--  And the beholdee  I think it would be prudent to increase that [informal limit] by even more than [the $1/4 billion that] Sam is recommending  I think we ought to [raise] it $1/2 billion because sometimes the situation moves fast And it does seem to me that there is no issue of principle here  Given the imprecision of the numbers, it seems to me that we all ought to agree with the general proposition that we are doing our job well if we come in anywhere within the ranges We should not give the impression that we are aiming for midpoints  Therefore, I think there is a considerable disadvantage in raising the range for M2 because then [it would seem that] what we are really trying to do is to come in closer to the midpoint and we would be disturbed with coming in around the upper end of the range So, in addition to the staff predictions that we probably will be more comfortable with the M2 range this year than in the previous two years, it seems to me that there is a pretty strong case for not raising the M2 range  On the timing question, you seem to feel that there are no disadvantages, particularly, in delaying for three weeks    2/1-2/82  I see I just wanted to be sure  It is worth pointing out on the other side that there is an advantage in testifying on the scheduled day because then we would begin to accustom the committee, the Congress, and the public [to the idea] that we are willing, when there are technical or structural shifts, to be more flexible on midyear--or I should say intra-year--adjustments If we wait the three weeks then you are somewhat less likely to put forward that point of view So, it seems to me that there are arguments on both sides  We have not And that is why we should begin, when we have a good reason to support it such as when    2/1-2/82  these technological changes and innovations result in shifts, to get people accustomed to our being flexible within the year  There is a difference in the implication for 1983  After all, the short-run decision that we just made early this morning does logically lead to what Paul said I don't think it will happen, but if we find that the money supply is strong in February, then we have to do something to give ourselves more room As I say, I don't think that is going to happen, but it does seem to me that we are better off sticking with the scheduled date for testimony and going on record and preparing people the way you indicated I would point out that the uncertainty also exists because of the question of whether the innovations that we saw in 1981, which tended to depress demand, will continue in 1982 There is uncertainty not simply on the up side but also on the down side  But then we would tighten the M2  If we offset the tightening by raising the M2 range--  --and we rebase M1, we are in real danger of getting a major reaction by the market, the press, and the public that we are definitely easing monetary policy very significantly  What I am saying--I think you are misunderstanding me--is that I think we could get away with rebasing M1 But to rebase M2 and then offset it by raising the target range another 1/2 point I think is overkill  We are better off, if we are forced into rebasing M1, not to rebase M2  And there are some arguments on why it does not have to be symmetrical  The trouble is that everything we say here is true  Even when we say different things  You would do it in an even-handed way in the sense that you would mention the possibility of a shift in demand due to the innovations and to technology? If so,--  Yes, I understand that But you would mention that there is this--  I would vote yes  -93-    2/1-2/82  At the risk of being mischievous, may I point out that this process or line of presentation--namely, getting a decision sequentially on this particular issue--[may prejudice the decision] You are asking for a decision on that and saying that you are going to inform the [Congressional] committee and prepare the ground that under these conditions we might be willing to make an adjustment and that it would be logical to do it in the form of rebasing If you get an affirmative decision from this Committee now on that and then go on to ask if we should fine-tune on the target ranges, then the answer I think becomes clearly no We will look silly, it seems to me, if we make minor adjustments in M1 or M2 even, and then on top of that say we are prepared to take another look at this and do some rebasing So, if you do not want to prejudice the decision on the last point, it seems to me that you really have to ask for a decision on both  I see I am just pointing out where it logically leads  There are two alternatives One is rebasing; the other is just to stick with the targets  What are your latest data on L?  I think Chuck's suggestion opens up an interesting area of compromise  But suppose we get a switch from large CDs to Eurodollar financing?  It would still be the same target, but we would rebase [bank credit]? "
2148,1982-03-29,SOLOMON," We have to look alert but relaxed When we get these bulges [unintelligible], affects the market reaction as to how they--  If I'm reading the numbers right, you are estimating a GNP implicit deflator for the first quarter of 50 percent; but for the second quarter it jumps up to 66 percent and then comes down again substantially in the third quarter and fourth quarter to about 5-1/2 percent What explains such an abrupt shift in the deflator from the first to the second quarter?  Talking about wage increases, I met last week with representatives of about 20 leading universities in the country and I was struck by the fact that every single one of them is going to be paying salary increases this year of 10 to 12 percent And when I asked them why, they said it was catch-up--that the university faculties and staff had suffered over the last few years  Their portfolios are doing so well in many cases--at least those who didn't make the wrong decisions--and I guess they're able to play a bit of catch-up  I'd like to ask Steve and Jim a question How do you reconcile this relatively reasonable increase in real growth in the next three quarters compared with the previous projections with the argument that the financial markets are going to be under pressure, given such a large public sector borrowing requirement? How do you reconcile that with your interest rate projections for the rest of the year in Appendix 2 in which you show the fed funds rate declining?  Well, what are you assuming about the budgetary deficit?  I assume all these, yes  Not in Appendix 2, though  The bottom line, then, is that you believe, even with real GNP rising close to 5 percent in the second half of the year on average and with this very large budgetary deficit, that we still can have a slightly declining fed funds rate for the second half of this year  But it's highly possible that if we ease the monetary targets, we would bring down short rates but there would be a perverse reaction in the long end of the market  I'd like to ask Henry Wallich this question, too, as well as Steve and anyone else who wants to answer If a perfectly indexed Treasury bond were put out today, what level of real interest would it have to bear in a competitive auction in the market?  Okay But real rates are technically the difference between nominal rates and inflation expectations, not the actual rate of inflation So, if the problem that we're running into, as Steve answered John Balles--and it's something we all know-- is that long-run inflationary expectations have not come down, then in the technical sense of the term real interest rates aren't as high as they look Yes, it may very well be that a perfectly indexed bond, which automatically takes care of inflationary expectations, still would carry only a 2 to 3 percent real interest rate because, if inflationary expectations are taken care of automatically, then why would one assume that a higher interest rate is needed today than a year ago?  No  I would favor something very close to ""B"" It seems to me that it positions us reasonably well, given uncertainties about the reversal of velocity in circulation I would recommend a slightly lower initial borrowing target Instead of $1-1/4 billion, I'd opt for something like $11 billion, first of all because that's more likely to prevent the funds rate from going beyond 14 percent And secondly, if there is a bulge in April--if M1 growth is somewhat larger than the 9 percent--we can accommodate it more easily That would demonstrate a consistency in policy but at the same time I think it's really better to try to keep rates from exceeding 14 percent in the next couple of months if possible So, I would not think the answer should be between ""B"" and ""C,"" but pretty much ""B"" or in that area, with a slightly easier initial borrowing objective  Yes, but if we also say M2 around 8 percent and the staff builds that operationally into the path, coming out with a path that's somewhere between ""A"" and ""B"" is not as restrictive as the 3 percent  Well, [unintelligible] deal more  I'm a little worried about the market perception when we narrow or widen the range--I'm not talking about the absolute levels now at all--because the market attributes much more significance to our narrowing or widening that range than we do We don't really give it much significance But market observers don't understand why we would be narrowing or widening the range unless it's of some importance to us I have heard recently views that we are keeping the fed funds rate within a very narrow range in terms of actually looking at the market behavior So, I don't particularly  -56-    3/29-30/82  care, except that if we want to de-emphasize the constraints that are implied by the range, we ought to try, if at all possible, not to keep shifting back and forth between a narrow range and a wider range  Also, there is a special situation in the market whereby in the last few weeks the fed funds rate has come in almost consistently higher than one would expect from the level of borrowing So, therefore, probably with $11 billion we will get about 14 percent with today's conditions I don't think the market would see that as terribly significant The funds rate has been averaging about 14-1/2 percent, fluctuating between 14-1/4 and 14-3/4 percent roughly, in the last few weeks with that borrowing level of $1-1/4 billion So, I don't think we would see that much movement in the fed funds rate  Why don't we flip a coin?  We have a little more room with $11 billion if April comes in high  I think Lyle has a good point that we wouldn't want to apply the M2 directive factor, so to speak, on a quarterly basis We would have to see a stronger growth in April in M2 before we clamped down And if we're targeting a 9 percent increase in the nonborrowed reserve path for April--  -61-    3/29-30/82  Do you mean that if somebody filed a Freedom of Information Act request, you'd have to give [the data] to them? You prepare a weekly M2?  That's giving a lot of flexibility  Yes, if it's a very minor adjustment we don't need a consultation to do it If it's a significant adjustment, then there's an advantage to having a consultation  You know the Solomonic decision is to cut the baby in half  How often do we hit any projection?  -65-    3/29-30/82 "
2203,1982-06-30,SOLOMON," Well, since I agree with Lyle's presentation, let me try and answer that last question, or at least give my personal view on it My own view is that we should say that we would tolerate a modest or limited overrun in view of the NOW account behavior, that is NOW account funds not acting as transactions money The reason I think we should choose that rather than either of the other two options--rebasing or raising the targets--is first of all that raising the target a half point to 6 percent target implies a precision that is almost ridiculous, given the possible swings in velocity in the second half of the year If we were seriously considering 6-1/2 percent, that might make more sense But I don't see the point of changing the targets a half point when I think it would be more consistent and better received in the markets if we simply indicated that we would tolerate a modest or limited overrun in view of the NOW account behavior  Stepping back, I think it's worth mentioning that our forecast is significantly different from Jim's We have significantly higher real growth in the second half and significantly higher inflation We are almost 1-1/2 points higher on real growth, at 39 percent, and almost 2 points higher on inflation We think inflation will be about 73 to 75 percent    6/30-7/1/82  No, for the second half of '82 The Board staff has inflation coming down steadily from the second quarter; it drops from 61 to 57 percent in the third quarter and then drops again to 54 percent in the fourth quarter, whereas we think it will be around 7-1/2 percent in the second half of the year  I'm talking about the GNP implicit deflator, yes For what it's worth, I don't conclude anything from that except that this difference in forecasts tends to corroborate a feeling that, as has been expressed here, we should be prepared to tolerate a modest overrun or raise the target, if it were the consensus view that it had to be raised a whole point It's just that I don't think a half-point increase makes much sense  Right  At the time that Paul testifies, I would announce it  [A limited overrun] wouldn't be much of a move beyond what he said earlier when he talked about the upper part of the ranges and then he talked about the NOW account behavior and we were quite comfortable, et cetera I think it would be less likely to be interpreted as a reversal of policy or caving in to Congressional pressures to raise the targets Even though other people haven't discussed '83 too much, I think it would be dangerous to lower the '83 targets In other words, I would want to stick with the 5-1/2 percent rather than do another half-point cut the way we've been doing the last couple of years Among miscellaneous points, I believe it is worth mentioning that, like Lyle, I feel not at all confident that we will see a reversal of the strength that we've seen in liquidity preference I think it's very possible that we will continue to see this phenomenon and that we could see a very uncomfortable pressure on interest rates if we don't give ourselves a little more room And one reason we ought to give ourselves more room in the revision of the '82 target is that it will influence our decision on the intermeeting growth path, the targets we'll get to tomorrow That's all I'd like to say now  Let's be flexible somewhere else this time  You were so indifferent to M1, you didn't care!  That's a cheap advantage of it That we don't know the figures  You're going to be flexible in February!  One point on flexibility between the preliminary figure given in the testimony in July and the figure adopted next February is that it's always easy to go down a half point; it's a lot harder to go up a half point if we put our preliminary target a half point lower  That's because some people didn't know the end-of-June figures That's the only reason  I think you ought to emphasize how much damage a leak from this meeting--particularly about the language that's here--would do I can't underestimate it  Mancera  What I would guess would happen--this is only a guess, of course--is that when October comes around we will  -26-    6/30-7/1/82  be told that under Lopez Portillo they will not go to the IMF and they will ask us for a three- or four-month extension so that Miguel de La Madrid will go to the IMF  The first of December  I'm not sure they--  $20 odd billion  I don't think we really have any alternative Even though $700 million is not going to solve their problem and they understand why we're pushing them toward the Fund, which would solve their problem, they--  I'm not talking about that I'm talking about the good housekeeping seal, obviously But it would be so incredibly misinterpreted [in Mexico] if we were to refuse to cooperate The only grounds for refusing--and I can't see this as very legitimate--would be to pressure the Treasury to step in right away It seems to me the only possibility is in the package approach But I don't see how we could refuse, given the fact we have this huge neighbor to the south and all kinds of intricate interrelationships I just can't see how the US government could refuse to be helpful, particularly since they agreed to the conditions without any waffling  Are you going to be coming back to the full Committee every single time if they repay?  That would be equally misunderstood  You probably are going to get questions also on why we don't target a range of real interest rates, a monetary policy Henry Wallich has suggested at times I think some sentiment for that is building in some quarters on the Hill  Well, we'd have to use a moving average of inflation on that We couldn't do it once a month  But that was associated with a different pattern of interest rate movements than we've had  Why not publish both of them each month and then make a switch next year?  That would mean a very sudden drop to about 12 percent  If we started with $300 million borrowing, that would be a very sudden move, not a gradual one  Well, let me say first that this is the strangest FOMC meeting I've attended There seems to be a whole change or shift in mood It's true that I missed the last meeting; I was ill Maybe it started last time But during the depth of the recession there was a much tougher attitude than I hear today I don't know what is bringing about this change, although I share in that view, as indicated by my remarks yesterday Anyway, without carrying that further, it seems to me that it's important--and here I want to emphasize what Henry said--that there not be an impression in the markets of a sudden reversal or shift toward easing It would be very politically suspect They see the pressure on us with widespread speculation now that we will ease And yet at the same time there's a gloom and doom atmosphere out there and very little expectation that interest rates will fall There's an ambivalent feeling On the one hand, they see the pressure on us [to ease] and some people think we may ultimately give into it But nobody expects that we're going to give into it that quickly Therefore, I think it would come as quite a surprise if there were a sudden drop in rates So, that is why I think we shouldn't go lower than about $800 million on the initial borrowing assumption On the other hand, I would go along with a 5-1/2 percent intermeeting target [for M1] and an 8-1/2 percent target for M2 I don't think that has to be increased The fed funds range is unimportant I see no reason to cap it And in particular, there  -52-    6/30-7/1/82  would be no reason to cap it if we accept Jerry Corrigan's suggestion, which I agree makes sense, that if the July [M1] bulge comes in at more than we're allowing for, we accommodate it within reasonable limits So, I would urge the Committee, even if it's going in the direction of easing--which it clearly is--to do so in a cautious way rather than in the kind of sudden movement that would be likely if we started off next week with a $300 or $400 million initial borrowing assumption  Well, first of all, borrowing was $1-1/2 billion last week  It has been averaging closer to $1 billion; I think it was around $900 million in the last few weeks It seems to me that the fact that we're building our [M1] path on as generous a target as 5-1/2 percent, assuming that there aren't some sudden flukes in the money supply, will permit rates to come down But I just don't think we want to be perceived as coming in with a very sudden drop in the initial [borrowing assumption] That's a matter of judgment We can ask Paul Meek I don't know; I haven't discussed this with him If we do have an initial borrowing assumption of $300 or $400 million, I think we'll have a sudden drop  A sudden change  Let me ask you a question, Paul If we started with an initial borrowing of $800 million and an M1 growth path of 5-1/2 percent, where would you expect the fed funds rate to be in the first couple of weeks?  13-1/2 or 13-3/4 percent  Do you think it's useful to have that in the directive that gets published? Or would you feel it would be equally--  In Paul's statement?  What do you mean we're following a wrong intermediate target?  Oh, I see; I'm sorry  The stock market would go [up] too  Could we have the new seasonal adjustment in the Bluebook from now on?  For the next meeting  That's a good way of handling it  We're lucky it isn't a dromedary--a double hump  You want a positive real interest rate?  Ultimately  Henry, there's a 6-month lag in FOMC reactions  Why don't we compromise by having ""about 5 percent"" with it understood that in drawing the path we're going to come closer to 5-1/4 or 5-1/2 than to 5 percent In other words, ""about"" is interpreted liberally to start off with  I thought you were proposing 5-1/2 percent  And that's consistent with what Paul is going to be saying in his testimony, too We could apply pretty much the same language to the directive that you think you would be using in your testimony [about] tolerating  Well, I'm assuming that it would be somewhere in the neighborhood of 5-1/2 percent from June  No, they don't, if things behave normally That's the big question mark Then it would mean that [the funds rate] probably would be around 13-1/2 or 13-3/4 percent in the initial two weeks or so But, of course, if there's a fluke in the figures and they come in strong, then we prevent [rates] from going above existing levels At least I understand that to be pretty much the feeling in the group And that's what Paul says too  I don't think that's better; I think that's worse! Can we agree on that?  We would get a much more favorable downward impact on long rates if the market sees a gradual and steady decline in short rates than if we have a relatively sudden drop in short rates [In the latter case] if the numbers don't come out right, particularly in August, we'd get a rise again The market has its own views as well And if we get too much downward movement in  -70-    6/30-7/1/82  short rates in July, they may not believe it is sustainable and we will not get as healthy an effect as we could get in the bond market  I don't remember, Paul  No, if it's low, we would permit some downward movement in the rates  We can't start playing that game  We can't do that The market will then start reading something into it every time we change the time of the release We'll go out of our minds  Oh, I see We apologize After a few hours here, we lose our sense of humor anyway!  I'd second that I think 10 to 15 percent, using the same language we have used, is the appropriate way to handle it And the Chairman himself has indicated that he would consult, if we got into an area that--  M2 may run stronger for June  Why don't you get a show of hands?  He hasn't suggested that  Exactly He already said--  And we wouldn't have the M2 caveat this time under Paul's formulation  He already explained that  Same here  If we're going to apply the tolerance of an overshoot to M2 as well as to M1, I have a mild preference for making M2 8-1/2 percent  But I'm not going to do or die [over that]  In your testimony you're also going to talk in terms of tolerating overshoots in both the Ms, right?  We don't publish the initial borrowing figure  So, what are we arguing about?  After what?  In New York Yes, but that's a year later  No  But rather than attribute it to uncertainties, wouldn't you attribute it to the behavior of NOW accounts?  Okay, but I wouldn't refrain from using something like--  When we talk about uncertainties, that gets misread It looks as though we'd do anything that the de facto situation pushes us to I was just having a problem with the term ""uncertainty""  But you don't want to narrow the target range, do you?  The Chairman is going to say that this is even more provisional than usual, that we're just leaving it where it is until we have a clear fix on it It implies that it's not in a certain sense the usual target  But they wouldn't necessarily have known that we were intervening with our own resources  And after the Under Secretary and the Secretary proudly pointed out that day that they had authorized this intervention to counter a disorderly market, the comment around Wall Street was What was more disorderly about Monday than a lot of other days that we've had before and since?  Oh, I see That's a good point Particularly one with money  The basic partnership agreement, which we've looked at, calls for the partners to put up the money On the other hand, there are a lot of reasons why they might delay and delay in the courts When the management and the general partners have been guilty of very sloppy management practice, if they have been--and there's some presumption that they have been--I wonder to  -86-    6/30-7/1/82  what extent limited partners, as distinct from the general partners, are still bound to put up the money If some of the thrifts who had their securities lent out end up with a shortage, I assume there will be lawsuits So, it's unclear But what is true is that we averted the initial bad psychological impact and the seizing up of the market by getting Marine Midland to resume the clearings The market is taking that whole thing very well and if at the end of the day there are some shortages, I don't think that is going to come in a way that will be disruptive  There could be a loss to those people who have had their securities used  The only real austerity, though, is this wage/price freeze for a few months  Right, but there has been no announcement of a change in the overall fiscal/monetary approach  I don't agree with that It is simply that they have put some limits on the amount by which they're going to inflate the economy or increase the budgetary deficit It's not interpreted--certainly not in the international business community in France or outside--as a reversal of policy It's just putting some constraints on what the left wing of the Mitterand party might have hoped they would ultimately go to I would say that there is a fairly widespread expectation that more devaluations will be necessary from time to time And if they come too frequently, that's the end of the EMS I think the word reversal is much too strong  Ours is higher  And a lower saving rate  If we don't ratify them, the staff personally out of their own pockets have to--  What are you aiming for? Do you feel under an obligation to respond?  It's very embarrassing to say that we ignore the state of fiscal policy in making our decision on monetary policy  Let me ask you this question If we knew that the Congress and the Administration were going to continue to run huge budgetary deficits over the next two or three years, how would you change monetary policy? Incidently, I might say that we calculate that and we've been on the mark exactly the last two years up in New York on the budgetary deficit We calculate, on the Board's economic assumptions, that the deficit in fiscal '83 will be $180 billion On our economic assumptions it's only about $166 billion, but there's a lot in there aside from that--it's Bill Ford I'm talking to The difference between the $104 billion and the $166 billion is not simply the difference in economic forecasts For example, when we go to the specifics of these things, there's a judgment that the management savings are just nonsense; they won't materialize for various reasons And there's some overestimation of certain revenues But even if we assume the $20 billion, we still end up in the $166 billion range with a similar set of economic assumptions But coming back [to my question] If you were to assume that the deficit is going to be $166 or $180 billion in fiscal '83 and that it's going to be somewhere in the neighborhood of $200 billion in fiscal '84, how would you change monetary policy?  That's what I'm asking you  Yes, I understand the argument But I'm not sure how the majority of the FOMC would come out on that  Except there is the opposite argument that this is the one way of bringing home to the Congress that they really do have to change that  The Congress has passed a budgetary resolution that says [in effect] ""Since we are tightening fiscal policy, you fellows ought to reevaluate and, by implication, ease"" Therefore, if we conclude that the Congress actually is not tightening fiscal policy, then presumably by the same logic the Congress would not want us to ease because they haven't succeeded in taking the tighter fiscal action  But, Lyle, you're aware that the high rates in the bond market are forcing companies to go much more heavily into short-term credit  Yes, but when Paul appears to testify he may be asked what the reaction of the FOMC was  Then do you want to summarize this acid discussion?  There's another way of approaching this If we say that--  Yes, it's in the official Democratic party approach If you tighten fiscal policy, then there would be an easing of monetary policy  Real?  And you also can report that there's unanimity that as yet we don't see any evidence, nor do the markets, of a credible tightening [of fiscal policy]  I'm not so sure that a phony resolution like this helps or is a useful first step  Yes, that's probably around $15 or $18 billion Okay, we get that  But there are some things in there that just can't possibly be achieved, such as the management objectives that they've built in and a few other things  Well, they might have faced up to the problem more if they had a more realistic assessment of what went into that $1039 billion "
2227,1982-07-15,SOLOMON," What do you mean, Steve?  The $451 billion includes the $58 billion [increase] we will be publishing?  Which Districts have received them? We haven't had any in New York  Paul, in regard to the last sentence ""The Committee also indicated that it was tentatively planning to adopt the same ranges for 1983,"" it seems to me that there might be some slight advantage in saying instead ""The Committee also indicated in view of present uncertainties that it was tentatively planning to continue the same ranges""  Yes, I do I had the feeling that ""adopt"" sounds like a firmer judgment as to the target ranges we want in '83 whereas ""continued"" sounds like a holding action I think it was the sense of the FOMC at its meeting that if we were going to do a revision, we would skew it downwards It would be easier to do that then whereas it would be hard to do an upward revision, and that is why we were continuing the same ranges tentatively I don't know why but I have the feeling that ""continued"" sounds better than ""adopt""  I have mixed feelings on that section that says we would tolerate some kind of--  Paul, with regard to that second half of the sentence ""and would tolerate for some period of time,"" etc first of all, not only is your suggestion of ""be evident"" instead of ""arise"" a good one, but also I'm a little concerned about not having an adjective in front of the word ""growth"" It seems to me that an adjective--something like ""modest""--before the word ""growth"" is necessary I wouldn't go as far as Nancy went in the last FOMC meeting as to indicate how much growth above we would accept, but I think there ought to be an implication that we're not talking about unlimited growth I'm a little concerned about the way some people might read that  I think it's a little too cryptic, Jerry I don't know that that would be more clear both to the Congress and the market than saying something like ""would tolerate for some period of time"" That's just my initial instinct on that  I must say, even though there isn't a large difference, that I think Bob Black's language implies a much greater willingness by the Fed to ""cave in,"" so to speak, if there is a liquidity problem in the economy, whereas what we are saying is that if the velocity of circulation is less than what it normally would be because of precautionary demands as well as demands for money and liquidity, we will factor that in So, I think that we stay more consistently and soundly based on technical grounds if we stay with the same language; Bob Black's language implies a much greater    7/15/82  willingness to ease monetary policy if the real economy continues to be in difficulty Some people might expect almost an immediate easing, given the present liquidity situation  I'd like to support Chuck's suggestion I think it's very consistent with our posture We would be very unhappy--I think substantively unhappy--if growth came in significantly lower than that It seems to me, in view of the  -12-    7/15/82  undershooting last year and in view of the situation in the economy, that coming in close to the top is appropriate "
2249,1982-08-24,SOLOMON," 115 banks  I just outlined the package, which you're probably all familiar with from the press And basically the Mexican presentation boiled down to their saying that the Fed would be repaid first on the $700 million swap; they told the banks that the only net new money between August and December would be approximately $14 to $15 billion--basically the extent of the BIS package to complete an extra additional [unintelligible] They said they had need of $19 billion, assuming everybody rolled over [their existing loans] and they had to build some reserves Therefore, this justified something close to a billion dollars in new money as being essential About 25 bankers spoke up Quite a few of them said they would cooperate, implying they'd cooperate on the rollover; some implied they would cooperate as well in sharing in the new money Nobody got up and said no Based on that, the Mexicans felt justified, and I think correctly so--though they put it a little more strongly than I think we would have said it--in stating that there was an agreement in principle on the rollover We might have said instead that there was a consensus in principle on the rollover; they said there was ""agreement"" But then they followed that up with telexes on Friday night and Saturday morning to the individual banks to get a legal, formal agreement on the 90-day rollover The advisory group said they had put together fourteen banks The two co-chairmen, from the Bank of America and Citibank, are working on the question of new money and whether they can get part of that from the other banks, not just from the fourteen As Paul said earlier, one of their conditions on the new money is basically to see the Fund program That doesn't mean they would want to wait until it is written up and every ""i"" is dotted and every ""t"" is crossed, but they have to have a basic understanding of the Fund program before they will come up with any money I think that's it  Does this reflect the oil that was previously in hock to the private banks?  There's a lot of oil that is already assigned I don't know if you have the numbers, Michael, on what is already assigned to private banks  I'm not so much worried about the Mexicans, but the Europeans will not really understand why we were so chintzy if we come in $25 million short of the 50-50 match I personally would put in for it  The ESF is in a much healthier condition than when I was there  It's the combination of all those drawings that we did from the IMF when we did the November 1 package, which we don't have to repay, so it only appears on the asset side of the ESF But all these high interest rates that the Federal Reserve is giving these countries has put the ESF in a very healthy condition  I would say that there would be very strong support from the Congress The thought of economic chaos in Mexico, with all those millions of people trying to pour in over the border, is just so upsetting to members of the Congress that I think there would be widespread support  But there is a perceptible difference between austerity programs and actual collapse  -10-    8/24/82  I don't think we can all get out in a year because they can only draw a maximum of about $1-1/4 billion from the Fund in the first year, or maybe $1-1/2 billion if they front load So, if you take--  We have our $700 million and we will get a part of the BIS--  We'll have a decision with no options  Correct me if I'm wrong, but if you made allowance for it, then wouldn't you have to categorize that borrowing by that big bank formally as emergency borrowing because the market would see a discrepancy between adjustment borrowing--  The Chicago Fed publishes its weekly borrowings  Only what takes place on Wednesdays?  You don't publish what takes place during the rest of the week?  They won't catch on so quickly?  Second  We wouldn't have any difficulty with the direction of your analysis, but we are assuming an essentially flat third quarter, not as strong as 1 percent We also are assuming a lower average federal funds rate in the fourth quarter You're assuming 10-1/2 percent; we're assuming 8-1/2 to 9 percent If we don't get something in that 8-1/2 to 9 percent region--if there is a significant back-up in rates in the fourth quarter--then we think the fourth quarter, instead of showing 2 to 3 percent real growth, may very well be negative So, I think the difference is possibly in the assumptions With your assumption [of the funds rate] at 10-1/2 percent, you still assume roughly 2 percent real growth in the fourth quarter, whereas our analysis would be that if rates back up to 10-1/2 percent, that is likely to result in a negative fourth quarter  Well, I think it's likely to be offset First of all, we have seen that we didn't get the increase in consumer spending that we all expected  That was partially because there was a higher increase in savings than we expected and partially because it was offset by greater weakness in the rest of the economy than we expected I personally feel that the more pessimistic scenario--in other words, continued weakness--is quite likely if there's a back-up in rates And even though there will be some modest increase in consumer spending, I don't think it will be enough Whereas if the average federal funds rate stays in the 8-1/2 to 9 percent area, I think we're likely to get the kind of real growth of 2 or 3 percent that we're talking about  Anecdotally, what I hear in New York is very pessimistic on capital spending Just last week a few businessmen told me they had made further cutbacks in their planned capital spending, and those plans had already been quite low  I'd like to make a straightforward comment; it's not very astute I think we ought to go for alternative A, with maybe a $300 million initial borrowing assumption instead of the $250 million And we ought to be quite sensitive to the fed funds rate in the next few months I don't think I have to go into my reasons why We're in a very delicate stage not simply because of financial fragility, but with regard to the question of whether there will be some recovery at all I think we ought to take advantage of your Humphrey-Hawkins testimony where you said we want to M1 growth to come in around the 5-1/2 percent [upper end of the range] and will even tolerate something over that under certain conditions Alternative A still puts M1 around the top of the range And even though I realize that, obviously, if the money supply bulges in the fourth quarter, we will then have less room than if we adopted  -18-    8/24/82  alternative B now, I still think the next couple of months are quite critical And maybe we'll be lucky on the money supply in the fourth quarter  The additional point I'd like to make, which I've touched on briefly, is that I'm really concerned about a lot of movement in the fed funds rate We don't want to see too much, if any, back-up Also, on the other side, it would be quite    8/24/82  damaging psychologically if we let the rate go too low and then had to be forced to see some back-up in the fourth quarter I don't know how to handle that All I'm saying is that we ought to be very sensitive this time  I don't know what I'm proposing I'm just saying that--  Emmett, alternative B gives you the back-up immediately  Well, then, would you go to $400 million on the initial borrowing?  But then what happens if you get a bulge in the money supply in the next couple of weeks and the Board feels inhibited about doing a discount rate cut?    8/24/82  Some people haven't--  The realistic range would be 7 to 10  And if we don't want to show that narrow a range--  We would have had a consultation  I think we have three choices We can say 7 to 10 percent; we can say 7 to 12 percent with an understanding that when the rate is outside 7 or 10 percent the Chairman will call a consultation; or we can take his language about unusual volatility  Well, if we choose [the wording] ""unusual volatility,"" we haven't any range Some of you are--  So you're leaving out the Manager for Domestic Operations?    8/24/82  In other words, the judgment is the Chairman's without any advice  Or maybe Bill Ford is talking about the substance also  If he thinks that the substance of 7 to 10 percent, roughly, is going to be a constraint, maybe he's concerned about the substance too I don't know  Much as it may surprise some of you, I also feel it would be a little disturbing to put in the phraseology ""unusual volatility"" We will get more stories, anyway, about our putting monetary policy on the back burner because of our concern about fragility And even though we are doing that, in a certain sense we are not; we are luckily enough consistent with our monetary policy [targets] at the moment It seems to me that it's more straightforward to say 7 to 10 percent with consultation The fact that we narrowed the fed funds range to 3 points during a particularly difficult period doesn't mean we're going to continue it at 3 points The following meeting we may go up to a 5-point range again  SPEAKER(?) Yes  I think what does the least damage in terms of market perception, if we're going to be honest about it, Mr Chairman, is the narrower range of 7 to 10 percent Otherwise, there will be a lot of speculation as to what ""unusual volatility in credit markets"" means and some further stimulation to the belief that we are putting monetary policy on the back burner Whereas if we say 7 to 10 percent, they will know that we just don't want too much movement in the period ahead  Yes, I know, but it's a way of putting it  The alternative, basically, would be Bill Ford's suggestion of 7 to 12 percent with a private understanding that it's really 7 to 10 percent And that has disadvantages, too  Borrowing is what--$300 million? "
2266,1982-09-24,SOLOMON, It may be of interest to you that I have had it said to me that people are hoping there will be a bank failure because then monetary policy [will operate in such a way that] they know that rates will come down further    9/24/82 
2290,1982-10-05,SOLOMON," I think the [Brazilian] problem is particularly sensitive with regard to their foreign exchange deposits [and whether their] backing by foreign banks will be resumed [as was the case for] the Argentine agencies In New York we have 17 Brazilian agencies and they have been having difficulty getting new deposits or getting people to leave in the foreign deposits We have a liquidity problem here because, like the Mexican agencies, most of that money was used to finance Brazilian borrowers, either public or private  Two of them are much larger than the others But this is part of the whole credit contraction going on in the foreign member bank markets between--  Gas has gone down  I have a question on the instrument the DIDC [plans to authorize] As I understand it, it seems that at a minimum what we're going to get out of the DIDC is an instrument that goes into M2 But it depends on how they word it If they put out two instruments, one of which is reserveable, then the one that is reserveable would be in M1 Is that correct?  Right; I understand that But if the DIDC words it fairly broadly, and we insist that because of the number of transactions exceeding the six--I gather it's three drafts or checks and three other forms of authorized transfers--then we could put a reserve requirement on it so that in both cases on anything over, let's say, $5,000, they would be paying market rates, except that one would be marginally lower than the other because of the reserve requirement It seems inevitable to me that the reserveable one would be in M1, in which case we might get a major bulge It's    10/5/82  unpredictable as always But the other one, which we're sure to get even if they word it narrowly, must be in M2 I don't see--  We would get two unknowns with enormous swings  Do you think the country would rally patriotically, if we made a public call that maturing all savers certificates should be reinvested in M2?    10/5/82  [The DIDC] clearly can't circumvent the intent of the Congress by putting a minimum value of $5,000 for checks  Just one last question on the DIDC instrument Based on your information, what kind of rate do you think the depository institutions will pay as the so-called market rate? Will they simply be competitive and vary it with the average money market fund rate or will they pay a Treasury bill-type rate? What do you think they will pay?  If there is any erosion of the banks' core deposits moving into these Super NOWs or whatever we call this new instrument, it's going to put a terrible squeeze on their profits  The European bankers look at this deregulation process going on in the United States and they react with horror In their view, this whole deregulation is such a disaster both for monetary policy and for the stability of the banking system that I think we are once and for all--through our experiment, if you want to call it that--making sure that no deregulation process is going to be copied in foreign countries  What kind of victory, a Pyrrhic victory?  $12 billion  I think the indirect effect on other industrialized countries' exchange rates and their ability to lower their interest rates, and the reversing if possible of the decline in the real volume of world trade that is going on, would probably have a bigger impact on the exports of, say, Mexico and Argentina and Brazil    10/5/82  than the direct reduction in the interest rate burden unless that lower interest rate prevails over six months or a year  Well, you're also assuming that we can have a stable level of recession in the world  The loss of US exports due to an uncompetitive exchange rate, as best as one can make rough estimates, has been estimated in work I've seen as the equivalent of 2 percent of our GNP in real terms I don't know what the staff here has  There was a major surge in the dollar yesterday To answer your question I don't think there's any willingness in this government to try to get the exchange rate value down in terms of levels Given Paul's talks with the Secretary [of the Treasury], there may be a tad greater willingness to be in the market on days when there are surges but not a [willingness to] sustain the effort, I don't think, to get the level down  I just came back from Europe I am struck by the degree of malaise and of nervousness there--fears of all kind--and the willingness of players to move enormous sums of money to Switzerland and the United States on gut instinct that things are just going wrong in Europe and that the future just doesn't look good for Europe And, of course, this was happening even in Japan where the statistics look better There is a lot of money going out of Japan And the exchange rate now is ridiculous; it's 270 yen for the dollar  Yes, that is pushing the money out [unintelligible] the world  All right  He didn't want to [unintelligible] I was shocked the other day when the head of one of the big insurance companies was in for lunch and said his company is giving wage increases that average about 10 percent  I did I gave him a much stronger lecture than probably was politic He apologized but gave me the argument that it's a catch-up because their workers' wages had fallen behind I don't know how true that is  Maybe the new form of a viable incomes policy Chuck, is to try to put constraints only on the [pay of] top executives  If you do that, they'll see that nobody else--  It's the first paragraph he's talking about  We don't get the new [unemployment] number until Friday  A change to reverse  I thought you were going to say 11  Less than 60 days?  I think the way to handle it is that it would be quite easy for the Chairman to say that we expect the rate of inflation to continue to decline next year and that over the long run we will be following an anti-inflationary policy I wouldn't say anything about the monetary aggregates next year but I'd say we expect the rate of inflation to decline even with a--  I think this is a rather momentous FOMC meeting I had thought that we had until maybe 1986 before the  -48-    10/5/82  pace of deregulation and innovation would bring us to this point But the Garn Bill and legislation that was [unintelligible] today--what's the name of that act?  It has moved us very quickly most of the way to the deregulation that we expected by 1986 I think we have a real dilemma here today On substance, I feel that we absolutely have to have some modest decline in rates I believe there is a real danger of a major cracking and then we would have to go even farther; whereas with a modest decline now that stays in place for a while there is a better chance of working ourselves out of this both internationally and at home I recognize that there will be a good deal of questioning, not only in monetarist circles but more generally I don't think there will be an avalanche of criticism, given our credibility, but there will be major questioning as to what this means in terms of longer-run anti-inflationary policy And it seems to me that there ought to be some words [to convey] our longer- run commitment and our expectations that inflation will continue to come down--and possibly they should be just in the Chairman's statements and other statements, not in the directive I don't know how to do it in the directive without sounding defensive, but there ought to be some words about that  So, I would support this I do feel that if one reads this carefully, we are really not targeting M2 We are targeting basically money market conditions and we are saying that we expect this will involve growth of M2 in the range of 8-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent Therefore, I'm not sure that we really need the last sentence The last sentence simply makes more explicit what is there quite carefully [unintelligible] I don't see that the way this is written, with the expectation of M2 growth of 8-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent, is a constraint on doing what is necessary to get the operative sentence And if I am correct in my interpretation, I don't see why we need that last sentence In that sense, I would agree with Chuck  Well, I wouldn't drop the operative sentence because then people don't know where we are  The presentation is critical And judging from past history, the presentation is probably going to be more dependent on the Chairman's statements than it will be on the directive, particularly given the [publication] lag and the fact that we are expecting such a large bulge in the first week of October and something has to be said Now, since the Chairman has a mind of his own, I would assume that if he gets a majority vote on the substance of this directive that it may not be worth spending a lot of time    10/5/82  interpreting and arguing about the more marginal sentences We are making a major substantive decision here And the presentation of that in a way that does not undermine our credibility is absolutely essential But we do have a lot going for us in terms of credibility on the longer-run anti-inflationary policy  Turning to the specifics, even with an initial borrowing assumption of $200 million, I don't think the funds rate would get down even to 9 percent unless this action is followed by a discount rate cut And I urge that, in the Board's infinite wisdom, that be confined to 1/2 point rather than a point It is my reading--and I could be wrong--that if the discount rate is cut 1/2 point, the markets will expect another half point later on, almost immediately If we do a full point, many people in the market may say that after the election there will be another full point This election thing is a damn shame because we are not being influenced by the election But the timing is very awkward for us Anyway, that's another area I would recommend that the initial borrowing be $200 million  If he took a weighted average, it would be $293 million!  But hopefully we wouldn't go so far that then we would turn it around three weeks later and rates would start back up  Well, remember, Paul said that he was going to expand what we call the boilerplate to make the worsening economic situation clearer and the--  Well, that's what I thought was going to be made clear earlier  We could say ""taking account of the desirability of somewhat reduced pressures in private credit markets and current economic conditions""  SPEAKER(?) It's both  Well, he likes the term ""consistent with""    10/5/82  Yes, I think there is something to be said for it in that it becomes a kind of quasi-target rather than simply expectations I don't think it puts any substance in here  Well--  Even though both sentences have a parallelism, the bottom line of both sentences is lower interest rates Right?  Well, okay But [conditions are] easier in terms of interest rates  That's the thrust of both sentences, given the fact that we are making--  The second sentence says we would tolerate more rapid growth, which means we would have lower interest rates than we would otherwise have  Okay The thrust of both sentences is for easier conditions in the markets, right?  Well, you are interpreting--  I'm talking relatively  I think we have to leave in something more or less like the last two sentences since we have now said ""consistent with M2""  Earlier, I didn't think it was necessary to leave in those sentences  It certainly seems a lot less important  Or lower  Following up on what Roger is implying, I think the chief advantage of having a sentence on the  -67-    10/5/82  range is that if--and I say if--the market reacts to this with great uncertainty, this gives some sense of reassurance that we are not thinking of simply an all-out drop I don't see that it's important otherwise; I don't think it's much of a guide But there is some advantage of having it in, if we get an unfortunate interpretation I don't think, though, that we'd want to have 7 to 10-1/2 percent; I think we'd want 7 to 10 percent I don't see what the problem is  That's right It has no substantive function whatsoever now, under this [approach] It's only a question of whether it reassures or limits somewhat the degree of uncertainty in some quarters  There may be some people in the market who, if they see interest rates declining, would wonder if we are going to let them decline, or push them down even, by a very large [amount]  Oh, why don't you take a show of hands? I don't think it's that important  With the half on the 10?  -69-    10/5/82 "
2316,1982-11-16,SOLOMON," Well, as for the recommendation [regarding the Mexican swap drawings], we don't have any alternative  I think it's worth making one comment Our current account deficit is beginning to mount up; by almost any estimate it probably will be at least $30 billion next year, but it might be as high as $50 billion At what point this will change market sentiment toward the dollar is unclear; that may require some other things happening as well But I would assume that we are beginning to see a little strengthening in the yen, and the Germans are beginning to see some strengthening [in the mark] against other currencies except the dollar So, there may be a change in this situation, although I don't expect it imminently  Another way of putting it is that the capital flows are swamping the equilibrium trade effect of an exchange rate There's nothing we can do about that  We will end up with an adjusted M1A, which will be called the monetary base  There is going to be a substantial decline in commercial construction next year, so even though lumber may be benefit, net, I'm not sure that the overall construction impact is going to be that significant  Even though unemployment levels don't track real GNP that quickly, the view on Wall Street--I would say the consensus view--is that unemployment will continue to rise I hear estimates of from 106 to close to 11 percent Some people say it will peak by the end of this year but others say it will peak in the first quarter of '83 We could have some plus--a tiny little plus--in real GNP and still get rising unemployment  But that wouldn't be perceived as recovery, I think  But, Bob, isn't the number of rigs in use up?  Consumer credit interest rates are not coming down very much I gather they are running 18 to 24 percent Many department stores are keeping their rates at 24 percent The argument is made that they had losses earlier when there were usury ceilings that they have to make up Some of the banks say it is longer-term money that they have to borrow in order to finance automobiles, for example Some of the upstate bankers in New York have said that their auto credit business has not picked up significantly But one banker told me that he has offered a 12 percent rate on the condition that the customer open an account or had an account in his bank And he said he is absolutely deluged with applications and that he did an enormous volume of financing of new auto sales at 12 percent Now, Karl Otto Pohl in Germany made a public plea to the banks to pass on reduced interest rates in the consumer credit area, and a few of the banks followed with a one percentage point reduction I don't know whether Chairman Volcker is thinking of making a comparable appeal  Yes, I think it would be a good idea  One last comment I'd like to make is that I met with a group of about fifteen business leaders, and those among them who have been doing well in the last two years--three or four of the fifteen--continue to do well Those who have been doing very poorly say they see the situation as absolutely flat; though it is not deteriorating further, they don't see any signs of recovery yet And I found it interesting that when I asked about salary and wage increases, all of them, including those who were doing well, talked about increases in a range from zero to 6 percent, with the exception of the New York financial community  The wage increases that the New York bank community expects to pay within the next 12 months were running 8 to 10 percent, but the increases expected in the industrial community ranged from zero to 6 percent    11/16/82  Are they counting the way they do it in Illinois?  I won't repeat the reasons that have been offered already on why I also share the view that interest rates should come down Summing up, I think there is only a 50-50 chance that we will get a recovery We need a little more margin there We need some further relief on the international scene So, the question is how to do it It seems to me that even if we reduce the borrowing to $250 million--and I can't see it going safely below $200 million or probably $250 million--the most we are going to get is less than a half-point drop from open market operations It is going to take a discount rate cut to move it a half point If it doesn't offend anybody's integrity, I would prefer to put a figure of 9-1/2 percent for M2 but have a $250 million borrowing assumption and use the funds rate range of ""A"" The funds rate range doesn't have the same relevance it did earlier because if we have the same kind of language in the directive that we had last time, there is a considerable flexibility for the Chairman and the Manager That's the combination I would prefer, but I could live with a straight ""A"" if others felt that it would be very inappropriate to have a 9-1/2 percent target for M2  Yes  What I'm assuming is that there would be a discount rate cut within a relatively short period of time If that happens, then whether we have 9-1/2 or 10 percent doesn't make that much difference Maybe it does by the end of the intermeeting period; I don't know Steve might want to comment on this Assuming we had a discount rate move in the next week or two, how significant would the difference be with an initial borrowing such as I talked about?  One thing that puzzles me in the market comments is that there is a very widespread view that even if rates come up again in the early part of 1983, they will trend downward during 1983 And yet these are the same people who believe there will be a modest recovery I'm not sure how they arrive at that view They have a feel for what everybody else is thinking in the market  And we are going to have the same amount of overrun this year as last year  But we don't want to go up to 10 percent either  But we don't want to go up to 10 percent either I don't think we're going to hit either of them  The way we're operating now, we are not going to hit either end of these ranges So it's partially psychological I would assume that if the economy stays this depressed and we saw the rate going up to the 10 percent area, the Chairman would either feel he had enough leeway to make an adjustment or he'd schedule a conference call  Well, I think what you're suggesting is okay I don't think the funds rate range makes much difference If we want to make the top side 10 percent, we could make it 7 to 10 percent or 6 to 10 percent It's strictly psychological; it has no operating significance at all  Carter bonds We made a lot of money that way!  They are going to match it point for point  Short-term rates now generally are working on the assumption of an 8-3/4 to 9 percent funds rate They did not align even with a slight upward movement As I understand it, at least from some of my banker friends, short-term rates are lower than would be indicated by a 9-1/2 percent fed funds rate  -43-    11/16/82  Or [the Board] could drop the discount rate a whole point I'm not recommending it; I'll be sending in a 1/2 point recommendation this week But there is just no more room in this nonborrowed reserve path There isn't any room to do much more than what we are doing If we go significantly below $250 million, that runs some serious risks that we could have a very screwy market situation We are better off with a move on the discount rate  Then we would really have a problem communicating that  The markets would love it  No, I'm not saying it will have much impact, but if you don't do it--if you wait too long--there will clearly be a backup in rates If we actually wanted to move the bond market and the stock market up--I'm not saying we should--then we'd have to consider a one-point move But I'm not recommending that I think, though, that you have to move 1/2 point  This is true Judgments can be made as we go along  A shade below the present discount rate  So, if [the Board] doesn't move the discount rate, it won't go down to 9 percent; it will stay at around 9-1/4 to 9-3/8 percent  That would be quite impressive, though, wouldn't it--having a component in M1 that doesn't have any reserve requirements?  The dash is left in  I don't want to nit-pick, but I don't see the point of deleting the words ""much less than usual weight,"" as suggested because the Fed watchers are going to wonder what that means They will wonder if that means we're giving it somewhat more emphasis now Why don't we just leave it alone the way it was?  Did Joe finish?  We should be guided, no matter how we feel individually, by the line that you are expressing Basically, in a polar case there are two choices Either we refer all calls to you or we make a best faith effort to state what the official line is, based on the way you interpreted it  Well, what about next time? Are you going to settle that now, or are you going to [wait]? "
2345,1982-12-20,SOLOMON," There is some movement in the Congress to try to modify those contracts because of the anomalous situation, isn't there?  Yes, I have a reasonable one The chains tell us that their sales are doing fairly well in the eastern region, with particular strength in apparel, cosmetics, and consumer electronics But they say that their sales in other parts of the country are not doing as well For some reason the East seems to be doing fairly well on retail sales  The head of one nationwide chain told me, and I found it very interesting, that the reason they were doing better than a lot of their competitors was that they had not pared inventories as much and, therefore, they had more stock for consumers to choose from  I have a question, Steve You have in your monthly pattern an extremely low growth figure for M2 for December, 4-1/2 percent That seems a little hard to believe, particularly since you are arguing that the [main] influence of the  -12-    12/20-21/82  inflows to the new accounts will be to expand M2 How do you get the 4-1/2 percent figure?  We have the nice range on velocity of circulation to use to reconcile  That's not the problem  You have a complete consensus on action if not on--  Well, although we all believe in controlling the money supply over the long run, some of us are placing importance on returning to targeting M1 as soon as possible--say, by the middle of next year--and some of us are more skeptical I don't think that creates a problem in the Humphrey-Hawkins testimony; it's perfectly finessible [We should say] that we will be watching it and learning from it what we can, notwithstanding distortions, and that if we see that it becomes free of distortions, it could be an appropriate target I think there's a widespread feeling of uneasiness among us about M2 and M3 as presently constituted They don't have a track record; we don't know what they tell us about nominal GNP One thing that bothers me is this Suppose next year or the year after we begin to see inflationary pressures develop and we have to start tightening If M2 and M3 were growing weakly and unemployment were over 10 percent, what is our reason for tightening? What do we offer? I feel that the fig leaf is pretty much tattered and that the mood of the Congress is pretty realistic The country knows what we are doing and, therefore, that we have an important effect on economic activity as well as inflation It seems that there ought to be a way of formulating our policy so that it meets the political realities and is a little more honest, and yet doesn't lock us into the bind that we all are familiar with Therefore, I would recommend for serious consideration that we say the following That we have certain expectations about where M2 and M3 will end up--and perhaps avoid the use of the word targeting; that those expectations would be importantly influenced by trends and levels of real economic activity and trends and levels of inflation; and that we would be drawing our reserve paths from M2 and M3 as we go along with the meetings But I'd be fairly honest about the fact that we're looking very heavily as well at other considerations that are less important, such as nominal GNP and the exchange rate Those would be the two important ones I would add to that, just as reassurance to the markets, that our long- term policy, notwithstanding any possible alternate later weakness in the Ms, would be to maintain positive real interest rates  SPEAKER(?) To do what, Tony?  -37-    12/20-21/82  To maintain positive real interest rates is our long-run policy I think it's important to reassure the markets There are various ways of formulating that We don't have to use the term real interest rates, if that's thought to be objectionable We can talk about the levels of prevailing interest rates in relation to inflation We don't have to get into the expectations area; we can take the [unintelligible] version of what people mean by that I would have no objection to substituting for bank credit, which is a very narrow debt measure--as an associated range, not as a target--total nonfinancial debt Again, I think that shows a certain amount of responsiveness and flexibility on our side and it is fairly realistic I don't see that it would do any damage It could be a monthly announcement but it probably would be a quarterly announcement if the staff and the Chairman felt that they didn't want to do that much estimating and wanted to wait for harder data  That's right; I'm aware of that They could, as Steve said, get it out with some heavy estimating in maybe three weeks after the end of the period But if we didn't want to do that, then it could be a quarterly announcement  There is one last comment I wanted to make and that is that a couple of people commented that they think we ought to do a shift adjustment of M2 Even though privately the staff will certainly be trying to analyze the movements of M2, I don't see the desirability of calculating a shift adjustment for announcement purposes I think it's much too dangerous And I don't think it gains us that much That's all  Does the law use the word ""targets"" or the words ""plans and expectations""?  I agree with you on large swings, but there is some disadvantage in being tied as closely as we are to the discount rate and not having any fluctuation of even, say, 50 basis points  Well, that's the way it seems to be working out  Well, if borrowing stays as low as it is, it leaves--  Well, the market thinks there has been a definite change in policy But I would say the majority of players think that what we have been doing is justified There is a technical disadvantage in being caught in a situation where the borrowing level is so low We don't want to tighten the nonborrowed reserve path because we don't want to see interest rates climb up and, therefore, in practice the only way interest rates move down is via a discount rate cut That's a more technical consideration and maybe it's only short term; I don't know But I don't think the market or other people are faulting us one way or another for pegging an interest rate I don't think that it has gotten to a point where they think we are pegging in a targeting sense If the fed funds rate doesn't move more than 20 basis points or so except with a discount rate cut and that continues over a period of many months, then I think there will be an increasing feeling in the market that we, in effect-- no matter what we say--are actually pegging in a targeting sense  One more, as Cagney says  But if we assume that our annual targets on M2 and M3--assuming some velocity of circulation we can defend--are compatible with the Administration's forecast of nominal GNP, which I think they are likely to be, we still would want to say that in setting quarterly targets for M2 and M3, we would be looking at the trends and levels of activity and trends and levels of prices I can't see how we could ignore that  But it seems to me that that is the answer to your question, isn't it?  They have come in with a plus for the revised third quarter?  How much time is there between our February meeting and [when] you testify? A week?  And Paul wouldn't testify until when?  Most of the market participants would have it somewhat higher than that At least the ones I've talked to would have it more in the 220 range  What do we do if the Mexicans come in and say We are so short of reserves or liquidity that we ask you to defer--not to take repayment and just roll over the loan for another three months or six months?  Let's say we're halfway between the scenarios The bank money is coming in slowly, though not for the full amount, and the IMF money is going ahead Do you still think there will be enough to pay us out and then we would put it back on standby?  The substantive difference is simply that we keep them on a tighter leash if we insist on getting paid out and then put it back on a standby basis and release it only in bits and pieces as we feel is justified I think that's the right approach  Some of it is contingent also on not triggering the 1 percent SEC disclosure requirement; some of it is contingent on not exceeding the legal limit; most of it is contingent, in theory at least, on everybody else putting up their share Certainly the IMF would accept $4-1/2 billion; whether they will accept significantly below $4-1/2 billion is the question  Well, isn't there a complication in the very unlikely event that we end up    12/20-21/82  Okay, but  Exactly  I don't think so   -63-    12/20-21/82  So, from that point of view it would be better for them to do the Argentina deal  I thought the  Are you saying it's already legally--  It's higher now  Will they have to warehouse with us in order to do some of this? Are they sufficiently liquid to do all these transactions?  Okay, but the Treasury also is considering a $300 million swap with Mexico and a $500 million oil advance  That would affect the liquidity of the ESF  If the technical consideration of  is not significant--if it's purely doable but a greater technical complication for us to do the Argentine thing--then from a more substantive point of view, rather than increase the Mexican exposure, we might very well take a substantial share of the Argentine commitment  Right But it's an Article VIII country  Bill, you were making some remarks yesterday afternoon that this assistance to Mexico and Brazil, etc is all part of an inflationary danger I don't see that It seems to me that the bottom line in those countries is that they are going to have to have much tighter fiscal and monetary policies as a result of the IMF adjustment programs And there's the fact that they are going to get a much smaller amount of new money than they got last year and the year before, and so forth I don't quite see why you conclude that we are adding to inflationary pressures with this assistance  I don't think that is what is happening We are getting some contraction in the interbank credit market globally  There are a couple of newspaper reporters who have taken that line Sydney Marks--do you know him?-- did in a column recently He is not in one of the major newspapers But I have not heard the view expressed in the markets in any widespread way at all that we are encouraging irresponsible behavior by our approach to this regulatory problem  That's true for domestic corporations If a bank came up with new money for a domestic corporation so it doesn't fall into arrears, that's still considered a performing asset  Okay These aren't concessional either  Bill, it's true that it hasn't been as explicit in a certain sense because the need wasn't as much earlier They used to talk in terms of a cap on foreign borrowing; and even though it's still a cap, now there's a problem of a floor as well Formally, it's nothing new; but I think the [unintelligible] concern as to the financing is greater funding--  This is a cheaper way of doing it If everything goes to hell then the amounts of both public assistance and losses to the banking system are going to be [huge] I can't conceive that the United States would not step in ultimately and do what was necessary to restore order in Mexico to tame the chaotic situation But the problem may be that political events in a chaotic situation would take over and we might be confronted with a--  Putting the shift issue aside for the moment, how much of a negative growth in velocity of circulation are  -77-    12/20-21/82  you assuming for the first quarter? What is your figure for nominal GNP growth for the first quarter?  How do you break down that nominal GNP figure in the first quarter? How much is inflation and how much is real?  I agree I think alternative two is clearly preferable It would seem to me that we're still allowing not only for a one percent shift but also for one to two points negative velocity [growth] if we accept that 9-1/2 percent figure We could say 9 to 10 percent or we could put in 9-1/2 percent like we did last time But the initial borrowing assumption ought to be $175 to $200 million because I think we would like to see the markets ease a little on their own and not be pushed down so obviously and aggressively by a cut in the discount rate If [the Board] does end up cutting the discount rate, we again would appear to be following the markets somewhat more So I would think we can leave the fed funds range where it is, at 6 to 10 percent  8 percent  M2 would be 9-1/2 percent, assuming we're going the alternative two route  I don't know what the adjectives should be, but alternative two would read--  No, wait a second The actual language of alternative two reads ""The Committee indicated that greater growth would be acceptable if there is evidence of substantial shifts of funds into broader aggregates because of the new money market account""  Right  Oh, I see Yes, I think that would be a help  Also, the reason why we would want 9-1/2 percent without shifts is because we don't think velocity [growth] in the first quarter is going to go back to zero, which is an historic norm  I'm talking about 9-1/2 percent and that we would tolerate a modest amount of growth beyond that if there were evidence of substantial shifts  Yes, but that's 3 percent at an annual rate  The 8-1/2 percent then permits a negative velocity [growth] of 2  Well, I was not very clear about that By suggesting that 9 to 10 percent or 9-1/2 percent, I was fuzzing together the negative velocity [growth] and the minimal shift; and then if there were a substantial shift, M2 growth would be above that  It's awfully dangerous to be that explicit on the estimate of the shift  I think we might even be justified in calling it a minimal shifting  From market instruments and large CDs  Right, it should be limited to M2  That's down from about $230 million To get some perspective on what that means, I'm told that a 1 percent difference in the target for M2 would mean over a period of one month a difference of $34 million dollars in reserves Therefore, if we are moving the borrowing from, say, $230 million to a shade under $200 million, it's the equivalent of having a 1 percentage point higher M2 target for one month So, I would say that at the maximum we ought to set it at $200 million but we might go as low as $175 million  Well, it would be somewhat under 8-1/2 percent; how much under, Peter can make a better guess than I  If M2 and M3 growth are as weak in December as Steve is projecting, then I don't think this will be perceived as an aggressive push  What would bother me in terms of the markets--and I think [the likelihood] is not great--would be if the growth doesn't come in that weak so we do get some natural decline in the fed fund rates If the fed funds rate stays around 8-1/2 percent and then the Board simply aggressively cuts the discount rate 1/2 point without there having been any softening in the fed funds market, that would give a very strong impression of aggressiveness That has both positive and negative aspects to it but I think more negative If we go somewhere along these lines, what we're saying is that unless the weakness develops in M2 and M3 in December, the fed funds rate will tend to stay more or less where it is  That's what we're saying if we adopt this set of numbers If there is weakness, then the fed funds rate will probably go lower and the Board may or may not choose to ratify that with a discount rate cut  What happens, Steve, if M2 and M3 come in so weak and the demand for reserves is so low that there is virtually no borrowing and we start getting an indeterminate fed funds rate? What will we do at that point?  SPEAKER(?) That's exactly the--  I don't think that should stop us from going down now to the $175 to $200 million area  Steve is talking about 4 percent growth in December and it's possible, though not too likely  The banks are cutting back very strongly on large CDs, Roger, as they get money in the money market accounts, particularly since credit demands are weak That's a very substantial cutback we are beginning to see  Well, I have a preference--since the amount of shifting to M3 is going to be small--not to have our hands tied by having to have evidence that the shift is occurring in M3 as well It would seem to me that there's some advantage in having even that sentence refer to M2  It sounded to me as if--  We have so many qualifications  Yes, I'm in favor of taking it out  $1875 million!  What does this sentence achieve particularly, Steve? It just shows that we were talking here privately but haven't talked any more about the long-term ranges?  I agree it does  We could delete the whole sentence in this earlier form or in its new form I don't know what it adds "
2375,1983-01-21,SOLOMON," Yes, I think it's okay, but I'd be interested in hearing why Steve feels it's a good idea for us to come up with six ranges--three fourth quarter-over-fourth quarter ranges and three year-over-year ranges--when we're probably going to be wrong on all six "
2401,1983-02-08,SOLOMON," On the real economy, if you remember your chart, although you have a rise in productivity in '83 you have a drop in productivity in '84, right?  That's right  The reason it strikes me as low is simply based on conversations with many industrialists who have said basically the opposite They expect relatively strong productivity gains both in '83 and in '84 because they're assuming that the recovery in '83 will not be that rapid and that the expansion will continue well into '84 And they expect to see continued productivity gains in '84 as well as in '83 at about the same rate  Assuming we have 3-1/2 percent growth in '83 and 4 percent in '84, do you have an estimate as to where we end up on utilization of capacity at the end of '84?  Businessmen 9 months ago were not as cautiously optimistic as they are today  But even if you keep an M1 target, Chuck, you would deemphasize it and say that--  --basically the reserve path is drawn on the basis of derived M2  Well, I don't think there's a need to go around the table We went over this in great detail  Okay I don't think that there's any alternative to having some kind of broad targetry There's nothing to put in its place that's acceptable to the Committee, as we know from earlier discussions Now, if you don't want to get specific, then I have to stop there  In addition to targeting M2 and M3, I have a slight preference for continuing to target Ml but I'd make it clear that we are continuing the present policy of deemphasizing it If we do not say that, we are going to return to a situation where the markets are mesmerized by the Friday numbers and we're going to have a lot of volatility again and we're going to feel much more handcuffed I think we do have the need for the kind of flexibility that we have demonstrated in the last few months, so I could live either with dropping M1 or leaving it in We can leave it in but I think it's essential to make clear that it is going to be deemphasized and that basically there's no perception that we're making a significant shift from the present conduct of monetary policy back to a stricter monetary targeting  Yes  Well, we all know what we're doing The net effect of our monetary policy is still restrictive and the majority of the market perceives it as such because they look at the level of real interest rates  You mean in the first quarter?  The markets are so conscious of this $200 odd billion that has moved that I think they would be surprised if we were to base [the target] on the fourth quarter and incorporate this massive redistribution I think it would be very understandable that we would take the February-March base Oh, I'm sorry  At least I have the clear impression that they would be surprised They would know the imprecision of our shift adjustment estimates We'd have to say so quite honestly And I think they would understand, given this massive movement that's going on, why we would take a February-March base It's not so much that the size of the numbers bothers me, although I think there are people who don't understand and who will be shocked by the numbers, but I think the market would feel [a February-March base] is a little more accurate way of doing it  We hit that problem--  Either way we'll have--  Well, I'm not sure about that, Nancy We have such an overwhelming case on the distortion in M2 in terms of the numbers one can point to whereas we have a much more modest reason for shifting the base on Ml and M3 I think one could make an argument either way My preference would be to show that we are maintaining continuity where we can maintain it--where the distortion is not too great So, I would have some preference for the asymmetrical treatment of the base, which I think just the sheer magnitude of the numbers would justify  The other thing is that as the media report on our progress or performance during the year they always compare what the rate of growth is compared to what our target was But they don't go into the technicalities of what the base was  I don't know You get a somewhat better reading from the media on performance as the year develops  Yes, but if we deemphasize it, then it's not going to--  Steve, you're assuming for M2 a velocity of circulation of roughly zero in '83?  And for M1 on your alternative II here you're assuming a velocity of circulation very slightly negative  Okay  I have a question of Steve I had the impression, Steve, that when you shift the base to February-March from the usual average of the fourth quarter, that 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent is tighter than 9 to 13 percent Am I correct?  Yes    2/8-9/83  The second question I have is If we want flexibility, shouldn't we aim for a four-point spread in M2 this year instead of 3 points?  Even though you eliminated January from the base there are still a lot of uncertainties  I'm a little worried that 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent may be a little tight I certainly would oppose rounding it off downward  A range of 7 to 11 percent doesn't sound good It sounds like we're really gambling!  Even though I like the four-point spread, I'd like it on the up side    2/8-9/83  It probably is  I don't think it's worth cutting it a half point    2/8-9/83  If, as we agreed yesterday, they strive for a larger market share and are more aggressive intermediaries, [M3] could easily come in higher I don't see the point of cutting a half point on the up side  When we shave off a half point like that, we imply a level of precision in our thinking that seems to me inconsistent with all the uncertainty we keep talking about I would just stick with the provisional target we set up  I hate to say it but it seems to me that all it does, even with 4 to 8 percent, is move us slightly away from the upper end of the range without even allowing for the growth of Super NOWs later in the year, etc In the course of conversations with some key market people, in general I've noticed that they give the advice that according to the market it's much better to project higher targets and hit them during the course of the year than it is to worry about the initial effect of the higher targets That is just the general advice I heard from one of the key people in the markets So, even though we will have deemphasizing language, I assume, I'm not sure that 4 to 8 percent does anything more than move us slightly to a more realistic range And it still doesn't allow for any Super NOW growth    2/8-9/83  It can influence one's decision    2/8-9/83  Let's say that we had a very difficult decision to make This is just one more straw on one side or the other--whether it's running tight or running easy--that we would look at To some degree we also are influenced by the exchange rate and by a lot of other things I think it would have some influence  Frank, the fellow who has been pushing this is Ben Friedman I don't remember when I talked to him what his numbers were Have you had a conversation with him?  I have an instinct that not very many market people would be familiar with this and spend a lot time analyzing whether this is easy or tight with the exception possibly of Henry Kaufman and Ben Friedman I'm sure Ben will be commenting on it I was just wondering  I thought of that, but it seems to me that implies some precision I wonder if it's wise to make that--  Maybe we should just stop with what we had already set up before  I would like to make one suggestion I don't feel that strongly about it, but I'd like to point out that there is an advantage in addition to this associated [debt] target of leaving in our traditional associated bank credit target for two reasons One is that we always hit it for some strange reason, and that's very nice to have happen [Laughter] The other one is that there are a lot of people in the markets who aren't going to understand [the debt aggregate] If they do, it's very--  And it seems to me that there would be some sense of continuity If people see that same bank credit target of 6 to 9 percent or whatever it is that we've had every year-- and we always hit it rain or shine--they're going to tend without doing any independent analysis, which will be limited to a very few people, to feel reassured about the higher numbers on this broad credit measure because they'll assume it's consistent  It's still within 6 to 9 percent; it's still the same thing  Maybe we wouldn't hit it that way  ""For monitoring Ml""  Maybe ""assume no unusual""  What will you answer if some member of the [Congressional] Committee said Does that mean then that in the DIDC you are going to oppose the extension to corporations?  You would agree, though, that by definition if we went back to that situation of giving it that much emphasis, we would then have more confidence that velocity was telling us something  So, therefore, one would handle it the way Lyle Gramley suggested that if that situation does arise, then it's perfectly consistent with this Right?  I don't think it helps any, but if you want to get your point in, instead of saying some weight we could say ""with the degree of weight placed on that aggregate over time being dependent on"" Is that all right?  The [appropriate] range of growth is going to depend on what velocity is  It's a real danger Oh, they love those numbers, that action!  Yes, if we return to the kind of weekly volatility that we had before, it would seriously impede the recovery And I don't think it adds anything to our anti-inflationary posture to have that kind of weekly volatility  We have a clear split here between those who want to imply a stronger possibility of a return both to an emphasis on Ml and a greater degree of automaticity and others who simply want to be neutral about keeping the options open I guess that's what the argument is about I tend to agree with the second view And I had thought that was the thrust of the consensus view  -76-    2/8-9/83  generally--that we don't want to imply to the market that we are being extremely sensitive and that there is a near-term probability I do want to be neutral on Ml The big question in the market is How long is the Fed going to continue its current approach to monetary policy as opposed to at what point do they [return] to some more automatic emphasis on Ml? It seems to me that in the face of that, we ought to be carefully neutral  I would hope it would not be in  I happen to agree, as I said earlier I just think that the market is extremely sensitive to the question of whether we are leaning back toward Ml again  We can say ""carefully,"" though  It's nice and straightforward  I think we ought to leave in what is bracketed  We are doing that  Basically, thinking back to the amendment we adopted at the last conference call, we talked about seeking to maintain existing reserve conditions and not increasing the restraint That comes closest to what we are really doing, assuming that we continue with the $200 million borrowing assumption If it were our judgment that we wanted to press toward some more easing, we should adopt something lower, say, $100 or $150 million If we want to defer that easing, okay, we can defer it But it seems to me that the operation is best summed up either in the first sentence of the paragraph the way it is now or we could go back to the language adopted in the amendment in the last conference call  I have a very mixed feeling about the numbers I realize that we really can't drop the number for M2 and leave one in for Ml and M3 without confusing people; they'll think we are paying more attention to M1 and M3 than we are So, I suppose we really either have to drop them all or leave them in But we have to make clear that they will not govern and won't override what is basically an intention to continue with the existing degree of restraint or, if the aggregates slow down sufficiently, to ease So, even though I realize that the word ""contemplated"" that has been put in achieves in a certain sense what I'm talking about, I'm not sure that ""contemplated"" is quite the right verb Perhaps ""were expected"" or [unintelligible] ""experienced""?  Well, M2 is bound to be slower  [Unintelligible] flows, yes  I would opt for the second sentence in addition to the first I think it makes our intention clear And then we leave open the degree of appreciable slowing and how we interpret that  Or leave open the possibility  Then the implication, Roger, is that you wouldn't put in numbers  I wouldn't go quite as far as Roger, myself But what we might do is to say that lesser restraint would be appropriate if justified by monetary, credit, and other conditions  I don't think we have to be that explicitly honest All we're trying to do is not lock ourselves in or not close the door to the possibility that we might want to cut rates in some way or other even if the monetary aggregates were not appreciably slowing  The only thing I disagree with here is that I think we can't make too sharp a break If we get too explicit in disregarding the monetary aggregates, I think it's going to cause adverse market reactions  And, therefore, I think we ought to be a little more generalized in our language  Well, we may find that the slowing is only in M2  We may very well find the slowing is not in all the aggregates  Might  The only other way of doing it is something like I suggested earlier that some easing might be acceptable or appropriate in the light of monetary, credit, and economic conditions So, we would be leaving open what will trigger that and yet we would not be ignoring the monetary aggregates    2/8-9/83  Which is more or less--substantial or appreciable?  Again, why can't we cover the same stuff in more general terms by saying ""if monetary, credit, or economic conditions so justified""  That's true also of these other formulations with liquidity or the weakness in the economy, etc If there is a consensus for that, all I'm saying is that it ought to be worded more generally I don't like the phrase ""weakness in the economy""  I'm not sure, if I may say so, that we're really achieving what Roger intended at all  -91-    2/8-9/83  Even with the five who have expressed some support for these other conditions-- I'm going to retract my view on this The more I think about it, we can always have another meeting if there is a problem, and if we go further than saying that there will be less restraint if the monetary aggregates slow down appreciably, then without achieving very much on the other side we may be inviting some risk of a market reaction  I think I'll reverse my vote  We're expecting a minimum growth of around 15 percent in M2  Yes, but it doesn't make sense with M2, which is the key aggregate we're looking at And even the 15 percent may turn out to be an underestimate in view of the way February [seems to have] started off  We don't want to spell out a target for M3 That would be pretty--  If I were reading that literally--  Yes, but some people when they see our long-term targets would read that as meaning that unless M2 gets all the way down to 7 to 10 percent or something like that, we're not going to be easing  Yes, we'd have to say that  Do you want to add at the end of the first sentence ""slowing from their recent pace""?  But some people might not understand what ""slowing in the aggregates"" means  Oh, I see It's hard to move it  down, I think It's about 8-1/2 percent If we made it 6 to 9 percent, it shows that we [unintelligible] problems or we could have 7 to 9 percent in an attempt to show that It's consistent with the first sentence to move it down to 6 to 9 percent  I don't care whether we leave it alone  Second  So moved  In the view of the key people who are negotiating all this, of the four remaining substantive areas being negotiated there is only one really difficult one And that is the question of what foreign exchange assurances the central bank will give in regard to the ultimate repayment of what will be the rescheduled private debt, [unintelligible] debt The other three are resolvable I was surprised to find that the people who are running this operation feel that the $48 billion in commitments they have are solid even if there were, let's say, further erosion in oil prices Even if there were further concerns, they seem to think that they can depend on that In the meantime, they have agreed to try to speed up their discussions as much as possible But the Mexicans also share some of the blame in not getting the rate [unintelligible] up there regarding this foreign exchange position  I think that their formal posture has to be that they're going to continue pursuing this until they get full pari passu $5 billion But I agree with Paul that there may be ways of handling this so that we can still go ahead and still appear to have gotten the full $5 billion while we're still striving to get it We're probably not going to get very much more money but I think the leading banks would probably help make up a part of that $200 million debt So, there are different ways of handling it "
2429,1983-03-28,SOLOMON," And the amounts [allowable] within intermeeting periods unless the Foreign Currency Subcommittee moves on something urgent  But normally the Subcommittee doesn't    3/28-29/83  act unless there's a time bind, and even then I think a proposed change is frequently referred to the whole Committee  Anyway, [despite] what Ted said, Chuck is exactly right You don't have to worry about it  I don't think it makes sense to be buying dollars at a time when we're all worried about there being such a strong appreciation of the dollar, Chuck I think that was the only reason  I'd certainly like to argue in favor of it I see no reason for discontinuing it; it's an important help to the liquidity of the ESF The Treasury would have had some very serious problems from time to time if it had been operating without the warehousing fallback  I would move that it be extended for another year  The Treasury bears the foreign exchange risk  If there were an unexpected cash problem in the Treasury, then in practice that night we would honor overdrafts, I gather But they would be expected then to do a cash management bill and get the cash in before close of business the next night?    3/28-29/83  Okay, if they can't--  Steve, but what happens if we honor the overdraft and the next morning they issue a cash management bill but they can't settle it until the next day? Are we permitted under the lawyer's ruling to give an overdraft the second night?  I'm for retaining it for the time being but it's not clear to me, aside from waiting until there's much more confidence in the banking system, [when and how to get out] If you were requested, Peter, to figure out a scenario to get out of this within a year, what kind of strategy and what kind of rationale would you adopt, assuming you knew you had a very healthy period of time in which to work your way out of it?  -11-    3/28-29/83  What explanation would you give--that the market had developed enough that it didn't need this?  If we gave a substantial delay--I don't mean a time limit of one month but, let's say, 6 or 9 or 12 months--do you think there would also be some market feeling that we were leery of this stuff?  Even with such a long time?  It still doesn't make any sense to me to take the marks that we get as interest and turn around and sell them Therefore, I don't see why it's relevant to his proposal, which is to raise the limit in order to accommodate the interest that we'll be getting in marks  All right And I'm saying that we ought to raise the limit because it doesn't make any sense to sell them  Excepting dollars  There has been no change Aside from repaying the Carter bonds, there has been no change, virtually, in the combined Treasury and Federal Reserve holdings of foreign currencies since the new Administration came in  We've seen signs of flexibility but haven't seen the flexibility  I don't know what that means, Paul Today for example, the deutschemark started at 242, didn't it, Sam? And now it's down to what--about 239?  I mean up to 239  Under what circumstances would you encourage the foreign exchange Desk, Mr Chairman, to make to you and the Treasury a recommendation that intervention seems appropriate to us? Earlier we made that recommendation a few times when there had been a very substantial weakening in a key foreign currency and the Treasury would then say Well, let's wait a while and watch And so the opportunity would be missed [Their] reaction might have been that if there's a further weakening, yes, we'll do something But by then there had already been a 1 percent or a 1/2 percent move and then there wasn't any further weakening  But it would seem to me that we could have a prior understanding and a presumption that, if it were to move more than, say, 1/2 point in 3 hours or more than a point in 4 or 5 hours or overnight, we wouldn't wait for a further significant weakening--that only a few basis points move after that would be sufficient to trigger it  I move that we increase the limit on the deutschemark but not on the yen Are you ready for a motion?  [If you are] testing the tone of the Committee's thinking, obviously, I would be in favor of raising it But I didn't think that $250 million had very much meaning There is a real need to move on the deutschemark because we're getting near the limit with the interest earnings  There have been times when the Fed has intervened without the Treasury, but it has been more common--  What you're saying is that you'd prefer a full-dress debate on this one  We had a full-dress debate on this in 1980 and we continued the policies that we had been following jointly --the Treasury and the Fed--in terms of trying to slow the appreciation of the dollar And we got up to $8 or $9 billion in foreign currency holdings by the time the current Administration came in and [intervention] was brought to an abrupt halt Even though there had been some incidental comments on that at various meetings, I guess we haven't had a full-dress discussion In deference to Chuck's view, why not schedule one for the next meeting? That will be after Williamsburg; it will be after your G-Five Ministers of Finance meeting, Paul  It will be after that That would be a logical time, then, to have a discussion here In the meantime, we can just move on the deutschemark limit  I have a premature question If the fed funds rate continues at around 8-3/4 percent, am I correct in assuming that it's rather unlikely that the prime rate would move up but that if it were to go to 9 percent the prime is likely to move?  What assumptions with regard to the trade deficit and the current account deficit underlie your projection?  That's the current account  Both?  The only way that you factor the extent of recovery abroad into your domestic projection is through the trade account?  Well, I'm not sure myself I was just wondering  What is your staff projecting in regard to inflation?  I think that a strong case can be made for continuing with a money market directive for the time being I'm not sure but that it'd be premature to return to targeting even M2 and M3 in the short run of the intermeeting period With a money market directive we could implement an extremely modest tightening, which I think would be indicated under the situation for reasons Emmett talked about; I doubt that we would respond in a mechanistic way to the short-run targets So, therefore, we could achieve the same substantive effect anyway with a money market directive I'm not saying that there won't be a point when we would want to return to targeting the aggregates, but at the moment I have an instinct, and I think that's all I can actually call it, that a strong case could be made that it's somewhat premature to do so It could put us back in that situation we were in earlier I'm a little concerned about the market impression of our going in that direction Paul made one casual remark in one sentence in answering a question about Ml growth, namely that it was looking strong, and the market very strongly overreacted and people were looking at Ml for quite a few weeks If they see us now moving back to monetary aggregates targeting, then I think they might draw more conclusions from that than would be justified I don't think that they would recognize the heavy degree of judgmental decision components that I assume will go into our policy moves Even though it may make some sense to target M2 and M3 --although I think M3 would be more reliable for the next period and we might consider just targeting M3 for this short period while we're still seeing the substantial movement of funds going on--I still think a case can be made for a money market directive being continued  We didn't target them at the last meeting in terms of the short-run targeting  Have we ever gotten down how much currency is going to Latin American countries?  Chuck was saying stay with the existing language  Isn't there some basis for reconciling the two different reactions in terms of the fact that Kaufman was talking about a very substantial move in short-term rates whereas the earlier impression in the market was that it was just what they called a snugging up--20 to 30 basis points? I think that may account for part of the difference in the reaction in the long end of the markets  Which alternative would that put you on, ""B plus""?  Which one would give you 7 percent?  Nancy, the $250 million borrowing assumption is more likely to result in the present 8-3/4 percent [funds rate] than 8-1/2 percent  The only plausible explanation I've heard for the high level of excess reserves is that some banks are being slow to adjust their planning and their operations to take account of the fact that some of their funds, such as the MMDAs, moved to their reserve free situation And then there have been other changes in reserve requirements Some banks are slower than others If that's true, then over a period of time we ought to see a trending downward of this tendency toward large excess reserves  But I think if you go--  Maybe you ought to have a show of hands on alternative I versus alternative II because I think alternative I avoids certain of these problems  Alternative I  Were you going to say ""expecting it would be consistent with the long-range targets""?  Why don't we say ""The Committee makes a guess""  Or we can say ""a further appreciable""  More pronounced than projected  Instead of saying ""appreciable slowing"" why not take the ""more pronounced slowing""?  Very common sense  The more we put in, the more likely we'll be wrong That's why I don't like short-term targets there associated with operations We're more likely--    3/28-29/83  Basically you're scrapping the [notion of] unusual demands for liquidity, which gives us complete flexibility on anything That comes with every possible situation  But in reality I think it is fair to say that the fed funds rate gives us a bit of a clue as to whether our guesses on the reserve situation are erring in one direction or the other It's one sign of how tight the situation is  I think $250 million is a reasonable compromise "
2444,1983-04-29,SOLOMON," Paul, this is Tony It seems to me that the current situation reflects the clause in the last FOMC directive that lesser restraint would be acceptable in the context of more pronounced slowing of growth in the monetary aggregates, etc And I think we ought to give serious consideration to a cut in the borrowing level assumption In theory, a cut of $100 million from $250 to $150 million would give us about a 25 basis point reduction on average in the fed funds rate On top of that there probably would be some psychological effect and we might get a drop over a period of time down to as low as the 8 to 8-1/4 percent area It seems to me that there's some advantage in doing that because all the arguments, including both the international side and the high level of real interest rates, are on one side with this very major slowing It also seems to me that we would want to see that development first before considering a discount rate cut And next week there are three days of Treasury refunding, so that it would be very hard to do a discount rate cut in the middle of that or the day after Any discount rate cut probably would come in the early part of the following week, so we would have about a 10-day period before we could give that really serious consideration and in which we could have a working out of this reduction in the borrowing level We ought to have some discussion and serious consideration of doing this  Even if May showed a rebound of the magnitude that I understand is being considered, growth would still average out for April and May at only 5 percent  But you would agree, Steve, that the average of April and May would still represent a significant slowing compared to the growth rates we've been seeing all this year And given the facts--and I'm thinking particularly of the international side as well as the solidifying of the recovery here and the slowing of the inflation rate--there would seem to be a lot of good reasons for some modest reduction If we wait until we see May data, we're talking about waiting maybe five to six weeks--    4/29/83  --before we have a clear idea And we may be losing an important period of time  You're going to be testifying before the Banking Committees of both houses? Does this mean that the paragraphs in the budget resolution are stalled temporarily or what? "
2466,1983-05-24,SOLOMON," I think part of the better Mexican performance is due to the enormous disorganization The agencies have not been spending the money In the second half of the year [Finance Minister] Silva Herzog is expecting that they're going to be under more pressure and it's going to be much harder for them to hit the Fund targets on the public [sector and public expenditures]  My question has been taken care of by Roger I just have a lot of skepticism about that projected decline in the dollar, if one assumes interest rates stay in this range, given the enormous interests on the part of foreigners in our securities markets and less confidence in European securities A lot of the European bankers we spoke with talked in terms of a very high percentage of their portfolios staying in US securities Combined with the interest rate spread outlook and the safety haven aspects, we may very well see next year the same kind of disappointment with regard to the dollar value that we expected in the last year The bulk of the market had expected a decline in the dollar in the last 12 months and it didn't materialize Nobody can say for certain; it's just that I personally have some skepticism that we should count on any decline with any degree of certainty  Not very much, because central banks have not been adding to their holdings And [private] foreigners don't tend to hold a very large portion of US Treasuries  Yes, putting it all together, there was some reduction in some of the central accounts Some of the OPEC countries have a big reduction Of course, in France's holding, that famous surplus, it is not very clear where it is anyway As I think Chairman Volcker said last week, our biggest trading partner is ""errors and omissions""  I might make a general comment that some of you will not agree with, I'm sure I think that one of the most disruptive forces in this whole question of a world recovery is the strength of the dollar The LDCs are paying their interest on dollar-denominated debt in dollar interest rates while they earn in weaker currencies It adds to their problem For commodity prices, including oil, it's the same kind of situation And I think it will continue to be a drag on our economy in terms of exports It's certainly a drag on the other industrialized countries We tend to be very asymmetrical in our view of monetary policy with regard to the exchange rate We are perfectly willing to tighten monetary policy when the exchange rate is down to a point that concerns us and disturbs us But for some reason, we have what I would perceive as a large measure of indifference to using monetary policy to restrain what is clearly a very damaging rise in the level of the exchange rate This is a view, of course, that is common abroad And I find probably a greater gulf in intellectual thinking between the foreigners and ourselves in this area than in almost any other area  Well, I think there's a good deal in what Preston says We are not expecting, even without a financial shock in the international area, boom conditions Certainly the second quarter growth may run as much as 5 percent or more, but we still would look for something more in the neighborhood of 4-1/2 percent growth over this year and well into the next year under the best of circumstances Even though we're not getting into monetary policy discussions now, I want to take issue with what Bob Black said I don't see that the money supply has increased that much M2 and M3 are either in their cones or a little below The credit aggregates, both narrow and broad, are in their target areas The fact that M1 is behaving in the screwy way that we all expected and that there seems to be a permanent shift toward holding a large savings component in Ml balances in NOWs and Super NOWs should not [lead us to] generalize that there has been that big an increase in the money supply I had the feeling that for good and rational and sufficient reasons we deemphasized Ml And now our psychology and our thinking as well as that of the markets seems to be creeping back to a situation where everybody is paying attention to Ml and these weekly numbers I would just take exception to the generalization that, in terms of a stimulus to the economy, the money supply has increased that much  Do you have a guess as to why?  -19-    5/24/83  But there has been a substantial amount of intervention by central banks  The Germans, EMS countries And that does tend, depending on how they--usually they don't sterilize-- [unintelligible]  There's more anxiety  -20-    5/24/83  Steve, isn't the interest return on M1-type accounts in most European countries still very low?  They haven't changed the way we have  I would keep the borrowing level at $250 million, for what it is worth It isn't worth very much, obviously I would use the M2 and M3 targets under alternative A; in fact, if I had my druthers, I would round them on the up side and make them 8 and 7 percent We have a strange situation where we are running short of our March-to-June targets by about 2 points and we have not been offered an alternative that comes closer to returning to the original targets For March to June we had put M2 and M3 at 9 and 8 percent, [respectively]  I can't [bring] myself to pay that much attention to M1, as I believe some of you do, when I contrast that monetary aggregate, whose meaning we all seem to agree we don't understand these days, with the reality of the international situation that we're living with I think it's just sheer irresponsibility on our part [to use] crystal ball wizardry to have our decision influenced so significantly by what is happening to this famous Ml I  -26-    5/24/83  come out quite clearly for no tightening, no snugging up, and staying where we are in terms of borrowing levels I do not see any evidence yet that a boom is going to materialize where we would have to say Well, it's a question either of tightening now or tightening three or six months from now I don't see that the choice is between them  I think there's going to be a strong market reaction if the fed funds rate gets to 9 percent The prime rate would definitely go up There will be loud cries from abroad  Even though the numbers are small, we should not ignore the fact that there will be significant reaction, I think, in the dollar exchange market There may or may not be some reaction in the bond or stock markets; I don't know about those One can't be 100 percent certain, but the probabilities are that the prime rate would go up if the funds rate is moved up as much as half a point, and it just seems to me that we're going much too far  We're going to be perceived as going against the consensus view of all the governments, including our own, to encourage a worldwide recovery, because people judge that the inflationary problem is considerably reduced--that there's no immediate prospect for that in the near-term future We are also going to be perceived as discouraging recovery because of the impact on the international debt burden And I just think the symbolism of this is wrong It's out of all proportion, I would admit, for a lousy $100 million difference in the borrowing level  I think it has two serious problems  [It] puts more importance on the fact that we're giving attention to Ml  You go out of your way to comment on transactions money And you're making Ml respectable again  Look, after Paul's initial Humphrey- Hawkins testimony, the market reaction was that they were paying a heck of a lot less attention to the Ml figures That changed when Paul made a couple of remarks that gave the impression that we were paying more attention to M1 than the market thought And that attitude has now come back It is completely controllable by what Chairman Volcker says and the way he articulates his view on transactions money or Ml  I think he's going in another direction  -36-    5/24/83  Yes, but if we can get through 1983, there's going to be a big difference I don't see why a slightly stronger recovery, if it's accompanied by continued low inflation, is going to cause us to raise interest rates later in the year  They're not going to come down if the Fed is tightening  If we tighten now, I doubt if we're going to end up changing our position six weeks from now or whenever the next FOMC meeting is We'd have to see some major change in the economy, a weakening, which we're not going to see  I think there will be a lot of reaction It will look as though we're trying to spoil the recovery basically It will be out of proportion to the modest amount of rise If there's a clear perception that we are snugging up, people are just not going to understand  I think that's really an unfair conclusion Lyle, let's accept the fact that there is some possibility that a stronger recovery than what we want may materialize later At the moment you say it's going along on track okay but you're worried that later on it may materialize Does that mean that you anticipate that now, given the situation? It can only--  Well, if you want to make a snugging gesture, make it $300 million  I could live with that; any more I couldn't  I'll go for that  Including the ""transactions"" [part]?  Yes, but that's--  Yes, but I don't understand You argued very strongly that the reason for your position is not Ml  It's the strength of the economy Why not say so, if that's the majority view here?  I can dissent But if that's the majority view here, then why not say so?  It doesn't say that He emphasized transactions balances  What's the part about the transactions [balances]? We don't have copies of it; we can't see it  The way I would write the directive would be ""The Committee, recognizing that M2 and M3 are expected to remain somewhat below the rates of growth of 9 and 8 percent established for the quarter but recognizing that this is in the context of a somewhat stronger economic picture, decided to maintain roughly the degree of existing reserve restraint but permitting some modest changes""  We don't have to have a money market directive; we can go back to an M2, M3 target I think, though, that we wouldn't begin to agree on the numbers for the rest of this period  A surge in Ml, to which we don't pay much attention--  And we don't want to--  If we increase the borrowing assumption $100 million, we are still reducing the nonborrowed reserve path by $100 million and it depends simply on banks' variable holdings of excess reserves We still are snugging up in intention Whether it's manifested or not would depend on the excess reserves level  I think he's right I think alternative II comes closer--  Well, what is his first sentence in alternative II? What's the verb, ""maintain"" generally or ""increase"" or ""decrease""?  But the M2 and the M3 which are referred to in alternative I are running low now  The advantage of the alternative II draft, I think, is that the sentence on Ml is handled better than in what you read earlier, Paul  It doesn't have to read that we put Ml back on a pedestal or as a target  I think there's a very serious problem with your formulation, Paul, which is not true of alternative II, which is this In effect what you're saying in the first sentence of your formulation is that while M2 and M3 on the one hand are growing below the rates established, since transactions balances have been increasing substantially more rapidly than desirable we therefore are increasing slightly the degree of reserve restraint In effect you are telling the market that Ml is now more important than M2 and M3 Do you really want to go that far?  It doesn't say that It says that Ml is more important than M2 and M3 in terms of the bottom line  -48-    5/24/83  Well, that's not my view of deemphasis  What you're saying is that even though we have deemphasized Ml, when it's this large we have to take it into consideration  I don't agree with that  Well, you could say marginally, so you avoid Chuck Partee's--  A more honest directive would say that  I don't think it is I think a more honest directive would say we are worrying about too strong a recovery  -52-    5/24/83  and even though we don't pay too much attention to Ml, when it gets to be this big we would pay some attention to it  Well, I'll be glad to back off  Did Regan say 6 percent for Ml?  Statistically insignificant  Couldn't we say ""While Ml, which we normally deemphasize, was growing unusually rapidly""?  Would it be sufficient in the last sentence, Paul, simply to say ""slowing of the aggregates"" and not say anything about the broader aggregates or deceleration of Ml?  Now try $300 million  You've got $250 million over here  [Unintelligible] get you to vote on $300 million?  -59-    5/24/83 "
2479,1983-06-23,SOLOMON," Mr Chairman, this is Tony Solomon I think that $400 to $500 million is reasonable under today's conditions It would mean that there wouldn't be any further movement unless anticipations carried it somewhat further than the 9 to 9-1/4 percent that Peter Sternlight was talking about I think it's reasonable and consistent enough with the majority view on a slight increase in restraint that I don't think there needs to be a rewriting of the [directive] I agree with you, therefore, that this can simply be a consultation in which we agreed on this somewhat higher level of the borrowing assumption  Does that get published?  So, does that raise the question of a vote?  SPEAKER(?) No, I don't think so    6/23/83  Even though your voice faded, we did get the last sentence I agree with the approach you outlined I think it's a moderate response, but I'd go along with it  I think it's because we never mention in our record, as I remember, what the borrowing assumption is  Okay, if it's not published, it's all right But if it were to be published, then that would sound like a further increase in restraint and that is beyond what the majority decided last time  Well, I must be dense It seems to me that what you're doing is leaving it open to ambiguous interpretation, which may be just as well But it could either be a slight firming, which doesn't go beyond the firming that was in the last directive, or it could be a slight additional firming even though it's still consistent with the last directive Am I correct that it is open to both of those interpretations?  I'm not sure either, but I think it is ambiguous Okay  Mr Chairman, your voice fades The Washington end fades very, very frequently Maybe somebody ought to take a look at the system again  Is that the Federal Reserve System or the communication system?  SPEAKER(?) Both! "
2505,1983-07-12,SOLOMON," Second  Our figures show a projected fiscal deficit in 1984 of $225 billion, significantly higher than yours And then there are some moderate increases in the few years thereafter  Assuming 4 percent growth  I'd like to ask a question I'm sure this has something to do with statistical intricacies On the contribution of selected components to real GNP, as I understand it, even though there is a deteriorating export performance you show a positive contribution of net exports in 1984 as contrasted to 1983 Could you explain that to me?  No, it does get some--  But why?  Did you say this assumes a 15 percent or a 10 percent depreciation of the dollar?  How much are you reducing the capacity of the steel industry?  Coming back to Governor Wallich's point Most forecasters are projecting a higher rate of inflation than we are Certainly, that's the feeling in the financial community; they are looking toward inflation of 5 to 6 percent instead of around 4 percent Is it that their assumptions and models are different or is it that they are factoring in, in an intangible way,    7/12-13/83  psychological expectations, commodity prices, etcetera, and are not basing it primarily on unit labor costs? How does the CEA come out with a higher inflation [projection]?  Have you fed back in Ted Truman's 15 percent depreciation of the dollar?  We all have been assuming a depreciation of the dollar and factoring it in for the last year, and it hasn't come about  Haven't we begun to see that already? In recent months hasn't productivity declined?  Let me say that I think the projection of 71 percent real GNP for the third quarter is a bit on the high side, or at least that the risk is that it won't be that strong It seems very high with the bulk of the inventory adjustment being completed in the second quarter  Well, we always can run into problems on either side You said no matter how low the probability Are you saying that the probability of a sudden pickup in inflation is low?  I admire the consistent and persistent courage of the staff in trying to forecast velocity of circulation of Ml I suppose they have to do it here The swings are so enormous and so arbitrary and there's so little predictability that I shudder at the thought that we're really going to come out with monetary policy conclusions--specifically, targets for M1--based on velocity of circulation or something  Oh, definitely I'm not going back over 20 years I looked at the 20-year average too, but if you look at it in terms of the last few years and the current situation, M2 and M3 are running at pretty much zero velocity--exact relationships to nominal GNP  My thinking also is that this is tactical No matter what we do on Ml--whether we raise it, rebase it, or suspend it--there's going to be a certain amount of unhappiness Therefore, it's probably just as well to reduce [the M2 range] 1/2 point for next year on account of [unintelligible]  Why don't we use the word tactical instead of cosmetic?  Coming back to the question of whether to lower the credit target 1/2 point or 1 point If we are lowering the M2 and M3 ranges 1/2 point and we lower the credit target more than 1/2 point, it implies a precision and knowledge on our part whereby we can differentiate between 1/2 point and 1 point And I'm a little worried about that  If you feel comfortable and still [think] it is a time of--  Do we know why it's high this year?  But bank lending has been pretty flat and we're still going to have the big federal borrowing next year And I think bank lending may be stronger; the equity market may not be as strong next year So, it may very well be that we will still tend to see [growth in] the credit aggregates slightly above that in GNP  It doesn't appeal to me either for the same pseudo-precision reasoning that seems to be implied  I don't think we have enough confidence in what the future trends are going to be--not only the large deficit, but also the changing institutional arrangements in the markets So, it seems to me that the question we again come back to is Why do we imply that we have that much [omniscience] to differentiate an extra half point on credit?  The midpoint implies plus 2 velocity  My concern is that, as we've seen in the last couple of months, the markets have once again attached enormous importance to Ml All the speculation that the Fed is going to have to tighten is really coming from the Ml figure because even if there's a justification for some modest tightening from the broader aggregates, it's Ml that has been the discussion point, contrary to the period right after the initial Humphrey-Hawkins testimony in February I think putting a numerical target on M1 [is unwise], whether we call it 8 to 12 percent, 7 to 11 percent, or rebase, although I would agree that rebasing may give a shade of nuance of extra [emphasis] compared to simply moving up to 7 to 11 percent I think there's much to be said, in view of the arbitrariness and the unpredictability of what it's telling us, for suspending the target for Ml for the rest of the year and not at this time coming up with an '84 target range for Ml We would continue to monitor Ml and when it becomes a little more predictable then come in [with a range] at that point I don't know how one gets around that problem  -39-    7/12-13/83  I think that's true  Could we have some further discussion of Bob Black's suggestion? I find myself in a strange alliance with him in favor of saying that clearly M1 growth is going to be way over our target because of velocity and not offering a rebased or raised target for this year  Well, my own feeling would be not to offer [an M1 range for 1984] at this point But even if the majority of the Committee preferred to offer a range for next year, that doesn't mean we have to come up with a new number for this year  Well, I don't see that as a real constraint We are operating, at least most of us here today, on a recognition that we have [to have] some further restraint because of the strength of the economy We're not mechanically reacting to the [monetary growth] outcome  And, therefore, if the Chairman keeps enough flexibility, which I think he will, we can react to nominal GNP and the real economy It seems to me that that would not be a constraint  The basic difference, or point of departure, is that I am somewhat--in fact, substantially--surprised that we would stick our necks out with numbers where I, at least, feel that we are not stabilizing along a particular trend The fact that velocity was not as negative in the last couple of months as it was earlier in the year, and granted all the Ms had negative velocity last year, [does not alter the fact that] the situation is so sensitive to the changing way people hold balances I hear people talk about it in the banks and in the markets I don't see how we have even a pretense of a scientific basis for working with and making projections on the basis of what may be a very unpredictable velocity situation I don't understand why we would stick our necks out because we can do enough tightening based on the movements of M2, M3, and credit and the real economy without setting out a series of projections that have better than a 50-50 chance of turning out to be wrong again I don't really understand; I guess many of you, including maybe the staff, must have much more faith that the range of predictability is going to be substantially narrowed I don't believe that  Exactly Market participants watch it when they think it's influencing our behavior Secondly, we are going to lose credibility with certain kinds of people anyway if we move to 7 to 11 percent or rebase and wipe out the past That will be giving Ml more importance, no matter what Of course, I'll admit there is a way Paul could go back to the Humphrey-Hawkins February version rather than the April version But even then I think it is going to be harder to get back to the February market reaction to Ml  Okay But it is still true that when you talk to market people in New York you feel that Ml is halfway back again  Sure, you hear various sentiments But those whom I believe are the more astute observers in the financial community make a point of saying that we ought to be more sensitive to the real economy than to Ml There's a fear around also, and I have that fear, that we ourselves are going to feel--and the market will perceive us as being--more locked into M1 if we go ahead with it and dignify what has been happening with--  Let me ask a question Even though I prefer 5 to 9 percent over 4 to 8 percent, certainly in terms of the immediate market effect, is it feasible to say that we're coming up with 5 to 9 percent and yet we are going to continue deemphasizing it?  Would you base it on June, then?  The whole spectrum of short-term interest rates is really behaving as though the fed funds rate were closer to 9-1/2 percent than to the 9-1/8 percent rate of the last few days So, if we raise expectations [by] having 4 to 8 percent based on the second quarter, we are going to get even more of a reaction in the market  CBO is out of date There isn't much--  We can do 4 to 9 percent based on the second quarter, which also is a practical way of showing the market that we're de-emphasizing M1 to some degree They don't really believe as much as I think some of you people around here believe that we have de-emphasized Ml I keep mentioning this point Sure, it has been reinforced by the strength of the real economy; I understand that But there's a revision to the old thinking more and more  But how can we say we see the first signs of inflation? What do we point to?  I don't think he has a basis for saying that  If the exchange rate--  Maybe if we talk long enough, you will come back to my suggestion  -57-    7/12-13/83  The fact that we are doing some modest tightening, [which is] probably what we're going to be doing, I don't think we ought to show that And there's enough justification in the M2 and M3 figures to justify a modest tightening  We don't have a typical recovery We have a very strange world situation as you know, Henry And yet I don't see that that whole world situation enters into our bottom line policymaking here  Are you talking about roughly a $600 million borrowing assumption?  I think we need $800 million to get the funds rate to 9-1/2 percent  -59-    7/12-13/83  But if we're going to work with the initial assumption of net borrowed reserves, then we have to make an estimate as to what the excess reserves are going to be, and I don't think--  I know that  I think it's fair to say that the market, particularly after the Humphrey-Hawkins testimony, probably will not retreat and will tend to assume that this is not the last upward adjustment  They are reacting now to those wide swings in weekly Ml variations as they were before we had formally deemphasized Ml  I'm talking about the swings [in Ml] we're now seeing in the Friday publications  If we tighten to 9-1/2 percent, the chances of the market not continuing to anticipate that there might be more tightening later on are very small I don't think we could tighten without getting some movement in the whole spectrum of short- term rates, even though technically the 9-1/2 percent [funds rate] would be consistent with the short-term rates we've seen here  -65-    7/12-13/83  The logic of that argument, Chuck, that we [ought] to wait a while before we put more pressure on the whole spectrum of short-term interest rates is that we really can't afford to push up the fed funds rate even though it would be in a technically better relationship  I am assuming that the tone of that testimony, to the extent that it's not as completely neutral as it can be, is that it would give more [emphasis] to the question of alertness to the strength of the economy, strength of the aggregates, etc, than it would to any implication that would correct anticipation on the other side In other words, I don't see any reason to assume that the testimony would tend to take the upward movement and expectations out  Are you prepared to go that far?  There has been a bit of a shift back to prime as the Eurodollar and the Libor rate got lower and the banks found some of their interest is--  I don't think you can do it in your testimony either  Do you consider the exchange rate progress?  Well, I'm closer to Emmett and Nancy's view, but I think it would be perfectly reasonable to compromise at something in the neighborhood of an initial borrowing assumption of, say, $700 million I don't see that expectations are going to change, and that [borrowing] would we give us some modest further lift in rates and I think would be consistent, as Steve pointed out--at least I think he expressed this view--with the targets of alternative A I don't think the funds range is significant; the way we're running monetary policy these days, we're not going to touch either extreme anyway So, I don't think it's important whether we leave it at 6 to 10 percent or not I think we might as well leave it  You and I ought to change Districts! The theory of this regional system is that we reflect the view of our Districts We do not  How is that lower one split between real GNP and prices?  Do you feel that you can say we've tightened a bit and that for the time being we want to wait and see the results of that tightening and other factors on the growth of the economy?  I'm not sure that I understand the importance of the targets for M2 and M3 and that for Ml I'm not sure  -73-    7/12-13/83  I understand their importance if we're having that narrow a view as to where we expect the fed funds rate to be Do you want to--  Could you expand that sentence and put in something about total credit in the same sentence?  But it would be helpful, I think, to carry through the concept of the two tiers with the associated ranges, if there's some way of doing that even without putting numbers on it  Well, it gives us a little more flexibility, Roger  Basically what it's saying, though, is that our judgments about movements in the real economy will temper that earlier sentence And I think that's consistent  I agree  You think we're being too heretical? ""Depending in part on evidence""--  --""about the strength of economic recovery both domestically and in the world"" Something like that would show that we are aware of what is happening in the world economy  The short-term directive--  It's also the industrialized countries  Then maybe you ought to find out whether today's discussion could cause some of those who came in with higher projections to feel justified in somewhat lower ones or not  We had even lower-  -80-    7/12-13/83  Paul, I'd say 5 to 9 percent Unless there is going to be a major review and change from a substantive point of view I'm happy with the 5 to 9 percent  But if you take Paul's reluctance to base it on June, then you tell the markets that you are going to do 4 to 8 percent based on the second quarter  Well, you're thinking of using annual--  The argument against rebasing as opposed to giving an annual number is that it might look as if we're giving Ml more importance than we want to convey But I think that's a bit offset by putting in Ml and total credit as associated ranges  Yes, that's what I'm saying In other words, I'm addressing why we were moving away from the rebasing approach earlier In general it was because it might give the impression that we were attaching more importance to Ml than we wanted to convey But maybe we're offsetting that now by putting in Ml and total credit as associated ranges So, therefore, I think we can rebase on the second quarter  -83-    7/12-13/83  And we shouldn't have a distinction because that would imply a knowledge on our part about velocity, which we don't have  Yes, but on our principal targets, M2 and M3, we would be showing a reduction  Well, it is the Committee's  We could underline the uncertainty of the velocity projection by making it 4 to 9 percent  Oh, we forgot it!  We can have a new category for velocity-sensitive associated ranges!  You already asked that, didn't you?  Oh, you're not suggesting that?  When you do the Humphrey-Hawkins testimony, do you actually release the directive language on the long- range targets or do you simply use your own wording?  But I assume on the wording that the associated range type of language would be placed around the sentence on Ml  An Ml and a total credit sentence  I think it gives more importance to the associated ranges if we have a separate vote on them  I think it should be the reverse In other words, say that the associated ranges of X and Y are consistent with the principal targets It's not that the principal targets were designed to be consistent with--  What would you do then about the next paragraph?  In the second sentence we ought to say ""the behavior of Ml and total credit""  Well, wouldn't you want to say the degree of weight on both in leaving out the next sentence?  No, the degree of weight on M1 and on the [debt]  You're right; I'm sorry  I think that's a more clean-cut way of doing it  The fact that we already used multiple--  Well, I'll switch my vote and accept 5 to 9 percent for the remainder of the year and 4 to 8 percent for the next year  Excepting Ml  It would be ironic if the markets interpret the 1 point reduction in M1 as against a 1/2 point reduction in the other three as in some way giving more importance to M1 again  SPEAKER(?) Let's take a vote  We have about 47 or 48 percent  And that didn't go through  SPEAKER(?) They never drew on-- "
2531,1983-08-23,SOLOMON," What remaining foreign currency balances does the Treasury have now after paying off the Carter bonds?  That's all?  Well, I have a general comment to make I think there are two types of intervention One is [based on] the modest, narrow concept of countering disorderly markets; the other is when one wants to lean against stronger trends And the second really should be done not only in concert with other key central banks but in a package approach in which other actions--not just intervention--are taken I think what was done fell between those two schools Now, it still had a useful purpose I wouldn't agree with some of the public comment that it was a complete failure It had the politically useful--and I use the word politically in the very broadest sense of the term--function of demonstrating that the United States was willing to meet its Williamsburg Summit commitments of cooperation And it certainly checked for a few days the very strong upward trend that seemed to be out of all proportion to the upward movement in US [interest] rates It's quite clear that it didn't leave a good taste in people's mouths, although some people in the market thought it was a useful thing to do On balance, I think the general consensus was that it didn't turn out to be very effective Secondly, I think there was some irritation on the part of European central banks that on the key night, a Thursday night, we did not follow through and do any intervention in the Far East--we had no authority to do that--when there was a very major movement And this followed a day on which the Bundesbank on its own had asked the central banks of many small European countries to join in on the intervention And, therefore, it left a rather bad taste in their mouths and they later came out with this statement that Sam referred to, and I think that just about finished the possibility of any really effective concerted intervention I only make these comments to give you my perspective--a report card, so to speak, of this particular incident I don't know whether Paul agrees or not    8/23/83  We're kept on a very close leash When I first became Undersecretary of the Treasury and we had the need to intervene, Arthur Burns also would keep the New York Fed on a very close leash That went on for a week or two He would say that [the Desk] had $25 million and when they used it up they had to come back And then there would be a consultation with the Treasury I was following it very closely and I felt policy with that close a leash didn't make any sense So, I said to Arthur Burns that if we were serious about it, we had to give the New York Desk more room; and he agreed finally The Desk ended up having a very substantial amount of discretion, including in the Far East, and also with not too small a dollar amount Frequently there was not a dollar limit as such Just the process of consultation alone [is cumbersome] If we need to intervene and are getting close to the end of the money authorization for the day--[which might be] $25, $50, or $75 million depending on the market--by the time we get through to the Treasury and the Treasury consults with the Chairman and then they get back to us, at a minimum that will be 20 minutes; sometimes it can be an hour or two So, I personally feel that if it's a serious concerted intervention, we have to give a little more discretion to the Desk I don't think that view is very popular, certainly not in this Treasury John?  No, I don't think that's true  Now, what was a little unusual was that the Treasury went out and made an announcement In hindsight, I'm not so sure that was a great idea Normally that isn't the way we would do it unless we were planning a very major effort, which we used to do by activating swap lines, taking a monetary policy measure--what I call a package approach Then when we make an announcement, we get more credibility Anyway, that's a minor point They announced it, or simply after a couple of days answered questions  Yes But on the other hand, Ted, we had made an enormous amount of money in our intervention Just on the Carter bonds alone--selling those, which is done to get foreign currency--not only was there a large interest rate savings but there was also a big profit  Yes, and the Exchange Stabilization Fund when I was there was in the red By the time I left it was in the black because of the profits that we had made, even though not all of the profits went into the Stabilization Fund Some of them ended up in the general account  Well, I think in a case of countering disorderly markets, in the very narrow sense of that term, we can do that on modest basis That involves more a quasi-continuing presence from time-to-time in the market without making a big deal out of it The second type is concerted intervention or leaning against the wind, which was a situation that was posed to us because in the larger sense of the term one can argue that this was a very disorderly movement The abruptness and the size of the market movement in response to a relatively modest uptick in US interest rates was out of proportion Yes, I feel that we shouldn't do that kind of major, concerted intervention unless there's a package approach and we really mean it and don't keep such a close hold on the Desk That's my own view  Oh, yes  Our share was $300 odd million  I can't give you a gross figure for all central banks  We started off without foreign currencies so we had to activate the swaps, and I suppose we got in hock by about as much as $8 billion Sometimes we have to stick with intervention It's not an easy, simple, black and white thing For example, when we announced that big dollar rescue package on November 1, [1978], even though we had a whole package of measures and even though there was worldwide consultation and even though the dollar turned around very sharply on the first day, we had to make it stick and make the markets believe we meant business and that [what we were doing] was credible To give time for the fundamental improvement in our balance of payments to become more and more apparent, we had to stick with substantial intervention all through November and December On January 2 the markets turned around on their own and then there was such an inflow that we were able to repay our swaps and over the year to begin accumulating foreign currencies because the dollar was rising too fast That was a situation where we had very effective concerted tactics and yet still needed intervention Sometimes I hear the argument that [if] it is an effective concerted package which involves domestic monetary policy, then intervention isn't needed at all That was a case where we did need it  On another matter, in view of the experience we've had in the last few weeks in the way the markets absorbed this large US Treasury borrowing You said earlier that there had been some econometric analysis indicating that if there were substantial reductions in the deficit, interest rates might be, say, a couple points lower Was that analysis done on the basis of current conditions in the economy or was that analysis based upon a more robust economy or higher utilization of capacity?  So, common sense would tell me that if a year from now the economy were functioning at a much higher level of utilization of capacity and you did the same econometric analysis-- and at that time we got a major move to reduce the budgetary deficit-- we would get an even bigger impact in terms of interest rate reduction Is that a sensible conclusion?  Why ""unfortunately""?  Peter may not agree with me, but what the experience of the last few weeks--with this very large Treasury borrowing in the markets--indicated to me at least is that the other factors swamped, or were more important than, the size of the borrowing in ultimately determining the level of interest rates in the markets So, even though in the early stages of the borrowing there were considerable interest rate pressures geared to the size of the borrowing, the whole amount got digested very easily with interest rates ultimately coming down somewhat because of other factors It wasn't the size per se that caused that much of a problem in the overall context of current conditions and perceptions about monetary policy I don't know if you would agree with that or not, Peter  The third quarter is going to be about $50 billion, isn't it?  You seem to be assuming that next year we will have a downward drift in long-term interest rates, notwithstanding the improved economy, etc  An act of faith?  Coming back to the real economy, Jim What level of housing starts and what level of automobile sales are you assuming for the fourth quarter?  I would guess, although it's nothing other than gut instinct, that those levels are somewhat optimistic Housing transactions are beginning to fall And as the pent up demand for automobiles begins to be satisfied to some degree, I have a feeling that that's a very high level of automobile sales to be projecting for the fourth quarter  Is that because of the demographics or because people aren't getting married, or what?  Union Pacific people tell me that carloadings have not gone up as much as the rest of the economy and normal relationships would indicate, although the published data don't seem to make that very clear  The barge business is also very, very bad It has not picked up There seems to be less movement of coal, heavy material, steel, and even of grain But coming back to food prices I thought we were sitting with such huge surpluses I'm not quite sure I understand why there is such a big price impact  I see So, it's meat prices rather than corn that you think--  -12-    8/23/83  Did you really have an 8 percent third-quarter projection back in February?  Even when you were so worried about interest rates back in February?  How much of the increased spending do you attribute to the stock market and bonds?  Peter Fousek from New York has some projections, which I forgot I don't have any here You can answer it, can't you?  The change from the second quarter of 1982 was a rise of some 57 percent in the stock market  SPEAKER(?) What was the 30 percent?  Not for the second quarter of '82 to the second quarter of '83  Housing prices [were] firm  You have to look at the volume of refinancing of existing house mortgages to begin to get some kind of clue as to whether it influences consumer spending or not  There are a couple of us left who more or less agree with it  It could just be that everybody is wrong  Well, I don't think we have to argue really about whether it's ""B"" or ""C"" We maintain the same operational paragraph and simply say we maintain the existing degree of reserve restraint And we assume [borrowing of] $700 to $900 million I guess that's the difference between us If we go all the way down to alternative C, that assumes a borrowing range as high as $1 to $1-1/4 billion, and then we would be pushing up the federal funds rate to 9-3/4 percent plus, whereas if we stick with $700 to $900 million, then it's about 9-1/2 percent  The operational paragraph says 8-1/2 and 8 percent for M2 and M3 and it says 7 percent for Ml I don't see that we have to change any language, but I feel very strongly that we not go higher than $700 to $900 million on the initial borrowing  I think that's reinforced by the fact that we're getting credit--I'm not sure we deserve it--in that there's a widespread perception in the financial community that it was our tightening that started correcting that bulge Whether it's true or not true, we're getting the credit for it  I'd leave it alone  But how can you get that significant a move upward for it to go over 10 percent if we're running policy as we are and interpreting it as maintaining the existing degree of reserve restraint? That's the operative sentence  Well, there is some variation  But in planning the nonborrowed reserve path you still have been using the assumption for everything you've said, haven't you, Peter?  Irrespective of the fact that some weeks borrowing comes in higher or lower  That's a larger question He's talking about a narrower question  I'm not on the phone every day, but my understanding--if I'm wrong, Steve or Peter ought to speak up--is that they are following the Committee's guidance in calculating the nonborrowed reserve path They are not adjusting the nonborrowed reserve path to the actual borrowing that happened to occur in a particular week  -23-    8/23/83  That's why we changed the paragraph to put emphasis on the degree of tightening--or maintaining or loosening, even--of reserve restraint  It certainly limits the amount of variability in the fed funds rate There's no question about that But I think it's also correct to say that we're not pegging it We've seen within a week a considerable movement in the funds rate "
2559,1983-10-04,SOLOMON," I don't think there is much difference of opinion in the financial community about the current situation and the near-term prospects for economic growth What I found interesting, though, was a private discussion I had the other    10/4/83  day with on the one hand and one I had with and [unintelligible] The views varied sharply and [unintelligible] believed that capital spending would continue in 1984 along typical recovery [trends]; therefore, [for that reason], along with other factors, they concluded that interest rates will rise at least 100 to 150 basis points over the next year sees no evidence that capital spending will be that strong and he doesn't believe that the inventory replenishment will continue beyond the spring He says he doesn't believe it is going to return to a statistically normal ratio because he thinks it is ridiculously low now and can't reflect completely the reality And unless he is wrong about inventory replacement, he believes that the recovery will peter out sometime toward the end of the first half of next year I would say that the view is probably a minority view in the financial community There would be more people reflecting the former view And then there is a monetarist view, reflected by an Englishman with whom I had a conversation,  He's saying that inflation in this country by the fourth quarter of next year will be between 8 and 10 percent and that the inflation rate in Germany also will be very high, based on his approach to analysis So, in some ways, the question of 1984 prospects and the so-called crowding out effect of the budget deficit is much more interesting than the current situation But I don't have any real difference of view from that which Jim expressed with regard to the current situation I would add one comment on the current situation, which is that aside from the distorting effect of high real interest rates on different sectors in the economy, there is also the distorting effect of the exchange rate, which is making the composition of what look like normal overall figures somewhat different than we've had before, with certain sectors still being very badly impacted  But isn't it still close to 7 percent for the country as a whole?  Are you speaking of long-term--?  Let me ask whether the staff has gone through a hypothetical scenario that I tried to go through, very inconclusively That is, next year we're probably going to be running a trade deficit of about $110 billion and a current account deficit of $70 or $80 billion What happens if, notwithstanding the high level of interest rates, expectations regarding exchange rates change radically and we see the exchange rate falling substantially? That has implications of a reversal--a major reduction or a complete cessation--of net capital inflows Now, what's the effect on interest rates? As we analyze it, there probably would be some upward movement, but there would be an improved differential in the dollar market against the Eurodollar market and there would be reflows from the Eurodollar market brought in by the banks The composition of the capital movements would change substantially The interest rate effect probably would be not too significant here at home and/or we would have a dramatic change in the exchange rate But I want to be sure of this kind of analysis If anybody on the staff wants to comment on what they think the impact, if any, would be from this on domestic interest rates, I'd be interested in hearing  Can you see any clear effects on the monetary aggregates resulting from the changes in the composition of the flows?  Well, we do get a bigger impact in 1985 It's probably a difference of about $6 billion in 1984, which would be relatively modest If you make an assumption of a substantially--  Well, let's say 25 to 30 percent as against 15 percent I think it would give you only about a $6 billion improvement in 1984 but the improvement is much, much larger in 1985  There's a disproportionately favorable impact on our trade from our large imports from Canada and Japan There's a relatively small impact on Europe and--  That's the line they've been taking The Chancellor of the Exchequer told me that he thought [the UK economy] was going to be even better in the second half than in the first half, which most people are saying is not so  Well, the best one can project, I would assume, would be 2 percent real growth in 1984 for the European community And it may fall short of that I think the biggest threat--and I know we'll get into that later--is not the export problem that we're having in our current account deficit but something probably happening in the LDC indebtedness situation that will trigger some major ripple effects around the world  From that point of view we need an easier monetary policy  And our price--  And the fighting would spread into the Gulf and straight to--  That ought to be an IMF compliance standard!  Also, Gonzalez del Solar told me that [the judge] acted under the influence of the Argentine Air Force who are very powerful in the Terra del Fuego region where he is located They are very militantly nationalistic and angry at the United States and Great Britain Now on the other hand, [unintelligible] told del Solar before he got arrested that they seem to feel that the [unintelligible] Sandinista candidate as well as the radical candidate are both going to play this debt issue very moderately That was the view as of a week ago And he certainly didn't get arrested by those groups; he got arrested by--  There is the view in the world--I'm not sure it would be so at this table--that if a major international financial problem is triggered, let's say, by Brazil or Argentina or something, that the Federal Reserve is basically the lender of last resort in the world So much of the debt is dollar-denominated that a large part of the world, including France, would look to the Fed to ease monetary policy immediately and very drastically I'll leave it at that, but I hear that  In fact, one very distinguished member of the financial community told me that if Brazil were to announce a standstill or default, whatever you want to call it, that interest rates would immediately fall in the market in New York because everyone would expect that the Fed would have absolutely no alternative but to ease policy  Yes, but that assumes that they can still get IMF help  Yes, sure And the trade credits would stop and a lot of other things would stop So, I think they'd have a real crisis on the import side  Send this to the--  Seventy?  I think that's the only thing to do  John Berry's article in The Washington Post, I think, goes in that direction He quotes from the directive and says that the flexibility of how the Desk interprets ""maintaining the existing degree of restraint"" is becoming enormously wide  Oh, it came through pretty clearly  Well, if we continue operating as we did here, there is a certain degree to which the Chairman and the Desk and Steve are exercising a bit of discretion  What they will pay more attention to is if they see the fed funds rate decline to below 9 percent in this period and then they see the release of a record that says ""maintain the existing degree of reserve restraint"" Then they would be surprised, possibly  But if the money supply were still within the target but in the upper half, then I'm not sure they would understand that we were not being a little more secretive in easing But I don't think it's a major point  If the real economy were showing signs of weakening, even though the money supply was still in the upper half but within the range, it might still be a situation where we would do some easing That's a mixed case  It's not likely  Could we put it this way? Could we say ""The Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of reserve restraint, compatible with the slight easing in market conditions in recent weeks""  Because we have seen some easing in market conditions  [Unintelligible] other interest rates in the markets generally, so why can't someone try to explain why--  As I understand it, part of that technical problem--the reason for that modest shift in the borrowing assumption--can be that the System suspects there's a miss in the projection because of some peculiar movement in the fed funds rate which doesn't seem to be explained, unless there is some--  You could underline it  I think we've gone as far as we can I think we're verbally hitting the shadows There is a slight implication of asymmetry in the language and I don't think there's much more we can do We shouldn't start tinkering with that, I think I don't know what more we can do  -44-    10/4/83  How many recessions do we need? "
2588,1983-11-14,SOLOMON," What does this model assume about real growth in the rest of the world and how sensitive is the conclusion to changes in the assumptions on how the rest of the world is growing?  Steadily through the 5-year period?  That's aside from any influence on the exchange rate I assume that, say, a 1 point gain in the economic growth in the rest of the world doesn't have much impact on this?  I don't agree with that, because at some point as the current account deficit gets larger and larger and larger, with huge leaps, we'll see higher interest rates It's not going to prevent some change--some depreciation of the dollar  Let me ask a question of you When you answered Governor Rice that it would be easier to achieve price stability if we didn't get rid of the budget deficit because of the higher interest rate effect and the higher dollar, are you also assuming a major recession?    11/14-15/83  Maybe they have the dollar rising 10 percent a year  I think, though, that the result is even worse than you have there You have real interest rates rising steadily from present levels to a point where eventually they are about 4 percentage points or so higher than they are now I find it inconceivable that we wouldn't have a recession in this period And for a period of time we would have a much higher level of unemployment than you have At least that seems to me more likely  That's right I guess I would say that is a slightly better scenario I wouldn't want to be quoted on this but it seems to me that a more realistic scenario would be a monetary policy that keeps inflation in the 4 to 5 percent range for the rest of the recovery and then one would hope that a normal cyclical recession at that point would cut the inflation rate down to maybe half of that and get it to the 2 to 3 percent range It seems to me that, in terms of all the elements that have to be accommodated, that is a more realistic way of trying to work toward long-run price stability  Well, we could get a recession in 1986, which will head off unfavorable contract negotiations  But I think one could argue, Paul, that even if inflation continues at only 4 percent or 4-1/2 percent or whatever, that we would still get a net increase in wage compensation beyond 6 percent for this reason The only way we get today's low average is by having extremely depressed wages and absolute cuts in many manufacturing industries It's running much higher, as you point out, in utilities and the financial sector, etc So, if we have recovery in the smoke-stack area--even if inflation is still in this [4 to 4-1/2 percent] area--we probably will end up with a higher average wage in the country as a whole  Okay, but counting Chart 17 [unintelligible], assuming that there is that correlation, what level of unemployment do you have to have to get price stability in 1988?  You come back to the same conclusion as your baseline  What is the inflationary expectations assumption of this model?  Turning to something else You show a one for one--  And to continue on that line, since you say in the earlier pages that if you have a 1 percentage point less rapid rate of growth in '84 and '85, you get 1 percentage point less inflation in '84 and '85 If you were basically following a policy along the lines Governor Wallich and I are talking about, is there any additional reduced inflation payoff of running, say, a 1 percentage point lower rate of growth in the next year or two, recognizing that what you're really trying to do in the broadest policy sense is to contain inflation just where it is during the recovery and then take advantage of the next recession to bring it down somewhat more? Is there a significant advantage in running a lower growth rate over the next two years--that's basically a cyclical view--rather than doing this?  Unless you're lucky on some of the other things, such as productivity and a couple of other things--  I understand that But if we were able to prevent the rate of inflation from going up beyond the present level during the rest of this recovery, though I don't think we will be, I would guess that there would be a very, very widespread expectation in the financial community that the next recession would bring the rate of inflation down significantly We would get a very favorable expectational result if, over the next year or year-and-a- half, we could stabilize this level of inflation  4 or 4-1/2 percent The [financial] community is expecting basically a 1 to 2 percentage point rise in the rate of inflation over the next 2 years  Well, what does it assume for velocity of circulation for M2? If we drop [M2 growth] to 6 percent in 1984, what velocity of circulation does that assume?  Yes, but isn't that a lower velocity than we normally adhere to?  But it has an interest rate effect in your model, doesn't it?  I think the expectation, as I was trying to say earlier, is a little different and the scenario is different If you contain the existing rate of inflation during the recovery, you will get a very significant drop in inflationary expectations in another couple of years That, I think, is significant in working the model  I'm not saying it's going to be right or that this is going to happen automatically And I don't want you to assume that I'm going to vote the way I'm now going to suggest But if we reduce the speed of recovery by 1 percentage point over the next year and we get 1-1/2 to 2 percent growth, and assume no action on the deficit until 1985 and then only half of what we are thinking at this time, I was wondering what that would look like We might very well not have any increase in inflation in the next couple of years because of the exchange rate effects as well Maybe you fellows worked this out roughly A 1 percent lower rate of recovery over the next two years during this--  I'm talking about this earlier scenario  You have already assumed in '84 and in '85--  Well, I don't understand that because chart 18 has 33 percent in '84 and 15 percent in '85  Okay But at the moment in the real world we are assuming that growth in 1984, if we were to continue with the present monetary policy, is likely to be 5-1/2 percent At least  -23-    11/14-15/83  that's what we are assuming in New York; it's higher than you people have  With the present monetary policy? So, we are assuming significantly higher growth Am I right on that, Peter?  Okay, 5-1/4 not 5-1/2 percent And I'm saying--well, I guess you can't compare the rates  Our inflation prediction is somewhat higher; I think we have a rate 3/4 of a point higher than the Board staff has  We are assuming basically that we have a 9-1/2 percent fed funds rate  I don't worry about that  So, in other words, if I'm correct To maintain 4 to 4-1/2 percent inflation, assuming that's what we have now, you would have to cut back real economic growth in '84 according to your model to what level?  But if you had 1 point more in productivity, you wouldn't have to cut back quite that much?  If capacity is increasing at less than the postwar average or [unintelligible] So, at this speed of recovery, at least it's a normal recovery but we are moving up faster in utilization of capacity This is where the Carter Administration ran into trouble quickly because there was a theory that utilization of capacity was supposed to [unintelligible] noninflationary growth [unintelligible] I've put a lot of emphasis on capacity utilization And it's very disturbing not to have it growing at a normal rate, even though we're having a fast recovery I attribute this to the inflation rate However, we are getting a lot of spending on equipment but not on plant; presumably the spending on equipment will extend the rate of productivity for [existing plants]  It seem to me that the [unintelligible] means more optimistic But I would like to know how to be able to avoid a significant effect rather than a lower growth with such an elusive combination of--  [Unintelligible] factors cyclical It's unlikely that the recovery would last beyond '87 I don't even think we should wait until '87; we ought to go for '86 And if you factor in an enormous [unintelligible] then we could get worse inflation I don't know how to look at this kind of policy  So did we all  As Mr St Germain pointed out About a year ago he wrote me a letter, which was in the press, asking Why are you doing such a huge volume of RPs? We wrote back explaining the reasons why and I never heard from him again  You have had to ask every once in a while before, Peter, for this kind of temporary increase in the limit Wouldn't it make more sense, if you can establish your case, to have a permanent $5 billion [intermeeting limit] instead of having to come to the Committee each time?  You're saying that if by some chance the Congress were to reach the end of the week without raising the debt ceiling, you think the Treasury could get through until early December?  Does the Congress know this?  What if it came about two months after?  You wouldn't need a new authorization?  The drawing rate we pay, Paul, as I understand it, is the bond rate three months before the bond matures whereas the rate we get when we invest is the 3-month rate on an RP And there is a few basis points difference here to our disadvantage if we were ever to draw on the yen swap arrangement  And the Bank of Japan is sympathetic and discussions are going on  -30-    11/14-15/83  Well, I think the one thing that is worth commenting on--I don't think Sam mentioned it--is that the price of gold was declining during this period of enormous ""safe haven"" flows The dollar has basically replaced gold and that has shocked a lot of Europeans and Arabs and a lot of other people But they basically told them there are all these events--Lebanon, the Caribbean, etc They would all expect the price of gold to go up instead of going down  I don't know of any small bank that has refused to reschedule, as distinct from coming up with new money At least I haven't heard of any lawsuits, attempted lawsuits, or attempted cash-ins, and I find that comforting  I think a major problem still is the likelihood that some major debtor country will ask for better terms Argentina is discussed frequently on the front pages, even though that is the more moderate of the candidates [unintelligible] I still think that [such a development] is more likely than not There are various ways in which that request could come forward Hopefully, it would be in private and in a moderate form and not be accompanied by any threats of a standstill How the banks will respond to that is still a big question mark, if that does occur  They still haven't reached an agreement on the [unintelligible] side on the communist countries?  But you agreed to create a fourth category in between weak and substandard, I gather  Some of the foreign central banks and banking commissions are beginning to require a provisioning against [loans to] Latin American countries [Unintelligible] for this year are requiring 5 percent of the exposure for the first time and they are talking about 5 to 10 percent next year  Some of the banks' CEOs said to me that they would be most reluctant to start provisioning if the reserves were [not] tax deductible; they are concerned that the IRS regs would not--  They don't want the write-off equivalent And you're saying that the specific reserve provisioning would be deductible?  And the argument against write-offs is that the debtor countries become aware of it and would have less interest in trying to keep paying I'm not sure whether that is an honest point or not  I don't know [Unintelligible] trying to differentiate between those that have been charged off or written off and those that haven't So, I'm not sure at all that there is that much validity to the argument that one reason they can't write them off is to take advantage of the tax cut [unintelligible]  Privately [unintelligible]  -35-    11/14-15/83  We still don't have a definitive clarification from the Comptroller on the legal limit being exceeded and how that is to be treated when everything gets rolled over  But the thing I didn't understand is that, in my naive mind, it looks like an evasion Bank of America has said that they would exceed the limit so, therefore, they are going to make the loan from their holding corporation and not from the bank  Does that meet the spirit [of the law]?  But, Jim, you have the GNP deflator going from 35 percent in the third quarter to 46 percent this quarter; that's a substantial rise of 11 percentage points  Well, New York real estate is still [unintelligible] To the extent that people are looking around for an inflation hedge, the collectibles market has picked up quite rapidly in the last two months; much higher prices are being bid at auction houses It's almost as though people are thinking in the inflationary hedge terms we saw a couple of years ago I can't understand why there is such a rapid rise in prices at the better end of the scale  Isn't business fixed investment stronger than one would expect with that policy mix?  I second it  Or up  -53-    11/14-15/83  But I shudder to think of what would have happened to the economy if we had followed Ml on its crazy turns in the last year  On balance, I also come out for staying as we are, although I do think it's quite possible that next month we will have to give more consideration to a tightening move In addition to the arguments that have been offered around the table against a move at this point, I would add that a tightening move at this point really would not be understood in the markets It would be totally unexpected in the country at large And I think there would  -59-    11/14-15/83  be a lot of speculation that the Fed is expecting much more inflation next year, notwithstanding the Chairman's testimony in which he said it could be 4-1/4 percent or less I think the only way the country would understand a tightening move at this point would be [to conclude] that we privately are expecting significantly higher inflation Obviously, I'm not saying that that should be the sole governing consideration, but it does seem to me that, even though one can make an argument for a precautionary move, the force of the justification for that might be very much clearer at our next meeting So, I would vote to stay where we are and for borrowing in the $650 million area  How do you explain the fact that in the last month or the last few weeks--I don't know exactly what time period--while there has been a firming in bond yields there has been a slight lowering in mortgage rates?  Yes The explanation I heard is that the competition among the thrifts has become more intense for mortgage business and they are--  I wasn't disagreeing with that  Even though I agree that we won't have any better monthly numbers, there would be some anecdotal information We may have a better feeling for how the fourth quarter will be coming in and what is happening in business fixed investment  But isn't there an implication if we say that greater restraint would be acceptable should the aggregates expand more rapidly, that that's the only condition under which we would go to greater restraint? And yet, of course, we could have weakness in the aggregates and still have enough business evidence that we would want to move a little What I'm saying is that we ought to put a little more emphasis on the strength of the economic recovery considerations in that sentence  Yes, I understand that I just felt [we needed] a little more emphasis there rather than on the aggregates  -64-    11/14-15/83  I don't think that would be--  You could achieve what I want simply by putting in one adjective ""Depending on evidence about the increasing strength of economic recovery""  Okay What I'm trying here may be quite technical--  Right, or ""continuing"" If we do that, it gives a flavor of the Committee's concern that there may be something further down the road  And then make the change you suggested, Paul  Reversing  How about ""might be acceptable""?  We did rebase You were critical to rebasing, I presume, so haven't we--  No But I don't see the reasons for pushing hard to get above the bottom of the rebased range  Except old Ml was just as weak, apparently, in that time period "
2619,1983-12-19,SOLOMON," It's mark-to-market, isn't it?  Second  Unless we offset it  The staff already has factored in a much smaller rise in consumption--by $33 billion dollars, I think  Well, I guess we come out somewhat differently The New York Fed staff's forecast is for stronger growth than in Mr Kichline's forecast So much of this is ""iffy"" that I won't bother going into the components and how they arrive at their forecast; they arrive at it, incidentally, with a much higher productivity guess I'm particularly impressed, unfortunately, by the increased talk I hear in the financial markets about rising inflationary expectations And I hear a lot of it So, from that point of view, there's a fairly clear implication for some snugging up, possibly On the other hand, though, the thing that bothers me is that the exchange rate is getting to be a looming menace in a difference sense The higher it keeps going the more precipitously it's going to drop when expectations regarding the exchange rate turn around It's going to drop at a time when we're nearer capacity utilization and it will have a much bigger inflationary impact I'm not even talking about the developing countries burden I think it's a real time bomb  So, I am in a quandary as to where these conflicting analyses would lead one If one were looking just at the domestic scene, I think it would be important to affect the psychology and curb somewhat these rising inflationary expectations I don't think that a quarter or a half percentage point is going to bring that much of a change in housing and the real economy that it is going to slow down the momentum that much, but I think it would have a very salutary psychological effect However, I don't know whether it would push the exchange rate up even further It would be my guess that it would and I just don't know if we can afford to be that asymmetric in our monetary policy in regard to exchange rates When they are falling precipitously, we are all willing to tighten monetary policy; when they are rising into the stratosphere, we're not prepared to liberalize monetary policy--for reasons I understand, of course, and with which I sympathize to a large degree I don't know how to cut this dilemma The easy way out would be to say Let's wait a few more weeks until what is happening becomes clear But Ted Robert's scenario--even though we don't believe that it's the most likely one-- certainly is still in the realm of possibility I don't think there would be any chance of a recession, but there could be some slackening of growth At the present time we think there is enough momentum that growth probably will be coming in higher than the 43 percent; we're thinking more in terms of 5 percent  I think we've been fairly consistent in ignoring those kinds of considerations  You'd like to see them all higher?  I want to respond to your comment that we might want to say something qualitative about 1985 Even though I know that we don't want to imply an automatic quid pro quo, which would be a tighter fiscal policy and easier monetary policy, it does seem to me that we have an obligation to spell out the overall terms [unintelligible] of the economic profile of 1985--if we decide to go that far--and that we ought to do it by starting out with different assumptions meaningful action to reduce the budget deficit and the absence of that It seems to me that we have an obligation not simply to preach this but to show our best view of what differences there would be in the economy, even though I know it's not clear beyond 1985  I'm sorry I was just saying that if the Chairman is going to spell out qualitative views in regard to 1985, we ought to describe the scenario in general terms if there is meaningful action to reduce the budget deficit and if there is not With regard to the monetary aggregates, it seems to me that at the very minimum we should raise the M3 range 1/2 point to make it equal to the M2 range I think it's a little restrictive for the same reasons that Steve has described And it looks strange; I don't think it makes any sense to have it lower than the M2 range In general, even though I'm sympathetic to what Frank says, I don't see that tactically at this point we can afford to drop everything but the credit target I think that would be interpreted in some quarters as being politically motivated I'm [not] quite as cynical as I was a few months ago as to the markets reacting differently to a monitoring range as against a target range for Ml I have the sense that the markets are being somewhat less knee-jerk in their reaction to the weekly Ml figure So, it seems to me it would be appropriate to continue with our present structure of the three target ranges--for credit, M2, and M3--and a monitoring range for Ml That's all I have at the moment  Do you mean lock ourselves in on that one?  What would you expect to happen in the real economy in '85 if we made a significant cut in the money target for '85 and the Congress had not or was not taking any action on the fiscal side? I'm not necessarily disagreeing with you It's not a provocative question; I'm just asking what your honest guess is Would we have a recession in '85?  Yes, but in practice we don't vote that way What would you do right now? Would you ease monetary policy?  No I don't know of any this large But there certainly are lags; these things don't correspond exactly And it's really the reversal in direction that is usually most picked up by the markets when they are looking at some [unintelligible] In 1978 when the dollar was sinking one reason we felt that we could probably undertake a major intervention that would stick--and we did it in November '78--was because the current account deficit was no longer increasing and indeed was beginning to shrink in response to the more competitive dollar that we had in the year-and-a-half before that So, I don't know of any such situation; in fact, there's no question about it These numbers are so huge now that there's nothing comparable The largest current account deficit that we ran in the  -50-    12/19-20/83  late '70s was in the neighborhood of $15 billion We're looking next year at a deficit of probably $80 billion And there is no other industrialized country that has run a deficit of more than $15 to $18 billion  I don't think it's a sustainable situation in the long run One can make an argument that it's not a time bomb--that when the dollar comes off it will come off gradually and moderately I don't believe that I believe that the longer it goes up and stays up, the faster it will come down when expectations change What I don't have any feeling for is the comment that I frequently hear--and I think Henry said this--that when the inflow of dollars stops because of the change in expectations about the exchange rate, that is going to have a very major upward effect on our interest rates I'm not sure that that's so I don't know what the interest rate effect of that will be because it is sometimes argued that the banks can bring enough back in the Eurodollar market that we wouldn't get that much of a movement in interest rates I don't know whether Paul has a view on that We may end up with just a very big impact on the exchange rate and a very minor impact on interest rates from the cessation of the inflow of foreign funds What do you think, Paul?  The interest rates?  At a minimum it probably will force much more rapid devaluations of the weaker currencies in the EMS And it might even make it almost intolerable, depending on the Italian and French policies It certainly will mean much more strain on the EMS  -51-    12/19-20/83  Everybody has deficits  In fact, there is a Machiavellian theory which, of course, nobody here subscribes to You can argue that intervention in this penny ante amount is simply a way of discrediting intervention as a policy  -52-    12/19-20/83  Second  This is halfway between existing policy and snugging up  I think there's a difference, even though it's a nuance, between ""B,"" retaining existing policy, and your proposal, Mr Chairman Since I indicated yesterday that I was torn between retaining existing policy and a very slight snugging up, I think your approach tries to bridge that You said you would maintain at least the existing degree of restraint and you would have more restraint depending on the continued strength of economic recovery and you would drop out the section on lesser restraint so that the directive is somewhat asymmetric Basically, that poises us to do some snugging but it doesn't actually do the snugging We would stick with the $650 million for the time being but if we see continuing strength in the economic recovery, and particularly if that's reinforced by money numbers, then we would do the snugging up I don't know--we wouldn't need a conference call then, would we, at that point? Based on that directive, that would permit some snugging up  -61-    12/19-20/83  Right  Suppose we get the continuing strength or ebullience in the economic recovery but we don't get M1 growth, would you still do a little snugging?  -63-    12/19-20/83  If it comes out at 7 percent, inflationary expectations will increase another notch, even though the actual hard data won't show [more inflation]  But you're talking only about the last four months of sluggish M1 growth I don't understand  Maybe the conclusion is that you need an erratic enough policy to eventually bring about a recession that brings down the inflation  I'd be reluctant, though, to raise the federal funds range for the same reason, even though I know we're getting near the higher end of it But it seems to me that we're not going to hit the higher end and I think it would give the wrong signal I think we can continue using the [current] range as long as we retain a money market directive and the markets know it has very little relevance When we had a more automatic feedback reaction from money supply movements, then it was a reasonable constraint But why do we bother to continue to put the range in there?  Shouldn't we put in ""Merry Christmas"" or something like that?  It doesn't make any difference  So why spend any time on it? In fact, the advantage of knocking off the halves is that it looks less precise  People who know what we're doing--  Yes I still think it's more accurate to say ""should the aggregates expand more rapidly and/or the economic recovery continue at""--I don't know what word you would want to use, Paul  Because the way it reads now we're kind of locked in depending on the aggregates  That's an acceptable way of getting a bit of flexibility there  Is there some advantage to compressing the period?  Do you need more than one week? "
2645,1984-01-30,SOLOMON," We'll be deeply honored  Instead of stockpiling, the Treasury is de-stockpiling It was a very unusual thing that they did, paying half of the United States' quota--the gold tranche of the quota--in yen and deutschmarks But they wanted to reduce their war chest  Until the dollar reaches extremely weak levels, we're not likely to get any really meaningful central bank cooperation on major intervention So, Frank, the only reservation I have to increasing the war chest of foreign currencies,    1/30-31/84  which as you know I have always been in favor of--and we did follow [that approach] until this Administration came in--is that even that war chest is going to be of very limited value unless we get very strong cooperation by other central banks And we would not get that in the first stages of a--  But everything will work the wrong way when it starts, because as interest rates rise foreigners will get out of the bond market and the stock market, even more so given their expectations on the dollar We'll get a combined reversal of the inflows I agree with Frank that [the exchange value of the dollar] has been so high for such a long period of time that when it turns the probability is that there will be a very substantial move downward  And I take it that may very well be why it's going to be a long period of time yet--maybe half a year, a year, or even longer--before this turn comes  So moved  So moved  Before you do that, let me ask a simple question I see that mortgage loan delinquencies did not really come down in 1983 and are running at very high rates Why hasn't this big wave of prosperity since 1982 reduced mortgage loan delinquencies?  Yes, go ahead  Is this mostly in the industrial states--the heavy smokestack industry?  How much of the assumed fall in the exchange value of the dollar over the projection period is correlated with that 1/2 point rise?  You're crediting me with a more subtle question than I asked  Given the fact that we're moving into a period of much more utilization of capacity, the falling exchange value of the dollar in time will have much more of an inflationary impact than it otherwise would Now, if I understood you--maybe I didn't catch it earlier--you are projecting that over the 1984-85 period there will be a 1/2 point higher rise in inflation due to the fall in the dollar, ceteris paribus Is that right?  And how much of a fall in the trade- weighted value is that?  For our labor force in 1985, as I remember the chart, you are projecting an increase only a shade more than 1 percent  You have about a 1 percent increase in the participation rate as I read it  Let me ask you a general question I assume that there is no change in the projection of revenues and expenditures--that there is no new action on the deficit Is that correct?  -10-    1/30-31/84  Now, maybe I should be smarter and understand this, but what conclusions do you come to about the so- called ""crowding out""? What is the impact later in '84 and in '85 on medium- and long-term interest rates? Would you just take that as a given coming out of monetary policy?  Well, I know that, but that could change from the present situation  But if I remember correctly you have only a very modest rise in mortgage rates over the remainder of the projection period  How do you get an assumption that the rise will be that modest? Is that a conclusion arrived at independently or is that taken from Steve [Axilrod] or something?  Even in 1985 when unemployment gets down to 7 percent, housing is still relatively stable, business investment is strong, the deficit isn't reduced, and you have an extremely modest rise in interest rates  Is that Wallich's rule--the ratio is one to one?  They don't limit the amount of the interest rate movement each year?  It sounds to me that in the scenario that most of us tend to think is more likely than not--if not in '84 at least in '85--of rising interest rates combined with a falling dollar and rising inflation, that we won't get a tapering off of the cycle but a very quick turnaround Then 1986 might be a period of distinctly negative growth or recession rather than a tapering off That seems to me more likely, given this set of imbalances we're talking about basically coming to a head  And keep the risk It gives them recourse on the paper  Do those who are saying that M1 should be reinstated as a target mean by that that we should return to the automatic feedback on the nonborrowed reserve path that we had before, with all the volatility in the short-run [interest rate] movements? Or do we get to the Henry Wallich view--and I want to ask Henry what he means by this in practice or whether it is just symbolism Since you said you're opposed to that kind of automaticity but you want to give more importance to M1, by that do you mean we  -25-    1/30-31/84  should target it rather than have it as a monitoring range for the fourth-quarter-over-fourth-quarter period? And if so, what does that really mean then?  So, if I understand you, Henry, you would continue with intermeeting directives that are written in terms of more or less restraint rather than returning to the language of the earlier intermeeting directives?  Well, of course, I have much less difficulty with that approach because what you're really saying is that we allow significant movements in M1 to influence our management of the fed funds rate gradually over a period of time  Well, in managing our reserve position we're guided by the fed funds rate  It shows the accuracy of our reserve calculations, right?  Anyway, on the alternatives, even though alternative II strikes me as acceptable, I think there is some case for reducing M2 to 6 to 9 percent rather than 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent But that's probably a quibble At first, I was in favor of moving the M1 monitoring range to 4 to 7 percent, but I think that detracts from the de-emphasis that I, like Lyle Gramley, continue to prefer So, I would stick with alternative II with the suggestion that M2 be cut 1/2 point both on the top and bottom  Is it seasonal or is it revision due to the benchmark mostly?  If it's put on a co-equal basis, it will become primary  When you say we exercised judgment, are you referring to good judgment or bad judgment?  Farm prices in the late '20s  Psychologically, it makes more sense if we're going to cut 1/2 point to do it on M2 and not M1 First of all, M2 still would be getting greater emphasis than M1 even if we [reinstate some] emphasis on M1 Secondly, if we start using ranges like 4 to 7-1/2 percent, that implies a precision that is [unwarranted for] M1 If we do want to make a tightening gesture, it seems to me that the logic is for making it on M2  It's a weak credit [measure except] for mergers and acquisitions  I wasn't being entirely facetious Just in this proposed Texaco takeover of Getty there was $8 billion of bank credit  While we are waiting, is there any way of making the phrase [about international transactions] in the opening sentence somewhat less silly?  I'm sure of it ""Any less sustainable""--  ""Minimize the damage on the international"" No, I mean it; that's what we're trying to do  It's going to get worse  I would make the opposite suggestion Delete ""for the time being""  Well, I guess we're pretty evenly split, but for those of us who would like M1 to be kept as a monitoring range rather than a target, this makes it a target with caveats and it seems to me that that phrase is important But the markets tend to overreact--we all know that--in terms of the importance it attaches to M1 It's in that context that we have to look at how our language will be received  How about unpredictable?  Would you rather say something about ""in light of the changing composition of M1, its erratic behavior""? That's a little too strong, right?  Use ""volatility of M1"" rather than talk about velocity  -44-    1/30-31/84  What happens to interest elasticity, Steve, if the Congress removes the prohibition of paying interest on demand deposits?  I don't think there's too much danger, Lyle, for misinterpretation of that  Second  What about ""principal weight""? Is that any better? It says it more succinctly  Right It's putting it in but in a different way But we do say ""for the time being""  Sure, it's hedged all over  Because this time if there's a leak, it's squarely going to be on us  Yes, but we're overlooking the main point, which is that everybody at this table has heard the decision And you can count--  The question of whether they come to New York or not is only one aspect of it I don't want everybody to assume that because it comes to the New York Reserve Bank [that any leak is from] the House committee or New York  That means that if we made it December to March the numbers would probably be around 8 percent [for M2 and M3] and around 7 percent [for M1]  Right But rounding them we would probably come up with a 1 point rise in M1 then  Well, it is more neutral now; we're simply saying ""maintain"" If I remember correctly, last time we said ""at least maintain""  This is new house sales or existing house sales?  I think your position has changed, Chuck, hasn't it?  Right It's a little more consistent  -60-    1/30-31/84  I think that makes more sense  I think that Steve's proposed operational paragraph on page 18 is quite evenhanded  It takes care of Lyle's point  I vote for neutrality in relation to Lyle's scenario I see no reason why we should signal that lesser restraint is more easily triggered than tighter restraint  Why don't you ask for a preliminary show of hands between evenhanded and--  It certainly is a market [expectation]  A quarter of a point is probably the maximum we're talking about and I don't think that is going to change the international situation in terms of LDCs and the debt problem  Amen  Economic recovery in the other industrialized countries is picking up faster than we expected The very minor changes that might result out of this policy in terms of interest rate levels are not going to be a significant factor  Unless we have a move of a whole point But if we're talking about what I assume you are talking about--say, a quarter of a point--  It has been $400 to $450 million, although the average in the last several weeks would probably be more like $500 to $600 million  We have to allow a certain amount of bouncing around, I think, even if it shows up in the last two days; otherwise people are going to feel that we're really pegging the rate "
2676,1984-03-26,SOLOMON," I propose New York  They have been  Right Does that need a formal motion?  You all have copies of the report that we sent around containing our recommendation I might summarize the key points Before I do that, I should say that none of us on the subcommittee assumed that the leak that the GAO investigated came from the Federal Reserve System But we felt that the GAO report did have some basis for saying that our procedures were somewhat lax, or could be tightened up, and that there was a very large number of people with    3/26-27/84  access [to FOMC materials] So, we looked at many alternative ways of handling the access problem Basically, our recommendations were in four major areas first, updated security classifications, with an addition of one new category to the two old ones; secondly, refinements in the procedures for distribution and handling of classified documents; thirdly, stronger procedures for making sure that people are familiar with the rules; and finally, a reduction in the number of people authorized to see the more sensitive documents  Briefly, the new procedures call for use of double-sealed envelopes and distinctive cover sheets and for restrictions on copying Also, the rules will be circulated annually to each person on the access list who would sign off on them In regard to the number of people who have access to documents, our proposal calls for certain numbers At the Board and at the New York Reserve Bank, there is a reduction of five each in the Class I list and of six each in the Class II list At the other Banks there is a reduction of one each in the Class I list and a limit of seven for access to Class II material The most important switch we made in the classification of documents was classifying part I of the Greenbook as Class II The systemwide results of these restrictions and reductions in access work out as follows The Class I list is reduced from 86 to 67 people other than the members of the FOMC themselves; and the Class II list is reduced from 348 to 183 Even though we think these are reasonable, we did provide for ad hoc exceptions by the Chairman and exceptions for ad hoc assignments, which could be granted by governors and presidents I should also point out that the limitations in each category--for example, seven for Class II documents at Reserve Banks other than New York--apply separately to each type of document Those having access to Part I of the Greenbook, for example, may be different from those with access to the Managers' reports I think that summarizes the main recommendations We would recommend that, after discussion and questions, the FOMC adopt this  Well, what we did do for the first time was recognize the de facto practice by including it in the formal proposals But we did not feel that it was up to us--and frankly, I'm not sure it's very practical without raising more dust than it's worth--to restrict access to people in the Administration  But they don't get the Bluebook or the Open Market directives or the policy records What they do have are the two Managers' reports, and I think they're entitled to have    3/26-27/84  them because those are needed both in the managing of the public debt and, of course, in the foreign exchange market where the Secretary of the Treasury [has responsibility]  I think it's the weekly they get  What specifically would you propose to restrict, Nancy?  The only thing I could suggest would be to advise them that we have reclassified Part I of the Greenbook into a Class II document and that the Chairman and the FOMC would appreciate it if the three principals who get it--the Secretary of the Treasury, the Chairman of the Council, and the Director of OMB--would take comparable measures to restrict access at their own agencies    3/26-27/84  Now that we're moving [up its classification]  Yes, it does We did a spot check at about a half dozen of the Banks and talked with the staff here There was one Bank that had five [on its access list] although most of them had four As we analyzed who had a need to know--I don't mean in the formal sense of Class III, but in the sense of how the operations went at the different Reserve Banks--seven seemed a reasonable number And then Chuck Partee, Bob Black, and I discussed that Originally we were talking about restricting it to three but some of the presidents felt that would be excessively restrictive and that four would be a reasonable number  Well, that was our intention Now, we made some recommendations on systematizing the downgrading of a document's classification The Bluebook would be downgraded from Class I to the new Class II at the time of the release of the policy record and directive And then it would be downgraded to Class III four months later, roughly; in other words, after a six-month period old Class II is downgraded to Class III  It's still Class I prior to the meeting, right  Each Reserve Bank would handle it but there would not be a standing ad hoc  And under our new procedures it would require that the Secretary of the FOMC be notified immediately  Well, I don't understand Given the fact that we all have such good attendance records here, I gather that you're not talking about the very rare case when your first vice president would be attending [an FOMC meeting] in your absence, Roger?  He cannot participate on the morning call  So, I don't understand What does the first vice president do in your Bank in regard to the FOMC directives if he's not in on the call?  In effect, it really becomes five, doesn't it then?  A permanent ad hoc?  I see  I have no objection to that if that is the consensus view of the Committee and if it's clearly understood that it would only be in the president's absence  Use ""Federal Reserve personnel""  The alternative, though--to do what you have suggested--is giving out the Bluebooks on Monday morning We checked around and there were objections to that because presidents and members of the Committee would not have a chance to consult with their three other people So, I don't know what the alternative is  Of course, if it's the consensus view here, I'd go along with that But there is one disadvantage to sending it out Thursday night and to all the Banks having it Friday morning We'd be adding one critical weekend of possible leaks And that two- to three-day period before we have a meeting is when the media is the most focused On the other hand, with the general view--  If it were on Wednesday instead of Tuesday or instead of Monday and Tuesday  Thursday to get it to us on Friday  What you're saying is that if we were to try and get the Bluebook out to the Reserve Banks on Friday and you don't finish preparing it until midnight on Thursday, then you are not talking about the pouch but some kind of special express service that will get it to us by Friday afternoon I don't think we'd all get it by Friday  I know, but it comes in over the weekend What I'm saying, though, is that if it doesn't go out until sometime after midnight on Thursday, I don't think everybody would get it on Friday in time to--  It's fairly easy to deal with All Mr Bernard would have to do is call that number and say ""We're about to transmit"" and some designated person would just stand there and physically take it off the machine  Our report doesn't get into this question It seems to me that if the Chairman wants, he can authorize a trial run on it next time  Yes, but that had to do with the day of the directors' meetings and the last day of the settlement week  Do all Banks have their directors' meetings on Thursday?  So, it's either Thursday or Friday No Bank has a day different from that for directors' meetings?  What rationale would you give in your public announcement that gives a few months' notice?  There are some people, I think, who misinterpret the Federal Reserve eligibility as a good housekeeping seal We learned more about bankers acceptances when we looked into the Mexican line than we did at any other time  But can we really have an announcement that we will be discontinuing this within a few months without raising questions that we think some banks are shaky or without the market wondering what lies behind our doing this?  We could have a line in the announcement that says that if the budgetary deficit--  You are recommending, though, that you continue to have the authority just as you have the authority, although you haven't used it, to buy them outright?  Does this require a formal vote? Or what does it require?  Well, one could conceive of a situation in which we would want to use the authority and we might want to use the authority without waiting for the next FOMC meeting Presumably the Executive Committee could authorize that if there were some reason  There is an Executive Committee on foreign currency  Why not give them a Blackbook?  Now you have to ask how many people read it some of the time  On those 22 reschedulings that have been held up, one went through; it was controversial The new government came in and they basically want better terms On those, what the banks have offered them is to reconsider the maturities but not the spreads, and so far there has been no movement because everything is held up in Argentina It's not only the IMF thing, which of course is the key There is also still that billion dollars of money that they could make available to Argentina that would be coming back to them as interest Then there are the 22 reschedulings on which there is no movement So, there is an impasse  Or in the Eurodollar market  -26-    3/26-27/84  I looked at the hit that the New York banks would take if the loans become nonperforming on March 31 It doesn't add up to a lot is the most vulnerable but the numbers still are not terribly large yet, although it has a definite impact  They don't have to charge off anything automatically just because a loan is nonperforming  Adequacy is in the eye of the beholder  Well, if interest rates keep going up, the question is going to arise as to whether the [unintelligible] banks are capable of devising some kind of new relationship in regard to the increase or whether the financing put together by the IMF is going to have to be revised in the middle of the year, although that could create consequences In other words, there has been some talk, but it has only been in general terms, about the banks and a cap on  -28-    3/26-27/84  payment of interest rates; and any rise in interest rates would be capitalized so that it wouldn't disturb the cash flow projections and the financing that has been arranged for the year So far there is nothing very concrete, even though there has been a good deal of talk  No, and I don't think it's very likely, or practical either, for them to organize and talk that way because among the banks that aren't coming along there is a mixture There are very few of the important regional banks that don't come along eventually, although there may be 30 or 40 of the smaller banks  -29-    3/26-27/84  But even then, wasn't it couched in terms of asking the banks what their view was on this matter and whether they were going to go along or weren't going to go along? [Unintelligible] stating the Board's policy as we saw it but saying that, of course, they have to make up their own mind  Well, we did those about a year ago  Yes, in the case of Brazil there were a few but not very many  A four-pfenig drop  There were none  Motion  You're talking about 2 percent gross, before servicing debt?  What is the estimate of domestic demand--at least 1 percent more than GNP?  It seems to me that it's very difficult to have as useful a discussion, and ultimately a decision on whether and how much to tighten open market operations, if we don't factor in what the Board of Governors may do on the discount rate Let's say we tightened along the lines of alternative B and presumably got a fed funds rate in the neighborhood of 10-1/2 percent If then the Board were to move the discount rate a half point, we might not get a full 50 basis points out of that move coming on top of this because there is some expectational component But I think we would get very close to that So, we really would end up with something virtually close to alternative C It seems to me that we have this problem that doesn't usually arise This time we have a combination of circumstances where the markets are expecting a discount rate move There are some good arguments for that There are some arguments against it, I'm aware If we want to be in the posture of not sending a strong signal that we're taking the initiative--that we are simply not resisting the market's tendency to drive up interest rates--there is an argument against a discount rate move If we want to indicate a more forceful view, then there is an argument for it All I'm saying, though, is that I don't see how we can know whether to talk in terms of the objective as alternative B or alternative C unless we have some sense as to whether there is going to be a discount rate change I realize that you would be reluctant to talk about that in a large group but I don't know quite how to address this question  I'm talking about rates  But a considerable number of people on this Committee have an interest in interest rates not just in the monetary growth And I cannot see that this isn't an extremely relevant factor Now, we can always give two votes, I suppose one on one assumption and one on the other assumption  May I make a comment at this time? There's a danger in a discount rate rise in the sense that the political critics in the developing countries in Latin America may be able to get somewhat more ammunition from the Federal Reserve actively raising interest rates than from a posture of it being the market [raising rates] But I think that's very marginal From a purely domestic point of view, I would say that it would be better to raise the discount rate--if you're talking about alternatives I'm giving my personal view in response to your hypothetical question to Karen  Well, in order not to be repetitious, my bottom line is alternative B I would strongly oppose recasting the directive in the direction of automaticity And I would assume that the Board of Governors in its wisdom, if it did decide on a discount rate hike, would lower the borrowing assumption somewhat I have no problems with alternative B  We're not only putting it up front but also we have gone back to a monetary aggregates directive  But the bigger problem is the real economy; that's what we're concerned about It's not so much where the monetary aggregates stand that we are all concerned about in the end I think you're leading us right back in the direction of automaticity in this directive  Yes, I understand You know, the market tends to over-interpret, and I think the changes in the wording of the directive are reinforced by putting M1 in front Okay, we put M1 further back But I think this will tend to awaken expectations  -71-    3/26-27/84  that we may once again be on that roller coaster Nobody is going to believe necessarily that this is the last ride, particularly if the economic data continue relatively strong And then there would be expectations of [rates] going to very high levels I just think it's disturbing to move back in that direction I realize we haven't moved back 100 percent in terms of the way the short run feeds back with the nonborrowed reserve paths  Right  Well, what does it mean then to have your second sentence?  No, I mean the third sentence where you have ""greater reserve restraint"" What does that mean then?  Well, I don't think that is a strong enough reason to convey such a strong [unintelligible] impression, which is what I think will be conveyed by recasting it  I don't feel strongly whether it's 7 to 11 percent or 7-1/2 to 11-1/2 percent I'm always bothered by 1/2 points  The markets may overread what that new ceiling is going to mean  What do you mean? What kind of pressure?  I think there is a difference between starting off the way the Chairman has been talking about on the degree of reserve restraint and then saying the Committee believes these to be consistent with intermeeting monetary targets of X and Y or whatever, and putting it this way The substance of what we do may not be different, but I think it will be the impression in the markets that we are returning toward much more emphasis on the monetary aggregates, and more volatility in interest rates then becomes a possibility And I don't think that's a helpful thing at this time  -74-    3/26-27/84  Well, in substance I said I could live with either 7 or 11--  I think Lyle is right that we probably need a little more movement and, therefore, even though I could live with either I would have a slight preference for 7-1/2 to 11-1/2 percent myself  If we don't take them too seriously, I think they're fine  When you say you want asymmetrical wording, what you are really saying is that you want a stronger interest rate response if there is continuing excessive strength in the economy and the monetary aggregates  -77-    3/26-27/84  Yes, but even if you're more concerned as I think we all are--that's where the risks are--why does that argue necessarily for an asymmetrical articulation in the directive?  I would agree with you if we were simply going to react mechanically to an easing of money growth But I'm interpreting that there's not going to be a substantive change in our policy [approach]--that we're still going to be looking at money in the context of the business expansion and inflationary pressures But I would agree If we were going to be reacting more to money growth in the future, then we have to word it asymmetrically for the reasons that you just indicated, Lyle  I wouldn't  I think there probably is a majority for these numbers Maybe you ought to get an informal showing  But won't they be influenced by the carryover? If they see that they have run very large excess reserves,  -81-    3/26-27/84  won't they be inclined to avoid such high excess reserves the following period because of the carryover?  Weren't they also influenced by widespread expectations that rates would rise or the possibility of a discount rate rise?  And I think that influenced the level of excess reserves I don't think we should assume, Paul, that it's going to continue at these levels  It's not going to change the fed funds rate?  -83-    3/26-27/84  Well, I think it will Peter?  I don't think so A half point is what the market is going to--  In fact, a quarter point move would carry an interesting message If we went back to quarter point moves, it would be interpreted as meaning that we're not going to have a lot of volatility in the next year--that basically we are thinking in terms of more cautious moves and that that will be the likely pattern over the next year I don't think we want that interpretation either, for the reasons that Lyle has pressed so strongly I think a half point is--  And you do have the flexibility you're going to need in case we are wrong on the borrowing and for some reason the fed funds rate that falls out of the borrowing assumption is on the down side I think that's pretty clear  Chuck, I was telling Paul that my board of directors had indicated already that we should not tighten -- not raise the discount rate--in their view until we actually see increased inflation They argue that at this point it's too early to take away the punch bowl They want us to wait until we actually see it; I say we may be too late then  Presumably, there is some sense of an upward limit If the Board raised the discount rate and we found out by not reducing the borrowing assumption that fed funds were trading in the neighborhood of 11 percent--  It could easily be between 10-1/4 and 10-3/4 percent  No Without a discount rate increase  Depending on where the fed funds rate is  As I said earlier, I can live with either 7 to 11 percent or 7-1/2 to 11-1/2 percent I don't feel that strongly about it And I think you have a majority for the numbers on the three Ms as they are  And we have $1 billion on borrowing?  But arguing the other side, if we have a range of 7 to 11 percent and the funds rate persistently for a week or longer goes above the 11 percent, then we'll have a consultation So, I don't know that we're really blocking any action, Jerry, if we use 7 to 11 percent Do you think there would be a significant public relations impact of having 11-1/2 percent as the upper bound when it comes out?  Yes, They are going to see that we suspended the ceiling a week before I had not noticed the market paying a lot of attention to these changes in the range  I'm assuming that the direction we're moving, with alternative B, is going to give us at least a 25 basis point further move, in addition to what the market has done in interest rates And I think the Chairman is going to make darn sure that it comes out that way In other words, there is going to be an  -92-    3/26-27/84  impression in the market that we have tightened if we come out with alternative B  Okay, we can't pin it down that much But I'm assuming that there will be some upward movement if we go in this direction Are you saying that you don't believe that or are you saying that's too little?  Well, why don't we presidents walk out of the room while you fellows--  We're all going to be at the Wye Plantation  As confirmation of what they suspect  I'm going to vote for both sides  The trouble with this whole process is that there's no quid-pro-quo bargain I would trade my vote on some of those last votes for the wording of the directive you're saving The way you're slicing us off, it's a salami tactic  But if you thought of it that we are under net borrowed reserves--  We'd have to say Variant I, then Would you have the same problem with not knowing what Variant I means?  ""To increase""  Since you can live with Variant I, then the real issue, it seems to me is Do we stay with that kind of wording in the directive or do we go to the new wording? What I'm concerned about is that this new wording leads us in a direction of more automaticity in the monetary aggregates  But there's also going to be a heck of a lot of concern if people think that we are going back to the kind of volatility we had in interest rates, which I think is damaging both substantively and perception-wise  If we follow the Chairman's suggestion on the directive as shown on the paper he passed out, we would be encouraging an increased emphasis on weekly volatility Moreover, I think the impression that we are going to be more influenced than we have been by money growth is going to lead to expectations that maybe by the end of the year we won't have seen just  -97-    3/26-27/84  a point or point and a half move, but something significantly larger than that  I feel that we did a lot of damage to the economy by the enormous swings [in interest rates] from 8 percent to 20 percent and then down again I think if we had stayed longer at tighter levels, we wouldn't have had to go up to 20 percent Now, I understand the rationale, but I think the notion that we don't influence interest rates--that all we are doing is targeting money growth--has gotten very thin in the country We moved away from that and we used the excuse that the velocity of circulation was no longer in a typical traditional relationship What would you say? You have to say that we're back again in a period where the velocity of circulation is a little more dependable And this all fits in with the feeling that we would get in the market that we're returning to the pre-summer of 1982 [approach to policy]  [Unintelligible] the plural ""maintains""  Well, I don't have any trouble understanding it in view of our discussion I think it is going to look a little strange because, after all, it's not unusual for there to be fluctuations of borrowing in one direction somewhat unexpectedly And yet I don't think we have noted that before in directives, have we?  I think there is going to be a variety of reactions in the market as to what that sentence means--  --because they haven't seen it before Therefore, they are going to have a field day with it  We know what we're starting from; we haven't told them before anything about whether the initial borrowing assumption is--  So that's what we're ending up with Would you put M1 last in the order? Do you want M2, M3, and Ml?  Every little bit of symbolism counts  That's the way we've been doing it  Let me ask this Are you saying that if you were asked by a Congressional committee whether we are giving equal weight to M1 these days with M2 and M3, you would say yes?  They are now trading US government securities in London on an increasingly large scale, so in New York offices are now opening at 400 in the morning, as soon as the London market opens There is around-the-world trading in government securities  If you don't think this gives it too much importance, we could simply say ""more substantial growth in the monetary aggregates and the rate of credit growth"" in that second sentence  The market knows that we don't get data on the technical classification--total domestic nonfinancial debt--until after a considerable lag We get some indications of various types of credit growth with less of a lag and, therefore, by leaving the rate of credit growth we are making it a little more  -104-    3/26-27/84  general and a little more operative Otherwise, they know it's not that operative since we don't get that particular data  You are going to let Lyle [unintelligible] your explanation and you are going to be set free  The recommendations of our Committee said specifically a ""normal"" type of meeting We didn't get into any recommendations on what is executive only [material] The Chairman is saying handle it in the usual way  SPEAKER(?) It's all right to tell them? Your memo says only the Presidents receive the directive "
2704,1984-05-21,SOLOMON," But as you pointed out, that was to a large degree in response to the belief that US monetary policy would be easier, whereas what you're talking about is a direct loss of confidence  At Bretton Woods over the weekend a couple of people asked me whether there would be a spillover effect in terms of foreign banks' reluctance to fund other US banks  Obviously, I said no There is that view floating around a bit; that question is being asked in banking circles  My feeling--my hope, I guess--is that the prompt action by the US authorities on Continental Illinois would tend to prevent that kind of spillover [effect] It's probably    5/21-22/84  realistic to assume that there is a somewhat more alert, more skeptical, attitude abroad and that if there were another situation, we probably would see some more of that  I hope you assured them they were  There is some questioning by foreign banks--I've heard this in a couple of places--as to whether it is 100 percent risk-free at [every] stage of the process because they are not familiar with the way the FDIC would step in and what would happen They wonder whether there is some point in time where they would be at risk  [The guarantee] was so sweeping that they had difficulty believing it Also, some of them say Well, isn't the unlimited liquidity commitment of the Federal Reserve limited to the amount of collateral that Continental Illinois can put up?  I know It doesn't say so because we got advice in the course of our discussion that that would be counterproductive But on the other hand, there's a heck of a lot of collateral in Continental Illinois  The great majority of dealers have been losing a lot of money for quite a few months; they don't seem to be able to hedge well enough Most of them are in some kind of net long position and I don't quite know why I don't know enough about the futures market to know why they can't seem to hedge better This is what I've heard from half a dozen of them  Well, I'm not sure that that was the reason They argue that as underwriters they were not able to hedge  But the overall profit situation of the dealers has been very bad  You follow the thrifts closely  Would you expect the Congress next year, if the thrifts are in the same difficulty, to extend the capital fusion program or whatever that's called?  Well, I don't know whether those New York savings banks can continue their present situation as late as that I would assume they'd need a resolution of that  Is that mostly the rental equivalency?  In the right context, that's worth making public because I haven't seen that anywhere  On this question of prices, what I find strange is that people are expecting somewhat higher inflation levels--you hear a lot of worries about it and explanations about what is happening and why we don't see much investor demand--but at the same time those same people would admit that they don't expect inflation to hit higher than half of what it was in the previous two recoveries I'm talking about the great majority of them; there are a few [exceptions] We hit rates of 12 to 14 percent in the two previous recoveries and you don't hear people in the financial markets or industrialists I speak with expecting it to go to more than roughly half of that But that seems to get lost It's a perspective that I think is a terribly important development It holds out some promise that during the next recession it will dip and in the next recovery we'll be able to hold inflation at lower levels than this So, I don't know why there is so much fear of inflation I have the sense that it is almost a rationalization of the reluctance on the part of investors to buy They are more agnostic They don't have any sense of confidence but [say] that their reluctance to buy is so significantly motivated by fear of inflation  -18-    5/21-22/84  Institutions don't hold securities the way they used to; even longer-term investors don't think in the same terms that they used to Therefore, they just don't want to sit with big paper losses because it looks very bad and it reflects on them and hurts their position in these various institutions where they work So, even if they are fairly confident that inflation is not going to go up to anywhere near the previous levels, they don't want to be seen sitting with substantial paper losses in their portfolio  Is the rate of foreclosure on farm land still the same as it was a few months ago?  Well, the wheat picture looks a heck of a lot better Contrary to expectations up until last week, it is now viewed that the Soviet Union is going to have a big crop failure  -20-    5/21-22/84  again due to the dry weather Wheat prices have moved up 3 percent in the last few days and they are going to go higher as that gets confirmed more and more I don't know to what extent improvement of wheat [prospects] will make a significant change  Let me make a comment on that I got worried about the amount of financing going into leveraged buyouts, so I sent a team of supervisors to all the leading New York banks to look at that We came to the conclusion that there were 8 banks, and 4 particularly, that were being too aggressive and too optimistic in their assumptions on the amount of credit they are extending on leveraged buyouts, which we went over loan by loan And we counselled them to be cautious Whether it will do any good or not, I don't know, but we took that initiative And we came to the conclusion that the biggest point of vulnerability was not so much on the interest rate assumptions but on the--in some cases--very optimistic assumptions on the cash value of those parts of the leveraged buyout companies that they were going to try to unload immediately if the deal went through In some cases the banks were giving financing equivalent to 100 percent of relatively optimistic assumptions And in that connection, although only slightly related, I've had reports that some of the European banks that participate in the lines of credit for financing big takeovers are beginning to pull back a little Two of the European bankers told me that their medium sized banks that have been participating in these syndicates are beginning to get worried and are pulling back in the financing of some of these big American takeovers  All I will say is that in my area I have a sense that on the one hand things are very, very strong and that at the same time there are enormous financial uncertainties and very poor profits in the financial markets, particularly compared to the last couple of years It creates a very mixed feeling I would assume that the staff forecast is most vulnerable to financial shocks --virtually the same thing you said, Chuck The staff forecast seems very reasonable in the absence of financial shocks, but I think there is an increased possibility compared to previous cycles that it could be upset by something happening For planning purposes I think one has to go with something that basically tracks the situation and  -26-    5/21-22/84  previous experience in recoveries And that seems to [be true of the staff forecast]  I agree I think we ought to go for alternative B and $1 billion of borrowing and leave the fed funds range as it is I think that is a prudent position to take  I'm assuming what Peter has told me that we have been catching up with the lag in the last week through our matched sales operations for the borrowings at the Chicago Fed So, once the psychological situation changes--barring that reaction from the banks that Steve is talking about--I'm assuming that within 4 or 5 days more, maybe a week, we probably will be back up to the more normal levels that our policy and our nonborrowed reserve path indicate--namely the 10-1/2 percent area  Why did it catch up so quickly?  It does reflect a slight improvement from 6 days ago  But after that initial run-off of the overnight money, they were expecting to lose about $900 million to $1 billion a week And I don't see that deterioration Do the numbers add up to that?  Did the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago end up funding the FDIC?  The political environment is going to get even tenser later in the year  The asymmetry derives just as much from having ""somewhat"" lesser restraint, whereas we don't have ""somewhat"" in the--  I would go for Chuck's version because there is already a widespread feeling in the markets that we are giving enormous attention to the situation in financial markets I don't think that we're misleading the markets if we do it in a more low-key way Therefore, Chuck's approach strikes me as better We are very vulnerable to the charge--and I don't think the charge is justified--that we're departing from anti-inflationary policy for a temporary reason like Continental Maybe there are a couple of people who feel that alternative B represents primarily that consideration But I think many of us here feel that we'd be going for alternative B anyway, without the Continental situation  What do you mean--should they develop further? You're going to alarm the hell out of everybody!  We're not ignoring it if we use Chuck's language  It's a good living  It's clearly understood  The question in my mind, which is not relevant to our decision here, is that we look like knee-jerk reactors in the sense that the first time we put in financial markets as a thing we consider to modify our behavior is after the Continental Illinois situation Many of us, including the Chairman, certainly were worried about the financial market situation and vulnerability of the banking system before this month of May '84  Okay It does seem to me, though, that you and I are putting more emphasis even on the LDC debt situation as being a constraint on our operations rather than the Continental situation I'm wondering just in the longer term, more as a philosophical speculation, whether maybe we ought to consider having that in there even if Continental settles down I'm saying we should not take it out in the next directive  -40-    5/21-22/84  That's another way of making my point We look like we're reacting to something that caught us by surprise  Oh, nobody's saying we shouldn't All I'm saying is that I don't think we should take it out if Continental settles down And in a sense I'm sorry we didn't have it in earlier  -41-    5/21-22/84  That's what is in the policy record?  I'm not sure I understand why you want the word ""only""  So you're going to have ""a change would be considered only in the context of appraisals,"" right?  That sounds to me that we're less quick to let the influence of the continuing strength of the business expansion, inflationary pressures, etc, etc come through in terms of the monetary policy  I don't read it like that, because in either case it is referring to the change in the aggregates Such a change--namely, a response to the aggregates--would be considered only-- So you're basically limiting it  I find the word ""only"" confusing Do you see that differing interpretation? Is there any great advantage in putting in only, which the Fed watchers will look at and wonder what is happening?  So what are you saying?  Okay But I thought the practical implication of what you were saying was that you don't want the qualifier ""only"" inserted, which we didn't have in the previous directive  I don't want to make a big deal out of it; it's not But if a Fed watcher sees ""only"" this time and not before, does this imply that earlier we were more responsive to the monetary aggregates and now we're less responsive?  My long-term policy  Can we have a show of hands?  We weren't reacting that mechanistically to the aggregates before this and no one seemed to feel dishonest by not having the word ""only"" in at that point I don't know; I wonder if people are going to overread  Instead of saying ""only"" could we say ""such a change would naturally be considered""?  It's not going to influence my vote anyway, of course It's a minor point I don't want to make a big issue out of it "
2734,1984-07-16,SOLOMON," Second  How much does your inflation projection come down if we don't get the 15 percent dollar decline?  Well, we didn't have the drop in the dollar in our model and yet we come out with an inflation projection the same as the staff's I guess that's at the low end, though  With no drop in the dollar we came out about the same as the staff in our inflation [projection]  I think the one thing that throws off the historical relationship between labor costs and prices is the rather unique price constraint influence of imports It is unique in this recovery to such a degree I continue to run into businessmen who keep talking about the fact that even though volume has picked up they can't raise prices; they can't get the margin because of import competition And unless you make an assumption that the exchange rates [are] going to come down significantly, it seems to me you come up with a fairly low projection of inflation  But right now they are more than financing the current account deficit That's why the dollar is rising, you see  And the financial markets in New York--I don't know whether they are right or not--are placing enormous emphasis on the abolition of a 30 percent withholding tax And even though there are very strongly mixed views about it, the possibility that the Treasury might consider bearer bonds is a separate issue There are a lot of people who feel that there are going to be some substantial flows from that; and we're still getting some intrabank assistance as well The dollar is being pulled back from the Eurodollar market, which is helping to finance the current account deficit My sense is that even though, obviously, it's almost a tautology in the long run--neither we nor the world can accept that large current account deficit to finance indefinitely--I wouldn't assume it is going to be in 1985 necessarily that we're going to see that kind of change  He has retracted that inflationary [unintelligible]?  Would you be reassured if we all thought there would be a recession in '86?  That's price deflation?  But even in that situation, a drop in real output would come first and then the price deflation  It's going to try and get you, Henry; it's like Jello!  Perhaps put credit on probation  Keep them  I agree we should keep them the same It seems to me that the fact that they are running over is not a good reason for changing the ranges unless we're prepared to say that we're going to tighten policy or ease policy as a result of changing In other words, it's got to imply a policy change that would be meaningful rather than a statistical adjustment just to come in within the range  It's funny, but I come to the opposite conclusion It seems to me that if we raise the target for credit, we are implying to the markets that we're going to be somewhat easier in our policy than if we don't raise the target It seems to me that there has to be a policy implication to making a midyear adjustment You don't read it that way, I guess  Why?  Particularly since Frank Morris has assured us that this is the one target that we did come in within the range up until the time we monitored--  You'd expect very little, if any, wage increase in the depressed industries What explains the erratic pattern that in some nondepressed industries the increases are still extremely low, whereas in others--?  Well, in New York, they got [6-3/4] percent  There seems to be a qualitative difference in the psychology in the country in that for the second year of a recovery people are being much more careful about wage increases One can either attribute that to the greater intensity of the recession than some earlier recessions or to some feeling that  -28-    7/16-17/84  they can't pass on these wages as easily in price increases I don't know if there is any other explanation  But there is still a difference We did that, as I mentioned, and we still came up--  And come up with a mini-result  They'll go after it, no question  The Treasury is considering various tax proposals  With that same assumption we came up with a 29 percent real growth forecast for '85 That's not too different from the staff's, with their 15 percent [dollar] decline I don't know why we come out so closely to the staff on both inflation  -30-    7/16-17/84  and real growth when we don't have that dollar decline that they have I haven't analyzed it Dick [Davis], do you know the reason?  Doesn't it get a little embarrassing, Paul, if you're asked by the [Congressional] Committee about the reasons for the wide spectrum [of views] among the members of the FOMC? If you said that some of them assumed a 15 percent [dollar] decline and some of them didn't assume that, is that going to look a little strange up there?  One sees these things in hindsight If we had waited 10 years, we wouldn't have had to float the dollar  If you put a lot of emphasis on the mergers and the LBOs, you're going to be asked to send out a letter asking the bankers not to finance that activity  The whole thing boils down, of course, to the forecast on the velocity of circulation I gather from this that Steve is projecting that in a year in which we don't have substantial price increases, the long-term average [growth rate of the] velocity of circulation for M1 is 2 Is that correct? And you are not talking about seeing relatively modest interest rate increases next year; you're talking about substantial--  If he's really right that the long- term average [growth rate] is 2--and I don't have a view on that, I just assume that he's correct--then it seems to me that we probably should confine the M1 growth rate to 4 to 7 percent or else we might pump in too much money On the other hand, my instinct is maybe to go down only a half point in this midyear preliminary proposal in order to preserve room in February of next year to go down all the way to 4 to 7 if that still looks [appropriate] That's because it would be much harder to move up a half point if we go to 4 to 7 percent now; then it's going to look bad to retreat by that half point So, even though I think there is an intellectual case at the moment for 4 to 7 percent, tactically I think we would be better off moving cautiously now and if the situation is still the same in February of next year, going all the way to 4 to 7 percent  Well, 8 to 8-1/2 percent  But your point, Chuck, then also tends to work in the direction of concluding that a 4 to 7 percent range makes sense    7/16-17/84  Well, no We still would be moving them downward; I'm talking about at least 1/2 point  Oh, yes  I would move down a half point now and then if the substantive case is still solid in February I'd move [down] another 1/2 point After last year we made some significant revisions between the preliminary targets adopted in July and those adopted later, in February It would be a little embarrassing, though, to move a full point now and then, if we felt we had to retreat, move up 1/2 point That's why I'm suggesting this other sequence You're shaking your head skeptically  Suppose inflation isn't doing well but you can't be as tight in your monetary policy for international reasons or whatever Then that's not so good  I think there's as solid an intellectual argument for 5 to 8 percent for M2 as there is for 4 to 7 percent for M1 Why would the assumption of roughly, let's say, 0 to 1 percent velocity of circulation for M2, be any different than a 2 percent assumption for velocity of circulation for M1? I don't think that's any shakier We've been running about 1 percent, haven't we, for velocity of circulation for M2?  What's surprising about M2 is how low it has been running  Let me ask a basic question I don't understand Jerry's remark If you're presenting the range of views of the FOMC and all of us are above the 8 percent that the staff has, are you going to come up with an 8 percent figure and ignore the FOMC members? Is it the staff who make that assumption? Don't you have to adjust to an 8-1/2 percent [assumption for GNP] or whatever it may be?  -37-    7/16-17/84  Yes, but there are some other things you have to assume  Yes, [but] 8-1/2 percent is still a pretty ambitious target  I mean considering the price inflation--keeping that [moderate] After all, this is the third and last year of a recovery! [Laughter] In the two previous ones the inflation hit what--12 to 14 percent at the peak? If we can confine it to 5-1/2 percent, that's going to be quite a triumph, I think  Well, except that we expect the velocity of circulation to come down significantly from the 4-1/2 percent it has been running over the first half of this year  I think there is an intellectual argument for 4 to 7 percent  If we raise the target, then they are going to feel less pressure to work on the budgetary deficit  You have more faith than I do  Well, what would you do then--5-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent?  I think Roger has a point We wouldn't want M3 to come in at 6 percent I don't know; I guess it depends on what you place more importance I assume people are not going to be looking at the bottom of the range in this recovery period, although it might become important at the end of 1985 It's the scenario--  Right You're talking about the other three I think Roger has a point I think it helps send a message that we're going to be following a tough policy, and I don't see the reasoning for narrowing the spread We certainly cannot answer that we have slightly more certainty about hitting the M2 range than the others, which would be the only justification for narrowing the spread  I thought Steve was saying that the velocity of circulation of M2 has been very erratic  What's your objection?  I could go either way on that one  And a lot of them have been losing money on foreign exchange operations went from a $24 million profit in foreign exchange operations in the first quarter to a $12 million loss in the second quarter because most of them had been betting on some decline I would agree with Sam that they are taking both a short-term view and a fairly jaundiced view about their earlier expectations of a dollar decline So, they have retreated somewhat now to thinking that maybe the dollar isn't going to decline  -51-    7/16-17/84  So moved  One significant indicator--and I feel it's going to be with us for a while--is that it's very hard now to get term money in the Eurodollar market  I'm talking about the US banks The maturities have shortened, and it's very significant  The shareholders, who are very strong in both those cases, are putting up more capital and the markets know this assures us that they bent over backwards to write off everything and reserve everything they possibly could And they are going to show a substantial profit this quarter And I think $80 million more capital was put up Also, of course, we know that Midland is now offering to buy out the minority shareholders in Crocker and has a complete commitment to Crocker So, that's why it didn't really get hurt  Temporarily  -53-    7/16-17/84  If we hadn't accommodated the extraordinary demand for excess reserves, we would have gotten even more of a rise The Committee last time assumed that a billion dollar borrowing assumption was going to give us [a funds rate] in the neighborhood of 10-3/4 percent Instead, we ended up with 11 to 11-1/2 percent  They're going to have more of an opportunity now with the abolition of the withholding tax  Two of the banks are going to fall short   At the risk of sounding ""me too-ish,"" that's exactly my view of it I think we should not tighten further; we should simply consolidate the tightening that has taken place in the market And we should certainly not ease So, it seems to me that alternative B is what is indicated I might argue--and this is a  -57-    7/16-17/84  nitpick--that on M3 I'm not sure it makes sense to put in 9-1/2 percent instead of 9 percent when 9 percent is the upper end [of the long-run range] and we're running over that I don't know whether that one-quarter period is significant enough to aim for something that's over But, with the exception of that nitpick, I would go with [alternative B]--$1 billion for borrowing and moving the funds range up that extra 1/2 point to 8 to 12 percent I assume that the general language would permit room so that if the banks relax further and $1 billion of borrowing ends up giving us something in the neighborhood of 10-3/4 percent [for the funds rate], there would be flexibility to tighten a little so that we stay in that 11 or 11 plus percent range  What are you on borrowing?  You have to wear gum shoes when I say that  Do you expect this bill forcing us to disclose immediately to pass in this session?  What you're saying is that you want it asymmetrical?  Because the way it was last time--  It was symmetrical  That's what central bankers are supposed to have  Well, you know the Oracle of Delphi used to have this kind of language in it--pretty subtle readings of pigeons' entrails Having said that, I think it's probably okay to do that kind of thing The very frankly asymmetrical approach is probably not the most advisable So, I also would vote for a judicious mix of ""mights"" and ""woulds"" or ""woulds"" and ""coulds"" or whatever else we can use  -68-    7/16-17/84  That's the same point I made, Henry, and I'm assuming that this language could be interpreted to guard against that just because of changing bank attitudes toward excess reserves This would prevent a meaningful drop in the rates We could use this kind of [wording] and the flexibility would be sufficient to cover that contingency as well Would you agree with that?  It also complicates the LDC political attitude If they get a sense of relief and then they get whammed again, it just makes things harder  Five weeks  Aren't you going to be asked about current short-term policy when you testify?  Would you convey the flavor of asymmetry in your answers to those questions?  asked Suppose the questions were asked the right way, would you do it?  Rather than symmetry?  Particularly since you guys aren't doing anything on the deficit!  That comes after the sentence you just read about mergers?  But then we're putting ourselves on record that we're projecting--if I understand it right--a continued hectic pace of merger activity in 1985 Or are you saying that 1985 is going to be higher because of the mergers?  Oh! I'm sorry  But what about the sentence at the end? ""The Committee understood that policy implementation would require continuing appraisals of relationships--""  But doesn't the sentence I started to read, even though I jumped the gun, apply both to '84 and '85  Then I think the tactical advantage gets lost because in a certain sense--  I hope we're going to intervene in the deutschemark if the dollar goes above 3 deutschemark That becomes a threshold "
2759,1984-08-21,SOLOMON," The way I've heard the question is not so much the way Si has heard it but At what level will distress borrowing complicate open market monetary policy operations? Will there be a limit on the amount of borrowing the System can make available to banks that need liquidity because of the problem it creates for our open market operations?  It's going to hit earlier?  There are a lot of questions of that sort floating around and there is a lot of uneasiness And if FCA comes into the [discount] window, I think we're going to see a significant increase in concerns You know [about] the actions that  took to help FCA out--they are a very tough bunch, strictly profit oriented--and for the first time I heard them saying that part of their motivation was their worry that the FCA situation would extend to other thrifts and just cause general problems which, of course, would affect them, too  But at that point we probably would need some ease in the financial markets and, if anything, in the banking system  Do they have a run on?  I see comments in the press First, they talked about the institutional deposits they were losing Then in the last few days, ever since the revised earnings report, I saw that it was retail deposits  I have a question about your projection on inflation You are projecting, as you just said, 1 percentage point higher inflation in '85 compared to '84 But if I understood correctly your analysis 6 weeks ago, you are projecting about a 1 percentage point rise in unit labor costs Now, that alone could account for a 1 point rise in inflation but on top of that you're also factoring in a 10 or 15 percent reduction in the exchange rate, and presumably you'll get some some increase in utilization of capacity I don't see how, based on your assumptions, you end up with only a 1 percentage point increase in inflation in '85 over '84  But don't the price effects show up a lot earlier than the trade effects?  I'm not sure that your basic proposition is clear because [foreigners had] even a much smaller share of the [domestic] market in 1978 when the dollar was down [unintelligible], and other exporters were giving discounts to keep their share of the market What you're really saying is that because the foreign share of the market is larger than it was, they are going to be more willing to make concessions  Empirically what they do, Chuck, as I had occasion to follow it very closely, is that they don't hold their dollar prices but typically will split with their distributor half the costs of the exchange [rate change] The distributors also have an interest in preserving the volume and share of market, so they will  -10-    8/21/84  cut their own [profit] and the manufacturer will [unintelligible] and be willing to accept some of the smaller profits  If you analyze what happened to inflation in the last recovery which was almost a 5-year period going from the third quarter of '75 to the first quarter of '80--and I'm not saying I've done it scientifically, but I've asked a lot of questions about this--we hit double digit inflation problems Part of that, of course, was a very large drop in the dollar First of all, I would put the oil shock as [unintelligible] and then the drop in the dollar And part of it, I guess, was monetary policy Even though the money supply numbers looked pretty good for most of that period, interest rates really did not rise and in hindsight the experts tell me that there was a shift in the demand function--whatever that means, I don't know  The interest rates would not keep the rise [unintelligible] agreed-upon proposition Until the dollar began declining, which forced some major rises in interest rates, [unintelligible] interest rates probably did not keep the economy from overheating It's interesting to analyze when you look back if there is any way to give weight to these certain factors Was the System more to blame than the Arabs and OPEC? I don't know It's true that we probably are not going to have an oil shock That looks to be the case It looks as if there are going to be a lot of assurances against another oil shock almost permanently--I mean by permanently in the next 5 to 10 years And presumably we're running monetary policy now somewhat more tightly We are more sensitive to an inflationary threat during a recovery On the other hand, we don't really know how the dollar will behave and what the impact of that would be So, it seems to me that there's a useful lesson to be learned from doing more scientifically what I was trying to do--analyzing what is different in the factors affecting inflation in this recovery than in the last one That is relative to Henry Wallich's kind of pessimism about [unintelligible] Are we going to end up doing any better or not? It seems to me that there are two things going for us that may make a  -11-    8/21/84  significant difference One is the likely absence of any oil shock and the other is the way we are running monetary policy now  We tend to think there might be some rise in interest rates in '85, which would hold things back a little  In my District I noticed that my board reflects that more cautious tone They are heavily influenced by retail sales, car loans--the [industries] they are in--and they seem to feel that [business conditions] are not quite as ebullient as they were Still, that's just a nuance of tone, I think  I think what happened was this In the first years of the Carter administration basic inflation was running only around 6 percent but they admitted privately that there were a lot of built-in factors in the policy that was being followed that would bring that inflation rate up substantially even without the oil shock But it probably would not have gone to double digit rates; it probably would have gone to 8-1/2 percent without the second oil shock  -14-    8/21/84  This brings up something that I want to check with Jim Kichline on My people project that even by the end of 1985, assuming these growth figures that we more or less are in agreement on--let's say 3 percent real GNP in 1985--that utilization of capacity should not exceed 85 percent because they believe that capacity will be growing in 1985 at about the same rate Therefore, even though we're up now to the 83-84 percent area--I don't know exactly where in there--we probably will not see 85 percent even by the end of 1985 Is that correct? Is that your assumption?  That would make a big difference also, because as I remember the Carter period we got up to 88 percent and that [utilization rate] was putting on a lot of pressure  We've had the shift of the tooling up in the automobile industry  They certainly aren't yawning out in California  In an ideal response world, Pres, if you had your say in the Congress what would you do about it, if there were a financial crisis?  Chuck, you will be interested to hear that the CEO of one of the major money center banks in New York said at a meeting in my Bank with S&Ls and quite a few industrialists, [unintelligible] ""You would think that the regulatory authority would be able to prevent a situation like that"" And I said to him that my understanding was that they had--that the whole reckless expansion had been frowned upon very seriously by the regulatory authorities but they didn't have the legal authority [to stop it] I said that we couldn't too easily in our system, given all the emphasis on deregulation, issue a cease and desist order simply because of imprudence or what we judge to be imprudent expansion when the chickens haven't come home to roost yet [The question is] whether we really could prove that in court What is the ability of the regulatory authorities to slow down an expansion that they think is imprudent?  The 4 to 6 percent settlement does not include the COLA, which they are going to maintain Therefore, if inflation goes up, say, 5 percent altogether, then we're talking about a 10 percent increase in compensation Am I incorrect?  How can that be?  I had a presentation which said that they were not  But if we're figuring inflation is going to be up in the neighborhood of 5 percent, are you talking about only a 1 percent [real] increase?  I wonder if the staff knows the answer to this  Chuck, even though we did end up with a higher Fed funds rate than we would have expected for a $1 billion borrowing assumption, it seems to me we'd be imprudent now to reduce that borrowing level It seems to me a little premature, given the strength of the expansion, to move down, say, to $700 or $800 million of borrowing  But we don't know how long that shift will persist The usual--  But, you know, that situation had really looked [unintelligible]--without getting into too much detail Even though the risks are that there will be a higher level of uneasiness about the banking system and the international system than a relaxation of these special tensions, which probably have been causing the fed funds rate to be higher than we had originally expected, it seems to me that that situation is very unpredictable Even though we want flexibility to cope with that kind of thing, if it shifts in the other direction, it seems to me that at this point if we were to reduce the borrowing because we ended up with a higher fed funds rate than we expected, that would be sending a premature policy signal The market would interpret that as a fairly significant easing of the fed funds rate It would be attributed to a shift [toward an] easing of policy It would not be attributed to a change of bank attitudes in regard to reluctance to borrow Do we really want to bring about that kind of policy signal at this point?  50 to 75 basis points  What would you do about the borrowing?  -25-    8/21/84  And the borrowing?  It would spark another rally in the bond and stock markets and it would look, I think, like politics if we were to do it at this time  Well, as I said earlier, I think we ought to keep the $1 billion borrowing I think the advantage of keeping the same M1 monetary aggregate target that we had in July is that if conditions weaken in the economy, then it's perfectly appropriate for us not to be locked into as tight a policy I would keep the range of 8 to 12 percent [on the funds rate] I would not change that even though the rate is around 11-7/8 percent now; I'd have a consultation if we have to And I would change the directive so that it's symmetrical You remember that it leans slightly, through the judicious use of ""would"" as against ""might,"" in the direction of our being quicker to restrain than to ease depending on what happens And it seems to me that at this point we probably are justified in moving to more symmetrical language  Each $100 million represents about a quarter of a point So, if you put it at $800 million instead of $1 billion, you would be bringing down the fed funds rate 50 basis points, in theory  Exactly And then you can have symmetrical language too  I have assumed that the 5 percent becomes meaningful only if conditions weaken  In the economy, right  That's right Otherwise, the borrowing assumption would prevail and we'll see more or less a continuation of the present fed funds rate But if conditions weaken, then I don't think we should have locked ourselves in to a 4 percent target, because I think it would be justified that the fed funds rate would come off somewhat on its own What I'd be opposed to is for the market to perceive a clear and overt easing of policy by a move now to $800 million [on borrowing]  I realize we're nitpicking, but even so it seems to me that if we move to symmetry by changing the ""might"" to ""would,"" that's sufficient If we go ahead and reverse the order of this, we'd look a little silly if the economy turns out stronger than we think It looks as if we're really getting into semantic signals by reversing those, don't you agree?  ""Were substantially slower,"" if you want to use exact symmetry    8/21/84  It's like the Delphic oracle!  I'd leave it at 7-1/2 percent  Well, you wouldn't have any alternative  The spread had gotten up to 160 basis points in Treasury bills and 3-month CDs Then it went down a little to about 60 or 70 basis points and now it's back up to about 100  Okay  Well, give or take maybe 10 basis points, I think they're probably fairly accurate  It is useful Is it credible?  Yes, but we do say--and it's a little inconsistent with that--that one reason we don't want to release the minutes right away is that if conditions change during the intermeeting period we may want to adjust the standards Right?  That also sounds like an adjustment of policy  And the middle of 1982  Isn't this [directive] technically a communication to my Bank?  It is  All newspaper reporters, even the ones who are supportive of us, start off with a presumption that the maximum amount of disclosure is something good It's very hard to argue otherwise  They interpret that as a signal that they should borrow less  We checked up on that There's no evidence of that at all  Yes I had my discount officers call some of the other discount officers  This reluctance to borrow is not just at the larger banks At least two of the larger banks said to us that some of the regional banks were more reluctant to borrow I don't know whether you would find any in your area being more reluctant to borrow Because of the rumors in the market, every bank leans over backwards  They're not "
2784,1984-10-02,SOLOMON," No, there is an Executive Committee-- a 3-person subcommittee  I assume you are not interested in driving the value of the dollar up any higher?  I think that's true if you believe that there is a principle involved here, but I don't know what the principle is You're assuming that all interest on foreign currencies should as a matter of routine be converted to dollars? Is that what you're saying?  That still is a form of intervention, so I don't understand why you would want to do that unless you had an intervention objective in mind  They jumped on the declining dollar  We keep talking about the banks being reluctant to borrow, and many of the banks talk about the Fed having tightened its administration of the discount window I've had that said to me time and time again even though I know that our discount officers deny that But I don't know why there is such a strong    10/2/84  impression of that around--or there was during this period of time The fed funds rate was higher than what one would have expected  But that doesn't explain why You are talking about caution [by banks] about borrowing because they might get contaminated  But if that's the explanation, then we should be in the beginnings of a reversal of that because all the anecdotal reports as well as the reduction in the spread between CDs and Treasury bills show that there has been less anxiety in the banking system and in the markets generally in the last few days In that case, if we were to continue, let's say, $750 million borrowing, we might end up with a much lower fed funds rate than one would expect at the present time  Except that we have gotten reports in the last few days that show so much more relaxation on the part of bank management, particularly now that they feel that interest rates are not going to go up All I'm saying is If that's the explanation, then there are [unintelligible] conditions that will reverse that    10/2/84  Another major bank has to show a big loss or something  Peter, you told me that there was a tendency in the beginning of these periods for excess reserves to be somewhat higher    10/2/84  It seems to me that we ought to maintain the present borrowing level of $750 million I do think it's worth commenting here, though, that I've been surprised that you have brought borrowings down from $1 billion to $750 million without any consultation with the Committee Even though I think that was the correct thing to do and a certain amount of discretion is indicated in the directive, it seems to me that at some point you would want to check with the Committee to make sure that others share that view on how to use that discretion The question could arise again, possibly, over the next few weeks If we were to start with a borrowing level, let's say, of $750 million, at what point would you feel that you should check with the Committee if both money and the real economy turn out weaker and, therefore, you were reducing the borrowing level or increasing the nonborrowed reserve path?  Turning to the decision for today, I'd start from the assumption that even though there may be weakness in the fourth quarter, that just does not mean an incipient recession It seems to me that we already have been perceived in the markets as being fairly aggressive in easing and I think we ought to be somewhat cautious, particularly between now and the election period Unless there are very clear economic reasons to do otherwise, we ought to continue to  -23-    10/2/84  be fairly cautious rather than move toward a pronounced easing As far as the targets go, alternative B strikes me as fine I would leave the funds rate range where it is There is one last point It's not too likely, but if we were to get a restoration of confidence in the banking system in a way whereby the management of these banks began to follow a somewhat less cautious policy in reserve management, then with a borrowing level of $750 million, we might find fed funds dropping to as [low] as, say, 10-1/4 percent And a question I think the Committee ought to consider is Do we want that much of a drop? If this contingency were to arise--though I don't think it will--would we want to see that much of a drop? There could be an understanding that the Chairman would be in touch with the rest of the Committee at that point  In '80 when we had an 18-1/2 percent funds rate in June  Or even 10 percent I would have problems with 10 percent in the next few weeks I assume you would  I also heard that they approved what we have done this year  We have to be careful not to go back and overemphasize the importance of short-run money supply numbers They may not be telling us anything  But, normally, we look at longer periods, and in longer periods we seem to be all right I understand that a lot of the recent economic indicators are somewhat weaker, but as long as we're doing so well in the long run [with respect to] the annual money targets why should we be that concerned about correcting the short run?  I don't know what that lag is  Which would be all right  Coming back to the question that you posed, I would agree with the basic strategy as you formulated it in terms of continuing where we are on the borrowing level, the alternative B numbers, and using your discretion that if everything comes in weak to go down to $600 or $650 million [on borrowing] But it seems to me that a large number of us are concerned too about the perception as well as the substance of a large drop in interest rates engineered by the Fed in the next critical 5 to 6 weeks And it seems to me that, under those circumstances, there would have to be a strong enough case for you to call a Committee consultation if you want to go below $600 million If it's something in that area, that seems to me an appropriate way of touching different bases  Yes, if there's an overwhelming case for--  Or clear case  The markets don't have as pessimistic a view as I think you and Pres Martin and maybe Emmett have been reflecting today  Oh, I misunderstood you I think the market view is quite clearly one that this is a temporary weakness-- this 3-1/2 percent that we see on the third-quarter flash [GNP report] --and that the fourth quarter will continue with moderate strength And I think it's important that we have a clear case before we're perceived as doing some very substantial easing  I think you did the right thing  I think you did the right thing, but I guess I'm surprised also For a man who's as skeptical as you are and most of us are about what the economic indicators are telling us about the real economy, don't you think it is dangerous to try to fine-tune an interest rate response so quickly? After all, we only began to see these weaker economic indicators that I'm talking about in the last few weeks I think your judgment has been vindicated, but we only began to see a few weeks ago these indicators showing more weakness And they could possibly have been wrong  Yes, but since we ignored the strength of the dollar previously in domestic monetary policy, I guess I don't quite understand why this last speculative bubble had that much more impact on this situation Although I agree with the direction of it, the--  I know But then I heard very critical comments from the key actors on the European side--central bankers I'm talking about--that our intervention was so feeble that it didn't really mean anything  I thought it would be ""only"" in the context That implies that even without any weakening in the real economy there would be even less restraint just because of weakness in the monetary aggregates--that that alone would trigger it  Whereas the one we had before that said--  --""only in""  And I would agree, obviously  I agree with Jerry completely The more they see us responding quickly to short-run changes in the monetary aggregates, the more people in the market are going to say ""Are we going to go back to the extreme swings that we had where rates were running between 8 and 20 percent?"" I think we have to be careful of that; we ought to be moving very gradually  Well, that's because of special factors that you talked about earlier  Earlier you said you had no objection to making it double-barrelled as long as it's only tilted, but I assume that you don't object to putting back in some contingency language on the other side  A moderate adjective?  I think perhaps you have a stronger view from the down side of the economy than most of us have  Sounds great Real prose--poetry, in fact  The usual boiler "
2808,1984-11-07,SOLOMON," If I remember correctly--Ted Truman might know--when I was at the Treasury the amount of the two items that Henry mentioned was $1 to $2 billion a year And we did not urge them to follow a policy, Henry, of immediately selling it out as they got it in, but they did try to follow an overall, longer-term policy of averaging out that way  Do we need a formal vote?  The Japanese felt an obligation to cooperate I think that was a significant factor that wouldn't necessarily be there in the future to such a degree  It has been an interesting market I think that the range of short-term interest rates is predicated more on a market anticipation of a fed funds rate closer to 9-1/2 percent than the 10 or 9-7/8 percent that it has been averaging lately So, there is a question--not that we're getting into that now--but assuming there's some further easing, the question is whether markets will assume that's the last; I doubt that they will They'll probably assume there will be a discount rate cut later on and the markets will then take it even further and we may continue to get some lower rates than the projections  I am living in a state which has double that rate of unemployment and yet I share your view, Frank I don't quite understand the level of concern that I hear other than that it is the inherent nature of central bankers always to look at the gloomy side And I think the sense of balance would be not a major shift of policy as Ted Roberts is saying, but some modest though limited easing I won't repeat the reasons why I think the staff forecast for next year is on balance probably as reasonable as one can expect In our view it might be somewhat weaker in the fourth quarter because of inventory adjustment But the general feeling in my District--what I hear from business leaders and from members of our board--is that there will be good Christmas retail sales and that manufacturing is not showing the earlier growth but is not showing any significant softening either I also share Henry Wallich's view--I don't always agree with Henry, but I must say I do this time--that the business cycle is still with us and we should not be excessively alarmed about some tapering off and moderation And even though 3 percent isn't high, Chuck, it seems to me that that is a very appropriate level--if that is what we actually get next year  Well, I tend to assume that the dollar is going to come off more and I assume there will be inflationary pressures that will result from that--although they won't show up too immediately, I suppose And I would be concerned about much more than a 3 percent growth rate I think our capacity is growing around 3 percent and it may very well be that the structure of the economy and our comparative advantage has changed in the world and that we cannot expect to go back to a level of unemployment as low as we had in previous recoveries Also, in those previous recoveries we got to double-digit inflation so we then tended to overreact the other way It seems to me that a steadier, more prudent, balanced, calmer policy would be in the direction of easing which does not reflect as much concern about the economy as I heard around the table  I would like to propose that we move to an area between alternatives A and B I think we get halfway there if we only bring the borrowing level down to $600 million If the fed funds rate is running now at, say, 9-7/8 percent on average and we reduce the borrowing level by $100 million, the rate is likely to come down to 9-1/2 percent or a shade above I think the markets then will expect a discount rate cut at some point following that; and if that were a 1/2 point reduction, that would bring [the funds rate] down to 9 percent It seems to me that to go all the way to alternative B would be a great mistake Therefore, borrowing somewhere in the area of $600 million makes the most sense We probably ought to adjust the fed funds range I forget what it is now--8 to 12 percent? Maybe we ought to make that 7 to 11 percent For the monetary target figures I would probably take numbers halfway between the [A and B alternatives] I don't have a clear view on M1; it seems to me less reliable than it has at other times But the target figure is there  Okay  I am pretty limited by 10  That's all I have  But if the Board were to take the move and cut it by 1/2 point--I'm not saying that it would--the fed funds rate would go down by 1/2 point with that  They're trying to influence these deliberations here!  Frank, one of the problems was that nobody could be sure how long that unpredictable behavior was going to continue We didn't know how long that reluctance to borrow would continue and we certainly didn't want to take care of it in the directive because then we would have ended up [targeting] the fed funds rate more narrowly than I think--  We are pretty sure that retail sales will be somewhat on the weak side  The conduct of monetary policy would be better, I think, with a mix of a partial movement in the fed funds rate and a cut in the discount rate in order not to get the borrowing levels too low If the borrowing level gets too low, I think there are complications  Why do you say that, Roger?  Well, I agree with you on the $400 million I am just a little surprised that you said to continue the $700 million level would bring fed funds down to about 9-1/2 percent  I am a little concerned also about the market speculating as to why we gave two-month instead of three- month growth rates A lot of [market observers] will presume there are reasons; and if so, I wonder if they're worthy ones If the numbers add up to what they add up to, then I don't see why we should put ourselves in the position of treating M1 specially in order to come up with a higher-sounding number when anybody who really is a Fed watcher is going to know exactly what it will mean and that it will say the same thing for the quarter as a whole I have a mild preference for alternative I  Well, not only have we used quarterly figures but, as I said before, Fed watchers are going to come out with the same arithmetic Thirdly, if we do fall short of this 8 to 9 percent growth in November and December--  --it clearly makes it even fairly obvious to non-Fed watchers and casual Fed watchers that there was this enormous shortfall I just don't see why we want to play around with moving away from the quarterly numbers The minute we do that they are really going to take out their pencils and do all the arithmetic  Let me ask a minor question, Steve If my recall is correct, and it probably isn't, didn't we always use the word ""reduce"" rather than ""decrease"" existing pressures on reserve positions?  Yes People are going to wonder why  But am I correct that we always used ""reduce""?  -44-    11/7/84  Do you want to say ""In view of the negative number in October"" rather than ""the shortfall""?  It's a lucky number  You may have two groups of dissenting votes  I'm afraid that at $700 million there might very well be some backing up  If we have a volatile--  But, if the markets think that we're going to be easing aggressively, they will go even further, Chuck  We will have more flexibility and more options to move or not to move on the discount rate if we go down to the $600 million, or possibly the $550 million, level I think the $600 million level is better, because otherwise we are going to have real problems with what may be a psychological situation in the markets where the expectations are so heavy for a discount rate cut and so affecting behavior that we may feel that that's what we want to do if conditions indicate further easing  We serve pressed turkey here!  Or a discount rate cut rather than go completely down to $400 million in the second step  But that would be a half-point cut  But at the conference call, you remember, there were some people who wanted to ease aggressively and some of us--and I was in the other group--wanted to ease only to a point where we avoided going down to 9-1/2 percent [on the funds rate] We thought that the Chairman and the Open Market Desk might go as low as $650 million on the borrowing assumption Some of us hoped the rate would not go much below 10 percent I think they stayed very faithfully within the spirit of the consultation by bringing borrowing down only to $700 million And the average fed funds rate recently has been a shade under 10 percent So I think it was a perfectly appropriate move; I was a little surprised it didn't come earlier because the market situation was very strange In a sense, that's past history almost, Roger, and I think--  I still feel that $600 million gives us the maximum flexibility to respond to any changing circumstances either in the market psychology or in the real economy or--well, I don't think we'll see much change in the money numbers in the next few weeks  Why don't we compromise by saying the initial borrowing assumption is in a range of $550 to $600 million and leave it [to you] as you feel your way over the next couple of days?  There's a danger in the sense that the market is so bullish that they are going to seize on almost anything We're getting a very significant bond market rally; I don't know that we've seen evidence of it in the stock market Whatever we do they're going to do more, if they think there's more to come  The unexplained decline  Well, if you go that far and use the word ""sought""--which is all right with me--then I think we ought to leave in the counterbalance sentence Otherwise, if we leave that out too, then it's really going to look silly  And if you have to make a very substantial step downward, we could have a consultation unless you decide to do it through a discount rate  If we end up with interest rates [down] much further with your second or third step, there's going to be absolutely no incentive in the Congress to do anything about that deficit "
2834,1984-12-17,SOLOMON," That was sheer bluff--a way of getting a message across  I think there is even less of a case for making a shift in 1985 based on the 1984 results--both for the reasons that Chuck gave and for the embarrassment we would have if we didn't make a downward correction in M3 I just don't see any way we could present anything as drastic as this to the public and to the Congress in a selective way Down the road we could be facing an accumulation of many misses and it would not be an easy job to stick to this; and, certainly, we can't stick to it selectively It seems to me that it would be a great mistake to depart from our policy of basing on the actual outcome rather than on the earlier year's targets  Wasn't the more meaningful incompatibility this summer the fact that we weren't getting the fed funds rate that one normally would associate with the nonborrowed reserve path? And that was because of the changes--  Well, what would you do about that?  I would agree with you on the automaticity I think there are problems with that But, let's face it In practice there is a modest range of flexibility based on consultations of the Manager and Steve Axilrod and the Chairman We have recognized that, I think, by talking about some flexibility In particular, at the last meeting we delegated some flexibility around a modest range Basically, there are three people who make those decisions I think it would be very awkward and difficult to have a consultation every time What we are seeing now, and I think it's working fairly well, is that when there is a need to make a larger change in the borrowing, then the Chairman has a consultation I don't really see that there should be changes in practices for times that might require some more immediate, flexible, and minor adjustment Those adjustments are done now basically Sometimes the Desk waits a day or two before draining or adding reserves There is some flexibility now based on the tripartite approach we're following, keeping an eye on interest rates as well as on hitting the reserve path I'd agree with you I don't particularly like the idea of even a partially automatic adjustment; it just seems to me that what we're doing now makes a good deal of sense I really do feel that we had the opportunity to take whatever action--a change in the borrowing-- was necessary to get the funds rate that we were all thinking of In that sense I agree with the Chairman; I think we had the opportunity But the economic events were changing at the time--the economy seemed to be overheating and, therefore, we really didn't object to the fact    12/17-18/84  that we were getting a higher fed funds rate The majority of the Committee was comfortable enough with the situation  The rule of thumb is a $100 million borrowing level change gives you 1/4 point [on the funds rate]  And you would react every two weeks  What about credit velocity, Frank?  But what you're really saying is a policy with the emphasis on M1 and the mechanical feedback--the same as from October '79 to the end of '82  We wouldn't let it go down to $65 million, I presume We would cut the discount rate  Did you see that article in the Sunday New York Times yesterday? The automobile quotas are costing the consumer $10 to $13 billion dollars, of which $6 billion or more increases corporate profits in the automobile industry  No What they argue is that some of it went into overtime which could have been handled more economically  Yes The $6 billion increases corporate profit  Maybe you assume they will only break even  If everything is indexed on inflation in this new tax proposal, presumably it will take a less high level of interest rates to prevent the economy from overheating  But I think the people who are saying this have an ax to grind  Coming back to the more basic question that I guess you asked If you assume [3] percent real growth in '85, you said that the risks of deviating either on the down side or the up side are about even in your opinion Isn't it true that if there were a major change in the dollar, that would heavily weight the risks on the down side?  But that would show [up] more in the following year  Just out of curiosity, how do you get something as precise as an 8 percent assumption? You used to do 10 or 15 percent  We're assuming in New York $150 billion on the current account  That's the way the directive is written and that's the way the markets are interpreting it now If anything, they're giving it more [weight]  Isn't it 6 to 8-1/2 percent?  Maybe it would be more appropriate to skip it I find Lyle Gramley's analytical reasoning very close to mine with one or two very minor exceptions, so I won't repeat But it seems to me that there are too many uncertainties They are unusually high in '85, higher really than in the first two years of recovery [The outlook] is complicated now by the tax program, correction of the budget deficit, the dollar, etc Under those circumstances, since we can't really know what the results of our actions will be, I would be in favor of very moderate moves--feeling our way as we go along Under those circumstances, I obviously feel that we ought to maintain the present operating approach and not return to any degree of automaticity, no matter how marginal, because I think that tends to give us a psychological framework that is not conducive I have absolutely no ability to predict whether the present level of interest rates or a level 1/2 or 3/4 of a point lower is going to give us 3 percent [growth] or give us 4 percent So, I don't understand the policy implications of posing that question I know there's a need to present to the Congress some ranges On the other hand, if the Congress is going to beat the heck out of us because we say 3 percent rather than 4 percent, what are they going to do when we have to tell them about a dip in the economy coming along later? I don't think we've abolished the business cycle So I don't know if that means that much to me Maybe I'm not being sensitive to the situation in Washington But I don't have a clear view that 4 percent is that much more significantly desirable than 3 percent, although I certainly agree that a 3+ percent is better than a 3- percent  The international case for some moderate easing is much stronger than the domestic case Even though I don't think that a moderate easing of rates is necessarily going to change exchange rates, I think in the very long run the level of interest rates will be a very important determinant of exchange rates In the short run I think a moderate easing may not have any significant effects But there are other international objectives to be achieved from a moderate easing of interest rates So, it seems to me that we ought to maintain the ranges where they are and I think they're permitting enough growth in M1 and M2 I'm not quite sure why we continue to leave an M3 that seems to be misaligned on the low side year after year From what my staff tells me I believe we have tended over a rather longish period of time to see higher M3 than we would normally expect in relation to M2 I don't see any tactical problem or public relations problem in upping the M3 figure I don't think it's [necessary] by any means, but I throw that out for what it's worth I think I've touched on all the points that I find significant  Yes, but this is November to March  Yes  You're assuming that if we start with $250 million, we'll get a funds rate of 8 to 8-1/2 percent or somewhere in that range? Right?  Yes, assuming no action of the discount rate  I agree not for me When the fed funds rate drops down to, say, about 8-1/4 percent, there's going to be such intense and widespread expectation in the market that a discount rate cut will follow very shortly that it would be impossible to resist that So, unless the Board cuts the discount rate only a quarter of a point, when the second shoe drops then we're really looking at something that brings it down into the 8 percent range Now, I realize that for good reasons you're reluctant to talk about what the Board might or might not do about discount rate changes But if we do go as far as $250 million--[not], say, $300 or $325 million-- I think the pressure then becomes very strong for the second shoe to drop It's hard to resist it Whereas, if we go to the $300 or $325 million level, at least to start with, then the pressure would not be quite as great    12/17-18/84  But that's not the key issue  But why is it so important? Given the situation, the difference between 6-1/2 and 7 percent is going to have relevance only if over a period of time--not the first few weeks, certainly--we find that we have significant money growth Otherwise, it's not going to make any difference at all What's going to influence everything in the next few weeks is the drop in the borrowing level and any type of change in the discount rate So, I don't think the fact that December is going to have slow growth is of much importance, and I don't think the difference between 6-1/2 and 7 percent has that much [relevance] It's a small chance that we would be up in that range where it's going to make a significant difference of any kind later in the quarter  I think the real decision that is facing the Committee--I'm not talking now about the directive and what happens over the period of a quarter, because we are working under a system where there is substantial flexibility--is whether we want to see in the very near term, say, in a week or so, as much of a drop [in the funds rate] I think Peter Sternlight is right, as I said earlier, that [the proposed borrowing level] would take the rate down close to the 8 percent level, even if arithmetically it should take it  -63-    12/17-18/84  down to 8-1/2 percent or a shade above The market psychology is such that it probably will drop to 8 percent because the markets will be expecting a discount rate cut and the pressures will be enormous So, therefore, does the Committee really want to see that much of a drop that quickly? I think that's the most important issue we're facing, assuming we build the flexibility into the directive the way we have for the last few intermeeting periods My personal view is that that's too big a drop too suddenly Personally, I would reduce the borrowing level maybe to the $300 or $325 million level I'd make it more gradual  It's this discount rate thing  I checked at 1010 am and nobody else had gone  They have their bets; they are ahead of us  It would really make more sense for us all to go home and you [Board members] can do a discount rate cut  Okay, that's true There's some similarity in our thinking, Lyle But on the other hand, if we do want some easing, the preferable way of getting it at this point is a discount rate cut I don't think you have to read quite as far reaching a message; the markets will do what you just said Now, if  -72-    12/17-18/84  you feel that there shouldn't be any easing at all in the rates, then I think you have a consistent position in also worrying about the message you're giving to the market There's no way at this point that the market has really exaggerated expectations I would have guessed at this point that if we were to demonstrate pretty clearly that the funds rate is not going to go below 8 percent, we probably would be able to deflate those expectations significantly  I'm worried about the frictional borrowing level, also And it seems to me that one way of doing it is to do a modest cut in the borrowing level and move the discount rate either 1/4, or possibly 1/2 point--or else just do the discount rate cut  We still can say ""maintain""  Since it doesn't get published for 6 weeks, it seems to me that--  I don't know; the general trend is down We could probably leave it simply ""reduce somewhat"" and not worry about the fact that since Thursday and today there has been--  I'll trade you Why don't we do a trade?  In fact, I'd take the Corrigan position a notch farther It seems to me the way it comes out now that some people might read this as indicating that we actually would tighten monetary policy if the dollar began to decline And that is not the message we're trying to get across  Yes, we've got to be very careful about this now There's a lot of attention being paid in the market to what we might do  Okay But the way it reads now, that's what it sounds like People may read from that that we would tighten  Are you going to have the next sentence?  What I was going to say is this If we are going to have a succeeding sentence of some kind, maybe we ought to put in a more carefully worded [reference to] the foreign exchange market consideration instead of trying to get the symmetry in that one It's a risk  Well, basically what we have always said  What I think we can do--and the Fed watchers will spot the difference--is keep the succeeding sentence on lesser restraint and move up international financial market conditions to be the first [item in that list] That gives some consideration to it--""evaluated in relation to the strength of international financial market conditions,"" etc  Well, I was going to suggest the opposite Drop the dangling phrase beginning ""particularly"" and leave in the sentence, which is more or less similar to what's in there now, as a separate sentence; and move international financial market conditions up to the head of that list  -77-    12/17-18/84  Under 3  What is ""continued strength of the dollar""? What do you think it means to most people--the dollar climbing further or maintaining present levels?  But it would be 180 degrees opposite of what the Committee wants if any significant number of people in Europe or in the United States were to read from this wording that we would resist, through monetary policy, declines in the dollar That's  -78-    12/17-18/84  not what we're trying to say That fact that there's nothing in the dollar situation that would prevent us from easing is one thing Carrying an implication that we would tighten monetary policy if the dollar began to come off is another  I think it's just a risk I'm not saying it's a strong probability  I don't know who that reflects upon-- this Committee or the Board of Governors for not having moved faster on the discount rate cut  I still would prefer $300 million  MESSRS BOYKIN and GUFFEY I would too  It's important to us, even if you say it's not important to you  For a Christmas present?  Whose errors are they?  Up to? What is the nuance between $300 million and below and up to $300 million?  I noticed If it's such a minor nuance to you, why not try the $300 million?  Oh, do they?  I still don't know what we're voting on What are we voting on? "
