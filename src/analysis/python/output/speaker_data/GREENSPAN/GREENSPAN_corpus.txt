 That was a longer pause than I expected [Laughter] I'd like to entertain a motion to move the minutes   If there are no objections, then they are approved Mr Cross   Comments anyone?   To what extent is the general apparent reduction of tensions in the Persian Gulf, which was obviously the cause of the decline in the oil price, actually the cause of this retrenchment? In other words, periodically, when we see tensions in the world, everyone rushes into the dollar; and, it looks to me as if we are just unravelling that particular position It strikes me as rather difficult to believe that there is a secondary reaction to a    8/18/87 -2-  published news event Is it possible that the markets are just easing because of the decline in tensions, and people are just reaching for explanations of this sort? Or is there some reason to believe that it's really more than that and that there has actually been some Japanese reevaluation, rather than this view being just somebody's hypothesis   What happened to the DM this morning?   Anything else? May I have a motion to ratify Mr Cross' actions?   Without objection, they're approved Mr Sternlight    8/18/87   Why don't we hold that until we get through the total discussion of Mr Sternlight's remarks We'll go to that later   Further comments?   Anything else? I need ratification of two items First, I'll entertain a motion to ratify the open market transactions since the July meeting   Any objections? Secondly, we need another motion to approve the increase in intermeeting leeway   Governor Angell is raising the right question This is an extraordinary circumstance If it happens, I don't think there's any reason not to expand it, so why don't we increase it--what did you want?--to $12 billion   Give us a number which you sleep well with   This is a technical problem which does not confront the Committee very often    8/18/87 -5-   We have to formally change the motion Was it Jerry Corrigan who made the wrong motion? [Laughter]   As I read it, the next meeting is September 22 Thank you for your patience, ladies and gentlemen  END OF MEETING  -37-       I assume it is approved Thank you Mr Prell   Governor Seger   I think that the Saudis are a self- correcting mechanism because they have maintained that posted $18 a barrel light Arabian crude price, and if the spot price goes under it, their liftings will fall, because no one is going to pay $18 if the spot is $17-1/2 So, it's a sort of self-correcting mechanism, which worked in the very beginnings of this And I think that's one of the reasons the cheating is really an issue and was relevant to bringing crude price from, say, $22 a barrel down to $18 But the Saudis have demonstrated that they can lock the price at that level   President Guffey   President Stern   President Melzer   Governor Heller  -10-    8/18/87   President Black   Mr Forrestal  -11-    8/18/87   President Keehn  -12-    8/18/87   President Parry   President Boykin   Governor Johnson   Governor Angell   President Stern   Vice President Hendricks   Governor Seger   President Corrigan   Governor Heller   President Guffey  -21-    8/18/87   President Melzer   Governor Kelley   Mr Boehne, do you have any comments you'd like to make at this time?   I'd like to make just a few observations We spent all morning, and no one even mentioned the stock market, which I find quite interesting in itself I think it's important in the sense that as an economic force, history tells us sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn't It's conceivable to me, however, that this may be one of the times in which we may begin to see some opening up in the capital goods markets It's very dull; appropriations are not expanding at a rapid rate, but they are expanding And I think what the new orders are showing is a mixed bag Mike mentioned that there may be some exports in those orders,  -23-    8/18/87  but we also may be seeing an increase in the share of the total domestic capital investment markets because, remember, those figures are orders at domestic facilities only And the one thing that seems to be appearing in the numbers, in real terms, is that irrespective of the nominal trade figures, the share of capital investment coming from abroad has been increasing dramatically, although it's now beginning to taper off That will create a much stronger set of new orders figures for equipment, as we see in the aggregate appropriation numbers and the aggregate investment numbers I'm a little concerned that we may be looking at more than the opening up in this area that the staff numbers show, in part, because I think profit figures are moving fairly quickly The ability to pass through prices is another way of saying margins are opening up And we are beginning to see very clear evidence in a number of areas that we are picking up some form of potentially significant profit expansion That would lead me to conclude that we could very well be running into trouble at these monetary aggregate levels; but my impression is--at least my hope is-- to get to it a little later But we may be looking at the possibilities of a turn in velocity numbers at this stage I think the presumption that velocity will stay somewhere down in this area, or even approximate the staff forecast, may be wishful thinking I think there is more of a potential on the inflation side, on the nominal GNP side, at fairly low credit and monetary aggregate expansion than I think we're willing to admit, if for no other reason than I think we're merely projecting the most recent past I think that is turning; and if it turns, we'll have some possibly significant difficulties  On the exchange rate question, even though the staff forecast, as I understand it, has implied profit margins on imported goods flat at very low levels--meaning that the import prices of goods shipped into the United States are essentially reflecting very little change in profit margins--I think history tells us that that doesn't happen often either The evidence suggests that, from these levels, the likelihood is for more of an increase in those margins--meaning an increase in import prices relative to the exchange rate What I conclude from all this myself is that, while the staff forecast is in a way the most likely forecast, I'd be inclined to suppose that the risks are clearly on the upside, both on volume and on price And my last forecast is that that's likely to be the way Mike will come out the next time around   In case there's any doubt, I think the real world is going to influence him If there are no further comments on the economic outlook, let's move on to Mr Kohn   Thank you Why don't we break until 10 minutes to 12  [Coffee break]    8/18/87   As we sit here, the dollar seems to be dropping Maybe we ought to adjourn for awhile I would like to open the floor now for a general policy discussion and some indications on the directive and borrowing requirements and any tilt that you would like to express as we go on The Vice Chairman starts off   President Boehne   President Forrestal   I would like to raise a point with respect to that This directive goes through a very short period of time And I'd raise the question as to whether or not it is really an operational directive at all, because by the time this is actually something that is likely to happen, we are beyond the period which we are focusing on, with respect to policy in any event That's at least my view; I don't know how the rest of you read that   Well, I am referring to the sentence "Somewhat faster growth in the broader aggregates would be acceptable in the absence of indications of worsening price pressures and substantial weakness in the dollar, given the shortfall of these aggregates from their annual averages" What I am basically saying is that we are not going to learn a great deal more about what those aggregates are doing between now and the termination of the time frame to which this directive applies So, I am not quite certain whether the directive has any operational significance because of the shortness of the time frame   Oh, no, no Just the aggregates   That is all I meant President Parry  -26-    8/18/87   $700 million on borrowings   President Morris   President Boykin   President Keehn   President Black   Governor Heller   President Stern   Is that $600 million?   Governor Seger   First Vice President Hendricks   President Melzer   Governor Kelley   What do you want [on borrowing], alternative B?   $500 million?   President Guffey   Thank you If we averaged everybody, we'd get a different result than if we averaged the voting members by themselves I don't know if this is a typical result of this type of activity  -31-    8/18/87   I'll put that on the record It's fairly obvious that this is a unanimous vote for alternative B, and I would read it as a mild--maybe slightly more than mild--majority for a tilt in the language There is some desire to move inflation and business expansion up in the language and the dollar down The average borrowing requirement amongst the voting members is a shade under $550 million For those of you who are keeping score, I'd opt for "B" with $600 million and a definite tilt Basically, my own view is that the risk of snuffing out this expansion at this stage with mild tightening is extraordinarily small My view is not so much that we know a great deal about what's going to happen in the fourth quarter and beyond I just find it rather difficult to perceive a set of forces which can bring this expansion down when you have the following lead times in the delivery of materials and investment goods as short as we have now, which presupposes that the markets are basically tight on inventories; clear evidence of an expanding capital investment market; and, in effect, pretty much a full adjustment in consumer expenditures [unintelligible] I think we are likely to get as a result of the income adjustments from the tax bill and other elements I do not believe that this is strictly a [unintelligible] trade issue myself, but I think there is more to it than the trade balances that are emerging And when you begin to see order impacts in some of the basic raw materials, such as in steel and aluminum, and the extraordinary behavior of the textile industry, which is surprising even with all the restrictions, I wouldn't join my colleagues here who consider this a set of very uncertain things I think what is uncertain is how it materializes; but, I've seen this before, and this doesn't look uncertain to me I may eat those words in six weeks, but it has a tone to it which I, frankly, find not really inflationary yet; there is no evidence in the wage data that I see In any event, that's the way that I come out; and that's the way I read everybody else I guess we can structure some language which I suspect would pretty much grasp the issue Let me describe it On the operational paragraph, it would read "In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions" As you know, we can either put this in terms of "somewhat greater reserve restraint" or "slightly greater reserve restraint" As I listened to the discussion, I read it as "somewhat greater reserve restraint would or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable depending on indications of inflationary pressures, the strength of the business expansion, behavior of the aggregates, and developments in the foreign exchange market I don't know whether or not that would be acceptable or whether anyone would suggest some rephrasing I think I was capturing what I heard, but I will accept revisions   Frankly, it's a close vote   Can I ask a question? We had the strength of the business expansion at the bottom of the list the last time As I read it, there's a fairly strong consensus to move that up Would there be any objection to moving that as #2 after inflationary pressures?  SEVERAL That would be good   So the question really gets down to two things the relative positioning of the foreign exchange markets and the behavior of the aggregates "as well as" phrase If we move the business expansion issue up, I would be willing to leave the sentence the same as it was the last time   Is there agreement on that? On the issue of the M2 and M3 growth rates, which were 5 and 5-1/2 percent, there were some suggestions of going to 5 to 6 percent in this context, which would be reasonable as far as not wanting to be splitting M2 and M3 apart As I read the data and alternative B, I would assume that we might want to say through the September period-- that this approach is expected to be consistent with growth in M2 and M3 over the period from June through September at annual rates of around 5 to 6 percent   One of the problems is that it's such a short time frame that that issue can be difficult to implement Does anyone else have views on this?   I thought that maybe the 5 to 6 percent was really a forecast of what is likely to happen, irrespective of monetary policy   Let me ask another question In your judgment, what is the average lead time between monetary policy and the aggregates   Let me ask you this Does anybody object to 6 percent as the upper limit? Are there any objections to 4 percent on the downside?   Leave it alone, meaning what?   Would 5 percent be acceptable to everybody? What's the general view on that next sentence?   The general view is for just dropping it Anybody object to that? Strongly? That leaves us with the funds rate   If you narrowed it, you are really saying that you're targeting--   Let me just ask, we haven't quite got to the borrowing target--   I don't like people who are good at arithmetic $525 million?   Well, you know something, I don't know the answer to the question The point being that I don't know what the convention is here--whether you average these things, which you can, or whether you take the majority What has been the convention?   If you don't average, then the figure is $500 million   I'd like it reread just to be certain   Right   Good morning, all  SEVERAL (in unison) Good morning   Would somebody be good enough to move the minutes?  SPEAKER(?) I move   Objections? Approved Mr Cross   Comments? Any motions?   Sure   I have a motion; do I have a second?   Without objection, we'll assume the transactions are now ratified Mr Sternlight   Any questions for Mr Sternlight?   I think there will be critical questions regarding what happens, not so much on Wednesday, but because that type of spike is very difficult to interpret; they will look at borrowing very closely in the next maintenance period   President Black   Any further comments or questions? If not, I will entertain a motion to ratify   Objections? Approved Mr Prell   Thank you, Mr Prell Questions for Mr Prell?   Governor Heller   It is most likely to show up first in increasing lead times on the delivery of materials In other words, leaving aside the question of where the pressures are, that's the first sign that you are going to get something of that nature--that is, capacity expansion There has got to be some evidence on the part of the company that it is having difficulty in maintaining deliveries on a relatively quick pace Am I correct in assuming that there has not really been any major change, or that there has been a slight increase--   President Parry   President Boehne   President Guffey   President Black   Governor Seger    9/22/87   President Boehne   Well, if you'll hold that for just a few minutes President Parry   Mr Melzer   Governor Johnson   Could I raise a question about what the GNP demand numbers would really look like if we were to recognize that the way we calculate the numbers is a function of the fact that we are using 1982 as a base period? I was looking at the fixed-weight GNP deflator versus the GNP deflator, which tends to pick up a difference in the mix, which is essentially an issue of how far we are from the base period to a large extent If I were to deflate the nominal GNP by the fixed-weight index--which is roughly, but not quite, the equivalent of moving the 1982 base up to 1987, the current year--it seems as though we're getting a good deal less in the way of real growth Let's take a case in point the fourth-quarter over fourth- quarter change this year and next, with respect to the difference between the GNP deflator and the fixed-weight deflator, is 3 and 4, respectively Assuming that the nominal is the same, that would reduce real growth The problem I have with that, however, is that I'm not sure whether the model is generating the real first and then, by implication, the nominal, or vice versa How do you look at that issue? In other words, how do we interpret that?   Let's be very specific In 1982, oil prices, and overall import prices, were much higher than they are now Therefore, a rise in oil imports on the import side of real GNP is a larger subtraction with 1982 as a base than with 1987 as a base I guess I'm really asking if you were to restructure the total system so that say, 1987, equals 100 instead of 1982, how would your real GNP look in that context?  -13    9/22/87  Mr TRUMAN These two years, 1987 and 1988, oil imports don't rise very much You may get some effect on GNP to the extent that you don't have the same rise in domestic production of oil or energy, measured in 1982 dollars But there's not much subtraction, even in our forecast, from higher oil imports from fourth quarter to fourth quarter   Also, assume that the overall non-oil import price deflator is significantly lower than it was in 1982, which, as I recall--   Which means that it's a relative issue that the domestic thing is [unintelligible]?   The reason I raise the issue is that it's becoming a very crucial question, not of statistics, but for real evaluation here We are trying to determine to what extent the net exports are the crucial issue We are getting some signals out of the industrial production index That is basically saying, if anything, that the cutting edge of the net export figures is much sharper, so to speak--much more positive--than the GNP numbers are implying, because we are getting extraordinary strength in industrial production Do you read it that way? Or is that--   We could be building inventories for export, which affects the industrial production index but doesn't show up in the trade figures I think implicit in all of this is that if the industrial production index stalls, it would raise some serious questions about this hypothesis   Any other questions for Mike before we go to the general comments? May I request that, in the general comments, you address one question that is bothering me particularly, and I think it's really crucial to the outlook I would appreciate hearing any views you have on how to interpret the rise in long-term Treasury rates--that is, to what extent would you disaggregate the rise into inflation premiums, or expectations instability premiums, and what part do you perceive to be real? By expectations instability premiums I mean expectations that bond prices fluctuate so dramatically that, in fact, you're imposing a premium on the overall interest rate It strikes me that much of what we are viewing out there, and how we view it, is going to depend to a very substantial extent on how we evaluate the various components in what is a fairly significant rise in the underlying bond rate I think President Boehne wanted to open it up?   Thank you President Parry   Thank you Mr Corrigan    9/22/87   The point is that, implicit in that, is the breakdown of the components   Do both   So this is your increment?   It has been volatile; therefore, it can't be more volatile?   But, it's almost impossible to tell at this time   President Stern   President Forrestal   Thank you President Keehn   Cold-rolling operations? Or importing slab?  -21-    9/22/87   Thank you Mr Boykin   President Black   I wish we knew the answer to this   Vice President Hendricks   President Melzer   Governor Angell   President Guffey   Vice President Eisenmenger   Governor Heller   Governor Seger   Governor Kelley   Thank you, Governor Now let's move on to Don Kohn   Thank you very much I think it's almost dinner time, so let's break for coffee!  [Coffee break]   Well, we better get back to the agenda As to the general discussion, I find myself probably about in the middle of much of what I have been listening to The point I would make at the moment is this while the economy is clearly quite strong, I think the orders pattern and all the various elements we usually look at are fairly balanced; to a certain extent the outlook is being given to us far more concretely than it usually is This is more classic than one realizes I grant what Mike Kelley is saying that there is something different There is always something different; something that does not look like all the previous ones There is never anything identical, and it is always a puzzlement But there is  -33-    9/22/87  nothing very unusual about this one And, it seems to have fairly good momentum The main issue, however, which I think Governor Angell mentioned, is that we do not yet have any evidence of actual inflation By that I mean as distinct from expected indicators The numbers really are remarkably soft While we can anticipate the elements of labor tightening--and I think it is probably quite correct to say that we would expect wage acceleration to occur and labor costs to run up--that has not yet happened And what that suggests to me is that, while we are tight and are likely to get tighter, we haven't yet triggered anything I think that the time frame in which these events will occur is often somewhat difficult to pin down, and I mean by that on both sides It is quite conceivable that three weeks from now we will all of a sudden begin to get some stories of significant wage patterns emerging The Wall Street Journal will usually show up on the front page with a real [unintelligible] of stories about prices, profits, inflation, and the like, and that could very well be the first indication that something is happening The point is that no one can write that story at the moment; it is not in the numbers  Consequently, as far as policy is concerned, where we are at the moment strikes me as quite appropriate to the outlook I don't feel terribly strongly about it, but I would be inclined to start off merely by assuming that we stay at "B", and that we stay with the $600 million on the borrowing requirement, if for no other reason than it is not a significant edging higher from where we are currently There is very little doubt in my mind that we can do nothing to the extent of the accumulation of economic activity that is occurring But I think it does position us in the appropriate place Having said that, I don't see the need to phrase the directive, as we did the last time, with a tilt toward further tightness I think for the moment it is probably well enough to stay basically where we are I don't know where that will fit me in the rest of this group, but I'd love to hear Mr Vice Chairman, would you like to voice your opinion?   That's what?   President Boykin   Governor Angell   Mr Boehne   Governor Heller   In the time frame you were looking at, were they down more than we were in real terms in that time?   In other words, the differential between US rates and German and Japanese rates in the time frame   Ours were coming down very significantly at the same time, so it is really a question of [differentials]-- although I don't disagree with you, as you know, on the statement you made on the exchange rates at this point   President Stern   Do you think we'll see it in some of the data before then or just in qualitative--?   So it is really a question of the evidence that emerges before the numbers begin to show?   Si Keehn   So you're going look at "B", $600 million, and you prefer a tilt upward?   President Forrestal   You're saying "B" with $500 million but a tilt upward?   I must say I'm learning a new vocabulary sitting in on these meetings   We abrogate the English language every time I come here, it seems President Parry   The assumption, of course, is that you agree with that forecast Governor Seger   Governor Kelley   Thank you President Black   Thank you Governor Johnson   President Melzer   Vice President Hendricks, would you like to comment?   Vice President Eisenmenger   Well, it is clear that there is a fairly strong consensus here for alternative B, at $600 million on borrowing; there is a small support amongst the voting members for a tilt toward something stronger in the language, and something on the other side I, personally, would go along with those vague notions of Governor Johnson on the issue of not fighting the world to try to get $600 million in this maintenance period, because it may be a futile endeavor It may, in fact, give signals, which is a point that Governor Seger raised earlier in this meeting that struck me as a reason not to specifically fight that number But, as I read the instructions that I've just been given, the language apparently should read "In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to maintain the degree of pressure on reserve positions sought in recent weeks Somewhat greater or somewhat lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable depending on indications of inflationary pressures, strength in the business expansion, developments in foreign exchange markets, as well as the behavior of the aggregates This approach is expected to be consistent with growth in M2 and M3 over the period from August to December at annual rates of around 4-1/2 percent and 6 percent, respectively M1 is expected to continue to grow relatively slowly The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that reserve conditions during the period before the next meeting are likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of 5 to 9 percent"   Symmetric language   "Somewhat greater or somewhat lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable depending on--"   You mean you would be precise for us but for the public you don't choose to be precise?  -39-    9/22/87   You mean for both aggregates?   In other words you'd say "consistent with growth in M2 and M3 over the period from August through December at annual rates of between 4 and 6 percent"   Well, no "Around" means a number--that there's only one number there   Oh, I see Around 4 and around 6 Is that what you're saying?   You mean 4 to 6 percent for both?   That's what I thought you said   What did he say?  -40-    9/22/87   So be it Around 4 percent and around 6 percent, respectively   We have set a range that is really merely plus or minus 2 percent from--   Yes, but the interesting issue would be if we are now at 7 or 7-1/4 percent and then we came in with the old 5 to 8 percent range, then I think that would really be a big signal   But 4 to 8 would essentially be saying that-- You know, I think this reads perfectly I think this basically says we are already here and we are not going anywhere   Yes, I think the general language on the actions we are taking basically would indicate that we did nothing at this meeting   As I hear the discussion, that is where we want to be  -41-    9/22/87   Unless there are further comments can we vote?   Good morning, everybody Will somebody please move the minutes? [The minutes were moved and approved at this point] Mr Cross   Any questions of Mr Cross?   Why don't I respond to that, and then Sam Cross can correct me There have been significant disputes over the years as to precisely what the relationship is between the Treasury and the Federal Reserve with respect to the question of exchange rate intervention As I understand it, even though there are disputable issues here, we largely tend to follow Treasury's lead in this question The Treasury's position, while basically favorable to the Louvre [Accord] as a general procedure, is that they nonetheless are interested in making certain that we don't endeavor to defend a particular position which is indefensible And, I would think that while the general view of the Secretary sort of backed and filled on various occasions, ideally, he would like to see the markets stabilize on their own without any actions on our part, whether through monetary or intervention policies But, should that not occur, his willingness to commit US resources is limited And the general impression that I get, although it is not articulated necessarily sharply at all times, is that if the market moves us down gradually without any secondary consequences until we reach a market equilibrium, that would suit the Treasury just fine There is, however, I think a general awareness that this all could get out of hand and that there could be a lot of dangerous, secondary problems But it is the Secretary's view--maybe I should use the word "hope" because that is more relevant--that that will not materialize So, I would say at the moment, that while the Louvre [unintelligible], it is clearly fading; and it will continue to do so unless and until there are dramatic policy shifts on the part of the Treasury, which I must say to you, I think would not be appropriate Irrespective of what has been happening recently, I would say that we are not freely floating but we are floating in a way in which the degree of intervention that the Treasury is willing to commit is very minor   There is an element of that There is a very fundamental question that we never seem to confront How successful is intervention under various, different conditions? I think that the major thrust of our policy, as I understand it, is basically to exhibit our hand [to show] that we have not completely lost interest in the exchange rate, leaving the impression that should something really significant occur, we would be in there with both feet But, that is a very mild position, I think, relative to what it was several months ago, and certainly at the beginning of the Louvre agreement But, as best I can read it, there has unquestionably been a significant change in the position at Treasury in the last several months   Well, not necessarily Do you mean to reset the exchange-rate question or just to get the G-7 meeting for coordination?   At the moment, I think that there's a disinclination on our part to do it unless we have something to bring to the table If something significant materializes out of these negotiations currently going on, then I would suspect that we are dealing with the possibility of a G-7 meeting which, in effect, would endeavor to exchange fiscal actions on our part with comparable actions on the part of Germany and Japan Presumably, at that point, they would revisit specific paragraphs of the Louvre agreement, probably to reset where the intervention points would be We have now run through all intervention points of which I am aware   There is concern of that I found that President Poehl is, I would say, somewhat less firm than Mr Stoltenberg on this question And, I think what Manley Johnson is talking about is really to the point they have constructed for themselves a series of monetary targets carved into granite by means    11/3/87  unknown to anybody; and the credibility of the Bundesbank is at stake If you go into the market and intervene heavily, you may think you are fully sterilizing [unintelligible] but it sort of leaks all over the place I think that there are significantly different views I would gather, but I'm not sure, that what President Poehl was saying last night necessarily is speaking for the German government in total, but it does reflect a significant part of his views You were there, Jerry Is that your impression?   And that's probably correct, too   I think we have to remember what the issue of the dollar is It is not that it is falling per se, but that whatever it is doing creates a judgment in the market that it will continue to do that There are really two ways to look at this and that is really, I think, what divides the economic fraternity at this stage If, somehow, somebody could wave a wand and move the exchange rate down sharply to a point where the expectation of future change was zero, then the yield spreads between intermediate or long-term issues in dollars and those denominated in the other currencies would dramatically come together; and we would get the type of stability that we would like The problem, unfortunately, is that the other potential is that a sharply [falling] dollar merely will be extrapolated, as Sam Cross has implied Here, we don't know, largely because we don't know where the bottom is Obviously, the lower we are the closer the bottom is, by definition Exchange rates tend to be non-negative, though sometimes you wonder Judging from the way the markets have been behaving the last several weeks, I think the probabilities that a freefall is about to happen or could happen have diminished Unfortunately, the trouble is that even if the probabilities have diminished, the consequences of that event are extremely dangerous Even if we get to the point where we are all fully, unequivocally, convinced that there are no secondary reaction problems in the exchange rate, I think we had better keep up our guard   The only way we can do that is to eliminate intervention, assuming it works in the first place, and do it through market rates   And you will find, as you just heard, that you have people who don't agree with you on the other side of this table   That's what we're doing at the moment   We are now on agenda item 12 or 13 May I ask you to hold such remarks until we discuss policy questions? Are there any more specific questions of Sam? He never had a chance to answer questions   Does anyone have any further questions for Sam?   There's a wonderful debate that goes on in the legal literature, which somebody gave me earlier on and which I found fascinating I came away from it deciding that this [arrangement] works in ways that are very mysterious   If there are no other questions, I will seek a motion to ratify Mr Cross' activities I also need a motion to approve a one-year extension in the swap line agreements Approved Mr Sternlight   Why don't we wait [on the leeway recommendation] and see first if there are any questions on your report?   I think we have to be careful here when we say that a lower dollar basically induces individuals to be less interested in dollars Obviously, that goes against everything else we know that the lower the price, the greater the demand In a technical sense, every time we get a change in the exchange rate which leads to a change in long-term yields, what we are looking at, in effect, is a change in the far-distant forward position of the exchange rate In other words, if the exchange rate is falling and the bond market is collapsing--assume it's against the yen and the yen-denominated securities are not moving--what effectively is    11/3/87  happening is that the short-term decline in the dollar-yen relationship is creating an expectation of a very much sharper decline in the future That's the critical issue It is the expected rate of forward deterioration in the exchange rate which translates into basis points on the yield spread in the long-term, risk-free instruments And, it is conceivable that we will get to a point--at some point, I hope--that the exchange rate will arrive at a level which the markets perceive will not go very much further, and the forward position of the dollar will begin to rise and we will get a decline in long-term interest rates The danger here is that with the huge block of US dollar-denominated securities outstanding, psychological cracks could induce tremendously rapid changes and create high degrees of instability So, I think that something happened last week I think one can argue that there has been an odd form of delinking--that there is a presumption that declines in the dollar do not imply that there will be future declines in the dollar The trouble is that it might be what happened last week, and it may be what's happening this week, yet next week the markets might turn right around on us and go in the other direction But, I do think it's important not to think of it in the sense of a tight linkage about what Federal Reserve policy is going to do, although it does seem that way I think we have to remember that we are dealing with real variables and that the markets tell us a great deal in this respect   What was the bond market doing?   What's the funds rate expectation at $450 million borrowing under normal conditions?   Governor Seger   Any other questions for Mr Sternlight? You have a recommendation?   Before we vote, let's have Norm Bernard read the directive   I also read from everything I've been listening to that the official borrowing target, to the extent that it's required, is $400 million   It's out, if you put it the way--   Since it is 130 pm, I think we ought to vote on this and get to lunch   The vote next meeting is Tuesday and Wednesday, hear a motion to adjourn?  is unanimous The date of our December 15th and 16th Do I  SPEAKER(?) So moved   Without objection, to lunch  END OF MEETING  -47-       Why don't we separately move on the actions the Manager has taken since the September meeting and then settle the motion on the specific request? Motions approved Mr Prell   We also got the Conference Board index in a post October 19th [survey] and it didn't show that at all So we have a problem on how to read these things Mike, why don't you report on the differences for just a second?   President Parry   Bob, I think it rests on two issues one is the movement of import prices at a rate higher than domestic prices; second, and just as important, is the renewed share of imports in total domestic demand You need both to have this effect The interesting question is How do you get this small a number? Is it the fact that your import price estimates are much lower than the staff's?   But we are importing computers on which the prices are going down; that's probably the reason that it's happening   I think you're raising a terribly important question here I think it's important that we get that right   Governor Heller   Are there any further questions?   After the fourth quarter?   Governor Seger   I think we are now at a point where not only Mr Prell has to be adventuresome, but the rest of us do as well   Does anyone want to open up [the discussion] around the table? Mr Boykin   President Parry   President Keehn   President Boehne   President Forrestal   President Black   President Stern   I missed it What happened there?   But we will hold you to it   President Melzer   Vice Chairman Corrigan   Governor Angell   President Morris   Governor Heller   Is there anyone else?   Governor Kelley   We haven't heard from Presidents Guffey and Hoskins Do either of you wish to add to the body of knowledge?   In view of the time, it's probably advisable to break for coffee, assuming that it hasn't gotten cold yet Then we will come back and Don Kohn will brief us on monetary policy  [Coffee break]   Mr Kohn   Are there questions for Mr Kohn? Mr Stern   Any more questions?   Any other questions of Don? Let me start off with a review of where I think we have been In a certain sense, we have been very fortunate for the last couple of weeks We chose to supply the demand for excess reserves in the system We did it essentially by endeavoring to target the funds rate because, obviously, if we target the funds rate then we automatically supply  -28-    11/3/87  the demand for reserves at that interest rate And, in that context, it's crucial that you come out with the right rate I think we fumbled into it and, at least in retrospect, it looks as though it came out to be about where it should be namely, slightly under 7 percent As a result, I think we have seen a marginal return toward the normal relationships, defined in this context as reflecting the differential yield spreads and the basic flight--or crash--to quality that seemed to be occurring at that point We can go on with this policy for a while, and my impression is that we have very little choice but to do that I think, however, it is important to remember that we have a number of sequential dangers out there I think the one of utmost importance, against which all efforts have to be directed, is what I would call a flight from the future At the moment there is investment going on in the longer term of this country In other words, people are buying longer-term bonds; they are still buying stocks, and yields are not all that bad; the exchange rate is soft but it's [not] falling on its face It is not all that difficult to imagine a less developed country scenario where what we had would have led to a dramatic collapse in the exchange rate, a huge rise in long-term bond rates, or the effective disappearance of the long-term bond market Obviously, under those conditions the stock market would fall away and everything would implode into the short run And the bill rate would collapse, and we would have all these crazy, horrible events that none of us thinks can happen until we see them Now that's the type of scenario that would force us, just to preserve the system, to move the discount rate up two or three points And then we would get into the types of problems that a historic monetary collapse always creates We are far from that at this stage, but I suspect a lot nearer than we would like to believe, because financial markets have been so inherently unstable, just looking at the variations in volume and prices The evaluation process which runs stocks the way they have been running in the last two weeks suggests a degree of uncertainty--especially a degree of uncertainty, potentially, in the foreign exchange markets We could very readily see a major endeavor to shift portfolios out of dollar-denominated securities into those denominated in other currencies That obviously can't be successful, after the fact, but it can have powerful effects on the exchange rates I think, as a consequence, this is a potential danger out there  Obviously, we have to be very cautious about how we move from the path that we are on toward a more stable regular policy-oriented position Consequently, as I said, I see no real alternative to trying to operate, roughly, along the lines of what we are calling alternative "B" at this stage Hopefully, if this situation continues to stabilize, we will be able gradually to pull away from funds rate targeting and allow the supply of excess reserves to fall with the decline in demand At that point, obviously, we will be seeing a closing of the bill rate/funds rate spread and presumably we will be seeing the longer-term corporate Baa less US Treasury spread come back down, and the junk bonds even will look almost saleable But we are still a goodly way away from that; we are still not normal These are not anywhere close to normal relationships, normal credit conditions, or normal attitudes in the market I think there's a sense of relief out there, but I don't think it's anywhere close to a sense of stability The fact that we have had a 500 point drop in the Dow, as far as I'm concerned, has now changed all the program trading, all of the different types of risk operations [unintelligible] people    11/3/87  take It's hard for me to see the stock market going all the way back to where it was I think the risk premiums that are now associated with what could happen have [unintelligible] It is conceivable, therefore, that in retrospect this whole thing could turn out to have been a remarkable blessing I must tell you that the odds of it coming out that way cannot be very large, but they are not zero either  In any event, strangely, I don't think we have a policy problem, at least as I see it, as to what our policy should be, because it seems that it should be just an automatic continuation of what we have been doing, so we can phase into something more permanently There is also the issue of how we portray ourselves to the public And that's not only the issue of what we do but of how we say it--how we write down the directive--because this particular directive is going to be disaggregated in such detail that periods and misprints are going to be read as having great, great importance So, I merely wish to say that I'd appreciate not only your thoughts and your usual comments here on the issue of policy--the borrowing--but also your recommendations on how we portray ourselves to the public at large in the specific formulation of the directive, taking any revisions from what we tentatively put down in the Bluebook Governor Angell   President Boehne   May I just interpose that we have interpreted what we are doing as alternative "B" Let's try to make certain that we are not dealing with differences of current perception Don, do you want to address this issue? What I don't want to happen here is to have differences which really relate to what we are doing as distinct from where we want to be   Well, that's actually where we are   That's where we think we are at the moment   I think that's a rounding question   Ed, what borrowing number were you thinking of? Are you thinking of $250 million, which is what the "A" number actually is?   You are targeting the funds rate?   Well, the borrowing assumption is in there When you're dealing with this sort of market it just breaks away from--   You have to make a distinction of whether you want to do borrowing or you want to do the funds rate   You have made your point President Black   President Parry   I'm sorry, what language?   President Forrestal   President Boykin   President Melzer   Norm tells me that the adjustment and the switch will be noted in the next policy record   President Stern   Indeed it is   Yes We do have a problem here, though Let's focus on it because I may have to re-poll [those who have commented already] Listening to everybody so far, everybody is locking into a funds rate that is very much more narrow than the funds rate that we are stipulating in this directive The question that we have to decide is this In the process of formulating this directive do we go with these very broad funds rate ranges, which is what would be consistent with a specific borrowing target, or do we go with a much narrower funds rate target, however we publish it, and have a much broader range on the borrowing side? It's very difficult to encompass the type of funds rate targeting that we have been hearing around this table in terms of 5 to 9 percent or 4 to 8 percent This is a choice   It doesn't exist   Go ahead, sure   What would you do about the very last phrase on the funds rate range?   Okay, I will put your variation on the table President Morris   President Keehn   I'm sorry, what was the last phrase?   Okay Governor Heller   Oh no, it's different in the sense that it depends on what you are targeting and what you are leaving as a residual So in that sense there is a meaning in doing that; the question is whether in so doing we also suggest a change in policy that we don't want to communicate   [Unintelligible] but it's one thing to be pegging the funds rate, which is not what the Desk is doing, and it's another thing to sort of be taking a shot at it in some direction To peg the rate would have some interesting implications Governor Kelley   For the Corrigan language?   Governor Johnson   I'd like to respond to that I don't see how we can do that without a conference call Governor Seger   If the roof falls in there is nothing to choose between those two alternatives    11/3/87   President Guffey   President Hoskins   I think we can feel the consensus, which surprises me in a sense but--    11/3/87   We didn't listen to what Governor Heller--   It is not "pointing"; it's "pointed"   Well, it's technically correct if you think about it It is past tense that the indicators in that period pointed to continuing gains   It's not discussing the continuing gains, it's discussing the indicators   Does anybody else feel strongly about that issue?   Technically, that statement is correct It's only a question of how you read it   Governor Angell   May I make a suggestion? This might not be a bad idea since it is a very crucial directive I think it would be useful to have it xeroxed and circulated so everyone has a chance to take a shot at it Is that--   Does anybody have any further comments at this particular stage on substantive questions? It's fairly obvious that there is a consensus basically on "B", however we define it, and asymmetrical language towards ease Everyone is talking, essentially, 6-3/4 to 6-7/8 percent on the funds rate, but I presume, to depict it in the usual wider range And Jerry Corrigan is getting rave reviews and we will use his language However, before we finalize it, let's take a look to make certain that we are all talking from the same set of notes   I would say $400 million   Governor Angell, are you still concerned about that money growth reference?   Should we put 4 to 8 percent in for the funds rate range or would you prefer 5 to 9 percent?   Can I have a quick rundown on the copy of this Corrigan language for 4 to 8 percent or 5 to 9 percent?  Vice Chairman Corrigan - My own preference was 5 to 9 Mr Angell - 4 to 8 Mr Boehne - 4 to 8, but not a strong preference Mr Boykin - 5 to 9 Mr Heller - 4 to 8 Mr Johnson - Totally indifferent Mr Kelley - 4 to 8 Ms Seger - 4 to 8 Mr Stern - 5 to 9 Mr Keehn - 4 to 8  -45-    11/3/87   I think that Governor Johnson is the titular, de facto, temporary chairman   Doesn't strike me as a democratic election! Would somebody like to move the Vice Chairman?   No objection I don't know when that game is in June   Will Mr Bernard read the staff officer nominees?   Can we have somebody move and second those officers?   Without objection The next item is choice of the Federal Reserve Bank to execute transactions for the System Open Market Account Would somebody like to make a nomination?  SPEAKER(?) I will move, sir   You need to state a preference Why don't we try New York?  SPEAKER(?) I'm going to New York  SPEAKER(?) Do they have a staff that can handle that primary--   That's their problem   By all means   May I point out that a discussion of procedures is a later item on the agenda   I think that that would be an appropriate item to bring up at that time Why don't we do that? I have a motion Do I have a second?    3/29/88  SPEAKER(?) I second it   No objections? Now we can vote on the selection of the Manager for Domestic Operations and the Manager for Foreign Operations, System Open Market Account The incumbents are currently, of course, Mr Sternlight and Mr Cross Would somebody like to make any other nominations, and if not would somebody like to move, second or oppose?  SPEAKER(?) Move  SPEAKER(?) Second   Without objection It is required that these nominees be acceptable to the Board of Directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which I assume will occur with the usual formality  The next item is the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations Is there any objection to renewing the authorization as it stands? If not, we can consider that to be done We also need to renew the Foreign Currency Authorization, the Foreign Currency Directive, and the Procedural Instructions With Respect to Foreign Currency Operations Any objection to renewing all three?  SPEAKER(?) None   If not, consider it done We have the same issue with respect to the Program for Security of FOMC information Why don't you read the changes, Mr Bernard?   Without objection, the authorization is renewed Governor Johnson, I understand, is prepared to make a nomination with respect to a variety of appeals authority   Is there a second?  SPEAKER(?) Second   Without objection Any questions on the examination report of the System Open Market Account? Would somebody move acceptance?   Second?    3/29/88  SPEAKER(?) Second   No objection Now we are finally up to the minutes Without objection Mr Cross   Any questions for Mr Cross?   I think that you're raising an important question that has no good answer But an interesting issue is whether there is an answer to a secondary question Can intervention even remotely succeed on an incremental basis? In other words, do we make much progress by small interventions, which can't have any effect or are perceived to be ineffectual and may even be counterproductive? Or, if we have the choice, if the rate has to be sustained, do we choose to intervene in amounts that do affect the market? I don't know how [unintelligible] reads the experience in the last six months, but it strikes me that the only times that I was concerned about the intervention were when [unintelligible] and it didn't seem to have any effect as we watched the monies being spent But I know when [unintelligible] hit the markets heavy and hit them also on the way up, I thought we received [unintelligible] response We may not be able to answer the first question, and I don't think that we will ever be able to answer that one; but my own question is whether or not we should at least be focusing on the more discontinuous intervention-- whether you're in or out--not this dribble effect   That's a crucial issue I don't think anybody denies that monetary policy is effective--   But it's a very interesting analytical question as to whether one can make the judgment you're making--in other words;, it really gets to the crucial question of what's the elasticity of supply of our system in the manufacturing sector and how close we are [to full capacity] I think that it will be helpful later if both Messrs Prell and Truman could address this issue as to basically (1) how much in the rate of change in the physical volume on both imports and exports is related to the current exchange rate levels; and (2) to what extent are we at the margin of capacity with respect both to the existing forecast and to any acceleration in economic growth which would result from a further decline of the exchange rate I think that that's the crucial question that really [unintelligible] about policy generally Anyway, I didn't mean to get into this at this stage Any further questions for Sam?   That's a question of monetary policy   [Unintelligible] I think the only argument you can make is that sterilizing intervention can have only a short effect and would be meaningful only to the extent that you can alter the psychology of the portfolio adjustment process And with the huge stock of assets out there, psychology is not an irrelevant consideration because you can get very substantial moves for [unintelligible] period of time with no change in fundamentals, as I would read the same evidence Long term, there can't be anything there and there isn't But short term I think it's an ambiguous [unintelligible]--that you can get some temporary effect and if you can do it after an appropriate time it probably can have some [unintelligible] But I don't know of anyone who can solve the debate on this issue It has been going on for a long time    3/29/88   If there are no further questions for Mr Cross, can I have a motion to approve the transactions since the last meeting?  SPEAKER(?) I'll move   Second?  SPEAKER(?) Second   Any objections? Domestic Desk operations, Mr Sternlight   Any questions for Mr Sternlight?  SPEAKER(?) My recollection of the Continental Illinois episode three years ago is that there was a more marked quality spread in the market then than what we see in the First Republic Bank situation First of all, is that true? And if it is, why? Do you think the market is getting used to this kind of bad news and hardened to it, or what?   If there are no further questions for Mr Sternlight, first, we need to ratify his transactions since the February meeting and, secondly, authorize his leeway request May I have a motion to move?   No objection? And on the leeway request?   No objection? At our last meeting we had a number of discussions on operating procedures and related issues and a memorandum has been put together by Messrs Kohn and Sternlight on that Mr Kohn would you give a report summary?   Questions or comments on the issues raised? Peter, did you want to add anything at all?   Mr Black   Governor Heller   Let's be certain of that What we're now on is the side issue of the 1979 procedure, which I think is very interesting Let's continue it, but let's limit it to a certain extent and stay only on the 1979 procedure I'd appreciate going further But if anyone else who was here then wants to [comment], that was a terribly important period for exactly this issue, and I don't wish to say that we shouldn't discuss it at all   Are you still on the 1979 issue? Then hold it   Actually, we'll start with 1979 And then I think Governor Angell is next   [Unintelligible] this is tough to maintain Maybe we ought to go back to the regular sequence Governor Angell   Statistically, you can't, because you're dealing with a number which is positive and cannot go below zero So the bias--especially as you're getting to the lower area--has to be on the plus side   No, I mean the bias If you're trying to hit a target which can have errors on both sides, it can never have an error which is below zero, so that the expected estimate is always higher than the one you're shooting at   Vice Chairman   You know, I think the question basically is there is no ambiguity on the issue of targeting some monetary  aggregate They may be right or they may be wrong, but that's clear And we think we used to know what the relationship was with the economy   I'm trying to get at an interesting issue here, because the question really gets down to how you would determine what the appropriate funds rate is   Let's remember why we went to a borrowing target--basically because the monetary aggregates per se sort of broke away from their ties [to broad measures of economic performance] and, as a consequence, required reserves tended not to be working any longer So, instead of nonborrowed reserves, we just took the top part of it, and knocked out the income velocity part which was giving us trouble, and we now have the borrowing target   This sounds to me, as Jerry said before, exactly like all of the discussions which led to the targeting of monetary aggregates Because, in fact, then you had a tie-in    3/29/88   There is, and I think Frank Morris will add to it!   I'm sorry, publishing funds?   President Forrestal   President Boehne   Is that factually correct? Can we have a meeting without being on the record?   President Hoskins   President Stern   President Black   President Melzer  -28-    3/29/88   Governor Seger   President Guffey   Let me tell you how I would define it I would define a policy change as one resulting from a change in the economic fundamentals which the FOMC did not perceive, or had not anticipated, and it required some form of adjustment Incremental changes to fine tune are not policy changes   Yes Don, that's the way I look at it But, I think it's important for the Committee, not the Chairman, to  -33-    3/29/88  define what constitutes a policy change It's in the discretion of the Committee to set policy It's in the discretion, as I hear it here, of the Desk in consultation with the Chairman to merely fine tune in that context But you cannot simultaneously have the Desk or the Chairman define what a change in policy is, because that will of necessity always override the Committee So, I think what is required is that we get an agreement about what constitutes a change in policy As I read it, we have a meeting and there's a consensus which emerges with respect to what the outlook is, and that is implicit in the directive Often the directive is very vague; if somebody were to tell me that that is an extremely sharp [unintelligible] set of instructions, I would tell them I don't understand the language But what is clear is the preceding discussion about what the general impression is, what various numbers were--[the context] in which we constructed that directive And they are rather sophisticated insights which are very difficult to put down, but which I think are not unambiguous I know that if somebody asked me what the FOMC's views were at the last meeting, I'd have no trouble describing them-- not in directive terms, but in terms of how the Committee evaluated the economy and the financial system and what it, therefore, thought was an appropriate policy As best I can see it, when things change such that the Committee's view of the outlook is changing and that therefore alters the structure of the directive--that I would consider a change in policy   No, we did not   No, I think that was merely an affirmation of what the markets were questioning whether, in fact, we had nudged down slightly in the funds rate--which we had, by about 1/8th And the only reason to put that in at the time was not as a statement of policy change, but as an affirmation of what the markets had been discussing   A $50 million change   Well, I think the issue is not so much whether it should be announced but whether it should be confirmed or not The reason I chose to, at the time, was that a lot of people were asking that question, and the simplest way of resolving it-- instead of being sphinxlike--was just to admit to it If it gets to the point that every statement the Chairman makes is a statement of a    3/29/88  change in policy, then we really better think out what the Chairman is supposed to say   It really gets to a question of what the definition of change is, because it is extremely rare that there are big discontinuities involved here But there's an awful lot of ambiguity about when you go from here to there; it's not a clear cut thing I must say that before I attended FOMC meetings, I had a different view of what constitutes the nature of policy, because I used to read the directives and I couldn't for the life of me figure out what in the world they were talking about But now, given the few FOMC meetings I've attended, I'm realizing what it is   President Keehn   President Boykin   Governor Kelley   President Parry   It turned out much longer than we had scheduled, but actually it has been an extraordinarily useful meeting As I read the tone of the proceedings, what comes out is that we probably would like something firmer to target To somehow get a restoration of the monetary targets and income velocities that look like we could use them, would get us back to the fundamental approach of what monetary policy is all about--namely, interfacing not with interest rates, but with the financial variables in the system which affect inflation and real growth in the real world, rather than the  -36-    3/29/88  intermediate proxies that are involved I sense that there is a general view of satisfaction--that may be too strong of a word--a sense of resignation to current procedures, largely with the assumption that this five-year transition won't last for another five years And, hopefully, we'll get to something a little firmer to target  What I would like to suggest, however, is that rather than just allow this issue to fade away, we come back to it again at some point--maybe six months, maybe a year from now So long as we're in a transition period, I think we should not behave as though it is a permanent, fully satisfactory and solid procedure I don't think anyone around this table has said that What I hear is a fairly broad consensus that we stay where we are, but that we continually review it If there are no objections, I would like to reschedule a review of this in nine months or a year or so, depending on what the circumstances are   Yes, we're pretty much back Since time is running short, I would ask the Vice Chairman whether we could leave the issue of the timing of the organization meeting to the next meeting?   Because we're not going to be reorganizing again, hopefully, for a while   This is probably an appropriate time to break for coffee and we will come back  [Coffee break]   He was referring to the run-of-the-mill forecast, not the staff's [Laughter]   The problem of using that, of the potential inventory change, is it because of consumption goods?   The GNP [unintelligible]  -39-    3/29/88   One thing we tend to forget is that when a lot of this discussion emerged on resource stringency and the like, we were in the 1950s and 1960s At that time, we used to think that a big inflationary push was when the inflation rate went from 2-3/4 to 3-1/2 percent We had some really tight markets in those periods and what we learned, especially in retrospect, was that something happened in the 1970s It's not strictly the pressure question because we had  -40-    3/29/88  much more pressure back in the '60s than now and inflation rates were considerably below where they are now There was very little inflation premium embodied in long-term interest rates And yet there was this standard--they didn't call it NAIRU then, but they had this capacity constraint question There is a tendency in today's environment to take the single points of the 1970s and say inflation pressures mean 3 percentage points, or 4 or 5 points And I suspect what we are looking at is not this resource allocation pressure but the issue of financial change that has occurred and the money supply and expectations effect that you are referring to But it may turn out that one fallout from this disinflationary period is that we may have--without our knowing it, and we won't know it until later-- successfully lowered the response rate of the NAIRU or the capacity restraint question  When we look at capacity--and the Fed is the official source of these data--capacity is a very dubious concept You really don't know whether or not you have run into capacity until you have some objective measures of the inability to meet customer orders That is really what it's all about And the lead times on the deliveries on materials--with the exception of steel, [unintelligible] metals products, paper and the like--haven't really expanded all that much In other words, the system is producing to demand, and even though the backlogs go up, there is no evident pressure So, while I think we are getting close, and I think the issues we are raising are the correct ones, let's stay with the numbers And the numbers at this stage are still telling us that there is some flexibility there yet There may not be much, but I don't see it, and I guess you don't either It's conceivable that the NAIRU may be lower or that excess capacity in terms of current costs may be still larger in general I would hate for us to make an assumption and start crying wolf, and then stop crying wolf at the point where the whole thing blows up on us I think we may have some flexibility here, but not an awful lot As I see it, the facts don't show anything else Do you disagree with that view?   It seems that people still report on deliveries in qualitative terms--only relative to something else When they give you the real numbers [unintelligible]   We are not getting an inventory rush, which is when things are getting tight, purchasing managers are getting scared, and they really start to load up They just haven't  -41-    3/29/88   I think that is exactly the way to put it You're in a high risk area, where if anything goes wrong, prices could accelerate Any other questions before we go to the general go around? We are now open to general discussions President Parry   Vice Chairman   It's getting to be 115 I suspect that it would be appropriate, rather than to try to finish up, to continue the meeting over lunch and truncate, to a certain extent at least, our regular luncheon agenda So, why don't we take a break now to get lunch and then we will continue the FOMC meeting   Do you have any analysis of how the staff interest rate forecast affects the thrifts and the Texas situation?   Questions for Mr Kohn? If not, shall we do our usual circle?   President Parry has the floor   We have a little problem with the Brazilian negotiations, which has diverted Jerry Corrigan for a short while He'll be back, but he asks for us to get started in any event I was listening rather closely to the discussion we have had, and it strikes me that there is fairly general uniformity of views as to what is happening to the economy And I think that Governor Heller's view that what we are looking at is the elimination of the negatives as distinct from accumulation of the positives is exactly right The one thing we have to be a little careful about is that we recognize that at some point, whenever you get a situation which is as uniformly positive as this, it turns It's only a question of when it turns The thing that's bothering me slightly about the outlook as I look at it--not in the negative sense but in the confirmation sense--is that, at this particular stage in the cycle, if we are running into the type of acceleration and inflationary process which is at the forefront of our concerns, I think we should now begin to get some significant inventory accumulation We have all the forces in place for it namely, intermediate prices beginning to move and general awareness of aggregate demand Yet we are not seeing either; nor is there an acceleration of the types of commodity prices which tend to be reflective of imbalance in supply and demand I'm not arguing for the commodity price explanation on the inflation side--where Governor Angell is coming from--but we have not had yet the secondary follow- through on metals prices and other prices, which have since stabilized, not as an indicator of inflation but, I think, as an indicator of the fact that this thing is not yet accumulating My guess is it probably will, but I don't think the evidence is here as yet that it has And the data we have on lead times, while higher, don't yet suggest the type of tightness that we see in a lot of individual industries This is a process that I fear is going to create a fairly substantial acceleration at some time, but it isn't at the moment--or at least it hasn't I'd be very curious--for those of you who have very specific insights on this, I would appreciate your addressing this issue very specifically, if you would, during the monetary discussion I don't think there is any question that the next move that we have to make is on the upside And the only question, basically, is whether we do it now or we do it before the next FOMC meeting on the basis of certain contingencies The thing I feel a little uncomfortable with is the answer to this question If we weren't meeting today, on this particular date, would we be moving or would we be waiting a couple of weeks or so? The reason I raise the question is that there is a market expectation which extrapolates itself from what we do In other words, if we start to move sharply, then the expectation jumps very quickly I'm a little concerned that if we move too fast, we can get significantly ahead of the curve, as has been said And there is a stock market out there that I think could get pretty shabby We could get confidence reversed  So, where I come out at the moment is basically for either alternative B with asymmetrical language toward tightening, with a    5/17/88  fairly explicit expectation that at the appropriate point we would move up; or going up $100 million now on borrowing, also with that asymmetrical language, because I think the question really gets to an issue of whether we go up $100 million or $200 million before the next FOMC meeting My own preference would be for "B" with asymmetrical language implying almost certainly moving sometime during the intermeeting period But I don't think there are any particular dangers if we were to raise borrowing $100 million now Frankly, I think going $200 million now, on top of what we have done already, is getting to the edge of being a little risky on the rapidity of the movement implicit in that and the extent to which there can be market extrapolations which occur as a consequence Governor Johnson   President Morris   We should pick that up in the purchasing managers' survey; it's probably more sensitive than most published figures   You get the lead times, and you get a qualitative sense of the issue you are raising   President Parry    5/17/88   But this is the later; we are there now We have already had this Of course, we're in May and about to get into June We just haven't seen what has been happening in the data Historically, it would be happening just about now   Yes   I don't think so   President Stern   President Forrestal   President Hoskins   I'll record you as "C" because I don't have [unintelligible] on the other end! President Boehne   Governor Heller   Do you mean $100 million at some point between--   President Guffey   Governor Angell   President Keehn   Governor Seger   President Black   Governor Kelley   President Boykin   Vice Chairman   President Melzer   As I tabulate the results, everyone here believes, as best I can judge, that the next moves are higher The only thing that basically differs here is whether we move now or move in a short period What I would like to suggest is that, if I've written down correctly what I heard from everybody, there seems to be a consensus for alternative B and asymmetrical language, with a fairly strong willingness--desire, if I can put it that way--to give instructions to the Chairman and the Desk to move before the next period I would interpret that to mean that, unless we see events which clearly are contrary to the general consensus of the outlook as one hears it today, it's almost an automatic increase There is a strong, and I think convincing, case that is being made that we should not, under any conditions, allow ourselves to get behind the power curve on this question And I would say further--in line with the issue Frank raised about the frequency of meetings--that should anything of moment arise that suggests the need to have a telephone meeting, I think we should That would substitute for having to come to grips with this rescheduling question I don't think there's any doubt that we are in a very sensitive policy period; and I think that close discussion and judgments are probably going to be needed at intervals shorter than our scheduled FOMC meetings So, what I'd like to suggest, and I hope that Norm would find the appropriate language-- I'm sorry, there's one thing I did forget Unfortunately, I only got from President Black his judgment about that sentence; we did not get any other appraisals on leaving that sentence in or dropping it out I think we'll go around on that question before we take our vote Normand, why don't you just--   Well, no In a certain sense--   5 to 9 percent is clearly--   Yes, but 5 to 9 percent is in both "B" and "C"; so it's automatic   It's clearly [the preference of] the majority for it to be out Anyhow, what I'd like to do is have a vote Why don't you--   I can't; I've never been able to read his writing so--   I'm sorry, I think you're putting the--   Yes In other words, it's a fairly strong asymmetrical statement?   The timing   Not will be, would be   Because there is, in effect, a contingency here   Anybody object strongly to that language?   How would you rephrase it?   But that's not what the majority is   Oh, okay I'm asking the question of whether I've captured the sense of the majority   No, I would not say expect; I would say if we don't, that would require one   It requires a telephone conference   Two weeks   Yes   He's talking about all the participants   I think you're correct on the total Committee [participants]   I don't think it comes out that way [for the voting members]   Unless I'm mistaken   Yes We might as well because we are very explicit on exactly what the difference is We can do that So, let me tell you what the language is and what the actual difference is The question basically is the issue of $100 million now or $100 million in, say, two weeks, unless some event occurs That's what the difference basically is in this particular group Would that be the view?   In either event, there is asymmetric language in the directive over and above this Okay, why don't you poll on that very specific question   No, we haven't, because we don't have enough votes for that to have--   Well, we still have asymmetric language   Yes; that's correct   That's the same vote that I got before So, unless I'm mistaken, that is captured by Don Kohn's language   You know, there's a difference I think we're pretty clear on what the consensus is That language is not in the public domain, in any event, for six weeks; and I don't think that there are ambiguities on what the instructions to the Desk and Chairman are in this respect Why don't you read the directive as we now have it   6 to 7 is right; that stays in   That period   You know, really it shouldn't--   Don, is there any reason why?   Can I suggest that we make that change at the next FOMC meeting, because you're actually raising more difficult questions Let's stay with what we have; let's do 6 to 7 percent March to June, but resurrect this issue because I think Governor Angell is raising a quite legitimate question   We can vote   Anybody have any objections to discussing the monetary base over sandwiches?  [Short recess]   Mr Kohn   If you can get a majority for the whole procedure   President Morris   What was the actual reserve growth?   Governor Heller   President Parry   President Black   Governor Angell   You have indeed Mr Vice Chairman   Governor Johnson   I think Lee is raising the point that if the market believed what we were doing, the long-term rates would be lower; hence, the yield spread would tend to be tilted differently from what it would otherwise be, to say the least   President Boehne   Governor Kelley   Then what happens on July 1st? In other words, suppose you take a specific action that drives it down   All constraints legally come off as of the beginning of the next quarter?   Wouldn't you really want more of a rolling three-month average rather than an actual quarterly system? A quarterly system works very much like the maintenance period, where you could end up at the end of the period with some crazy stuff going on   President Stern   Anyone else who wishes to make a comment who hasn't yet?   Sure   That's what makes it tough to do   I was sitting here keeping score Tom did marginally better than the Orioles, but not much   However, I also kept score on the general sympathy for what it is you're trying to do And I get the impression that what we're looking for here is more something to keep us off the path of an inadvertent acceleration of inflation If that's the case, then what we haven't done yet is to evaluate some particular vehicles that would give us that sort of indication; that's the issue Jerry really was raising Can I suggest that at this particular stage we rephrase the problem, not as a Tom Melzer issue, but as an FOMC issue Let's see whether or not we can look not at the usual targeting characteristics, but strictly at the inflation    5/17/88  question To give you an example if the long-term income velocity of M2 doesn't show any significant secular trends, it means, effectively, that the GNP price level, the implicit deflator, is a close function of unit money supply defined in M2 If you go further and substitute capacity for real GNP, and cyclically adjust the price--if you can actually get that--what you're basically trying to do is to get a relationship between, say, M2 divided by capacity on the one hand--or a bit more exactly, that as a long-term indicator of price, and the inflation rate being the first difference But, if we could get some general notion--it doesn't have to be on a monthly basis, but just as a basic thrust--I think it would capture some of the issues that we're grasping for Heaven knows, I think we are all acutely aware that chasing interest rates, ultimately, is going to throw us off the cliff at the end And, while there is no real strong support for Tom on this issue, I think starting from where he started and expanding from there may get us something that we might find particularly useful Now, I just suggest that Does anybody have any notions as to where we go from here, granting that we don't like this specific proposal?   Well, yes; but remember if we have M2 in that equation, which is what would be in the one I was using, for example, that's really suggesting the nature of the noninflationary M2 target It's a target which basically diverts itself from nominal GNP and gets away from the business cycle It's basically looking at the long-term targets of policy which we view as noninflationary I think we all know from our analytical work that the relationship between price and money has been a very tough one to grab In fact, we have created such huge lags between money and prices that it gets you to wondering whether you're leading the next cycle or lagging the previous one And I think that creates difficulties If we have some longer-term thrust, at least we know where we're going out of line for two years I don't think we can target any less than that   Well, does anyone have any objection to asking Don to see whether or not he can put his people to work? If anyone has any other thoughts to throw in the hopper, it might be useful   The question is if M2 velocity secularly is flat, then you're--   Regrettably, that is a legitimate criticism   Well, why don't we take a shot at it; and we will report back to you and see where we go from there   Well, can I terminate this conversation now, and just suggest that we will report back? If we don't, we're going to break all records on the length of an FOMC meeting   Do we have some lunch? We can now go into our luncheon session  END OF MEETING  -36-       Thank you Are there any questions for Mr Cross? If there are no questions, I would entertain a motion to ratify the actions taken since the last FOMC meeting   Second?   Without objection Joan Lovett, would you report on the--   When do you envisage--was it 1984, 1985, 1986--that this process would have changed? Because, obviously the evaluation of the Jurgensen Report, which endeavored to filter through all such relationships, was unable, at least to the best it could judge, to find any significant intervention impacts Is this something that you're suggesting is--   But at some point, the type of hypothesis you're raising is testable   Governor Heller   President Hoskins   Governor Johnson   I would agree with that    8/16/88   Unless there are any further questions on this issue, I would like to move forward to domestic operations Joan Lovett   Any questions for Ms Lovett?   What is the trade number?  SPEAKER(?) $125 billion   Lee   Any further questions for Ms Lovett? If not, may I have a motion to ratify the Desk's operations since the last meeting?   The only remaining item on the agenda is to note that the next meeting is Tuesday, September 20  END OF MEETING  -48-       Without objection We will now go to our economic staff reports, and we will have Messrs Prell and Truman sequentially   Thank you Questions for either gentleman?    8/16/88   President Black   President Morris   Governor Johnson   If you add in the inventories that go with that as one of the long production cycle, you're getting nine months of consolidated inventory in front of the expenditure outlook I suspect the numbers would be a significant increment over that   It's not the PDE deflator; it's the computer component   But I think the issue is--   Well, I think this question--   Now we are about to get into the discussion of what is the definition of a unit of economic output And that's going to go on for six weeks!   I'd appreciate that I think they're horrible We had a running debate at the Board meetings on this subject--on the effect of the shifting base of the price index in the GNP--which probably at this stage fills up about six looseleaf books of about 1,000 pages   Change the structure President Melzer   President Hoskins   Governor Heller   Governor Seger    8/16/88   Are there any further questions for either gentleman? If not, we are ready to do our round robin Who would like to start off?   President Keehn   President Parry   President Forrestal   President Melzer   President Boehne   President Hoskins   President Black   President Stern   President Morris   Vice Chairman   President Guffey   Governor Seger   Governor Angell   You mean it'll be less than $39 billion?   That wasn't the reason They were all shocked into silence and incoherence   Governor Heller   Any further comments on this round robin?   Have they got grains?   That's [a reflection] largely of grain   That's the next session Governor Johnson's got a relevant comment   It seems to me you're also getting over into the next session   If there are no further comments, and before we break for coffee, I was hoping that Don Kohn could get his remarks in   Thank you Mr Kohn We'll take a break now and when we come back we will first discuss what Don has been suggesting and then we'll go to a round robin on the Committee discussion on policy  [Coffee break]   [Unintelligible] Mr Kohn and Governor Angell   President Morris   The futures markets don't show the type of tightening that's in alternative "C"   Well, the question is, which is the more valid approach to look at the futures markets for the Treasury bills, or at a survey of forecasters?   And if they are not, which do you choose?   My recollection, however, is that the forward markets are showing less of an increase than is implicit in the forecast  SPEAKER(?) That's right   President Stern   President Parry   I think it's consistent with "B" but going to "C" the next time   Any other questions? Lee   President Forrestal   President Black   I think that's one of the most interest- ing events--which we haven't really focused on in the last six or nine months--how well behaved M2 has been   President Boehne   I think it proves that it is the case-- that it's easier to move a borrowing target than it is to move fed funds   I think there is a case--   Yes   President Guffey   Governor Seger   President Melzer   Governor Heller   I think we all would like, if we possibly could, to get back to some form of money supply targeting, reserve targeting, because in fact that's what a central bank does I think if it weren't for the extraordinary breakdown of relationships, we would never be having the first, not to mention the third, conversation   Well, in an odd way we are where we are controlling M We all have been focusing on the--   But, we are not doing it day-by-day I think that there has been a fairly consistent awareness of the fact that M2 has in fact been well behaved Were it otherwise, I would suspect you'd be hearing different sorts of reactions at certain different times around this table   Are there any other questions for Don? If not, let's get to the policy questions Let me see if I can summarize what I think I'm hearing at the moment There seems to be little change in the general view that the economy remains quite strong and that the underlying structure is firm There are a few marginal weaknesses on the edge, but remarkably few relative to this stage of the business cycle expansion In fact, I didn't even hear mention of weakness in the apparel-textile area, which is the only thing that I've been hearing in any context Apparently it's not a big enough issue to be talked about  The thing that concerns me the most at this point, as I mentioned on our telephone conference the other day, is that inventories remain--as somebody put it--lean That is reflected in low inventory-sales ratios and in remarkably contained lead times on the deliveries of materials and equipment In fact, if anything in the last two or three months--leaving July out--lead times have actually softened some, suggesting that the usual underlying elements which generate demand for inventories have been largely absent And yet it is very difficult to find a business cycle expansion that at its tail end does not begin to show some pickup in [inventory] accumulation There is some accumulation going on in steel and some of the other materials, but in general it's not a big deal  It strikes me that our policy thrust ought to be in the area which cuts the top off of inventory accumulation, and if possible, capital goods accumulation Real short-term rates are very crucial issues in inventory policy We must be, I think, in a position where we feel comfortable that we are not financing a bulge in inventories that will eventually topple the whole system And I think that we're not, but I'm not quite clear what to read into the July industrial production index which, looking at the detail, struck me as the type of distribution of output which is more suggestive of a backing up of materials production than shipments into the final sales area In any event, whether one looks at it in terms of capital goods or inventory, there's just nothing out there which suggests that this is not continuing and will possibly even be moving at a rate in excess of the Greenbook [projection]  And what that tells me is that the odds are obviously strong that we will be having to tighten again in the future As a consequence, I think there's no doubt that we should be continuing with asymmetrical language At the moment I myself am content to sit tight, at least for the short run, largely because I think we shocked the market with the discount rate more than I thought we would I was, I would say, uncomfortable with the Japanese markets and a little uncomfortable with our own I think they're stabilizing now, but I do think that they still have adjustments coming from the discount rate for a while I don't know whether or not it's several weeks, or longer, but I'd feel quite comfortable at this stage staying with the $600 million of borrowing requirement, but maintaining asymmetrical language, as a consequence of acute awareness that any forms of evident problems get met with tightening Governor Angell   Do you accept asymmetric?   Governor Johnson   Would you respond to Governor Angell?   Governor Heller   President Parry   President Melzer   President Forrestal   Governor LaWare   President Black   President Stern   President Keehn   President Boehne   President Hoskins   I'm not sure what you mean by that   President Morris   Governor Seger   President Boykin   President Guffey   Vice Chairman   Okay As I read all comments, it's clear that we have a strong central tendency for $600 million, asymmetric language, alternative "B" Amongst the members, there's marginal support for moving up the Ms, although little support for number one as yet So I would suggest that what we do is to move the aggregates above foreign exchange, because it's hard to place that--   That's probably the way to do it   Now, it's conceivable that it may get demoted--   [Unintelligible] There's definitely a majority of the members in favor of doing that I've been tabulating as it goes along But it is not a strong concensus   You do?   I knew you might   But I had you down   I didn't bother asking you   Use the 6 to 10 in here   3-1/2 to 5-1/2 is what you've got in the Bluebook for "B"   3-1/2 "and" Why, did I say "to"?   Okay   3-1/2 and 5-1/2   Call a vote  -47-    8/16/88   Can we have a motion to approve the minutes of August 16th?  SPEAKER(?) I'll move it   Is there a second?   Without objection, the minutes are approved Similarly, we need a motion to accept the Report of Examination of the System Open Market Account, which was distributed in late August   Without objection Mr Cross, will you bring us up to date on operations in foreign currency markets?   Any questions for Mr Cross? If not, do I have a motion to approve his operations during the month since the August 16th meeting?  SPEAKER(?) So moved   Is there a second?   Without objection Mr Sternlight, would you bring us up to date on domestic open market operations?   Any questions for Mr Sternlight? If not, I'll entertain a motion for approval of the actions of the Desk since August the 16th  SPEAKER(?) So moved   I'm going to confirm that the next meeting is November 1st and, well, is this a record?   We have a few topics on the agenda for luncheon, which I guess will be around 1230 Let's recess until 1230   Without objection Now we'll go to the economic situation, Mr Prell   Thank you Questions for Mr Prell?   What was the composition of the change in the fixed-weight? What additional information did they have?   That's a rather large increase for a second shot at the fixed-weight   Mr Parry   President Hoskins   President Morris   Governor Seger   Governor Angell   Governor Johnson   President Boehne   Governor Kelley   President Stern   Governor LaWare   Any further questions for Mr Prell? If not, we've come to the general discussion where the individual members will give us definitive forecasts of the outlook   Over the last five years!   Well, conversion in terms of barrels of oil isn't that bad   President Forrestal   President Keehn   President Parry   Vice Chairman   Governor Seger   I know; I've done that!   President Black   President Stern   President Boehne   President Morris   In a way in which you will choose now to comment   President Melzer   President Guffey   President Hoskins   Governor Angell   Governor Heller  -21-    9/20/88  MRHELLER Thank you Let me take a little bit longer perspective on the current situation In 1986, we had 15-1/2 percent M1 growth and almost 10 percent M2 growth and that, I think, is reflected to some extent in some inflationary bulge, which is now working its way through the economy from producer prices slowly down to consumer prices By the way, I think that lag is exactly what the textbooks tell us it is--18 months or thereabouts, counting from the 1986 area to slightly over the middle of 1988, with some variance around it Then, following what Governor Angell just said, in 1987 we saw a very substantial slowdown in monetary growth and I think that slowdown is starting to make itself felt in the real economy, which we are observing right now  As I think many people pointed out, there is some moderation in the economic growth picture in the Greenbook forecast There's more of that weakening, especially in the coming year Personal consumption next year is forecast to be 1-1/2 percent; residential construction is negative; and there isn't one single sector which is growing above the 2-1/2 percent growth rate that was described as optimal--except for domestic investment and exports And I think it's absolutely essential, if we worry about growth constraint, that we keep domestic investment growing at a solid rate It is somewhat disconcerting, however, that even the growth rate in that sector is forecast to be cut in half for the coming year So, what we're about to do here is kill the goose that lays the golden eggs We can't talk about a growth constraint being relevant for policy when the one factor that can ease that growth constraint, which is domestic investment, is being cut and restrained I also agree that exports have to be maintained I'm happy to see the higher export growth rates The current level of the dollar, I think, is entirely appropriate We're below purchasing power parity; therefore, we do have a competitive advantage and we can make further inroads into foreign markets  The scenario that was outlined by Mike Prell in response to Governor Kelley's questions is the really scary one--the black box, the Pandora's box, that the new President would have to face if growth falters, if we have the higher interest rates that we're talking about, and if the tax revenues are not coming in So I see the downside risks as a very unpalatable combination of factors indeed The upside risks I see as rather minimal, because of the items that Governor Angell has outlined already In my view, we're seeing essentially a moving through the economy of that inflationary bulge If you look at the beginning of that process, you'll see very positive signs--the commodity prices being maintained, the flattening of the yield curve, and also the strong dollar in international markets All are good portents of rather subdued inflationary expectations So, basically I like the economy the way it is running right now I think we're exactly on the right track and I would like to do everything possible to keep it moving that way   Governor Kelley   Governor Johnson   Governor LaWare, do you have any comments you'd like to make?   Why don't we, then, go to relevant policy decisions   Thank you With that we'll take our usual break   I'm sorry I thought we might do questions after the break We can do questions now, if you like   Any other questions for Mr Kohn? If not, we'll have a recess  [Coffee break]   Following up on Peter Sternlight's remarks about the borrowing requirements, I think that policy generally over the intermeeting period has required very little in the way of adjustment In fact, it's very rare that the outlook seems to change so little over so short a period One thing that worries me about the current economy is that it is vaguely reminiscent of a sag that occurred in 1976--which everyone assumed was the beginning of a decline, and it was a pause which sort of disappeared That was a bit more in the way of a real slowdown And I think we've got to be a little careful that we're not looking at a false dawn  Export orders, unfilled orders are still very high I see no evidence of any deterioration, even though there's been some slowdown in actual deliveries over the last three months Capital goods markets remain quite strong The order structure, appropriations, does not seem to be deteriorating It is true that there is some marginal weakening on the edges in a lot of different areas--the textile-apparel complex, I think, being the most obvious and the most important so far as size is concerned I think the crucial issue, which bothers me about the presumption that we would be in any way  -24-    9/20/88  accumulating a softening from here, is that the inventory situation has actually softened some And I suspect that's in part the cause of some of the overheating or preceived overheating being offset I'm a little concerned about the numbers, because whenever you get this high in operating rates, seasonal adjustments for July and August often tend to be a problem The classic case is the steel industry, which normally shuts down for a couple of weeks as an ordinary seasonal, but in times of peak demand, such as now, it doesn't shut down Then what you get is a seasonally adjusted sharp rise, unless somebody has the good sense to cut it And it comes right back down I think that's a part of the surge that appeared to be a real acceleration in June and July and an easing in August I suspect--at least looking at the initial claims figures which I think are really relevant to this situation--that basically, the economy probably continues firm, although not as aggressive as I think some of us feared somewhat a little earlier in the summer and in the late spring Corporate profit figures look quite good The report this morning was showing that profits continue to move forward in a reasonably good fashion and that usually is a precursor of underlying capital investment--domestic capital investment--being supported  So, in general, I think it is very difficult to visualize any really significant change in the outlook I think we're neither accelerating nor decelerating As a consequence, I must say I would feel comfortable with just taking the last directive, changing the dates and a couple of numbers, and going with it It is essentially a no-change scenario, asymmetric towards tightness, which I think is probably right My only suspicion is that we're not going to see anything that will require moving in a tightening direction in the intermeeting period But I find the possibilities of easing just about as remote as I think they can get I see no particular problem in continuing to be concerned about acceleration but I think that, unless and until we actually see the events as they emerge--until we get some evidence that this is in fact the type of pause which, frankly, I think it's likely to be--it would be premature at this stage to tighten further Governor Angell   If you're saying 60, 30, 10, I buy that   President Parry   President Boehne   President Forrestal   President Morris   President Black   President Keehn   Further comments?  -26-    9/20/88   Vice Chairman   I think we're still ahead of the curve And that's extraordinary, if we can hold that   Well, I'm a little suspicious of that Until I disaggregate it, I don't know what to make of it, because all the other price indicators don't capture that number Further comments? President Hoskins   President Melzer   President Boykin   Governor Kelley   Governor Seger  -27-    9/20/88   Governor Heller   Governor Johnson   President Stern   Governor LaWare, you have any comments?   Technically, we have produced the following operational paragraph   Does anyone have any comments on that particular reading? If not, can I have a vote?   Good morning, everyone Shall we start off by approving the minutes of the meeting of September 20th? Is there a motion?   Without objection We have before us a proposal for a change to a calendar-year basis for terms of presidents as members of the Committee You may remember that the Vice Chairman raised this issue a meeting or so earlier and we postponed it until this meeting I thought it might be worthwhile to go over it at this time Vice Chairman, would you like to repeat your proposal of that time?   You stipulated at the time, if I remember, that the members who vote for the ranges should be responsible for implementing them   I think it can be stated a bit more firmly in the sense that you can't really ask individuals to implement a policy with which they are in disagreement So, it's a little more than strictly to simplify the structure It's an eminently sensible motion, and I am wondering what other members of the Committee have to say on this issue   President Hoskins   Governor Seger   President Keehn   That I am sure is correct President Guffey   President Melzer   Anybody else who's got views on this? Let me say that this is not something that we should bring to a vote and get a count Unless we are unanimous, I don't see how we can move forward on this in an appropriate fashion So I really want to put it to those who feel uncomfortable with it Is your degree of discomfort at a level where you think it is inappropriate for us to do this? Or is it marginal? I do think that unless we do it by acclamation, it's an inappropriate action to be taking at this stage   Suppose that in the public statement made with respect to this that that particular point is emphasized   Would that solve your problem?   Yes   That strikes me as not a bad way to come at this Would you amend your resolution to do that?   If there are no objections then, I would presume it's the will of this Committee that the change occur not on January 1st, 1989, but on January 1st, 1990, and without objection I will assume that that is the will of the Committee   That is correct, yes   In effect, yes The next item on the agenda is an interesting analytical work which will be evaluated by Richard Porter and later by Don Kohn who wants to, as usual, have the last say on this issue   Any questions for Messrs Porter and Kohn?   Can I propose that the endogeneity is a short-term issue if one can demonstrate--and indeed the data do demonstrate--that carrying these out another 50 years that in fact M2 velocity is trendless or without any really perceptible change [in trend] Once you have stipulated that, the endogeneity problem disappears over the long run because clearly the trend of velocity can not be a function of anything other than structural aspects of the financial system over the long run If that's the case, then the issue of the two-year or three-year or five-year projections ceases to have that mathematical property While I certainly would agree that in the short run there is a great deal of endogeneity in it, I would suspect that that property decays very rapidly and probably is even insignificant over two- and three-year horizons   Governor Seger   President Hoskins   Well, Lee, I think the issue you are raising does wash out over a three-year horizon, because so long as it's a type of trend like the one we are going through now--I mean, are we targeting M2? In a certain sense, we are or we are not, depending on how rigidly--   The question of rigidity   Vice Chairman   It will come as no surprise to you that I agree with what you just said about [unintelligible] explanation Governor Angell   President Black   President Stern   But there is a simple relationship here which is algebraically necessary once you stipulate that velocity is trendless If velocity is trendless, then it is an algebraic necessity that the price level be proportional to unit money supply And that's a [link] which can only be broken if we can argue that velocity has no constancy to it All the rest of this is just interesting additions, but the essential tie between prices and M2 is defined by that relationship If the remarkably stable trend in M2 velocity since the turn of the century, and maybe earlier, is an accident, then I think one can argue that the relationship between M2 and the price level is an accident But if you can't argue that, you're required to stipulate that unit money supply is governing the level of prices over the longer run   But I don't think much more is being made of this It's very interesting that the R squares rise significantly as they do over the long run because in most models it's in exactly the reverse order President Morris  -10-    11/1/88   I think the real value [occurs] when we get to a position where policy has to be eased and we want to induce as a consequence an acceleration [in the growth] of the monetary aggregates If we had out there what a noninflationary level of M2 should be, say, three years out, I think it would give us a little better insight as to what our M2 range should be in a period of ease In other words, when do we get into dangerous levels [of inflation] where the degree of retrenchment to get back to a stationary noninflationary environment [is substantial, we can better gauge] what would be the consequences of various different types of policies we [might] implement at that time   President Parry  -11-    11/1/88   President Melzer   Any further questions or comments on this before we go further? If not, I'll call on Mr Cross Thank you very much, Mr Porter   Questions for Mr Cross?   Sure   President Hoskins   Governor Seger   That's not our fault   Governor Johnson   President Morris   President Keehn   President Melzer   President Black   Any further questions for Mr Cross? If not, can I have a motion to ratify the transactions since the September meeting?   Without objection I also need a motion to approve one-year extensions of the swap line agreements   Without objection I think it would be useful to have Ted Truman bring us up to date on the Mexican situation   I just want to point out that I will be soliciting by telegram your views on the agreement--in a couple of weeks, Ted, did you say?   Yes, I will be soliciting your views immediately upon completion of the negotiations, whenever that may turn out to be the case Questions for Mr Truman?   President Hoskins  -21-    11/1/88   Any further questions for Mr Truman? If not, let's move on to the Domestic Desk Mr Sternlight   Governor Johnson   Any further questions for Mr Sternlight? If not, can I have a motion to ratify the transactions since the September meeting?   Without objection Also, we need a motion to increase the Desk's intermeeting leeway as requested by Mr Sternlight  SPEAKER(?) I'll move   Second?  SPEAKER(?) Second   Our next meeting date is scheduled for December 13 and 14 It will not be known for a few days at least whether or not the 13th will be necessary So, I request that you hold the 13th open until you hear specifically whether or not that date will be necessary The evening of the 13th we will have an FOMC dinner in which we will give our best to our longest-serving member, Frank Morris, who has attended his last meeting today Frank has served for more than 20 years, during which there were 210 regularly scheduled meetings, and it appears that he missed only one meeting I think that's an extra-ordinary record No question we are all going to miss you, Frank, but we will get a chance hopefully to see you at dinner on the 13th If there are no further items of business, the meeting officially is adjourned, and lunch is served  END OF MEETING       Without objection We'll now move on to the economic situation Mr Prell and Mr Truman   Questions for either gentleman?   President Morris   Is that productivity or compensation?   He means unit labor costs   4 percent all through compensation?   With productivity up 8?   I think you have to explain why the tightened labor markets to date haven't had any really measurable effect on the acceleration of wage patterns That third-quarter unemployment cost index was something of a surprise, a deviation from historic experience How do you explain that?   This is supposed to be questions from you to our colleagues I don't know why I'm asking you, Frank   Can I suggest we stay with questions so we can break after the questions and come back for general comments after that? President Parry   Governor Seger   Governor Angell   Can we get started? Who would like to open up on Committee discussion?   President Parry   I think you've got a surplus with inventory adjustment!   President Keehn   President Forrestal   President Stern   President Boykin   President Melzer   President Guffey   Governor Seger   President Hoskins   Governor Angell   Vice Chairman   Governor LaWare   Anyone who would like to--   President Black   Governor Heller   Governor Kelley   President Morris, you're the last one I guess you think you've said enough, is that right?  -42-    11/1/88   Why don't we now move on to staff comments on monetary policy and the directive? Mr Kohn   I must say, listening to this, it doesn't sound all that different from our last meeting Questions for Mr Kohn?   Governor Johnson   Any other questions for Don? Why don't we start the Committee discussion? Let me start off I think the crucial question we have to ask ourselves is To what extent has this been luck or successful policy? It's probably a bit of both; I don't think we can segregate the two effects, as Ed pointed out earlier But what is important here, as I see it, is that to the extent policy has been the source of this slowing, then it's very crucial that we not be perceived as weakening prematurely As best I can judge, it's extraordinarily difficult to manage a gradual unwinding of the economy from the types of imbalances we currently have There is very little evidence [currently] of the type of sharp expansions, construction booms, or inventory accumulations that are capable of reversing very quickly And so long as those types of dangers are not there, it's very difficult to imagine--from where we stand--the types of developments that would bring the economy down quickly from here If this is true, it is in a sense saying that what we're going through is a pause, and that the slowing is likely to diminish rather quickly I think that what we're probably in the process of seeing is that the slowing of the spring and early summer is probably coming to an end because we still have very high [delivery] backlogs We still have momentum in the system, and we still have some very strong numbers in the capital investment area What has not been mentioned today is the reading on second-quarter capital appropriations, which I found rather impressively strong especially following what probably is a statistical weakness in the first-quarter data  In any event, as I have listened to the discussion today, everyone seems to be generally satisfied that we are in relative balance and that no significant policy action seems to be desired I would conclude from that that we probably ought to stay precisely where we are--meaning the same directive as the last time, with asymmetric language towards firming If for no other reason, if the Fed has been perceived of as being a restrainer of inflation, a restrainer of imbalances, there are probably far greater risks in just the psychology of perception if we go from asymmetric to symmetric language Even though it will not be released for a number of weeks, the markets will read a symmetric directive as though we are in the first stage of backing off That statement is not a forecast of the direction of the next significant monetary policy action or a prediction that the markets would probably read far more into a symmetric directive than we would anticipate, but I would hope that we could stay pretty much with the language we adopted the last time My suspicion is that, as we come out of this slowing, we will probably find the staff's forecast to be relatively close to the mark I might add parenthetically that there's a strong first-quarter GNP in the staff's forecast, which I believe is wholly the result of expected statistical adjustments to the GNP data to show a liquidation of farm inventories in the fourth quarter and a sharp increase in the first quarter And no farmer in the country will recognize those numbers Governor Heller   I would think--based on Mr Kohn's remarks--that the current funds rate is perceived as being somewhat abnormal, if that's not an exaggeration with your insights   President Melzer   Yes, it's essentially--   The Desk will endeavor to implement--if everyone is agreeing--policy in the manner in which it has been recently implemented   $600 million is the borrowing target   President Melzer   I don't think anyone would disagree with the way you put it President Morris   President Keehn   We have been thinking about that a great deal and doing a lot of testing I don't know whether or not we've come up with a final conclusion on this, but that's an issue which is absorbing a good deal of time for Mr Kohn and his colleagues   President Boehne   President Black   President Forrestal   President Hoskins   Governor Angell   Governor Seger   President Stern  -48-    11/1/88   President Boykin   Governor Johnson   Governor Kelley   Vice Chairman   President Parry   President Guffey   Governor LaWare, do you want to--   As I hear it, we have a significant concentration on repeating the directive of the last meeting I ask the Assistant Secretary to read it again   Call the roll   [Unintelligible]   I thank you I think what we need next is the election of staff officers Norm, would you read the list?   Would somebody like to move that?   Is there a second?   Without objection, it's so ordered The next item on the agenda is the selection of a Federal Reserve Bank to execute transactions for the System Open Market Account Is there a nomination?   Call again   Without objection I don't like the way this is going!  SPEAKER(?) It sounds all right!   Our Managers for Domestic Open Market Operations and for Foreign Operations are at the moment, as you know, Peter Sternlight and Sam Cross Would somebody like to move their reappointments?   Without objection We have the review of--and I assume that they have been mailed out to all of you--the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations, the Foreign Currency Authorization, the Foreign Currency Directive, and the Procedural Instructions with Respect to Foreign Currency Operations Would somebody like to move them individually? Let's do them one at a time Are there any objections to the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations? If not, let us assume that it's so ordered Sam, would you like to discuss the second issue?   Would somebody like to move that?   Is there a second?   I've just been informed that we don't want a formal vote on this   On the informal limits Let me put it this way Are there any questions on this issue for Mr Cross? If not, we'll assume [agreement]   Any further discussion on this subject? I will assume a general consensus in favor of Sam's recommendation However, we do need a vote on the Procedural Instructions with Respect to Foreign Currency Operations I'll entertain a motion   Do all three?   Let's combine all three the Foreign Currency Authorization and the Foreign Currency Directive as well as the Procedural Instructions   Without objection Next we have to approve the minutes of the Committee meeting of February 7th and 8th   Without objection Mr Cross, would you now report on foreign currency operations for us?   Are there questions for Mr Cross?   Any further questions for Mr Cross?    3/28/89   Governor Johnson   Any further questions for Mr Cross?   Anything else? If not, would somebody like to move to ratify the transactions of Mr Cross since the February meeting?   Without objection Mr Sternlight   Questions for Mr Sternlight?   Further questions for Mr Sternlight?   President Syron  -10-    3/28/89   In a total [unintelligible] it turned out--   Without objection Peter, would you like to raise your [leeway question]?   Would somebody like to move the leeway?   The next meeting is May 16th We will adjourn for lunch  END OF MEETING  -42-       Without objection We now turn to the economic reports Messrs Prell and Truman   Questions for either gentleman?   President Parry   Doesn't it bother you that implicit in this scenario is an increasing willingness to [acquire] direct claims on the United States? If you extrapolate to what seems to be going on, what turns it? In other words, I assume the long-term rate differential is what basically is driving the models Are we expecting that the long-term rate differentials will narrow in the next recession or the next month?   They're better than anything else I've seen   President Syron   Governor Heller   President Forrestal   [There are questions about] the appropriate numerator, I think, on velocity with the base--if you pick up a good chunk of economic activity outside the United States, some of it illegal   Yes, but they do use American currency last I heard President Melzer   Governor Seger   That's an interesting issue because the real interest rate there is to be adjusted not by general price levels but by the price of the asset to which it is applied   And there as you're saying--you don't mean in California that it is literally negative at this stage but--   Well, that's not the projection   Well, that's what will tilt the housing market down If all of a sudden there is a perception that residential property values are easing then all of a sudden, whatever the nominal mortgage rate is, it will grab--   Bob, I assume that the 25 percent increase is a nominal increase in price and that it has the same problem that the national figure has in picking up a significant increase in the average size of homes and improved quality So, the adjusted price level is not going up anywhere near that level   We do know in the national figures that it's very significant And since California is such a big part, clearly, it's got to be an issue there President Guffey   Ted, can I ask a question on the effect of the rise in the oil price in the last couple of weeks on the Saudi Arabian fiscal situation? A couple of weeks ago, as I recall, it looked as though the rapidly deteriorating fiscal situation in Saudi Arabia and the pressures on the oil price would likely come, with the Saudis having to increase their liftings to meet their revenue requirements, which would accelerate the price level decline Is there any way of making a judgment as to whether the recent runup in spot crude prices has altered the situation in a way in which they need not move the liftings at this point?  -20-    3/28/89   Yes, but they are still really selling at spot   If there are no further questions for Messrs Prell or Truman, shall we open our tour de table? Who would like to start? President Boykin   President Black  -21-    3/28/89   President Parry   President Stern   President Forrestal   President Keehn   First Vice President Stone   Vice Chairman  -25-    3/28/89   President Melzer, why don't you start off by telling us about rain in your area?   President Syron   President Guffey   Governor Johnson   Governor Angell   Any other Governors wish to add anything?   There's only one economy Anybody else before coffee?   Well, why don't we break now  [Coffee break]   The dollar is up to 13320 on the yen; the bond market is up over 9/32nds; the stock market is at [unintelligible] What do they know that we don't?   Which was my opening refrain to Don Kohn   Thank you Let me quickly ask on Chart 7 I assume that you're not repeating before 1978 because that's when the whole survey started Or is it because other proxies don't give you as good a correlation with the very present?   Any questions?  -33-    3/28/89   Questions for Don? If not, let's move on to a discussion of policy I'd like to start off by saying that the [outlook for the] economy is generally uncertain, a view I assume a lot of us share My own impression is that the odds are that what we're going through now is more likely to be a pause rather than the beginning of a downturn But the odds are less, I think, than they were in earlier stages in this particular cycle, if for no other reason than that we are at much higher levels of activity and the probabilities that the economy will eventually tip over obviously are linked to how long the expansion has been going on, even if age per se does not necessarily throw us over But there are signs that orders are a little shabby Basically, with the dollar very strong and with the money supply growth factor rather modest--even though the odds in my judgment are somewhat better than 50/50 that we will probably have to tighten again before this cycle is over--this strikes me as probably a good time to pause and see what effects our actions to date have That would lead me to come out for "B" asymmetrical towards tightness Governor Johnson   Governor Angell   President Parry   I would think so My own impression is that it's much too soon to allow the markets to get any signals, erroneous or otherwise, that we're backing off That would strike me as a very inopportune signal   I would think so   President Black   Vice Chairman   But adjustable rate mortgages are only 25 percent of total mortgages   President Keehn   President Stern   Governor Heller   Governor Kelley  -37-    3/28/89   Governor Seger   President Forrestal   Governor LaWare   So that's "B," asymmetric?   President Melzer   President Hoskins   The truth of the matter is that none of us has a clue as to what the price level will be in the fourth quarter of 1990   The fact that it's in the forecast I don't think [is important] However, I think the issue that you raise is But I wouldn't state it as unequivocally as you state it   No, I think it is our objective But when you look out in these forecast numbers-- You've done your models and I've done my model; I would hate to go back and have anyone look at our historical forecasts in this area That's the reason why I think the money supply issue is so crucial I agree that if we can hold the money supply growth down, just keep it there persistently, I think we'll win this one President Syron   I should hope we would be able to make some thrift-adjusted M2 judgments   I don't know Here I am complaining about the price forecast and--   President Boykin   President Guffey   Yes, let me say--and I think it deserves to be said--in the event that some number [becomes available] or that something occurs that is significantly out of tune with this conversation we're having, I think it is obligatory that we have a telephone conference and some rethinking and rejudgments of this First Vice President Stone   It appears as though the critical mass is on "B" with asymmetric language We could insert that into the directive Let's have it read and we can put in what we need to as we go along   3 and 5   Would anyone like to amend that or does anyone have any problem with the language as such? If not, could you poll the Committee?  -41-    3/28/89   Good morning, everyone The first item on the agenda is approval of the minutes Would somebody like to move the minutes?   Without objection Mr Cross, would you bring us up to snuff on foreign currency operations?   Any questions for Mr Cross?   President Black   Governor Johnson   Yes    5/16/89   That's roughly--   Any further questions for Mr Cross?   The Treasury has the legal lead on these decisions We discuss it with them but the ultimate decisions are theirs I think the issue isn't so much a question of how much each does The more critical question that you're asking, as I see it, is Why do we think that intervention can make very much difference when all the various studies we've been involved in suggest otherwise? And what we're partly reflecting are views of the G-7 finance ministers who believe more in intervention than economists and central bankers do But underneath it all is the very annoying concern as to why the dollar is strengthening in the face of our current account imbalance You can look at the issue in one of two ways either 1) that we are intervening for the purpose of trying to stem the rise because ultimately it has to adjust back downward; or 2) why not, because this very large potential capital gain is in process That has not been the case in the last couple of days There's something very odd--a puzzlement as to why the markets have moved as strongly as they have Certainly, if they move from here it will take a lot of explanation But I don't see it particularly on the surface at this stage Sam, is that consistent with your judgment?   If there are no further questions, Sam, would you mind reintroducing your recommendation so that we can put it in the form of a motion?   Hold the questions on this   Well, not yet   Let's do this in two separate motions Let's first have a motion to ratify the transactions since the last meeting   Without objection Let's have a motion and then discussion on this level issue   Is there a second?   Is there any discussion on this?   President Hoskins, then Governor Heller   Part of that cooperation is with the Treasury   Governor Heller   Governor Angell   Any further discussion on this issue?   Does anyone here have a strong view between $15 billion and $18 billion, for example? What's on the table is $15 billion We have heard a couple of people say they'd like to go higher   Why don't I simply find out by requesting a vote on the--   --on the motion on the table, which is the $15 billion All in favor?   Well, if you would like to   Is there a second on the amendment? That's what I was worried about    5/16/89   All in favor of the amendment to the motion say "aye"   Noes?  SEVERAL No   That leaves us with the original motion on the table of $15 billion All in favor say "aye"  ion  SEVERAL Aye   Opposed?   This is a formal vote so we have to--  SPEAKER(?) It will be published   It will be published so let's get a formal count Why don't you call the role quickly?   I join in with the Vice Chairman on this issue If we go a few more months with what's been happening I'll have to start to rethink my view of the world Let's move on to the next item on the agenda, which is Mr Sternlight on domestic open market operations   Questions for Mr Sternlight?   Governor Heller   Further questions for Mr Sternlight?   Further questions for Mr Sternlight? If not, would somebody like to move to ratify the actions of the Desk since the March meeting?   Our next meeting is on July 5 and 6  END OF MEETING  -49-       Without objection We now move to the staff report on the economy Mr Prell   Questions for Mr Prell?   President Syron   Governor Johnson   Governor Kelley   He's a good mind reader President Stern   Yes   Any further questions for Mr Prell? If not, we are ready for the roundtable discussion Who would like to lead off? President Boehne   President Boykin   President Guffey   Do the crop estimators at this time of the year assume normal rainfall for the rest of the period?   What I'm trying to get at is this When they estimate 200 million bushels for the winter wheat crop is that on the assumption of normal rainfall from here until harvest?   They don't factor in the rainfall forecasts that they now have in estimating the actual outcome and yield per acre, do they?   Well, at the moment, the crop estimators looking at the condition of the crop can judge its outcome either on the basis of an expected rainfall that is normal from mid-May through harvest or they can use the forecasts of rain that they have now developed over the years as a factor in making that judgment It occurs to me that I don't even know whether there's an official way they do that They used to do it, as I recall, years and years ago on the average But I don't know whether they've changed   That's what I mean--the normal rain from here until harvest   Does Kansas start in early June?   Yes, it starts down in the Panhandle, usually, in June   They do?   I'm sorry, I didn't mean to [interrupt]   President Black   That's a technical term!   President Keehn   President Parry   President Forrestal   President Melzer   President Syron   Negative absorption?   Vice Chairman  -24-    5/16/89   Governor Angell   President Stern   President Hoskins   Did that ever work out as a good indicator? I remember we discussed that  -27-    5/16/89   Governor Heller   Governor Johnson   Governor LaWare   Governor Kelley  -29-    5/16/89   Governor Seger, incidentally, had to go up to the Hill to testify on a consumer issue She should be back by the time we are completed with our coffee break, which starts now  [Coffee break]   Mr Kohn   Questions for Mr Kohn?   Questions for Mr Kohn? Governor Angell   Governor Seger   Governor Heller   President Hoskins   President Melzer   President Keehn   Anybody else have any questions on this? If not, why don't I just start off with the round table As I hear the basic comments on the outlook it strikes me that there is a fairly central tendency in this group's evaluation, which says in a sense that the economy clearly has slowed and probably will stabilize without going into a recession I think the evidence at this stage is fairly solid on that conclusion but probably needs to be audited with some degree of sensitivity The crucial pieces of evidence that we have that suggest the economy is not cumulatively going down are the initial claims data and the level of insured unemployment Both, after having weakened in the period when we got the pickup in the unemployment rate, have since eased off to levels that suggest a period of much stronger employment growth, certainly, than we've seen in the data of the last two or three months Similarly, we're looking at an industrial price pattern that would not be consistent with an erosion of orders in the materials area As a consequence, I think we have very little indication that the softening which has been so patent is cumulatively deteriorating, at least at this particular stage The one element that still seems to be reasonably solidly in place is the inventory situation, which as yet doesn't appear to be creating problems The increases in inventory investment, I suspect, are to a large extent still in work-in-process; and probably a very substantial part of that work-in-process pattern is in the civilian aircraft area, which is not suggestive of inventory backing up So, we don't have evidence of what I view as the crucial danger--namely that when you go from tightness to softness that you then just continue on That evidence at this particular stage is lacking The one negative, which I must say bothers me as much as it has bothered a number of people around here, is the money supply data The evidence suggests, as Don points out, that the money supply is coming back rather quickly And I think that that's the most likely outcome But if it fails to do so, then I think we'd better be looking very closely for other forms of evidence that may be signaling that the stability in the system which now seems to be in place is in fact lacking Wages clearly have slowed down The Bethlehem [Steel] case probably is an aberration I didn't like the LA teachers turning down that contract; that seemed to imply a much more aggressive attitude, which may be a delayed effect of the unemployment rate falling as low as it did and staying as low as it did earlier in the period  So, it's not a clear-cut balance of risks, as I see it We have moved, as best as I can judge, from a tilt toward inflation being more probable and are now closer to some form of symmetry I would conclude that probably the sensible thing to do at this stage is to have alternative B symmetrical I would be careful specifically to  -38-    5/16/89  watch the money supply more closely than we usually do, although I'm not sure I would recommend that we move it up in the directive But certainly I think that is crucial to what we are doing and we just need to watch it I have the impression that even though we didn't have a telephone conference in the last intermeeting period--there was nothing that really happened that deviated substantially from our general expectations as far as policy was concerned--that we ought to have one just on general principles this next time I'm pretty sure we should have one if for no other reason than to try to get a sense from all of you whether you see any [need for an] alteration in the policy So I would suggest that we do have a telephone conference just for the purpose of auditing what's going on Roger, do you have a question?   Okay, go ahead   Governor Angell   Well, that's what we have to worry about The worst thing we can do right now is to whipsaw That would really do damage   That's correct   Let the record show President Forrestal   It's not published for six weeks  -40-    5/16/89   The other thing I would say on that is that the markets look at the forward position in the federal funds futures market or the position in the Treasury bill market, for example; yet the implicit funds rate that the Treasury bill rate is in fact indicating for 90 days from now is something like 93 percent In other words, what I'm saying is that if we were to stay where we are, symmetric, that is actually tighter than I think the markets perceive us to be going, at least as I read the various--   It's a question of interpretation If we moved toward ease and backed off, frankly, I think that would be most premature and probably very counterproductive I'm not sure what is happening in the market is read that way If we move that's a different issue But I don't disagree with the concern that you have I must say "hear, hear" President Keehn   President Parry   Governor Heller   We don't publish that   Well, we can do it; and we can do it in the order in the directive itself What do we knock out if we move the order? What's the--   Surely we don't want to move it in front of inflationary pressures   That puts it number one   Would it be satisfactory to you if we put something about the interest of the Committee in monitoring the aggregates in the language prior to the directive ?   I think that's probably the same thing   President Boehne   Governor LaWare   Period President Syron   Asymmetrical in which direction?   Well, I'm hard pressed to find the difference between where I stand and where you stand   I understand what you're saying But you would put language [unintelligible] with respect to the Ms   Governor Seger   President Black   I wish policy were that--   Governor Kelley   President Stern   I think it's possible to remove the asymmetry and put it back without danger I don't think it's possible to ease and then tighten without danger   No, I think that's correct   Well, we didn't really start to tighten at that particular point; that was the beginning But it's [unintelligible]   Vice Chairman   President Melzer   Governor Johnson   It is Freudian President Hoskins   President Boykin   As best I can judge, the critical mass is for "B," symmetric That is $600 million borrowing but, listening to enough of the people here, I think the Desk is going to have to be sensitive to the issue of whether in fact $600 million really will represent what is essentially a no-change environment We will try to be cautious on that question   Well, because that starts to get to a degree of fine tuning about what these numbers represent, which I think we shouldn't do I think the numbers should be--   But that's what the $600--   The issue is "unchanged" Basically, the funds rate has averaged 9-3/4 to 9-7/8 percent and there's a technical question as to whether or not the borrowing target that effectively created that was $600 million or slightly less   That is what I'm arguing for  -47-    5/16/89   That's all I'm saying I would propose that halfway through the period, or if the data or any other evidence suggest it sooner, we schedule a call If nothing has changed significantly, the basic purpose of that call will be to review what it is that we all see in the outlook and try to find out whether there's any alteration of the view of this Committee I think we are in a very sensitive period at this point and we have to be more than attentive to specific evidence that begins to emerge in various areas to see if we can catch any evidence of deviation from what appears at this moment to be a reasonably good path Yes sir, [Mr Guffey]   Correct   "Somewhat/would"?   Anybody object to that?   1-1/2 and 4   8 to 12  -48-    5/16/89   Call the role   Questions for Mr Cross?   I haven't heard anything from them In fact, there has been a remarkable quiescence and lack of the usual discussions Things are as quiet as I've seen them in a long time Jerry, have you sensed anything?   Governor Angell   Any further questions for Mr Cross? If not, can I have a motion to ratify the transactions of the Desk since the July meeting?  SPEAKER(?) So move   Without objection I sent out a memorandum--basically a poll with questions on system foreign currency operations--in response to a discussion, as you may recall, at the previous meeting I would be most interested in any reaction that anyone had to that Is there any sentiment to change, alter, rethink, or the like?   Well, I think periodically we really ought to review the whole system, largely because our information base continues to change our views about how we affect markets and what the implications are A general review and updating, I think, is probably desirable just to make certain there are no structural changes that have occurred and, accordingly, altered how we should view the whole process Well, if there are no further questions on it, we'll just go--   Yes, Jerry answered your question literally Having trudged through most of that, the word helpful doesn't immediately strike me as [germane] We will, however, make a bibliography so that one can go back and see the particular efforts in this whole area over the last decade or so; it's quite extraordinary If there are no further questions, we'll just proceed further on that and keep you informed of the progress The next issue on the agenda is the question of the Mexican swap drawing   Any questions for Mr Truman or Mr Cross on this issue?   I think there's a certain advantage to doing it the way Ted is suggesting Even if we put the vote on the record, in a sense, we are not effectively implementing the swap from our point of view; and then if it falls apart, we're sort of hanging out there with--to use your analogy--half a bridge I think authorizing it and then delegating final approval to the Chairman leaves us in a position where, should the term sheet fail or something like that, then it is never implemented and there is no final action by this Committee And we don't sit there in a sense having said yes, and a final yes in effect, and then having the thing unravel It's really a cosmetic request   Yes, but I agree with you on this I'm saying that the vote that we would take this morning would be on the record   But the action would be a two-stage action authorization by the Committee and granting to the Chairman the ability to say that the Committee's action should be implemented because the other party or some third party accomplished a certain action My sole authority is merely to make a determination on whether the Committee's requirements have been met If they have not, then the issue is moot   And there is no further action required   But there is a question; we did take an action The issue of whether it is implemented or not is really a secondary question The issue is whether we report the nature of this [decision] in detail and [whether] an official vote was taken I think it would be appropriate to record that vote I agree with Governor Angell on this issue    8/22/89   Any further questions on this swap issue?   The implication is that flight capital, or reverse flight capital, might ensue if they show higher reserves So it's a smoke and mirror scheme  SPEAKER(?) [Unintelligible] hold his breath   You do these [unintelligible] If there are no further questions, would somebody like to move that action?    8/22/89  SPEAKER(?) Yes, move it   Without objection so ordered The next item on the agenda is--   Maybe the safest thing to do would be for you to phrase the motion as you think it would be appropriate, for technical purposes, in implementing this policy--just to be sure we have it correct   That's essentially what's in the motion  SPEAKER(?) It's in the vote   Okay Unless there is any objection, that will be part of the record Our next item on the agenda is Mr Sternlight on Desk operations   Thank you, Mr Sternlight Questions for Mr Sternlight?   Any further questions?   Well, I think Lee is raising a question, as I assume, that they have the capability of--   --funding directly out of their cash accounts or borrowing new money The issue, I gather, is should they be more variable in borrowing new money to smooth out both the tax and loan account and their balances with us? I think the answer to that, as far as monetary policy is concerned, is that I assume it's easier for us to adjust than for the Treasury   Also, the degree of instability that occurs is largely our inability [unintelligible] matter of using cash management bills or allowing the balances to move Everything is exact, but we can't-- I guess you could argue, though, that the more variables they have to play with the more likely that the forecasts are--   Yes, but sometimes they aren't   Any further questions for Peter? If not, would somebody move to ratify the transactions of the domestic Desk since the July meeting?   The next meeting is October 3rd We will break for lunch   Without objection We now move to the general economic evaluation Messrs Prell and Truman   Questions for either gentleman?   You mean if claims were to go up?   That would almost surely be reported in the BLS weekly release They do discuss technical reasons as to why claims move as they did Should that be the case, they almost surely would put it in the press release And it would probably be in our [unintelligible] and aggregate amount It certainly would make it clear that--   President Parry   [Unintelligible] transportation services from domestic to foreign--   President Guffey   Well, I gather that's not true for inventories   That's what I'm getting at In other words, to the extent that you view the level of inventory/sales ratios as a relevant consideration of inventory investment then, unlike capital investment, the [net] change is not fully appropriate in this context   Well, let me give you a very specific example BEA comes in with a major tripling of inventory change in the second quarter Can you tell me that that does not affect the third- and fourth-quarter inventory changes?   That is not the case; I understand that   No one has the guts to do it and the private sectors don't President Stern  -12-    8/22/89   This is raising an interesting legal question We are uncertain as to whether we have to spend that money under the statute They have made a judgment that we won't, and it's not clear that it's that simple We may find out that we're forced to make that expenditure in the RTC   That has not been clearly evaluated has it? It's a very interesting problem   Actually, we've only spent something like $1-1/2 billion so far   Well, we're behind the curve   Then how much [unintelligible] have they got to run down the cash balance after September 30th?   I guess the question really is What's the normalized expected Treasury cash balance from the period through September and is there much leeway to run it much below?   Governor, are you finished?   President Parry   Ex-aircraft there's a significant decline   Part of [unintelligible] called domestic defense   The usual   I think it's [mostly] revisions from the ones on the military contracts, which are--   The bond market went up on the initial release of the July numbers; then when they got the revision it went down   The question of the inflation forecast depends crucially on the [unintelligible] of the average compensation per hour forecast; when all is said and done, everything else pretty much washes out How comfortable do you feel with the relationship between labor market tightness and the wage forecast? In other words, it's clear that it has been slipping, but how would one characterize it? Is it significant or is the relationship still there but muted? How comfortable do you feel with the [mutual] relationship between  -15-    8/22/89  labor market tightness on the one hand and the wage forecast in the Greenbook on the other?   Well, let me put the question slightly differently Did you say before that you are a percentage point lower than you were two Greenbooks ago?   In the compensation [forecast] Did I hear you say that?   So, is the structural equation significantly changed? Or, in a sense, are you saying that with all the recent data we can now explain comfortably what has been happening in the last couple of years in the employment forecast?   Do we have any further evidence as to why the ECI, which has theoretically the same establishment coverage that creates the compensation per hour, [differs]? It can't be a mix factor, solely   That large?   Feel like making a judgment?   Governor Seger   That's right; the fourth quarter is up because unit labor costs are down   Governor Johnson   I'm sorry, what's 40 percent of GNP?   Well, the crucial issue was the financing of that   $2 trillion and the interest cost of that--   We haven't invested--   Any further questions for our colleagues? If not, who would like to start the Committee discussion?   President Forrestal   President Stern   President Keehn   Thank you President Syron   What's the unemployment rate in the District now?   I understand   So, you think the surprises are more likely to be on the up side than the down side President Guffey   President Boykin   President Boehne   Governor Angell   How do you know that Ted has been wrong? I can't get it out of him what his forecast is!   Vice Chairman   President Melzer   First Vice President Monhollon   Governor Kelley   President Hoskins   Governor Seger   Governor LaWare, do you want to comment?   Just say you agree with everybody!   I think what you're expressing is the fact that monetary policy can't do everything   Why don't we break here and return after coffee  [Coffee break]    8/22/89   Like the rest of you, I guess, I'm looking forward to the final word from Don Kohn   Thank you, Don I suspect that if we weren't at a meeting today we wouldn't think there was any need to do anything, particularly because when one looks at the data what's clearly obvious is that the economy is stuck in the mud or that it has fallen to sleep--I don't know which is the better description There is a remarkable stability in this system, which has both pluses and minuses, I think As I see it, at least, on the upward side I think we are running into a saving rate that was going up in the context of rising real income and now is flattening out; and I think we're getting some pickup coming in the consumption area If there is a follow-through in the housing area--that is, if mortgage rates are low enough to really start to move even marginally any of the housing data--then I think it is clear there is strengthening going on, which is independent of the underlying structure of orders and prices and values The odds at this stage, as I see them, are probably marginally plus that that will happen rather than not happen But when you begin to look at the underlying structure of the manufacturing area and the crucial area of capital investment, the evidence is quite mixed I think we were getting a significant deterioration in the order structure and in the economy when we met last That has stalled The pretty much day-by-day evaluation of order books in trying to get a notion of business sentiment with respect to capital appropriations and the like suggests that, after having come down, we have stabilized in recent weeks at a subdued level But it is showing very little evidence of either moving upward or downward I don't think it's actually clear at this stage--and it may not be for a number of weeks--whether or not the momentum is going to start up or down I find it very hard to believe, as I think Jerry has said, that one has a credible forecast of 2 percent real growth, inflation at 5 percent, and everything freezes indefinitely in the future That is not an equilibrium forecast Something breaks in that environment; it either accelerates or decelerates  Having gotten the money supply pretty much on track, in an odd way I think policy is probably as good as we can have it at this particular moment My basic impression is that we are at "B" and should be there for a while I'm torn myself between whether or not we should consider being symmetric or asymmetric toward ease at this point--not that I think it is going to matter as far as what we actually do, because if we get any type of acceleration or deceleration, this Committee will be meeting on the telephone to make some key decisions How we write the directive, frankly, I don't think matters all that much as far as actuality is concerned Since we are currently, at least technically, in a symmetric mode I would be marginally in favor of staying in that direction But I can't honestly say to you that I feel very strongly about that I do think we have to be careful about this basic softness--and it is soft--in the orders picture; I think it's soft enough that it could start to unwind on the down side There is no evidence of that; almost anybody I speak to is complaining about the level of orders but nobody is complaining that their businesses are tilting over in a way that is reminiscent of the feedback one gets during a recession  -40-    8/22/89  So, I am inclined to stay with "B" at this point; and just for technical reasons, I am perhaps supportive of symmetric language but, frankly, I don't think it means all that much I do think more than any other time in the recent past we are going to have to watch the orders business awfully closely to get a judgment as to which way that is going to evolve I just don't see any way it can stay where it is This is just not the type of balance that persists indefinitely in an economy--with inventories in balance and backlogs barely doing anything; inflation at a steady rate but too high; and a stock market which, until the last couple of days, was getting a little speculative I must say to you that the one thing that really bothers me and has not been discussed in the material here is whether or not we're going to end up with a tranquil economy which the stock market thinks is terrific and then the stock market does us in Up until a couple of days ago that had been a scenario which I would have put a higher probability on than I would have liked In any event, I would go for "B" with symmetric language; but if there is any concern about whether it should be asymmetric toward ease, I could support asymmetric I would prefer to keep stable in our position and have "B" symmetric President Guffey   That's the argument   President Syron   President Parry   President Keehn   President Forrestal   I'm glad you said that I think we all are in agreement with the general thought that you put forth, but it has never been stated this morning I think it's important to recognize that the solution to a recession problem is not necessarily easy money If we were to ease and were to run into an unexpected acceleration in inventory accumulation, at that point I think we would be through I don't know what we would do at that point, because the moment we try to tighten and prevent special forces from going on, there's just no way to prevent the economy from going sharply lower and really unwinding It's not self evident at this point that resisting recession presupposes bringing rates down sharply If any of us believed that, I think we would have heard a lot of "Let's flood the market" comments And I haven't heard any of that around this table Governor Johnson   President Boehne   Governor Angell   Governor LaWare   President Stern   Governor Kelley   President Melzer   Yes Governor Seger   President Hoskins   Don says they will have a report pretty soon President Boykin   First Vice President Monhollon   Vice Chairman   It doesn't matter whether we're symmetric or asymmetric   That is the worst scenario that we could face, because I think at that point monetary policy becomes impotent And then we would need other factors working and I'm not sure we would get them   No, but it's enough of a worry   Oh sure   I think that's exactly--   Yes I collected the votes and come out exactly as I expected, marginally asymmetric So, let's read it as "B," asymmetric   Does anyone have any objections to that?   There is one issue, however, that we ought to clarify and that's the positioning We had a discussion the last time on the positioning of the various different variables and it was inconclusive, with the exception of the phraseology with respect to the use of the words "progress toward price stability" as a substitute for "indications of inflationary pressures" That was the only one that I thought should be raised at this meeting to get a judgment as to how the Committee felt about the choice of words Why don't we just take a very simple quick vote? Those Committee members who would prefer staying where we are with indications of inflationary pressures please raise your hand One, two, three, four, five   Okay, I'm sorry Norm, why don't you-- we're using "slightly" presently   Okay?   All the members in favor of "progress toward price stability"? I think I counted seven, which has to be a majority Well, can we call the roll?  -47-    8/22/89   Without objection   Sure, go ahead   You can call the roll   Good morning, everyone Would somebody please move the minutes of August 22?   Without objection Mr Cross, you've had a dull few weeks!   Questions for Mr Cross?   Governor Johnson   Let me answer, Governor Johnson The best way of defining what was involved is that it was not a range for the dollar, but how much the various governments would be willing to commit I think the best way of describing the agreement is that there would be moderate intervention and if that intervention knocked the dollar down significantly, which it did, that was fine But if it did not, there was no agreement to just use unlimited resources to break the market That was an original proposal which had been shot down And in a sense, rather than talk in terms of what was the ultimate goal, I think the more appropriate issue as to where the restraints were and what the guidelines were was the degree of resources that were being placed into the markets   That's why in various meetings the central banks that were involved in this insisted upon looking at what was going on in the secondary markets--so that any evidence of a cumulative deterioration would have induced a real pull back It really wasn't country versus country It was finance ministers against central bank governors If you're having trouble finding out what the ranges are or what the policy is, [that is because] you're looking at a committee They tried to get a consistent day-by-day scenario, but as Ted Truman put it, there were too many branches of possibilities As they went day-by-day, the restraint or the criterion was the amount of resources that were available, not a particular target   That's not quite fair   The answer is "no"   Ed, that is true among academicians; it is not true among finance ministers There is an belief now, particularly among the Japanese, that sterilized intervention can put the exchange rate where they want it   There is no enthusiasm among any of the central bankers I don't think even the Bank of France is enthusiastic The two leading prongs are the US Treasury and the Ministry of Finance of Japan There has been a pulling and tugging on    10/3/89 -5-  this of rather large dimensions My impression is that in the event this all fails and the dollar starts to creep back up this intervention effort will be abandoned What we have to be careful about it is that as it becomes more and more difficult, they will want to increase [the amount of intervention] more and more What we have been fending off, successfully so far, is pressure that was not too subtly brought forth before the G-7 meeting to bring the central banks into this whole game In other words, essentially the G-7 would start to control monetary policy And I think that was fended off pretty abruptly There was a feeble attempt to put that in the Communique That was knocked out very quickly before things got moving Our problem, basically, is that at this stage we could probably as central banks--we could at the Fed--create a really big fuss about this As you know, legally, the presumption is that the President, through the Secretary of the Treasury, has full control over the issue of intervention policy It has never really been tested We have always had a partial voice; in other words, when Messrs Brady and Mulford started to talk about [a target of] 125 for the yen and 175 for the DM, I protested to a point where I suggested that they would pull the system apart And I got that eliminated So, they did have targets The trouble is if we ever tried to get to those targets, we'd have the world's most awful mess on our hands There is a limit as to what we can do short of confrontation I don't think it serves either the Fed or the country to try to be actually up front and to bring this operation to an abrupt halt I think we could do it In other words, if that were our objective--forgetting all the secondary costs--I have no doubt that we could do it I just think that it would be far better not to try that and, hopefully, keep this constrained at a level where the damage is minimal I disagree with Manley on the issue of the secondary effects being scary; on the contrary, I was surprised at how minimal those effects were Having seen an earlier version of intervention really almost kick over the bond market, I think in the last 10 days we got away with really minor results I don't think we can depend on that continuing I think that if we hammer at these markets, something will crack   Well, let me start with the Japanese It was very clear to me, walking into the G-7 meeting, that  He strikes me as a fixed exchange rate man, an interventionist who is willing to expend large resources to create changes  he came over to me just before the G-7 meeting started and said if we can't get the Germans to join us we would like to join you, meaning the United States, in extensive exchange rate intervention This is a different Japanese Ministry of Finance than ones we have dealt with earlier With respect to the Treasury, it's basically Mr Mulford with whom we are dealing and we have had philosophical and other differences with him on this and other issues for quite a while We do have significant influence in that operation In other words, it's not without possibilities I don't know what the end result of this thing will be, but if the dollar all of a sudden starts to strengthen I will try as hard as I can to convince Secretary Brady that this is a futile effort, that the    10/3/89  markets are trying to tell us something, and that to fight against it is a rather fruitless task Whether I will succeed, I don't know Vice Chairman Corrigan   Can you hold it? Presidents Black and Hoskins wanted to get in here   That is not the motive of Treasury   In fact, I just very recently have been arguing that the accumulation that we have to date does raise that issue; and this was before the Shadow Open Market Committee raised the test They are only now becoming aware of that excess block of reserve currencies--that the foreign currencies that we have are a potential political threat whereas it was perceived that we all of a sudden [could] lose a part of our cash   I want to say that there's only one of them on which I have been on the side of   One of the things that I intend to do is to convey the substance of this meeting to Mr Brady    10/3/89   President Hoskins   President Parry   The point is we do   No, that's not fair We basically have something to say; maybe we've got 40 percent and they've got 60 percent, but it's not zero   President Melzer   We have too many policy objectives and only one policy lever   President Syron   Part of the problem is that analytically we have been projecting a declining exchange rate for quite a while on the grounds that we've always perceived it as being out of sync and too high And the failure [of the dollar] to do that has led us to temporize on this issue on the grounds that it would cure itself eventually--in other words that we might have to engage in this [unintelligible] just for the sake of appearances on the grounds that the markets would then take over and that [problem] would disappear That hasn't happened And that's what the problem is; and it's still a problem with respect to the forecast   Governor Angell   President Guffey   As you know, it already showed up on the front page of The Wall Street Journal last Friday   President Black   I'd say [it depends on] who controls this The Bundesbank controls their exchange rate operation but they are pressured from the other side I'd say that [unintelligible] was quite strong The others I would say varied Actually, has been unfriendly to this heavy intervention   And I assume as a consequence he would independently, or in support of--   As far as I can tell That would be my impression but I can't remember any real--   President Boehne   Well, let me find out whether or not the discussions with Messrs Brady and Mulford on this help or hinder-- meaning whether or not the real deep-seated concern of this Committee induces them to be antagonistic or conciliatory At the moment, I think it is frankly somewhat useful to have some rumbling of a minor nature at this stage because if it ever was to break then I would be concerned what would happen to the markets But I think professional notions of discontent are not adverse provided they do not, for example, get into an Allen Murray front page article in The Wall Street Journal that the Federal Open Market Committee is revolting against the Treasury on exchange rate policy And they are prepared to do that because that little thing they put in last Friday was much stronger than the reality of it was So, that's a story that's sitting there ready to explode   It may be   And I'll be in Moscow already--  SPEAKER(?) Maybe you'll be safe there   Governor Seger   I trust that ends our conversation? Does anyone want to make a last comment on this?   Okay   Can I just stop here? This actually is a legitimate discussion, but not for this section Let's leave this for later this morning and then resurrect it because it really gets into the fundamentals of the monetary policy debate With some fear and trepidation I request the ratification [of the foreign currency transactions] Would someone like to--   Is there a motion on it?  SPEAKER(?) So moved  SPEAKER(?) Second   Without objection, hopefully?   That's what you're voting on   I think that's the reading   That's true   I agree that there have been no objections Mr Sternlight   Questions for Mr Sternlight? President Parry   President Keehn   Any other questions for Mr Sternlight at this time?   Can I have a motion to ratify the transactions of the Desk since the last meeting?   Sure   [Unintelligible] suggestion   What is the deadline for answering that letter?   Do we all agree?   We will discuss the letter at our luncheon   The answer to that letter has to come long before any of this other stuff occurs And I'm not altogether certain that the answers to the letter per se are going to be really tied up in any analytical issues I think what's involved here is looking at the problems in financing the large budget deficit, not pressures on the money supply What we really have to deal with, crucially, is what real rate of interest is consistent with a path of money supply which itself is consistent with zero or moderate inflation Because it's the real rate of interest that will tell us, literally, the capabilities of bringing the system into balance And I'm not sure that that really gets to this letter or anything related to it   Yes, but I bet you they don't differ by more than 10 percentage points   I wouldn't think so   Okay There is a fundamental problem that we have with this whole procedure in the sense that there are a lot of [unintelligible] things that have to be done in economic policy And with fiscal policy now out of the game, and really monetary policy and sterilized intervention being the only [unintelligible] there's an awful lot of mischief that can occur But I think it's those types of questions that we need to ask   Well, at a minimum, just having a focused Congressional examination of this process cannot be bad   Exactly I think it forces them to focus on the--   --costs and benefits Whatever comes out is unlikely to be anybody's--   I will tell you If you went back to the 1960s I would say you probably would have had 2 to 1 against it as far as economists are concerned I bet you now it's 1 to 2 the other way   The old Phillips curve trade-off was one that everyone believed either you got lower inflation and higher unemployment or the reverse and that was it But now I think there's a much more sophisticated view of that relationship and it differs   Yes, that's about the best   Yes Also, I think in all of our minds is the thought that over the next five years we really believe in some way or by some means that there is going to be a recession And that's going to be the period in which the price [improvement] occurs   I think lunch is served  END OF MEETING  -49-       Without objection Mr Prell, would you bring us up to date on the economic situation?   Questions for Mr Prell? Governor Johnson   President Parry   If there are no further questions, I think it's time for us to do a tour de table Who would like to start?   President Parry   Are they voting today?   I heard something about their voting   President Syron   President Black   I assume by that you mean down?   President Stern   President Boehne   President Keehn   President Boykin   President Guffey   President Hoskins   President Melzer   Governor Johnson   And the inventory/sales ratio went from 164 to 156   A good part of that is a big increase in auto shipments and sales   I was referring to the sales   Governor Angell   Governor Kelley   Jeremiah Corrigan!   Governor Seger   Governor LaWare   I suspect this may be an appropriate time to break for coffee  [Coffee break]   Mr Kohn   Questions for Mr Kohn?   What would happen if P actually reached P* at the end of '91? What is the gap at the moment in that?   No, equal to the P*   That's what I'm saying   No, no If at the end of 1991 P* is under P, then that gap is the measure of how much prices would fall if P were equal to P* I'm asking--   On the chart it looks as if it could be as much as 2 percent   04?   [Unintelligible] a P* operation is that we could get a lower [inflation rate] I'm not saying it's forecast; but it's not an argument that you could get a lower inflation rate consistent with that money supply growth [unintelligible]   I'll say it again very explicitly   The hypothesis that employs the M2 growth, which is better, is therefore not inconsistent with a lower inflation rate than is in the Greenbook for '91   Well, '92 is an easy forecast; it's '91 that--   President Syron   Wouldn't that degree of sophistication imply more M3 than M2?   If somebody were sophisticated enough to act in context of that law, one would assume it's more an M3 possibility   Anybody else? Why don't I get started on policy issues This ought to reflect much of what I've been listening to here because I, too, think the outlook is mixed, with some key timing points in the period immediately ahead It's fairly clear that the evidence for weakness, if one looks at that part of the spectrum, is most persuasively coming from the orders pattern, specifically in durable goods The nondefense capital goods area, excluding aircraft, clearly is scaling back at a fairly pronounced pace, including declines in backlogs in nominal terms What's unclear at this stage is to what extent that order easing is a reflection of real underlying weakness in capital equipment or merely an order  -38-    10/3/89  adjustment process to a significant decline in average lead times on the deliveries of materials and parts Obviously, if you're bringing the lead time down from, say, 90 days to 60 days--that's not the actual number--one can collapse the unfilled order pattern and orders would fall without affecting total plans for shipments If that is a major cause of this phenomenon, owing to the fact that the order lead times are now probably at rock bottom, at least in the context of this country, it would follow, therefore, that within the next several weeks we should begin to see some firming in orders The purchasing managers' order data have stopped their accelerating rate of decline; in other words, they are still implying a decline but the decline has stopped accelerating And there is some evidence popping up in a variety of different places that suggests that maybe the softening is coming to an end I don't think we're going to know that for another three or four weeks  The one aspect of the issue which I must say concerns me is the notion that this may be something more than that The argument for it being more than that is the continuous, cumulative decline in profit margins that has occurred since the spring It's clear that what has occurred is that the slowdown in volume, coupled with the price slowdown, has had a significant impact on the revenue side; the slow volume clearly has raised fixed costs and especially the extraordinarily high interest payments of the corporate sector In fact, the series that we produce internally--the ratio of gross interest payments by corporations as a percent of gross cash flow--has spiked up in the last two quarters partly, I suspect, as a result of the interest increases that are going on but also because of a slowdown in cash flow, which is another way of saying that there is pressure on margins coming from this gradual slowing up It is not reflected in the Greenbook too much, so maybe these numbers are not an issue of concern as much yet But I do think that the capital goods markets are the key to this outlook If capital goods hold up, I think there's very little chance that this economy can move down; in fact, if capital goods markets hold up we might exceed the Greenbook easily But if the capital goods markets continue to erode and then accelerate down, then we get a significant backing up of in-process inventories in the system We look at inventory data of purchased materials, goods in process, and finished goods from the establishment level But there's a very significant part of all of those inventories which are really in process If you consolidated them under their final sales level, for example, you'd find in the capital goods area that the proportion of inventories that were [in process] would be very high and that would tilt over the capital goods situation; even though the inventory sales ratios don't look formidable, you do get enough pressure to create some recessionary forces This is the downside argument The upside argument is basically that if this process were underway, it's already overdue on the basis of historical experience This economy doesn't work that slowly In other words, when you get these types of patterns, they trigger things and they go at a much faster pace than anything that we have seen That sort of suggests that this might be a false move  In any event, when I look at this and translate it into policy, it says to me at this particular stage that the argument for moving in either direction is rather dubious at this point One major reason is that if we were to move down--well, let me put it this way Moving up at this point strikes me as very unsupported I don't know  -39-    10/3/89  a reason for doing that and nobody around here even remotely suggested it But moving down right at this moment [is problematical], in light of what is presumed to be an increase in the Bundesbank rates on Thursday and a coordinated attempt on the part of the G-7 to now put monetary policy on the table and bring the dollar down--and believe me it will succeed; it will go right through the floor If we were to get anywhere close to moving rates down in conjunction with the Bundesbank move, I'm fearful that we would get too much market response as the new G-7 coordinated monetary policy endeavors to bring the dollar down And I think that would create some really major problems for us I conclude, therefore, that at least where I'd like to come out would be alternative B, asymmetrical toward ease as we are now And I would keep a close eye on the order patterns because we do get information coming in continuously If the patterns weaken considerably, I think that probably would be suggesting to us that the capital goods markets are beginning to slip off I don't think that's where the odds lie, but it is still a disturbing possibility If the more probable event occurs--namely, that the economy is about to stabilize--I think we will know that in several weeks In any event, I would like to suggest as a policy position alternative B, asymmetric toward ease Governor Johnson   President Parry   President Forrestal   Governor LaWare  -40-    10/3/89   President Hoskins   President Syron   President Boehne   President Keehn   President Stern   Governor Angell   Governor Kelley   President Melzer  -42-    10/3/89   Governor Seger   That means easing immediately?   Vice Chairman   President Black   President Boykin   The consensus is obviously alternative "B" with some concentration for asymmetric toward ease, which I would like to take a vote on But I will say that since there's enough in the way of desire for symmetric language, should the evidence emerge that action is required I do think it might be useful to have a telephone conference and discuss what the issues are; they are likely to be subtle and the Committee's views would be useful In any event, I would like to propose a vote on alternative B with asymmetric language toward ease Would you read the directive so stated?   Call the roll   Would somebody like to move the minutes of October 3rd?  SPEAKER(?) Moved   Without objection We need a motion to accept the Report of Examination of the System Open Market Account, which I believe was distributed a few days ago   Without objection Mr Cross, would you start us off?   Questions for Mr Cross? Lee   I remember that the press was assuming that we were acting on our own account at that point   Any other questions for Mr Cross? Tom   Sam, with a tremendous narrowing--and now you're saying a reversal of spreads--that essentially implies a stable or firming dollar What happens when the spreads are no longer narrowing or are going against us? In other words, does one assume that, adjusted for that process, there's a much stronger dollar underneath the system?   The question I'm asking--and maybe it's more appropriate to ask both you and Ted later because this may be premature--is whether, adjusted for interest rate differentials to the extent that one can do that, the dollar has been very substantially stronger I see a very significant uptrend, and this flat trend is merely offsetting these other positive elements against the negatives of contracting yield spreads   The only question is What is the order of magnitude? In other words, it really gets to the question of how significant the yield spreads on--   I haven't heard from Mr Mulford recently; without looking at any of the numbers, I knew it had to be something like that   The February meeting   Any further questions for Mr Cross? If not, can I first have a motion to ratify the transactions since the October meeting?   Second?  SPEAKER(?) Second   Without objection Also, Sam requested a vote for a one-year extension of the swap line agreements Motion?   Second?   Without objection Mr Sternlight   Any questions on Peter's report? If there are no questions, do you want to discuss the leeway issue?   Are there any questions on the leeway issue? If not, can I have first a motion to ratify the Desk's actions since the October meeting?  SPEAKER(?) So move   Without objection And similarly, on the leeway request  SPEAKER(?) Move it   The next meeting is--   December 18th and 19th   Hold it, everyone Jerry Corrigan is raising a question of whether we ought to start earlier   100 pm and have lunch here?  SPEAKER(?) Yes   Is that satisfactory to everyone?   Let's start lunch at 1230 pm and start the meeting at 100 pm Is that satisfactory?   In my judgment, this preempts the Board meeting   Mr Prell and Mr Truman   Questions for either gentleman?   President Black   Bob, are you [unintelligible]?    11/14/89   First of all, Mike, I've been meaning to ask you about these very substantial differences in our seasonals versus BEA's on the 10-day auto numbers I assume that you use their data because that's what the GNP is made up of But why are their numbers so different? I don't remember [the difference] being larger than it was in the first 10 days of November   Your seasonally adjusted data are smoother than theirs What do they require for conviction?   As I say, it's a very big difference   I would sense that what [they] are saying is that the market is falling apart You're saying it's asleep   While you're doing that, could you also find out why it is, which I gather is the case for Boskin, that BEA's estimate of the Boeing effect is minus 4 versus our minus 6 percent   Any other questions?   President Syron   Any other questions for the two gentlemen? If not, it's time for us to do our round robin or tour de table Who would like to start? Mr Boykin   President Keehn   President Parry   President Forrestal   President Melzer   President Boehne   President Syron   President Stern   President Black   Governor Johnson   President Hoskins   Vice Chairman   That's called fiscal policy   Roger Guffey   Wayne Angell   Governor Kelley   Governor Seger   Governor LaWare   With that, I think it probably would be desirable to break for coffee  [Coffee break]   Questions for Mr Kohn?   Alternative C will show up if anybody on the Committee wants alternative C to come back Any other questions for Don? Let me get started on our last round robin I think what we've been listening to today is really what our fundamental dilemma is--namely, that there is no viable clear-cut path that gets us to where we would like to be without some assistance from the fiscal side I've made this point to the President and his associates and tried to explain, in effect, that there is a downside limit to how far short-term interest rates can go without retriggering inflationary expectations and a significant recession on the other side of that There may be some dispute as to whether or not that level is 8-1/2 percent on the funds rate, or 8 percent, or if it was really 9 percent or even higher But what I think is reasonably certain from everything we've been looking at and discussing today is that the flexibility that we have to achieve the dual goals of declining inflation and still sustainable growth clearly is a window--which may in fact not be there In other words, I am talking in terms of Ed Boehne's and Lee Hoskins' various channels Neither one of them may be opened in a practical way for us to drive through without some assistance on the fiscal side I don't know to what extent that is going to be driven [unintelligible] but there is some clear indication from the White House at this stage that they may be getting serious The business of letting the sequester stand is not altogether a sham There are some fundamental discussions going on in private in that area It looks to me as though what is likely to emerge is a partial sequester--that is, a sequester which will be permanent for three months, followed by some reconciliation bill which hopefully will get the type of [fiscal policy] that the Greenbook presupposes But short of that, I'm not sure that we have a viable window  I also would like to point out that we have some very peculiar values out there Jerry Corrigan strikes a very important chord when he raises the issue that unit labor costs at this stage are seemingly locked in at an unacceptably high range and improvement on the inflation side presupposes the necessity of declining profit margins And declining profit margins, in the context of where I read the real expected rate of return on American securities and American stocks, suggest to me that we are now in a bear market If the bear market is rather soft and cuddly, that's fine; but if it decides to move rather fast then I think we will get some of the wealth effects in the GNP accounts and the economy will tilt over I must say, however, that the data on orders suggest to me that they are still    11/14/89  weak but they are not deteriorating; we're not getting any evidence at this stage, of which I'm aware, that suggests that we are on a slippery slope I think orders are soft and backlogs are still eroding I do think it is surprising that steel orders have flattened even though backlogs are down Aluminum orders still continue quite weak The respective commodity prices, I might add, are following the order patterns rather surprisingly well, which is suggestive of the fact that commodity prices are now sort of a new ordering indicator rather than an inflation [indicator] per se  I think it's a very sensitive period for us and I'm not sure how we will come out But I think we have to grope our way along While not losing sight of our long-term goals, which I think are crucial, we also have to be careful not to fumble into a severe recession That will make the capability of our achieving the long- terms goals politically unavailable to us So, it's not going to be an easy next six months In some of the most recent orders data I think there is at least some suggestion that we may well make it; but it's going to be close I come out after all of that not knowing very much more to recommend than alternative B, asymmetric for no other reason than that's where we are at the moment Wayne   President Melzer  -28-    11/14/89   President Black   Governor Johnson   President Boehne   President Parry   Well, I don't know if it's impossible but I think it will be very difficult to do so without breaking the back of the economy   President Syron   So you're "B" asymmetric?   President Keehn   President Stern   President Forrestal   Governor LaWare   President Boykin   Governor Seger   Governor Kelley   President Guffey   Vice Chairman   President Hoskins   I read the general inclination here as being modestly in favor of "B" asymmetric but--to capture Bob Black's words--should we move, that we should approach ease very cautiously I think that's the spirit of what I hear around this table Let's put that to a vote   Yes, please   Call the roll   Governor LaWare has moved that it is a good morning Are there any seconds?   Can I have a motion to approve the minutes?   Without objection Mr Cross, would you bring us up to date?   Questions for Mr Cross?   Actually, there is really a quite important difference between the Minister of Finance and the Governor of the Central Bank of Japan  I'm not sure they're going to be able to patch that back together immediately As far as I can see, it is subject to continuing problems Any further questions for Sam? If not, may I have a motion to ratify his actions since the February meeting?   Is there a second?   Without objection Mr Sternlight   Questions for Mr Sternlight either on actions or on leeway questions?   Let's leave that, because it does step over into the other area   That's right; that's because it's not statutory   Is there any new evidence as to whether or not, when the firm is fully liquidated, there will be any capital left?   I recall one of the major subs, which is the public side of the SEC regulation, has a note to the parent company that presumably would be the vehicle by which any excess    3/27/90  capital up in the regulated sub would go through the parent and back down But if there are other obligations of the parent, does that line stand in any securer position, do you know? I'm talking specifically about the commodity stuff   That's exactly the issue I wanted to raise   And there are a lot of leases   Any further questions of Mr Sternlight?   Peter, is there any evidence that where American banks are pulling back on this issue the Japanese are moving in?   I know of one instance having--   Any further questions for Mr Sternlight? If not, first can I have a motion to ratify transactions by the Desk since the February meeting?   Without objection Secondly, can I have a motion to approve the leeway request of Mr Sternlight?   Mr Kohn   Okay We still have a large element of our agenda in front of us, so why don't we break for lunch, come back quickly, and get started as soon as we can  [Lunch break]  SPEAKER(?) [Unintelligible]   With that information, let's go ahead and get started   Questions for either gentleman?   Well, the first thing we [normally] would do is to ask questions, but they didn't say anything to ask a question about So, if you want to comment on the substance of the issues, please go ahead   Let me just say one thing now To the extent that we at the Board raised concerns to the Treasury, I think we were more heard than not In effect, I would say that in this most recent endeavor to suppress the decrease in the yen against the dollar about which we raised very strong [objections] and had extended discussions as to why that was desirable or appropriate, it actually paid off In other words, the Treasury did pull back As best I can judge, that was largely the result of our reluctance to go along and of the arguments we were making So, even though in a legal sense we have to interpret ourselves as junior partners, it has been my impression that we do have a significant effect on the overall Treasury decision Were we to pull away and be strictly [the Treasury's] agent, I think by that very nature we lose completely all of our capability of influencing decisions that could affect our monetary policies My impression is that, if we were to poll this Committee, the extent of belief that there is any really significant benefit coming from [intervention] would be extremely mild to nonexistent The question that we have before us is not whether it works in any substantial way; I don't think you'll find many people around here who believe that Therefore, leaving aside the issue of intervention where it seems appropriate to curb disorderly markets and raising the much broader issues of pegging-type intervention, including G-7 coordinated intervention to drive the dollar down, for  -48-    3/27/90  example, the question is whether or not we lose our ability to influence those decisions if we pull away And I must tell you my impression is that we do Sam, is that your impression?   Yes, I think we've succeeded in shutting off some of the extreme elements of policy that they tried to implement   Is there any question that we can't totally sterilize our activities in exchange markets? Are you raising the question of whether or not they can influence us because we can't sterilize or what?   That's a separate issue Sure   You're referring to intra-week I assume?   May I just ask a factual question? Has there been a significant or meaningful political change since we initiated that on the basis of the concern that we shouldn't back the dollar with foreign currencies? Is that spoken of politically as an issue? Does anybody have a sense of that?   Look, the truth of the matter is the reason we built up at least part of that $20 billion is that in the early stages it just did not seem credible that the dollar would firm as much as it has And the early accumulation of both yen and deutschemark balances was considered to be a good speculative investment that we would get rid of relatively quickly Part of the problem is that the markets have behaved in a way that turned out not to have been expected I think that has gone against us   Well, I wouldn't disagree with that; in fact, that's precisely the reason we increasingly fought the Treasury as these sums began to rise In other words, as soon as they began to get into double-digits it was a signal that we were doing precisely that My own judgment is that if we were not there, the total, which is now what--$45 billion?   I would bet you that the total would be $60 billion at this stage    3/27/90   No, they could warehouse anywhere, if they wanted to However, the political exposure of the Treasury to losses in that fund go directly, dollar-for-dollar, into the budget deficit, and I think there's sensitivity on that issue   What I'm trying to say is it's an issue both ways   Well, if you adjust for the size of the market--   That's right, that's where the difference is; but it's not relative to the size of the market   One of the issues that we have to confront is that there is a globalization going on; there is no question that the amount of cross border transactions of every type is rising secularly against the nominal GNPs of the countries And this is an irreversible process So I think the issue is that were we to keep the proportion of intervention relative to the transactions constant, I would suspect that consumer and commercial banks are not going anywhere But the ratio of our holdings relative to our total assets also would be rising secularly, and that's the problem   Well, there's a crucial difference Beryl Sprinkel is different from all others I was going to use an econometric term on how one can apply that but I decided not to   The BIS   Well, Mr Mulford has been   No they don't We have to distinguish I happen to agree more with Mr Sprinkel's view on how this should work; I don't have any trouble with Mr Sprinkel But most Treasuries have been heavy interventionists The reason I want to say leave the Regan/Sprinkel [period] out is that it's a real outlier; it's really beside the point There have been occasions when we've butted our heads to little avail, but I must tell you that the vast, vast majority of occasions we not only argued but I think to a large extent prevailed There have been two or three occasions when we objected to heavy intervention largely directed at beating down the dollar We were bypassed for a few days But after they got the point that it wasn't making any difference, they dropped it   I don't think so, Manley I don't think we ever even remotely suggested that we would pull away Basically when Sam, for example, or some of us from here argue with the Secretary, I think it does have an effect It has not been 100 percent effective in the sense that we are not fully in control Frankly, I would be quite fearful of what they might do if we weren't there to harass them toward some degree of sensibleness   Listen, I have this old piece of paper that says on it Wayne Angell [wants to speak]   Okay Before I comment, the Vice Chairman wanted to [speak]   [Unintelligible] he could be quite disturbed   That's right   The G-7 in this respect is not the relevant vehicle The relevant vehicle is the Treasury In other words, to the extent that we get confronted with that issue it's not the Federal Reserve in the G-7 fighting this issue We ought to be able to turn the Treasury on this because if we can't, then it's dubious what it is that we have, basically As far as I'm concerned, our crucial issue is to try to affect what the Treasury's position is The question that was raised before about what it is they are doing I think we ought to discuss in a minute But I do have two names, which have been sitting on this piece of paper, who deserve to get called upon Dick Syron and Tom Melzer So, after you gentlemen--and Governor LaWare After the three of you--   Okay, after the two of you get through, I would like to call on our colleagues to define as best they can what the Treasury's position is, and then let's confront that specific question because I think that's where the real issue lies   Well, no Remember that the people who own the decks, the Congress of the United States--   --will [use them] if we don't use them   Yes   They set the exchange rate   Tom, I think you're reaching I doubt that very much Should there be a major problem with respect to loss in the budget from the exchange rate operations, the Treasury will get it all I don't think we'll get anything on that because it's very clear where we have stood on this question In fact, I think the best chance that we have to cap de facto some of this is to really raise this specter I raised it early on when the numbers were $10 billion and didn't make very much progress because essentially we were making money And so long as we're making money it's very difficult for us to get anybody's attention I tell you At these levels a 10 percent move in favor of the dollar is $4-1/2 billion and that's direct budget money That is a program, a child care program or something like that I know [unintelligible] and I said the only tool that I think we have at this stage that effectively could operate at this point is this issue I don't think that existed back at $10 billion It exists now and, frankly, I think that's an issue that we should get re-surfaced as soon as we can    3/27/90   They want us in, but they don't want us in because of this   Well, I was about to ask my two colleagues down at the end [of the table] about the motives of the Treasury Department   Well, unfortunately, we are missing Treasury representatives So, I think we'll use the two proxies   And this I might add was [at the initiation] of the Treasury because Mr Brady asked me basically What should we do? I said the ideal thing to do is zero; however, if you feel for political reasons that some token amounts are required, we will be supportive of that but we would prefer zero And he came off with zero   I don't think so; I disagree with that   Let me raise one thing Before Mr Brady went off to see Mr Hashimoto, I spent about 20 minutes with him here on the way to the airport And I went through what I thought was weakening the yen namely, the effect of the stock market and the portfolio adjustment process that was pouring yen into the international financial markets--an activity we could scarcely stop no matter how hard we tried I said that the problem was essentially a Japanese problem, that we would in a sense be [spitting into] the wind trying to stop any of this and that we would be perceived as ineffectual in endeavoring to stop any really major move As best I can judge, he went off to Los Angeles and took that position because when he came back everything he told me was perfectly consistent with that While it may well be that the lower echelon technical people are aware of what we're doing with respect to participating or not, during that 20 minute or half-hour meeting Brady didn't mention it once And he has not mentioned it to me since then I will tell you that he is not disinclined to scream and yell at us when he doesn't like what we're doing So what I will tell you is that it's not in his consciousness And unless I'm mistaken, unless Sam tells me I'm wrong on this issue, I'd say that essentially Sam's views and my views did penetrate--or maybe more importantly the real world penetrated-- because they got the message And that's--  -65-    3/27/90   That's what they say   Well, let me finish I'll follow up on what Ted is saying In all fairness, early on in the process when we had a current account deficit we also were concerned about the accumulation of assets, which ultimately would kill the value of the dollar It turned out that the willingness on the part of the world to absorb claims against the United States without disgorging them was much larger than we had anticipated, which meant that we did not have to view the trade imbalance as the indispensable number one adjustment process that a number of us thought--not that we chose to but we would have thought that a couple of years ago   Well, that may be true; we don't know that for sure But what we do know is that the original view that a lot of us, in fact almost all of us, had early on was not [unintelligible] to the most recent view of the Treasury Now, we may say that the Treasury is behind the times in understanding the facts, and frankly I think they are; but they probably are changing at this stage And our recognizing that, while the current account deficit is  -66-    3/27/90  not something particularly desirable, we do have a little more time to adjust it and hopefully adjust it in nonexchange rate terms is a new view It's a view that I don't think we have any reasonable expectation to be able to hold We've all misjudged the propensity--   I alter my statement to "most" I would say the most general view was that that was something we had no alternative to and, therefore, that the Treasury held that view up until recently is not something that's utterly bizarre Now, we may think they are wrong; we may think they are late in adjusting that--   Well, no If you believe it's going to happen, you try to cut it off at $500 billion net debt exposure before it gets to a trillion and a half; that's the theory The theory may be right or it may be wrong, but the [presumption] is what the argument essentially is all about   Well, no If you believe--and there are a lot of reputable economists who do--   Well, suppose the equilibrium adjustment comes into exchange rates--and that's a debatable question--and the intervention works?   And intervention drives the dollar down, closes the current account deficit, and chokes off the growth in net claims against the United States It may be right and it may be wrong; I think it's wrong, but it's not a crazy idea   You'd intervene because if you believe it's going to happen and you want it to, you believe that if there's less net debt out there, the adjustment process is less disruptive  -67-    3/27/90   That's right   That's the other question   Can I try something? I think we have the sense of where everyone stands Let me make a specific proposal and let's discuss that particular proposal I think that we're all in agreement that we should stay involved Well, let's say that's the sentiment of the vast majority; I don't want to speak for everybody The vast majority think it's probably better that we stay involved than not There is considerable discomfort on the part of this group about the policies and the policy orientations of the Treasury We all are concerned about the accumulation of the System's [foreign currency balances] I would suggest that in order to limit the size that the Treasury continuously endeavors to get involved in, in large part because they are driven by our counterparties on the other side-- in Japan to a much lesser extent than Germany--that we endeavor to resurface in some detail the potential risks that are involved in holding this much in the way of foreign currency assets I will take a position and try to [unintelligible] First, the extent that it affects our balance sheet and our technical capabilities of functioning, including the issues that Ed was raising; second, and I think far more conclusively, the risks that both we and the Treasury are taking with respect to potential backlashes should significant losses occur as a consequence of the holdings I don't know with absolute certainty that those arguments will prevail I think they are already beginning to prevail but I cannot know for certain Ultimately, the Treasury has the constitutional authority to run international exchange rate policy If we endeavor to confront them on that issue in an immediate confrontational way, we will lose in the Congress We almost have to lose in the Congress because any bill that the Treasury offers that moves to the Hill almost has to pass I don't see how that can be avoided even amongst those on the Hill who are very sympathetic to us So, we cannot win that battle in any way with which I am familiar All I can suggest to you is that I will put my best efforts forward, including communication of the not unimportant content of the discussion of this group today, which I will convey in some detail to them Having said that, I would like for us to agree in principle (1) to respond favorably to a request for an expansion, say, up to $15 billion, in the warehousing facility; and (2) to raise the limit on the System's overall [open] position to $25 billion and agree that the System's participation with the Treasury is discretionary, but with the strong presumption that the System will join the Treasury as long as there is reasonable two-way communication about US policy objectives and tactics in this area If we can agree on that, I think we will find ourselves in the best position that the System can be in So, I'd like to put that on the table as a recommendation   I'd say we say "no"   Nothing has been communicated to me from Treasury So as far as I'm concerned we have gotten no response Sam, do you know?   Tom, I think it would be [unintelligible] because the one thing we don't want to do, if we want to maintain continued presence, is to threaten them And that could be perceived as an ultimatum or a threat   Remember, that if push comes to shove, we will never prevail on this  -70-    3/27/90   Oh no, no   That's what I'm going to communicate   [I'm going to communicate that] the absolute size of what we're beginning to deal with is now getting to very dangerous levels It's beginning to have potential systemic effects in the Federal Reserve balance sheet; it's beginning to have potential political effects in the--   Oh, I can say that   I can raise it in a somewhat uncertain way   We have to vote on these separately   Yes, but you were managing them And the question is that some part of the law reads [unintelligible] you have a problem Are there any other comments?   No concerted intervention to drive the dollar down In other words--   That's getting too subtle They don't say that; they just say drive it down   Well, I would say at that particular stage I think we would have a confrontation   That's probably right   On that particular issue they would not bring it to the Hill because trashing your own currency is something you never want to go up to the Hill to get--   That happens to be the one--   That's the one issue that would not bother me   Well, when I say we'll have a confrontation I don't mean a big one We'll have a big dispute and I think the highly likely occurrence is that they would be unhappy but they would back down   I don't see why not   The debriefing about the G-7 [meetings] I can promise you; the systematic [unintelligible] sensible list from the Treasury--   That's true, in 1934   [Unintelligible] $4 billion or something?   You know what the law will state [unintelligible] the Treasury has full unquestioned authority to execute exchange rate decisions period   President Hoskins   Well, Lee, all I can tell you is that as best I can judge the ultimate legal authority is theirs and should they choose to implement it through the Congress they would probably effectively put us out of the operation You may find that attractive; I frankly don't   Well, let me say this All I can do is employ my best efforts I hope we don't get to that position If we do, I think we reopen the issue We'd have to rethink this whole thing I think it's premature to do that I hope at this particular stage that we will be able to implement the principles I suggested here to resolve this issue But it's not wholly in our hands It is conceivable that this may not resolve the issue; in that case we then will have to revisit it with different conclusions   Sure   Go ahead   Except by what?   Well, if we are required to go up and essentially reverse the Board's official position, it will surface some of these issues, which would not be all bad   No, it's quite possible that we will have agreed on raising these limits and that this may be close to the peak I just don't rule that out; that is a possibility And I'd feel more comfortable up on the Hill if we were up against some real problems with respect to foreign currency and they asked how this was happening rather than raise a contingent type of thing  -79-    3/27/90   [Unintelligible]   Yes   You may not seek confrontation with that, but it will create confrontation That's very unfortunate since we--   I now ask that Sam consider [formulating] two appropriate motions that effectively would read in principle (1) that should a question occur we would expand the warehousing limit up to $15 billion; and (2) that we would raise the System's open position to fund that The third issue, which is basically best efforts on my part, I assume does not require a vote Is that correct?   What I meant by that is Everyone is in favor, right?  -81-    3/27/90   Would a member of the Committee make that motion, please?   Is there a second?   All in favor say "aye"  SEVERAL Aye   Opposed?   We have two nays?  SPEAKER(?) That's all I counted  SPEAKER(?) Three   Three Do we want a roll call on this?   I think so Let's take a roll call   Okay Would you now formulate--   Will a member--   Will a Committee member make that motion, please?   Is there a second?   Call the roll   Three [dissents] on each   I can't believe this, but this brings us to the end of this meeting! However,--   You do?   I guess we could There's no reason we can't do it at luncheon Would the Committee want to continue that at the luncheon of the next meeting?  -83-    3/27/90   Let me suggest this I will at the luncheon of the next meeting report on the G-7 meeting And if you wish to bring up those collateral issues at that time--   Well, no Suppose it's nonsubstantive?   Why don't we leave that issue open? If there's a substantive question, we'll have a telephone conference; if not, I will try to review it at the next luncheon We can come in and have lunch first  END OF MEETING  -84-       Without objection We now move on to the staff reports on the economic situation with Messrs Prell and Truman   Questions for either gentleman?   President Syron   Governor Seger   Governor Johnson   Than what?   You're talking about the adjustment process?   Governor Angell   So to interpret Mike, what he's saying is that he's not worried about Ted's forecast; he's worried that if we raise rates right now it will affect his forecast!   You were finding this meeting very dull and you're finding a way to stir it up! President Boehne   President Stern   Governor Johnson   President Hoskins   President Guffey   Any further questions for either gentleman? If not, I think it's time for us to do our tour de table Who would like to start off? Ed   President Parry   President Keehn   President Forrestal   President Black   President Stern   President Syron   President Melzer   President Boykin   President Guffey   President Hoskins   Vice Chairman   There's even a possibility that we will see the 9 in the fourth quarter revised up   No, it's just that we have a lot [of indications]   I'll comment now I think that there is something going on The question is How far will it get? I think that the failure of Rostenkowski to get shot down immediately, which he did not, is suggestive of a willingness to take another look I think that process is going on, but it's much too premature to argue that anything is going to come of it But you're quite right there's something stirring that had not been stirring before Anybody else?   Governor LaWare   Try to top that, Governor Kelley!   Governor Seger   Governor Angell   You can't wait to hear what I have to say! Do we have coffee out there? We're a little late for coffee, but--  [Coffee break]   Lee   That's the real damage from the [Drexel] failure! [Laughter]   I think [the yen is at] 157-1/2   Now, or just below it Since the market doesn't expect anything, if we were to do that, I think it probably would go right through 160 or better   The market would be fooled Any further questions? If not, why don't I start the discussion There's no question that the underlying business cycle numbers have improved Not only the current numbers coming in but the actual revisions of recent history suggest that the current state of activity is better than we would have expected, certainly at the last FOMC meeting, though it's too soon to get a sense that this is anything more than a modest rebound from the end of deterioration We're not sure at this stage exactly how to read all the various weather seasonals If we were getting a stronger order pattern in the manufacturing area, we could presume that the pressure here was accelerating But from the surveys we take and from looking at the various sets of order patterns, orders seem to have stabilized at a relatively flat level, which is consistent with very little change in manufacturing activity The continued deterioration of profit margins has not yet turned, although I suspect that the improvement in raw materials prices that has come in recent weeks and that Governor Angell has been following may be suggestive of a first sign that the deterioration in margins may be ending But as of now, from what anyone can see on the profits side we are right at the bottom of this pattern and it has not turned What history does tell us is that the capital goods markets do respond to margins And in that sense, to carry this thing forward in the usual business cycle recovery pattern I think is premature It may turn out that way In fact, I suspect that the most likely forecast is precisely that  -39-    3/27/90  But we do have in the context of what is unquestionably an improving business cycle balance of forces--in a sense the cash flow part of the economy with the exception of profit margins--a lack of improvement in the balance sheets That is, there is still the deterioration and the [erosion] in the balance sheet; in the overall balance sheet we're seeing leverage still growing Don, I don't know whether or not the improvement in the liquidation of equity that you have in these flow of funds [projections] is going to occur that way I'm really sort of asking why you still have -60 or something like that; I don't know why it's not going to zero myself But the point at issue is that the leverage is still increasing and we're still dealing with a fragility in the balance sheet that is not improving And when that overhangs the business cycle pattern, I think we have to be cautious in projecting any form of acceleration in the underlying demand forces  I, like everyone else, am not sure whether the credit crunch is real It has to be partly real unless human nature has been repealed because there has to be a fundamental response to what has occurred I think the issue is how bad it is As Jerry points out, some of that is probably good, or not bad, especially if you look at credit that has been extended inappropriately The inflation issue is obviously the most disturbing part of the outlook I don't think it has gotten any worse since the last time The Social Security tax increase and the minimum wage hike are coming at exactly the wrong time If one had to go back and look at this whole thing in retrospect, that's not helping Probably it does mean that if we get past it without an acceleration, the compensation patterns will begin to fall off I don't know whether I'm encouraged or not, but whatever data we see on the wage side do not appear to be accelerating But then again, it's not improving in any material way that I can see either I'm encouraged somewhat by this slowing down of M2; I was getting concerned that it was going to break outside of our 3 to 7 percent range; it seems to be constrained Part of that, obviously, is the extraordinary pattern of the bill rate vis-a-vis the funds rate And in that sense one can argue that the markets have indeed tightened--that there probably is some modest tightening in the markets if you look at the bill rate, other short-term rates, and the money supply But it's probably a very modest amount because it makes [no] significant difference one way or the other  My own impression, having said all of this, is that it's probably too soon for us to be moving rates up The exchange rate effect, I think, would really be quite a destabilizing force Even at this stage I suspect that it's probably premature to go asymmetric toward tightness in the directive, although I must say that I suspect the next move we're going to make is indeed going to be up, not down, and probably should be At the moment I frankly would prefer that we stay symmetric but be very conscious of any evidence of inflationary pressures picking up, specifically in the price area, importantly in the money supply area, but most of all any evidence of acceleration in the business outlook While it is very early in this turn from the weakness that we saw in the fourth quarter, and in my judgment far too premature to assume that we're looking at any acceleration, we are nonetheless at 53 percent unemployment And that's a tight market If we get acceleration in demand at this point, I think the price pressures will begin to move rather quickly We have to be very conscious of that threat But my own judgment is that it's much too  -40-    3/27/90  early to assume that The order structure and the profit structure remain somewhat weak and at this point I would say that calling for more than leaving the directive unchanged and symmetric probably is premature However, if it were the Committee's desire to move to asymmetric language, I feel that's not altogether an inappropriate move--certainly at the next meeting, if not sooner Governor Angell   President Syron   President Guffey   President Forrestal   President Parry   President Boykin   President Stern   President Keehn   President Hoskins   President Black   Governor LaWare   Governor Johnson   President Melzer   Governor Kelley   President Boehne   Governor Seger   Vice Chairman   What I hear is that there is some concentration for alternative B symmetric The Secretary will read the directive encompassing that and we'll put that to a vote   Call the roll   Will someone move approval of the minutes of the March 27th meeting?   Without objection Mr Cross, would you bring us up to date on Desk operations?   Questions for Mr Cross? If there are no questions, would somebody like to move the ratification of his transactions since the last meeting?   Without objection Mr Sternlight   Are there any questions for Mr Sternlight?   Further questions? If not, would somebody like to move approval of the actions of the Desk?   The next meeting is scheduled for July 2-3  END OF MEETING  -34-       Without objection Mr Prell   [Pause] There must be questions!   Governor Johnson   Governor Angell   President Hoskins   Governor Seger   Further questions for Mr Prell?    5/15/90   Actually, they are leaner than I think the numbers show because our conventional measure is inventories over domestic sales, whatever they are But [unintelligible] the proportion of the inventories of imported goods While one can't say that excess inventories of imported goods will have no effect on domestic production but only an effect on production at foreign facilities, there is an element of truth in [the latter] So the estimates that we're making for wholesale and retail trade inventories, for example, have a rise in the ratio of imports to total, all at factory gate values, from 20 percent in 1980 to 25 percent now Assuming you also have the data for manufacturing, if you make the adjustments to have some form of weighing toward imports and take them out or put final sales in or total imports in, the inventory/sales ratios are much lower [now] than they were on an historical basis So, they are already pretty far down But, as Mike says, when you speak to purchasing managers they still have a way to go because they still think that there is significant improvement yet [to be achieved] in the quality of production So, if the reject rate can go down, which means they can bring the safety stocks back [down], well, it's really quite an extraordinary change   Well, if you look at the lead times, the April lead-time numbers were the lowest in I don't know how many years For production materials they're at the bottom of the chart    5/15/90   The other issue is that there is increasing access to foreign facilities for materials, so that lead times don't have to be bunched up every time there is a contraction in excess domestic capacity And it was the contraction in excess domestic capacity that used to trigger the lead time stretch-outs in inventory accumulation and [thus a] crash At the moment one rather positive aspect of the big share of imports to domestic demand in this country is that it implies that we have access to facilities all over the world That really makes a difference Any further questions for Mr Prell? If not, who would like to start our tour de table? Bob   President Black   President Parry   I think we have to find a way of producing excess crude oil and just [unintelligible] into the market; that did wonders in 1986 President Syron   President Keehn   President Forrestal   President Stern   In other words, tighter credit leads to higher prices!  SPEAKER(?) The high deal wins   President Melzer  -16-    5/15/90   President Boehne   President Guffey  -17-    5/15/90   Vice Chairman   It's probably stock adjustment; it was so weak for so long   I wouldn't hold my breath   I'd like to have that type of problem   Governor LaWare   Is your wife the source of this?   President Hoskins   In the District or in the United States?   I thought we agreed that that [indicator] doesn't work   I thought you were giving us a bearish forecast   Governor Kelley  -21-    5/15/90   Governor Angell   It gets too much ground effect!   Governor Seger   Governor Johnson   Okay Why don't we break at this stage for coffee and come back?  [Coffee break]   Questions for Mr Kohn?  -24-    5/15/90   President Parry   Any other questions for Don? If not, why don't I get started on the round table? Reflecting what I'm hearing among the Committee, I think what we're observing is something that I suspect has not been evident in recent decades I never recall a set of economic forces precisely that goes with what is developing here, and I've been trying to forecast the economy for well over 30 years On the expansion side, I think the evidence is very clearly mounting; we are past the maximum durable goods squeeze and I think we're beginning to see some flattening of profit margins at this particular stage [after earlier declines] As a consequence, capital investment is clearly showing some quickening pattern, and I think that shows up in the orders and the appropriations and in various qualitative measures On top of that is this extraordinary inventory situation, which continues to squeeze down--the issue Dick Syron raised Of course, what that implies is that if we ever get to the bottom when we're getting a squeeze and there is any evidence of tightening worldwide--so that there are shortages not only in the United States but elsewhere--then the lead times will begin to move and we really will begin to get the type of classic acceleration that we've seen many times in the past At this stage the evidence on the orders side is that they continue to improve gradually although they are by no means accelerating; the orders levels are just creeping up The backlogs in real terms probably are flat to down, but that is a major improvement from a year or so ago when the economy was deteriorating in the total durables and manufacturing areas If  -26-    5/15/90  anything, I would say the evidence of all of this is [that economic growth is] probably mildly accelerating  The trouble, however, on the other side is that we have something more than a merely minor financial disturbance I think there may well be more to this credit crunch than we're looking at; or to put it more exactly, I don't think we're through it yet The concurrent data that we pick up all over the place suggest that there has been, as has been stated, a mild pulling back But there is no evidence that it has stopped For example, all of the evidence about forward commitments, specifically on real estate projects and loans, is that this phenomenon is nowhere near over on the real estate side And we don't know at this stage to what extent it has spilled over in any other direction I find the money supply data--specifically M3, as Jerry has pointed out--mildly disturbing because they say in effect, even if you take out the thrift part of M3, that there really is something that is constraining financial capacity even though the underlying orders patterns suggest that there's something of a [unintelligible] considerably more forward momentum here The data we have on the credit crunch are, except for anecdotal evidence, not forward-looking They are all historical--all basically something in the past The trouble with the past is that as we continue to pick it up [in these data] it gets worse And before we're out of this, this has to stabilize and turn around--or at worst just stabilize, even if it stabilizes at pretty low levels--because it has to be having a fairly significant contractionary effect out in the distance through the late spring and into the summer on a lot of construction projects, which are a very substantial part of the goods markets  So, where this all leads me is to the same type of dilemma that I found myself in at the last meeting, where clearly there are dangers on both sides When we look ahead, the probability is that our next move will be on the up side because I do think one has to presume that this credit crunch is limited The trouble, however, is that at this point it is still growing; and to move to tighten at this stage while the evidence is that the credit crunch is still occurring I think would be a mistake Also, despite the fact that I think we probably will be required to move up before we move down, I wouldn't be inclined at this stage to be asymmetric on the up side This might seem an odd way to put it, but although the odds suggest that that's the direction we will be going in, I'm not sure that we should position ourselves in that manner until the credit crunch matter has stabilized Nonetheless, I do think that the inflation problem is very troublesome And while I would feel comfortable with "B" either symmetric or asymmetric, I must say I would prefer symmetric and would have the policy record relate the concerns that have been expressed around this table on the issues of inflation and the instabilities that they create But, like the last time, I think it's a tough call; and I suspect it may be no less easy as we get further on into the year So, my bottom line at this moment is "B" symmetric, but with extensive language in the policy record on the issue of inflation   I'm using it as a forecast   It does, and I would say that the money supply will tell us perhaps as much as anything If you look at the way the numbers have flattened out--I don't care what you say--that has come as a big surprise to me There's something wrong about those numbers And that's what bothers me   I wish that they could be explained by the April phenomenon I'm uncomfortable with that explanation   President Black   President Boehne   President Forrestal   President Keehn   President Guffey   President Stern   Governor Seger   President Syron   President Hoskins   President Boykin   Governor Johnson   Well, you know, what we react to and act on is not [just] what we write down   What we act on is basically what--   No, not on facts, but the attitudes of everyone Essentially, what we put down on a piece of paper is what the Committee obviously wants to do, but I think the reality is a lot more subtle than that And it depends on how events unfold   There's nothing that says we can't move with symmetrical language   Governor LaWare   Governor Angell   Governor Kelley   Vice Chairman   I also think that Wayne Angell said something which is important that the surest way to get a recession is to allow inflation to take over   I think that's an important issue The presumption that we are caught between inflation and recession is a misunderstanding of the way the system works We are always against recession The question is How do we avoid it best--by tightening [or] easing? Sometimes it can be either   President Melzer   I don't feel the pressure Let's try a vote on the recommendation that I made, which is "B" symmetric with appropriate policy record language indicating the concerns about inflation  -33-    5/15/90   Call the roll   Good morning, everyone We'll start with a controversial issue approval of the minutes  SPEAKER(?) So move   Is there a second?  SPEAKER(?) Second   Without objection Sam Cross   Questions for Sam?   Any other questions for Sam? This is the first time I recall in an extraordinarily long time when there have been no transactions When was the last time there were no transactions during an intermeeting [period]?   We had to ratify some   Well, of that I'm aware But quite frankly, it's the first time I recall in a very long time that there has been no [need for] ratification   The same, of course, does not apply to Peter Sternlight's [area]    8/21/90   Yes, please   Questions for Mr Sternlight?   Further questions? If not, may I have a motion to ratify the transactions since the July meeting?   Thank you Our next meeting is October 2nd Let's break for lunch  END OF MEETING  -44-       Without objection We'll now move on to the staff report on the economic situation I'd like first to call on Mike Prell   Thank you Questions for Messrs Stockton and Truman?   What is a concern in a sense is that there's very little chance that the demographics are wrong in that you get pretty much the same pattern if you [unintelligible] the labor force or if you construct the labor force out of the payroll data and the insured unemployment They both show the degree of tightness that has been exhibited by the sample surveys which, from the evidence that we see, suggests that this is not a statistical anomaly that's going to get revised next year   President Parry    8/21/90   The ECI data are far more comparable with the monthly average hourly earnings numbers; both the numerator and the denominator are comparable   I guess the revision would be horrendous on the compensation numbers   President Boehne   Well, actually, the error here is in participation rates in the labor force If you substitute historical forecasts of labor [unintelligible] participation rates, the unemployment rate opens up with the same growth Presumably, the wage rate following previous patterns does precisely what the model would suggest So I think the problem we're looking at in an arithmetic/ analytical sense is What is going on in the participation rates in the labor force that we do not understand? I'm not saying that's the sole issue but, unless we can answer that question, we're caught in the dilemma whereby at these growth rates we don't get any loosening in the system   But their unemployment rate was much higher?   President Keehn   President Forrestal   President Stern   Well, one thing that is happening is an increase in the cost of fuel and bottled water   Governor Mullins    8/21/90   You do have a proxy that is almost as good and probably even better than that, which is the 10-day [auto] sales figures In a period like this, to the extent that you get consumer shock, it is going to show up in those numbers Indeed, if you believe our seasonals, as distinct from BEA'S, there was really quite a significant fall from the last 10 days of July to the first 10 days of August Was it 61 on our seasonals?   [On our] seasonals?   Well, I'll wait for the second 10 days   They don't have much inventory   President Hoskins   Governor Seger   You will admit that the government would improve under such conditions! [Laughter]   And we're not going to get less than 1 percent for Q2 and Q3   Are you sure about that? Are you sure that CBO could unilaterally, by just an arbitrary forecast of a recession, derail Gramm-Rudman?   In other words, it automatically puts a vote on the table for suspension?   And the probability of that is not zero   If there are no further questions, who would like to start the Committee discussion?   Who would like to start off? Si   President Parry  -16-    8/21/90   President Forrestal   President Boykin   President Boehne   President Syron   President Stern   Vice Chairman Corrigan   It's all concentrated in a relatively small area south of Kuwait   When you say crazy [unintelligible] get it back to work and functioning within a year   President Melzer   This [survey] was taken when?   President Guffey   First Vice President Monhollon   President Hoskins   Governor Angell   Governor Kelley   Governor LaWare   Governor Mullins   But the difference is who imposes the tax   Governor Seger   I think we all need some coffee   Mr Kohn   Questions for Mr Kohn?   There's also an interesting change in the translation from crude oil to product prices this time relative to the last time We used to have a long lag; now it's instantaneous   President Stern   Anybody else? If not, why don't I get started and try to cut through some of this I must say that this is about as difficult a policy discussion as I have ever been confronted with, and I've been around these policy woods so to speak for 40 years Let's start with where we are I think there are several things we can stipulate with some degree of certainty namely, that those who argue that we are already in a recession I think are reasonably certain to be wrong in the sense that we do have weekly data that suggest, as others have mentioned, that up until perhaps a week or so ago there was no evidence of deterioration in what was a very sluggish pattern The insured unemployment data are as broad as any set of numbers that we have for the economy as a whole They don't get revised Sometimes they are a little unstable, but in general they do give an unfailing measure of where we have been And I think where we have been in the first half of the third quarter is clearly some small plus The whole thing may fall on its face next week, but I think at the moment it hasn't  On the inflation side, those who argue that the goods inflation is suppressing the problem on the services side are clearly looking at the numbers [but] I find the numbers a little difficult to read I think the crucial issue here is not the services inflation numbers but the wage rates which--however one looks at this inflation trade-off--clearly have not been coming down and show a slight upward tilt Although there is still the possibility that that could turn around in the third quarter, I wouldn't want to count on it given the type of environment we're in The services inflation problem has a lot of tricky things to it, which is what I think David Mullins was raising--especially when you try to substitute existing house prices for the cost of house operations for the owner or renter So, it's a mixed bag  What I am saying, essentially, is that there's a degree of apparent certainty out there in forecasts and judgments, which I think is suspect The crucial issue confronting us right at the moment is that the odds of an actual war in the Middle East are 50/50 If you look at the form of the buildup that we're engaged in there, it's fairly apparent that this is not a military establishment that is going to sit there for a very long period of time We are bringing in fairly significant tactical offensive weapons The chances of this all positioning itself and doing nothing and Saddam backing down easily has to be on the low side of the probability [spectrum] And the crucial issue here is that if a war does come, we have a very  -35-    8/21/90  serious question--as I think Jerry mentioned--with respect to the state of the Saudis' oil facilities, a very substantial part of which are concentrated directly under Kuwait off Ras Tanura and to the north of Bahrain And that is not all that far away from a couple of kamikaze raids, which some Iraqi pilots have already volunteered for Frankly, I don't think it's an issue in the next week or so We are still building our military forces and it's extremely unlikely that anything will be triggered until we are positioned We are nowhere near there because of the lead times it takes to move our equipment and troops And while we have a formidable force--enough for inhibiting any adventuresome activities--I don't think we're yet anywhere near the level that the reported flow of materials suggests we are  As a result of that, in an odd way where the economy has been is a very interesting statistic, but I'm not altogether certain it's as crucial as we probably would like it to be We obviously have a major budget problem, not so much in the additional costs but I think in the reduced probabilities of getting an agreement, which I think clearly have declined significantly In Gary Stern's terms, we are in a sense in economic/political policy turmoil  In that type of an environment, it is crucial that there be some stable anchor in the economic system It's clearly not going to be on the budget side; it has to be the central bank It's got to be we! I think we very clearly have to preserve--which is our fundamental role, mainly--the value of the currency both internally and externally and, in a sense I suspect, be more involved in damage control than in trying to implement a policy that is apt to do something of very significant dimensions I personally would feel very uncomfortable if we exhibited any evidence that we were going to accommodate the increase in nominal GNP that we would like to come out [unintelligible] with the price rise As Lee Hoskins mentioned, the experience of the 1970s is something that very clearly has to be avoided When we get uncertainties at the level that we currently have, I think we have no choice but to go to where our fundamental policy issues lie, mainly in trying to maintain as closely as we can a stable credit and monetary environment  I must say, I disagree with Wayne Angell's pessimism on M2 I would be more inclined to explain the fact that we have had a very low rate of M2 growth in the last three or so odd years--in the context that inflation was not coming down more--in terms of the P* model that we set up That would show in 1986 that adjusting the money supply relative to the price level indicated that the price level was down here and the long-term parallel real money supply was up here What we have been seeing essentially is a gradual narrowing, with the price level coming up and essentially burning off the excess money supply And it's only very recently that the lines have crossed I certainly would say that if the inflation rates were to continue [moving] up as money supply stayed stable, then the pessimism that you're exuding has some reason to be focused on But at the moment I think it's premature; I think we have evidence that this system fundamentally still works And I think that we have to be focused on essentially where the credit aggregates and the money supply growth are While at our last meeting we were getting clear indications that the markets were tightening more than we had anticipated, I had hoped that the money supply numbers we were looking  -36-    8/21/90  at in recent weeks were suggesting that that basically is simmering down As I recall, Bob Forrestal mentioned that he was hearing less about a credit crunch and that may in fact be what is happening; it may well be that what these money supply numbers of recent weeks are showing us is that the cumulative pressure coming in the credit markets in an endeavor essentially to preserve capital has reached the point where that continuing tightening has at least flattened out  In today's environment we have to recognize that there is a rather limited chance of affecting the economy in a significant way I would suspect at this point that the Pentagon has more policymaking clout than we do, because it's fairly obvious looking around the world that if oil [prices] go up and oil [production] comes down, that will have profound effects on the system And if Saddam is perceived to be increasing his power and his clout and his control over the West, he is going to be able to name OPEC's level of output--including his own, which will be up there and everybody else's, which will be down And his control would be more than just strictly the Gulf states because he has terrorist groups out there and he can control Indonesia and every far flung oil producer in the world Consequently, our ability to divert this guy probably has far more implications with respect to crude oil output, prices, interest rates, the world economy, and specifically the United States economy, than anything we can do sitting around this table for weeks So, I would suggest at this particular stage that we ought to have a more modest view of what it is we're going to be able to accomplish I don't think it is in our power to either create a boom or prevent a recession or vice-versa At this particular moment and for the period immediately ahead our tools are limited Therefore, I would suggest that perhaps the greatest positive force that we could add to this particular state of turmoil is not to be acting but to be perceived as providing a degree of stability And I would hope that to the extent our foreign central bank associates will feel the same way, we might be able temporarily to put some degree of stability at least somewhere in the system  Having said that, if one looks through to our next scheduled meeting on October 2, I think it's more likely that events will materialize in a manner whereby we eventually will feel more comfortable easing than we will tightening So, I would still like to stay where we have been which is "B," asymmetric toward ease But this is such an uncertain period that I think we're going to have to be auditing it quite considerably And under any conditions, I would recommend that we not go more than two weeks before we meet again on the telephone because I do think that within the next two-week period something is very likely to emerge that will require a general review I don't know anything specific about whether or not [our military] has built up to an offensive technical capability or not Frankly, if I had to guess, I would believe that the President has not made that judgment yet To know that we have the capability, one only needs to watch the television tube for any protracted period of time and know something about what types of armaments are used for what types of purposes Now, if this is strictly a limited police action, there are just too many policemen So, let me stop there with that proposal and see where everyone would like to go   Sure  -37-    8/21/90   No, this particular period I would view somewhat as a special case I don't know how I'm going to answer that frankly at this stage I haven't given it thought The authority of the Chairman under this proposed directive I think has to be evaluated very carefully Certainly, this is not the same view that I held last July when I put it the other way around I think we need something very significant to move from where we are President Syron   President Parry   Governor Angell   President Keehn   Lee was raising a question of two [changes], is that correct?   I recall we always really interpreted it as one   I don't think that has ever actually been formulated by this Committee, at least--  SPEAKERS(?) [Secretary's note Unintelligible because several people were talking at once]  -39-    8/21/90   I don't think it's the appropriate day   I appreciate that President Forrestal   President Boykin   President Stern   President Guffey   President Boehne   President Melzer   Governor LaWare   Governor Kelley   Vice Chairman   Mr Monhollon   President Hoskins  -42-    8/21/90   Governor Mullins   Governor Seger   I don't think I have asked specifically for support in a large number of meetings, going back a number of years I'm not saying that people should violate what they think are their principles I merely indicate that at this particular meeting it's important for us to have as large a consensus as we can get Obviously, I'm not asking anyone to go against his or her particular view of where you would like policy to be, but if you can find your way clear, this is the type of meeting in which it would be helpful if we had a very substantial consensus Having said that, I'd like to request the Secretary to put to a vote "B" with the language asymmetric toward ease   Yes, I'd stay with exactly what we had   Call the roll   Good morning, everyone Would somebody kindly move the minutes of the last FOMC meeting?   Is there a second? Without objection Mr Cross, would you bring us up to date on foreign operations?   Questions for Mr Cross?   Other questions for Sam?   Extending on Sam's remarks, I think there really is something fundamentally different about a confrontation where there is the possibility of a whole country or countries going under from a coup or some instability and the currency could conceivably--with a very low probability that's still not zero-- become worthless And that probability did exist with the East/West confrontations for Europe and for Japan This confrontation doesn't have that characteristic In other words, there's no credible judgment that one can reach that says this thing will be wiped out I think we saw that reaction in Saudi Arabia where there was this huge run [unintelligible] just moved as though it was the old dollar because that type of threat was there So it may be that while this confrontation has negative effects on Europe and Japan they really are quite limited And this war effect is very new to them The real test will be if the dollar doesn't do terribly much if there is a war, which is not all that inconceivable assuming that we can--   Any further questions for Sam? If not, I'd just like to take a few minutes to review what occurred at the G-7 meeting relative to the issues to be discussed today Those of you who have seen the communique know that a crucial paragraph on monetary policy brings forth the issue of, as they put it, "that the rise in the price of oil associated with the Gulf crisis poses two risks a risk of inflation and a risk of lower economic growth" The original draft that had been worked up by the deputies actually was skewed more toward inflation problems and had much less in the way of the issue of recession But [unintelligible] and Mr Brady both pushed for a symmetrical statement --or more exactly a statement that encompassed both even though [unintelligible] also involved income policies and a whole slew of other things, which were supported by no one Interestingly, however, the following sentence in the communique was crafted by , which seems to contradict the basic endeavor to get balance between inflation and growth, and it reads "The Ministers and Governors consider that stability-oriented monetary policies and sound fiscal policies constitute the correct policy    10/2/90  response" The interesting aspect of all of this is that the participants who were most strongly concerned about the inflation impact of the Gulf affair were the , both of whom in the previous G-7 meeting had lectured the group on being careful not to let the inflation genie out of the bottle because of all the difficulties they were having stuffing it back in And I thought it was quite interesting the extent to which they basically were not pushing for anything other than stability and clearly were acting against any form of accommodation My sense is that the other members of the G-7 were essentially all in the area of stability I heard very little in the way of--at least in the table discussions-- "interest rates should move up" In side conversations with some of the Germans I did get the impression that concern about the major increase in German government deficits was going to cause some upward pressure on monetary policy driven largely from the market side But that concern did not get expressed in the underlying discussion that evolved among the various participants I would suspect at this stage that pretty much everyone recognizes that if there is a credible budget agreement here, we will ease I didn't get too much in the way of concern about that, although I would suspect that if we embarked upon significant ease without a budget agreement, we would To the extent that these people ever express disapproval in anything stronger than moving an eyelash, we would get a double eyelash effect or something like that But the notion of stability in the context of individual adjustments was really enforced by the fact that there was no criticism, for example, of the Japanese [3/4] percentage point rise in the discount rate on the grounds that that was required to maintain what they perceived to be a basically stable policy  There was not too much conversation on exchange rates There was a general belief that a weak dollar would be undesirable And that was implicit in the communique, following up on the previous G-7 meeting's communique which had indicated that the yen was exceptionally weak, in language suggesting that the yen had reached a broadly acceptable range without specifying against which [currencies] The general view of the group, even though it was not explicitly stated, was that dollar stability--in fact, general stability--was desired, although  suggested that it might not be all that bad if the yen did actually firm somewhat relative to the other currencies But that was not a general view and that did not, of course, find its way into the communique I got the impression indirectly by the way he responded to the editing of the communique that Mr Brady basically was not in favor of significant weakening of the dollar He made several statements suggesting that, but he made no pronouncements; it was sort of half sentences But he was clearly not desirous of driving the dollar down and probably would be uncomfortable if that in fact happened The French at the meeting and the Japanese in public speeches requested that there be exploration of "a more stable international monetary system" as they put it And the G-7 basically agreed that some looking at the process was authorized, although I sensed no enthusiasm for the process on the grounds that no one was thinking that anything useful would come out of it But because a study and not an action paper was requested nobody particularly fought against it  With respect to intervention, generally nobody wanted to discuss anything about ranges; nobody even wanted to discuss    10/2/90  contingent intervention As a practical matter, while it may have been discussed peripherally, there was less talk about concerted intervention even in the abstract than at any time since I've attended those meetings I would say in general that it wasn't a particularly dynamic meeting, in part I think because there has been a change in the participants Considering the background of all the things that were going on, it was remarkably quiet and pretty much described by the communique There were no sub rosa discussions and no implied programs that are not in the communique And there is nothing much I can report that was not in the newspapers Does anybody have any questions or anything they want to comment on?   Yes There was general discussion of that in the context of the monetary policy issue I might say that there is a high degree of awareness about what is going on in the American economy and concern about it But as far as I can tell it's a limited concern, though clearly there   The hardened ECU?   Well, the discussion wasn't at the G-7 meeting but a couple of weeks earlier at the Basle meeting of the G-10 governors It was clear that the European part of the group had just come from Rome where they had had a fairly extended discussion, which sort of pushed back the [Delors] plan slightly I got the impression that the interest in the hardened ECU was not that everyone had all of a sudden looked at this and said "Gee, what a terrific idea" I think what happened was that the finance ministers finally had gotten the message that when you have the type of monetary policy integration contemplated in the Delors plan a substantial loss of financial sovereignty is involved So it wasn't the hardened ECU theme that created the problem; it turned out to be the vehicle that enabled some of the governments to back off from their commitments by saying "Isn't this interesting? Let's look at that" But I would suggest if there hadn't been a major plan they would have found something else   Well, I think that's certainly true on the part of the Germans It is going to be true on the part of the Brits and the Canadians until they begin to see more weakness in their economies And as Sam had mentioned this morning, Mr Hashimoto is already talking about what was effectively turning monetary policy around I'm not clear what that means As of the G-7 meeting, one    10/2/90  had the impression that they would remain firm, although there was no discussion of a further rise in their discount rate But, certainly, there was no indication of the type of reversal that was even remotely implicit in Hashimoto's remarks yesterday   Is there nothing else on this? We don't need anything to ratify [any transactions] since, fortunately, I assume nothing was done   Peter Sternlight   Questions?   I don't know, really When we say more volatility around something, of course, they'll be looking at the something Unless there is literally another instrument that we can employ, even in part, with some credibility, merely allowing the funds rate to fluctuate doesn't help us all that much because they will all be competing on who knows what the central tendency is on the funds rate What we really need is another instrument--some mechanism that captures the degree of tightness in the system better than the funds rate itself   [Unintelligible] goes off in the wrong direction   Yes In fact, I'm going to come back to that issue a little later because we've been giving a lot of thought to that structure not only in this context but also in the context of reserve requirements, which were originally set up on an M1 targeting basis   The way they set it up, I thought it would have been terrific if it had worked   Further questions for Peter? Martha Seger   They'll be looking for the central point of that range   In principle, you either have an interest rate or a non-interest rate [target] The trouble is in trying to finesse all this; it doesn't work   Either we have to say interest rates don't matter and we basically are targeting some financial variable or structure of variables or we target an interest rate And then we're always going to find somebody who's seeking the central point of whatever range we contemplate I don't know what we do about that, but it's not satisfactory; that's for sure   Are you suggesting something about creating some more [un]employment?    10/2/90   [Unintelligible]   Or lock in a mechanical [approach]--   Jerry suggests a significant part of the gross national product is value added from [Fed watchers]   Further questions for Peter? If not, may I have a motion to ratify the Desk's actions since the last meeting?   Is there a second?  SPEAKER(?) Second   Let us have lunch  END OF MEETING       Without objection Mr Prell    10/2/90   Questions for Mr Prell?   President Hoskins   When you look at the GNP data rebased to 1987, you tend to get lower growth rates [unintelligible], of course, slower productivity And when you take a look at the potential, the question is Are you going to be viewing it solely in the context of 1982 dollars or in 1987 dollars, which I assume is the base that will be emerging relatively soon? And that base is 1 or 2 less, as I recall, on a systematic basis   President Guffey   Roger   Governor Seger   Do you have a number that you use for sort of gross extinctions--in other words, the equivalent of the age of stock in the passenger car market--from the housing stock? There is a figure that is basically the net extinctions, which is related to the total number of operable housing units and the total number of--  -13-    10/2/90   So we're at the point where the vacancy rate increase is negligible and the housing starts number is following with the demographics?   Yes   Can I just add to that?   The equivalent Newsweek cover at the top of the market was exactly at the top of the market And then we got a signal that maybe--   But Governor Seger is right It could just as easily go to a million annual rate for a quarter or two and still be consistent with--   Governor Mullins   Further questions for Mr Prell? President Hoskins, didn't you have a question?   Any further questions for Mike? If not, would somebody like to start the Committee discussion?   President Parry   President Black   President Keehn   President Syron   President Melzer   President Stern   President Boykin   President Boehne   Vice Chairman   President Guffey   President Hoskins   Governor Seger   Governor Kelley   Governor Mullins   It's 23 basis points in the budget--   Governor LaWare   Governor Angell   We're running late, as I'm sure you're all aware, so we do have coffee out there which I hope is not too chilled And lunch is not that far away So, let's make the coffee break a bit shorter than usual and then reconvene  [Coffee break]   Mr Kohn   Questions for Mr Kohn?   Further questions for Don? If not, let me start off by giving you as quick a review as I can on the budget plan I realize the inclination of John LaWare and I sympathize with it, but having looked at this I'm inclined to believe that the degree of criticism is a bit overdone However, I might add that the fact that it is a bit overdone may make it difficult to get it passed on Friday because there is a lot of "real stuff" in here Let me define what I mean by real stuff I would say that any program that requires a majority of both houses of the Congress and a Presidential signature to be reversed would be defined as being enforced If you go down the list of all the various items that they have agreed to--though I must tell you there is a disproportionate amount of tax and tax-type stuff in there, much more than I would prefer--it does have the characteristic of enforceability The consequence of that is that $500 billion is not a number which I would argue has no smoke and mirrors My view of $500 billion is that it has always had some smoke and mirrors in it no matter what; it's a question of how much If we get a reconciliation bill and an affirmation of what David Mullins calls the "mini Gramm-Rudman," they've actually come up with something that is a lot better than anything they have done before  There are a few holes in the system which can break through between the budget resolution on Friday and the actual 13 or 12 individual budget items that have to be, according to the reconciliation instructions, on the floors in the House and Senate and in place by October 19th But I don't think they are very large In other words, once you lock in the reconciliation on the floor in both  -41-    10/2/90  houses, given fairly rigid instructions to the various committees within each house as I understand it, the leeway is not all that considerable There is some fudging possible, for example, in the agriculture committees where they can take the $13 billion and knock off a couple [billion] I don't think that can be done in any of the other ones in any realistic way No I take it back There is one other, but it is not very important You can't do it, for example, in the civil service lump sum; that's specific and that's it The postal affairs item is one that's in there In any event, there are a number of items in which there can be slippages between the reconciliation and the final passage, but I don't think enough to make all that much difference The probability of passage is fairly high in the Senate but a very close call in the House The markets responded positively to it and to the anticipation of it, but as David said, they were lucky that they ended up with the oil price decline Sometimes luck is not always bad! I would think that the consequences of that deal being voted down on Friday would be very adverse in the markets There would be disillusionment the likes of which would be very large And even though it's the Administration's position that they may need more than one vote to get it put in place--in other words, lose it and then come back at it--I'm not all that certain I think that if they lose it, unless they lose it by just a handful of votes, it's going to be final  There's not much to say on the Middle East issue with the exception that it's fairly clear that the futures markets have fairly persuasively forecast some form of war We have $35 oil when in fact production has pretty much closed the gap on what has been lost And inevitably, consumption has to be down 1/2 million barrels a day at these prices The supply/demand balance is not all that different from what it was before the invasion of Kuwait What we're looking at is a large number of refineries around the world that are concerned about being shut down because of inadequate crude or bidding in the market for inventories that already exist What we have is not a flow/price effect, but basically an inventory adjustment/price effect There's no knowing where that number will go because there's nothing that one can readily evaluate with respect to price changes under those conditions I think there's enough of that buying to hold the price up for a while The forward markets are discounted $10 to $13 a barrel And there I think we are looking at a bimodal distribution in which part of the forward market reflects a war that actually happened--loss of the Iraqi/Kuwait oil but also some Saudi oil--and the other part is the expectation of a war where nothing is destroyed or there is no war and everyone goes back to production If they go back to production, prices will fall below $20 a barrel in this environment This is not a market in which it is going to go back to $21 and stay This is a market which has an over-inventory, high production levels, and an awful lot of cheating out there which no one yet has figured out I cannot believe that Libya is producing at where it says it is; it's not the way they behave As a consequence, what we have is a highly uncertain situation When we were here the last time, we were discussing when and if war might break out I think it's still the case that lots of materials are moving across the ocean to Saudi Arabia We're obviously not positioned; if we were, all that stuff wouldn't be coming So, we are not ripe yet for an ultimate confrontation on either side It's only when we get to that point that the issue will be enjoined and resolved or there will be military confrontation But that's weeks away, maybe well into  -42-    10/2/90  November What we're likely to get is a heating up to a point where it's going to go either way and probably will get resolved within six weeks after that, hopefully In fact, I think the odds of peace have gone up rather than down in the last two or three weeks  So, we have that large uncertainty out there In the interim, we have all the issues that everyone here has been discussing I do think the evidence clearly suggests that we have a credit implosion going on We can see it all over the place I don't know whether the word "crunch" is a relevant notion, but everything is really being pulled back Commercial banks, on the basis of restrictive capital requirements and fear of not being able to meet the requirements, are pulling back Asset quality results are giving them some concern And while I don't know how to read it, I think that Ed Boehne is right in the sense that what's happening here is some sort of pressure I may change my mind in three or four days, but I still think we're in a situation in which there are forecasts of thunderstorms and everyone is saying well the thunder has occurred and the lightening has occurred and it's raining, but nobody has stuck his hand out the window And at the moment it isn't raining The point is, as best I can judge, that the third-quarter GNP figures in the Greenbook are not phony I think they are relatively hard numbers They can get revised down; they are being put down more and more but the economy has not yet slipped into a recession Now, that may change next week, but I think it's important to distinguish between forecast and history  In any event, we have some really significant pressures out there And at this point what strikes me as our major concern is that if we're going to maintain a semblance of monetary stability in an environment in which credit pressures are tightening the market, then I think we have to find some mechanism to ease We probably should ease at some point, really, to offset the credit crunch--with or without a budget deal But what I would recommend at this particular stage, in the context of all of this, is that we go asymmetric toward ease today with an understanding that if the budget resolution passes we go down 25 basis points, say, on Monday, but stay asymmetric There is still a possibility, although I think the odds are falling very sharply, that the budget deal--although it can't fall apart after the reconciliation--can get muddied in a certain sense I would hesitate to go more than 25 basis points on the budget resolution itself because it's not the ultimate final deal, although it is most of it And I think it would be appropriate to respond to that In that context, I would just stay asymmetric, and if the economic data look very poor on Friday, it might be desirable--especially if the budget deal finally makes it--to go down again, although I'm not sure that that would be the appropriate response But what I would suggest at this particular point is to presume that under certain contingencies we would move If there is an area of uncertainty about the events as they emerge, it would probably be desirable to have a telephone conference In fact, this is a very touchy period and if there's any uncertainty or questions about what is actually happening, I think it would be appropriate for us to have a conference At lunch we will be discussing an additional action that the Board is currently contemplating, which is the reserve requirement issue that I mentioned to you previously It is not supposed to involve interest rate effects, but does have an anti-credit crunch implication if the Board does decide to move in that direction So, in light of the fact that    10/2/90  the credit pressures have picked up, if anything, in the degree of stringency and--having looked at the plot of retail M2 excluding the elements that you suggest--that monetary growth clearly is pretty slow, I would agree with the way you put it, David that we are tighter than we had intended So, in the context of a budget agreement and this stringency, I would think it appropriate to take the types of actions under the various contingencies I have outlined, and I throw that on the table as a recommendation for discussion   Not Friday, no   Probably Monday, I would assume   It is?   It's a bank holiday?   How do you implement monetary policy when the banks are closed?   You're talking about the reserve requirements?   Well, we hope it's perceived as a technical issue But it is a non-interest rate easing effect in the same sense that if you reduce taxes on commercial banks, some of it goes through into increased loan availability How much depends on what the incidence is I don't think it will be perceived as an easing    10/2/90   I would say sooner rather than later We haven't quite decided   Yes, I would assume so In fact, how that is perceived will be dependent on the words that Joe Coyne puts out with the action! The purpose of that is to emphasize it as a technical issue, which it is It's basically something that we have been discussing; as you can see, that memorandum has been on the Board's agenda for quite a long while   Are you talking about the reserve requirements?   I disagree with Mr Hoskins Basically, if you're a commercial bank and you're concerned with your capital, you pull back; and the method by which you pull back is an asset rationing that opens up your margins In other words, the way you ration essentially is either through increases in price or through asset quality To the extent that you're opening up, if the federal funds rate moves down, you may bring the level of loan rates down That's the tradeoff So in that sense, it does make credit available   You don't increase demand, you increase supply   No, but credit quality and price are interchangeable in anybody's portfolio [Unintelligible] if you tell me I'm making a loan at 12 percent and I think the borrower is a deadbeat, I would say I want 30 percent; that's the same credit restraint  -45-    10/2/90   No, that's in response to the budget resolution passing   No, no action prior to Tuesday I think if we did it sooner, it would be very confusing   After the budget agreement is wrapped up   Yes   No, it's a combination of both the budget agreement and credit conditions If the budget issue were not on the table, I would still argue for the easing of 25 basis points I'm just saying on combining the two, it depends on how the budget agreement--   Oh no, it's more weakness than that I would say that the appropriate policy under the oil price supply shock is to do what we were doing before--to try in a sense to maintain the same money supply growth pattern we would have had prior to the oil shock, absorbing a lower level of physical activity and a slightly higher level of inflation largely because we can't avoid either of those two I would say that the appropriate action is essentially to be where we were It's not to be accommodative; it's not to try to stop the rise in prices, because we can't   What I'm trying to say is that there are two types of inflation One is the oil price pass-through The other is whether it embodies itself in the wage structure It's the second that we have to be very careful to avoid   If we believe that the oil price goes up and the [unintelligible] comes down and there's no wage effect, it's a complete washout There is no way to keep the [higher] price in there unless it embodies itself in some nonprice cost, in other words wage costs, cost of capital, or something   I'm not using the Greenbook forecast I frankly think that if we take Mike at his word, this one is a real problem But I would say that I see no reason for us to change the policy patterns that we had in effect as of July Basically, the targets that we constructed for the money supply should not change as a consequence of the Middle East crisis That's what I think should govern what we're doing If we do that, in my judgment we do not accommodate the inflation process   That may be, but the number of budget agreements that we're going to see making a precedent is going to be so few that--   I don't disagree with that, but the issue basically is that I don't see how we can get around not responding to a real budget agreement This is a real budget agreement There is no question that there is a significant absorption of purchasing power coming out of the system No one has ever seen a joint monetary policy/fiscal policy switch pulled off, and I don't think we're going to see it here But I do think that there's a general expectation [of an easing response], which we'll have great difficulty getting around, at least on the verbiage side Let me put it this way If I had the impression right at this stage that the economy was strongly inflationary, I think the argument we would make is that we should do nothing unless that budget agreement were making the economy go through the roof That's not where we stand I would argue for some ease, as indeed I have, because of the credit stringency issue over the last several months If anything, what    10/2/90  evidence we have suggests that that stringency has gotten worse in recent weeks   Oh yes, absolutely   I think it is important for us to emphasize that we have set target ranges for the money supply If growth veers outside of them the Committee would then act [accordingly], and I think that anything we do in the next six months had better keep monetary growth well within those ranges or we're going to accommodate this oil price thing And then I think we're going to be in the soup   I think that's right That's acceptable to me   Yes I think that a small part of it does show up, but David is right it's in M1 and money market mutual funds   Let me put it this way, Bob If M2 were at the upper edges of its range at this stage, I would feel very uncomfortable And my judgment is that David is right One has to be careful about taking out individual components; when you look at a price index and say without this, this, and this--   Are you arguing that the money market mutual funds are not in this basic thing?   But we do know the motives for the accumulation [unintelligible] assets   I would say, basically, that if you know the motive for holding it, you know what the behavior is; that's the definition We know the currency--   Yes If he just moved it out of the stock market, I would say the answer is yes   I don't want to make a point of this, and I don't think David wanted to make a point of it, but I think it's not an irrelevant consideration to try to disaggregate on occasion Even if we don't disaggregate, we still get moderate growth Go ahead   I'm ready to answer particular questions, but I do think we ought to get going on the policy discussion   It could be or it could be earlier   If the budget resolution passes   Yes At that point we would stay asymmetric toward ease   And we would contemplate another move if the economic data and/or the budget deal suggest that   The stock market will be open on Monday And we don't do anything until 1130 am, so the markets will already be open on Tuesday--   Until Wednesday?   It is a decision that is about 80 percent bound, maybe more than that, if my recollection is correct Theoretically, it's 100 percent binding, but I think as long as we have Bobby Byrd and Jamie Whitten up there--   Can I get the discussion started? Bob Forrestal has the floor   Well, that's an interesting question Theoretically it is supposed to be effective--well, they are going to vote Friday night so I guess it's Tuesday morning   Are you going to believe that that sequestration is real for the first 24 hours? I wouldn't   Well, I would be very hesitant to move upon the sequestration, which is readily reversible by a majority of the Congress and the President, especially given the size of the sequestration we're looking at; it's not credible So, I'd be a little careful   President Melzer  -51-    10/2/90   But it's not inconsistent; it's a little consistent with--   I honestly don't think that's--   Why don't we discuss that at lunch?   President Syron   President Keehn   President Parry   Governor Angell   President Boehne   Vice Chairman   Well, the way things are working, I would suspect that if we get to the first step, we should have a telephone conference to evaluate how that step went because we can't project a sequence of events that is at all complex through to the next FOMC meeting I just don't think we know how to do that   Governor Seger  -53-    10/2/90   President Stern   What would you do?   I would certainly say, assuming that is done, that we would go back to the Committee So, you have another shot at it in the sense that, as far as I'm concerned, it is not a self-evident process We would evaluate how that move went--   No, that's not what I'm getting at I'm talking about a basic discussion of what the actual response was Jerry is raising a crucial question If we all of a sudden find that the dollar is loose on the down side, we'd be crazy to move again My suspicion is that the members of this Committee will evaluate what has happened pretty much the same way Each of us is going to be looking at the same data I don't contemplate that as a particular problem, frankly President Boykin   Governor LaWare   Governor Kelley   President Black   I agree with that   No, I would say that we have a specific operational problem that we have to find a way of resolving Just to be locked in on the federal funds rate is to me simplistic monetary policy; it doesn't work   President Hoskins   When we talk about credit stringency here, hopefully you're referring to a sort of supply-side effect of restraint in the context of weakening demand In a sense if we're trying to maintain a steady supply and the markets are tightening up independently of what we are doing--at, say, an 8 percent funds rate-- I think this is a classic case of what's wrong with [focusing policy on] an 8 percent funds rate or some other fixed funds rate   That's very internal   Governor Mullins   President Guffey   Let me rephrase my proposal in the form of a voting proposal I would recommend alternative B asymmetric toward ease, with the presumption that if the budget resolution passes both houses there would be a 25 basis point decline [in the funds rate objective] on Tuesday morning or Wednesday or sometime around then Implicit in the proposal is that I'd like to remain asymmetric toward ease but--and this is something of a change from what I indicated earlier because I'm sensing different views in the Committee--that's as far as I would go It would merely be an asymmetric position with no presumption of a [further] move And if events materialized in the usual manner, in the way they have not under an asymmetric directive since the last FOMC meeting, what I would suggest is that it has the same status of that That is, under the same conditions we would move and there would be no implication of further action or the necessity of automatic action either as a consequence of an October 19th budget agreement or anything else Obviously, if the economic data all of a sudden turn sharply adverse, that would trigger it; that's the type of thing I would use So, that's the proposal that I would put on the table and request that we get a vote on  -57-    10/2/90   Well, there will be a call in any event to evaluate the first move, assuming that we have one, to get some judgment [on the reaction] But that has nothing to do with the--   There's no implied second move   There's no automaticity; that's correct   No, I would say that the budget agreement would not be a relevant reason to move were it not for the fact that there was a weak economy One can basically say that in the context of squeezing down the deficit, there is a little more reason but the fundamental reason is the economy and not the [budget] agreement   Well, are you saying Suppose something happens, would I feel obligated to request the Desk to move even if I thought at that point that it was a mistake because of some events that had occurred?   Well, that's a good question I would accept that   Yes, that's my inclination, as I've indicated, if [the legislation] passes and nothing else of significance happens to prevent action But I grant you that if there's some adverse market response or if something peculiar happens, it might not be desirable to move At that point, however, I think it would be appropriate to have a telephone conference to discuss why But my inclination would be in that direction   Exactly  -58-    10/2/90   Any further comments?   Let me be very specific This is an asymmetric directive Asymmetric directives are not automatic by their very nature However, I do suggest to you that if the Congress passes the budget bill, I would intend to implement the easing It is conceivable that other events concurrent to that may make that unwise That's as far as I'm going   Please   We've raised this issue before   I would suggest the following May I ask Don Kohn to submit a recommendation to this Committee on that question, because we've been doing this for long time?   I agree with you that we probably [unintelligible], but let's not muddy this   Okay, we're voting on the directive now Please call the roll  -59-    10/2/90 -60-   Would somebody like to move approval of the minutes?   No objections Mr Cross, foreign currency operations, please   Any further questions for Sam? If not, would somebody like to move to approve the one-year extension of the swap lines?   There is a second Without objection Peter Sternlight, domestic operations   Questions for Peter?   Si   I can understand why the spread has opened up, but what I can't understand is why the spread existed in the first place What is there about the risk on overnight funds, versus, say, a year and a half ago, of a major Japanese bank? Why is it any more than for an American institution?   That's even more bizarre   More trouble spelling some of the names!   President Melzer   President Forrestal   That's interesting Any further questions?   Yes, but didn't that come up just because of Mexico?   Swiss francs?   That soft currency!   Maybe we should go back to the gold backing   Well, this is so bizarre--the silliness of this Any further comments for Peter?   Go ahead   Governor Angell   Well, I'll put it this way One percent gold is better than 40 percent something else at least, because you've got--   You want at least $20 billion in discount loans?   I think this issue is getting to the point that the logic of it makes no sense This is really an extension of the original statutes in which we had backing for the currency for the legitimate purpose of its convertibility; that has ceased to--   That's one of the options If there are no further questions for Peter, may I have a motion to ratify the transactions at the Desk?    11/13/90   Without objection At this time Don Kohn would like to address another anachronism at the end of our directive   That's the reason we decided to do it before [the policy discussion], because we ran into that problem the last time We decided for exactly the opposite reason that we would make a decision [about this issue first] I'm not quite sure what it is we're going to say later that comes to grips with any of the options that Don has raised Do you have an idea?   I think that happens to be true But I'm not sure that that solves the problem because you're talking substance and we're talking public relations The issue that you're raising, which is a substantive operational question, is something we've been struggling with and have not been able to find a consensus here that would enable us to function in that context We had put it aside temporarily hoping we'd find an opportunity to address that issue But pending [a resolution of] that substantive question, we have this anachronism that is in the directive, which is on the table for us to address The question is What option do we choose? One option is to do nothing And it may well be that we should do nothing until we come to grips with the fundamental question That's clearly an option, but I do think we at least ought to make that judgment explicitly if in fact that's the option the Committee chooses to adopt President Parry   [Unintelligible] I'm not sure we'd have that much trouble explaining it   President Black   Do you mean option one?   President Hoskins   President Syron   That's a substantive question, which I suspect would not enjoy this Committee's support I hope not, anyway   In our previous discussions there has been a very significant amount of discussion in which we've extolled the advantages of having certain flexibilities in our operating procedures Peter feels extremely restricted at this moment for reasons that I think are fairly clear What we're failing to do is to find the means to do it I don't think there's a lack of interest in trying to go in that direction It's an issue of [finding] an operational procedure that is objective and that we can function with And I think we're still looking But literally trying to lock in on a funds rate probably will give us real problems in any event President Melzer   Governor Kelley  -11-    11/13/90   President Keehn   Governor LaWare   President Forrestal   That's very implicit in the current directive   President Boehne   At least we find out what the Committee has to say It has been moved and seconded to eliminate that sentence from the directive Are there any comments?   The trouble with that is that if we make an explicit statement that we're leaving it in until the next year we're saying it has some meaning   We're about to change   This will not appear in the policy record until six weeks after this meeting   We will have minutes at that point and I assume the minutes will explicitly state the purpose of what is being done I don't think it should create a problem unless I'm missing something   Look, we have a motion and it has been seconded Is there any further comment?   I would suggest that the motive here is to save money--for example, on the ink that is used on the paragraph Any further comments? If not, will the Secretary call the roll   It is removed  -14-    11/13/90   The next meeting is on December 18th  END OF MEETING       [We move to] the substance, ladies and gentlemen Messrs Prell and Truman are now on the agenda   Thank you Questions for either gentleman?   We may be seeing it in declines in some of the prefabricated manufacturing elements that go into the inventory data prior to going into the value put-in-place figures The SIC 344 --that whole metal fabrication area which precedes the value put-in- place--is beginning to become quite weak So, we may be seeing it on the edges   Are they talking about the orders for steel structures?   President Stern   Until you get the retail sales, how can you feel that comfortable?   It's not that I disagree--actually I agree with your forecast--but let me play the devil's advocate for a minute Initial claims are up sharply, but it is the level of the initial claims not their direction that determines the rate of change in economic activity And that level is back at the 1986 level, not back to 1982  SPEAKER(?) That's recession  -17-    11/13/90   And the only hard retail number we have at the moment is motor vehicle sales; and while they're off a bit, they're clearly not implying anything in a negative direction And while the data from the October employment report, which picks up wages and salaries, certainly are low implicitly as are the hours those data are notoriously subject to revision I don't know if it's 70 or 80 percent, but Lee is not raising a totally illegitimate question [Laughter]   I think that's a difficult call   Governor Mullins   In fact, we haven't had many of either   Governor LaWare   President Guffey   Further questions? If not, why don't we take a short break  [Coffee break]  [Secretary's note Chairman Greenspan called on Mr Parry to begin the review of economic conditions and the outlook]   Bob Forrestal   President Black   President Syron   It's shocking!   President Boykin  -25-    11/13/90   The newest member of OPEC!   President Guffey   President Stern  -28-    11/13/90   President Boehne   President Melzer   Governor Seger   Vice Chairman   Governor LaWare   Which district is this?   That's an unlucky number!  -33-    11/13/90   Governor Mullins   Governor Kelley   Governor Angell   President Hoskins   Don Kohn   Questions?   Other questions for Don? If not, let me start off by saying a little more about oil prices At this particular stage we have an economy where supply and demand have come into balance The Saudis have brought back liftings to a point where the shortfalls that occur as a consequence of an embargo are pretty much closed at this stage As is typically the case whenever you get higher prices, all the other OPEC members cheat You can see it in the data and you can see that the inventories are no longer under pressures And there is some evidence that consumption is slowing down against these higher prices What we obviously have is a group of refineries throughout the world that think there's going to be a war and that they don't have adequate inventories; and it's their bidding in the market for existing inventories which has kept the spot  -39-    11/13/90  crude price $10 to $12 a barrel over its equilibrium position There is some reasonable assumption that at where inventories are now there are potential storage problems The evidence is that inventories on the seas are increasing; the tankers are slowing down again, which is a typical pattern when there's a bit too much oil out in the system  This announcement of no rotation of US troops in the Gulf is a statement that short term, either we are picking up our bags and leaving or we're taking a bunch of shots and then picking up our bags and leaving And unless we get severe damage to the Saudi fields at this particular point or accidents in the refinery systems around the world including Kuwait, which I think we could probably write off at this stage, the oil price assumptions in the Greenbook short term are too high In this market it's going to go straight down for a while until we get a readjustment I'm not altogether certain that that is unequivocally positive The reason I say that is that we're thinking that we're dealing with a symmetrical system in which higher prices-- leaving our OPEC members aside--are negative and lower prices are basically positive But what I think we have here is a system in which, as a lot of you have said, the oil price rise essentially has had an income effect, which basically we see as crucial at this stage on consumption expenditures  Unquestionably, there is a very large risk premium that has hit the market as a consequence of the Middle East situation We can see it in the yield spreads on securities, which have all of a sudden just taken off; the A1/P1 to A2/P2 spread has moved over all maturities; everything has opened up If you take a look at the forward exchange rates that we calculate, the so-called 10-year forwards--which as a practical matter are a rough cut to get at what's happening to the exchange rates by subtracting the yield spread changes from the exchange rate--what you see is a relatively high forward exchange rate for the dollar in the G-10 currencies, which holds up until about midyear and then starts to come down; and with the budget problems and the Gulf problems it just falls like a rock All of this suggests that we have a very unstable environment--one in which the economy is being pressed down by the [adverse] psychology I think, for example, that the uncertainties and the risk premiums coupled with the oil tax, if we may call it that, are pushing down on consumption, opening up savings And if there were inventories sitting behind this, I think we would be in a free fall right at this stage I don't think the evidence--at least from the initial claims, which are the best figures we have--suggests that the economy is falling off the cliff as yet; it may three weeks from now, but it hasn't yet It seems to be crumbling very gradually under the financial pressure that everyone has been talking about What we have basically is old-fashioned disintermediation; that is, it is not that the net underlying credit demands that finance the GNP are collapsing; they seem to be going up slower than they were but we sure enough seem to be seeing that the intermediation system--not only depository institutions but insurance companies, finance companies, and everybody else--seems to be pulling back And what we are getting is the obvious tightness, which I think clearly is the major factor in a contraction of M2 and which is only one side of the depository institutions' balance sheets You can basically see the thing squeezing down as we get loan officers pulling back  -40-    11/13/90  The one great advantage that we have in all of this I think is that slowing inflation is now finally becoming credible Certainly, the employment cost index was a very important indicator, and even now there's a lot of question about the zero average hourly earnings number that we saw in the October release It is all consistent with a significant slowing down, which I think is beginning to show up in the underlying price data Indeed, if you disaggregate the CPI prices and reconstitute them with the weights coming from GNP --that is, using the fixed-weight PCE deflator--there's a very significant lower core rate of inflation implicit in there, which essentially reflects the problems we are all having with the housing service component in the CPI And there you have the very anomalous question of the market value of the underlying assets of this residential or quasi-residential group That's going down slightly and rents are going up Now, rates of return don't do that And I'm merely offering the suggestion that the commodities CPI is under 4 percent If you substitute some reasonable estimates for the services component for housing, I think we're beginning to get some evidence that at a minimum the acceleration has stopped While it's still premature, and indeed I think it's potentially dangerously premature, to assume that we have it beaten, I think that for the first time there are hard numbers that suggest there's something going on Under these conditions one would not assume, were it not for the crisis atmosphere, that the dollar would weaken as much as it has because one cannot explain the extraordinary weakness in the spot exchange rates strictly by the yield spread differences In fact, the type of calculation that we make, which tries to separate that, clearly suggests that a very significant part of the weakness in the dollar is essentially a vote of no confidence in the United States obviously with respect to the banks, financial institutions, and everything else  Under those conditions, it's very clear to me that if we are perceived as responding excessively easily to all of the other signs that would induce central bank ease, that the risks of the system cracking on us are much too dangerous I think we have to be awfully careful Nonetheless, I don't think that we have the choice at this stage of not trying to ease into the markets, being fully aware that at the first sign that we get of negative response we're going to have to stop I don't know whether or not we can do more than a 1/4 point over the next several months I would say the economy and M2 and the financial markets require it, but we may not have the choice In any event, I would suggest that we do have the possibility here--because there is no inventory system throwing us into a potentially sharp decline--that what we are looking at is a non-inventory shallow contraction which can stabilize after the saving rate adjustment is completed as a consequence of the oil price shock Even though, as I said before, I don't think that the decline in oil prices is going to be symmetrical with respect to [unintelligible], I still think that the oil tax will reverse, but I'm not sure that the psychological impact is going to be readily soothed over, so to speak  So, I think we have a good shot at actually coming up with the Greenbook's forecast However, I would read it slightly differently; I think that the best thing to do at this stage, when confronted with the types of problems which give John LaWare difficulties, is to remember what a central bank is here for A central bank is here to maintain monetary conditions in a stable    11/13/90  manner And I would say that at this moment, if we had a money supply that was going up around 5 percent, I would be very concerned about moving in the direction of ease even in this context of weakness But with the money supply doing what it's doing and the evidence of the continuous contraction that is going on, I would opt to ease 25 basis points right now and stay asymmetric [toward ease] with the understanding that only if the situation continues to worsen and is manifested in the credit aggregates in one form or another should we move again But if there is any evidence of significant weakness in the dollar, I think we will have to pull back and harbor the thought; it's not inconceivable to me that at some point if we overdo it, we will have to move back up Anyway, I would propose that as sort of the "least-worst" policy alternative that I can conceive of at the moment In summary, it's essentially for us to go down 25 basis points and stay asymmetric and watch the system as closely as we can Ed Boehne, do you--   President Keehn   President Forrestal   Well, that is basically what I'm saying But we have to be very careful on how we interpret things; in other words if the markets behave at all adversely and we hit them at the point when they are marginally adverse, I think there a danger Governor Angell   President Parry    11/13/90   President Guffey   Well, basically because I think the evidence at this particular stage is that we're more likely to have an opportunity to ease before the December 18th meeting than that a break in the foreign exchange markets is going to cause us to go in reverse   Well, let me say that I think it would be a mistake, short of some extraordinary event, to move again in another week or so I don't think that's a good--   Personally, I'm saying we're going to have to go through December 18th In other words, if a situation emerges in which the economy continues to soften, I would consider that what we're dealing with is early December, something of that sort Let me put it this way I don't think it would be wise to try to formulate exactly what would be done If it is sufficiently ambiguous and a difficult decision to make, I think it would be appropriate to call a telephone meeting and get the advice of this Committee It may not be that way; it may be as it was, for example, for quite a while when we were asymmetric and didn't move for weeks from one period to the next It's going to depend on events   I agree with that The only reason I prefer the asymmetrical language is that it's my impression of the forces we are looking at that it is more likely that we will be moving down than moving up That's all it means Frankly, I'm not certain that it really has that much operational significance because if the economic events are clear enough, it's not going to matter one way or the other what that tilt is  -43-    11/13/90   That's correct   Yes Vice Chairman   President Stern   Governor LaWare   President Syron   President Melzer   The move we made at the time the budget agreement occurred was not interpreted as a roaring--   I think that's right, but when they see the minutes of the last meeting I'm not-- Governor Seger   President Hoskins   Governor Kelley   President Boykin   Governor Mullins   Can the Secretary read the appropriate directive?   There's no final sentence Would the Secretary call the roll?   Leave M3 out   The minutes will have captured the substance of these changes; there is no problem   I don't know Don, can you accept 1 to 2 percent for M3 as well?   Would somebody like to move the minutes of the previous meeting?   Without objection Gretchen Greene   Are there any questions for Gretchen?   It was more than just Germany and Japan   Further questions for Gretchen? If not, can we hear from the domestic Desk, Peter?   Questions for Peter on either the Desk operations or the leeway request?   President Syron   Governor Seger   Except for those who pay big premiums [over] the funds rate   Further questions for Peter? If not, we need two motions I'll first entertain the motion for ratifying the Desk operations since the last meeting   Is there a second?   Without objection Secondly, would somebody like to move Peter's request for a leeway increase?   We'll now adjourn to luncheon Our next meeting is February 5-6  END OF MEETING       Without objection We'll now move on to the other regular staff reports Messrs Prell and Truman have the floor   Comments?   Well, can we assume that since the PCE for October is higher than originally estimated and imports are higher that we may be seeing nothing more than a higher level of imports of consumer goods?   Yes I'm sorry; I meant November   Any further questions for the gentlemen? If not, I think we'll start around the table   That was as of when?   President Boykin   President Parry   President Syron   President Forrestal   President Stern   President Keehn   President Boehne   President Melzer   Can't you create some contamination? [Laughter]   President Guffey   Vice Chairman   President Hoskins   Governor Angell   Governor Seger   Governor Mullins  -23-    12/18/90   Governor LaWare   Finally, Governor Kelley   Thank you Why don't we adjourn for coffee and come back in 10 minutes  [Coffee break]   Questions for Don?  -27-    12/18/90   It's four times the quarterly rate   We are a couple of weeks away and there is just no evidence that that has started yet So, be careful with your forecast   President Black, first   We don't know anything that contradicts it   Wayne, you were first   President Syron   President Boehne   Roger   Any further questions? If not, let me get started and be fairly brief because I think that we've covered a lot of ground this morning and put on the table most of the major issues I think it's fairly clear at this stage that the type of economic phenomenon we're looking at is something without any parallel in the post-World War II period This is in a sense a balance sheet suppression, the type we've all been mentioning It's really quite interesting to see the process, which is essentially one in which values continue to be under significant pressure For example, we're now beginning to see the weakening of residential real estate prices work its way into the CPI through the owners' equivalent rent numbers, which have finally flattened out Earlier data suggested that these numbers moved in parallel; they went out of line a bit earlier this year, which is probably a statistical fluke But it's fairly clear that we're beginning to see a disinflationary process going on, starting largely from the balance sheet structure of businesses as well as the financial system And I think that's a major element that is feeding into the basic price structure We are looking at it through the assets side and also as assets affect prices and prices affect wages, reversing the usual type of pattern We're obviously also seeing a significant weakening in the retail markets as a consequence of a fairly dramatic decline in realized capital gains on the sale of existing residences, which started to be weak in the second quarter And, although the data are very fragmentary, as we move into the fourth quarter the level of existing home sales has to be awfully low I think a goodly part of the weakness in consumer markets is not only consumer psychology but also a reduction of  -33-    12/18/90  purchasing power--quite similar to what President Syron was talking about with respect to New England, only on a much broader basis The psychology issue is obviously becoming really quite pronounced While one can argue that a substantial part is balance sheet related and asset related, the coincidence of the decline with the Persian Gulf crisis clearly has to be a considerable part of that But it's fairly apparent, irrespective of how one is looking at the pattern of economic activity as it works its way back between psychology and action, that we are seeing a seizing up of some forms of credit availability And the intermediation that has been taken out of the system in large part because of the savings and loan shrinkage is not insubstantial at this stage So, overall what is occurring, as a number of you have said and one can sense it, is that the fear [felt by] banks and the fear of getting involved in the intermediation process are really putting a big suppression on things I would suspect the 2 percentage point difference that Don is getting between the growth of M2 and that in his model may in fact reflect something we don't measure--namely, the inclination of individuals to hold liquid deposits which in the previous calculations are all presumed to be risk free The very substantial [volume of] noncompetitive tenders [in Treasury auctions] obviously in train this year is a mere suggestion of that particular phenomenon  Having said all of that, we have severe recessionary pressures But recessions always end And while our basic requirement as far as policy is concerned is to make certain that we maintain adequate liquidity in the system, especially under conditions such as those we are now experiencing, we also obviously have to look at the other side of this At some point we are going to come out of this and we want to make reasonably certain that when we do we're not looking at a degree of liquidity in the system that brings with it [higher] inflation rates and the next downturn much more quickly than is usual So, I think that it's apparent that we have a fairly difficult next six months ahead I don't think there's any particular short-term policy uncertainty My judgment and what I hear as the general consensus around here, if I read it correctly, is that the money supply has become extraordinarily restricted and that we're looking at what is a very major credit contraction The fact that the prime rate hasn't moved is an indication of the extent of that And I think there is an inclination to ease up a bit further here I'm becoming more convinced as the days go by that, while the optimum policy would be to somehow bring the funds rate down and [to generate] the associated credit with it until we get the economy in somewhat of a balanced growth position at which point [short-term rates] could stay down, the chances of being able to implement that are becoming increasingly small It's just not credible that a central bank can't print money; and the more we try to print it, in figurative terms, the more likely it is that at some point we'll succeed beyond our wildest dreams And while I would argue strongly that we have to get some downside policy cushion here, namely to make certain that we supply adequate credit into the system, I think we also have to be prepared for the fact that we may, and probably will, overdo it At some point the equations will come out right and we are going to be required to start pulling back, probably earlier than we might be desirous of doing so So, I would not at this particular stage leave out the possibility that we may overdo it, but I would not be overly concerned about that provided we are aware sufficiently in advance that that's what's happening The difference between where the credit aggregates,  -34-    12/18/90  the money supply, the monetary base--all the various financial elements with which we interface--are at this moment and where inflationary concerns are I think is rather substantial We have a long way to go, so I'm not particularly concerned about it The bottom line that I come out with is As I think we implied, the discount rate is on the table [for Board consideration] tomorrow Should the Board decide to reduce the rate in line with the vast majority of the recommendations of the Reserve Banks, then it strikes me that perhaps the partial accommodation of a 1/2 point reduction in the discount rate with a 1/4 point in the funds rate, bringing it from 7-1/4 percent to 7 percent, probably is at this stage the most sensible policy option If the Board chooses not to reduce the discount rate, I would still argue in favor of moving the funds rate another 1/4 of a point to 7 percent under appropriate open market policies And I would further suggest that having done that, we should remain asymmetric toward ease Comments?   It could be done that way What I'm actually recommending is that the FOMC act independently to move But as I noted, it's a technical question   Well, why don't we quickly put that on the table and let people comment Bob Black first   President Parry   Do you have any views on Wayne Angell's comments?   We do have to have a press release with a discount rate action, which does bind our hands with respect to that issue   But if you do that, the problem is that the normal market expectation would be a 50 basis point decline in the funds rate, which is more than I think we want to suggest So, in the press release we're going to have to say something to the effect that the expectation is for it to show through only partially in the funds rate   Because that's in fact what we've been doing   Well, let me put it this way Let's first get the policy down for which there seems to be very little difference And then we'll worry about the means of implementation It will not be viewed differently in the market but it will affect how the minutes read and how the implementation of the directive reads It won't affect anything else, but let's make certain that we get some    12/18/90  agreement on what we're actually going to do and hold for a minute the question of how that is technically implemented Bob Forrestal   Vice Chairman   Well, it might not be a bad idea at some point to have a sort of a fleshing out of this [unintelligible] issue you're raising President Melzer   If P* is any sort of basic inference, we are significantly better positioned than we were then   We have a lot of room to make a mistake in here   President Keehn   President Stern   President Boykin   President Hoskins   President Syron   Governor Seger   President Boehne   As long as it's the right thing! Governor LaWare   I regretfully suspect that you may be right Governor Kelley   Governor Mullins  -41-    12/18/90   Roger, do you have any remarks?   I might just say technically--   I think that's well said This is not the tough vote; the tough vote is on the other side of this   Well, let us remember one thing that we can be pleased about and that is that we've cut off the top of this [inflation bulge] very early on In terms of looking at the real M2, we have not been confronted with this big [unintelligible] In other words, essentially we've stabilized the growth in money supply to an extent that we haven't seen in quite a long time And hopefully we can continue doing that We're not going to get it [unintelligible] but we have kept it within our target guidelines now for a surprisingly long period of time And I just hope we have the capability of doing that in the future But I think what Wayne Angell has said is something we'd better be at least careful about [Unintelligible] run this It's going to happen If it turns out that the Greenbook forecast is right, that would be terrific But as Mike said very early on, he thinks that the risks of that forecast are asymmetric toward a worse outcome And I think we're all saying that that's what we're responding to, but it may not turn out that way And we had better be prepared to--   Are you saying we overdid it in 1988 on the up side?   Okay, can we put this directive to a vote?   The trouble, unfortunately, is that the ex-oil part also accelerated at some point, which gives some-- May I request that the Committee leave with the chair the solution to this problem?   We have to get the right language   Will you call the roll?   This is the first time in a long time that [the Committee membership] has been addressed as "Messrs" Who would like to move approval of the minutes?   Without objection Don Kohn will discuss the [report] of the task force on the relationship of the discount rate and open market operations Don   I thought you gentlemen had an impossible job, and as best I can judge you came out with about the best compromise that one could conceive of I must say I'm still quite reluctant to cave in, if you will, on this question that we can do nothing but target the federal funds rate This issue arises largely because what we are doing de facto is targeting the funds rate I'm not sure that any of us believes that that's the right policy What I think this compromise does is to recognize that that is what we're doing and that it does require enhanced consultation in the form in which Don Kohn suggested But it probably would be unwise to go to anything very specific or very detailed if for no other reason than that if we start to get very rigid in this area, we'll have to publish exactly what our guidelines are, and I think that probably would restrict our capabilities somewhat So, as far as I'm concerned, the enhanced consultation notion strikes me as the way to come at this question in a manner which brings together what really are statutorily two fundamentally conflicting forces If we really had to operate the discount rate independently from open market operations, we probably would get a monetary policy that was less than terrific Indeed, I think that's the experience we had in the 1970s If we can possibly avoid that and find a way to come off rigid funds targeting, I think that would be the ultimate solution to this problem And even though de facto on a day-by-day basis I think we are targeting the funds rate, in the longer-term sense I'm not sure that's right I would say that in the recent periods we probably did more monetary aggregates targeting in a sense than funds rate targeting, although operationally we were using the funds rate as the target Considering all of that, it strikes me, frankly, that the [staff] committee has come out almost Solomon-like if that's even conceivable in this kind of situation Does anyone else have comments?   Bob   Lee   Governor Angell   President Forrestal   Tom Melzer   Ed Boehne   Well, I think that's actually what has worked in the past   Peter has obviously confronted that issue in some detail Maybe it wouldn't be a bad idea to put down what you said orally in a short memo and circulate it I think it's an interesting issue how the Desk--   Yes Can you and Don put together something like that, Peter?   It raises an issue that Wayne Angell, who now has the floor, has raised at some length   Does anybody else have anything to add?    3/26/91   Anything further? If not, let's see if we can implement in some way the inclinations that have been expressed here both in the memorandum and by various members of the Committee And we'll look back after a while and see whether or not we're doing it right; and if not, we'll recalibrate it again until we feel comfortable I thought the [task force] report did help us in this particular area; let's see if we can benefit from it Let's go now to the regular formal agenda and start off with Sam Cross Sam   Questions for Mr Cross? Lee   Other questions for Sam? If not, would somebody like to move to ratify the transactions?   So recognized Is there a second?   Without objection Sam, do you want to go forward?   Questions for Mr Cross? President Boehne   I think Ed is raising a question involving three choices $20, $50 or $100 billion   Governor Mullins is first   If I may just piggyback, it's not that we have in the past always had to go to foreign central banks to borrow currencies for intervention We did, remember, have a period when we actually went out and sold Swiss [franc and] deutschemark denominated Treasury securities to raise those funds in the markets   We do have alternative means of accumulating currencies should we need them It's not only the level [of our foreign currency holdings that matters] but our standby options [to acquire more] to meet alternative rather than prespecified requirements In other words, it's not an issue of just having inventories of some physical commodity which when they get to zero it means something It doesn't mean that much in foreign currencies, if we have a realistic capability of borrowing fairly substantial quantities in open markets And I think that's an issue [relevant] to what Governor Mullins is raising in terms of the conceptual framework   President Hoskins   Governor Angell   Vice Chairman   That's a good question, Peter!  SPEAKER(?) Why didn't you sell those bonds before they lost value?   There is a difference, Jerry US government consolidated purchases that the Federal Reserve--   Roger   President McTeer   President Syron   President Boehne   President Melzer  -16-    3/26/91   I think we'll get hearings on this   Let me ask Sam a question, which in a sense comes out of this discussion Your argument for a war chest and some of the concern on the negative side is the associated price risk since the interest rate risk--or I should say the interest income is level Is there not any mechanism by which we can create swaps or RPs or something of that nature in which essentially we have fixed the exchange rate of our holdings? Is there a way in a sense to have a [unintelligible] put back to the originator of a currency so that, for example, at this particular stage we would have a deal with the Bundesbank where we would match certain parts of their dollar holdings and an equivalent part of our DM holdings and agree that that is a swap at a fixed price and eliminate exchange rate fluctuations, which affect--   Well, the only difference is that the currency moves after the agreement What I'm asking is Can we move the currency retrospectively in a sense or agree at this stage that--? I'll give you a specific case We basically are saying that the $10 billion deutschemarks and the equivalent of yesterday's exchange rate  -17-    3/26/91  in dollars held by the Bundesbank are presumed to have been fixed- price swaps which we will at some point unwind at that exchange rate It gives us the cushion but it doesn't give us the exchange risk   There are lots of ways of doing that   Well, the point at issue is that it's a [forward] exchange transaction that has a date on it   And effectively that gets factored into the market and neutralizes your position What I'm thinking of--and I just thought of it this moment, so there might be plenty of reasons why not--is an open-ended fixed-price mutual put, to put it in the terms that Governor Angell stipulated, so that we can eliminate part of the problem that is on the negative side of the current--   Yes   Okay In the interim, unless I misheard, at a minimum there is support here for trying to edge the stock of foreign currencies down either by unwinding some of the warehousing and/or selling interest receipts into the market if that is at all feasible In today's environment I'm not sure how much we could do of that, but clearly something is going to show up I certainly didn't hear anyone here support a significant increase; we are pretty much biased in the other direction   [Unintelligible] warehousing because that implied an issue for opening up [talks] with the Treasury, which we have to do And I think we are in the process of discussing that Hopefully we may succeed   Give deutschemarks to the FDIC?   If that doesn't get somebody's attention!   Well, we will be discussing this   Why don't you go ahead, Sam   Governor Angell   Charlie  -19-    3/26/91   I think we had a very short window earlier this year, when we could have done a significant--my impression was upward of $10 million deutschemarks--off-market swap  -20-    3/26/91  with the Bundesbank But that window closed very quickly on us as the markets began to move What it required was the Treasury to go along, [not] for this body to go it alone And by the time we got the system [greased] the market had run from us and made the issue moot There are windows, but they're very narrow and I think rare I did speak to Karl Otto Poehl at the Bundesbank, and he seemed inclined at that stage Now at this point I don't know; I don't know what else is going on But there are times when large transactions could be made if we chose to do them   No, [the reason for the delay] wasn't this Committee but [the Treasury] Any further questions?   Peter Sternlight   Do you want to go back and change [your prepared statement] to make sure that what you have written is now--?   Questions for Mr Sternlight? Lee   Si Keehn  -21-    3/26/91   Governor Angell   Any further questions? If not, would somebody like to ratify the actions of the Desk since our last meeting?  SPEAKER(?) So move  SPEAKER(?) Second   Thank you Our next meeting is May the 14th Let's adjourn for lunch  END OF MEETING  -46-       Without objections Mike Prell  -23-    3/26/91   Thank you I think we ought to take questions for these gentlemen and then break for coffee The floor is open  SPEAKER(?) The thought of coffee killed any questions!   Well, let's break for coffee  [Coffee break]   President Black   President Parry   President Keehn   President Syron   President McTeer   President Boehne   President Melzer   Vice Chairman   President Stern   Does Mike Prell get the same number?   President Guffey   Governor Angell   I don't know Would you get it from North Dakota?   President Hoskins   Governor Mullins   Governor LaWare   Governor Kelley   Thank you We will now move on to Don Kohn   Questions for Don?   There are always firsts   Any other questions for Don? If not, let me get started I have nothing that's significantly at variance  -40-    3/26/91  with what I've heard around here I do think we can look at the policy outlook as essentially representing more of a bimodal distribution in which the probabilities of events are probably discrete rather than continuous By far the highest probability at this stage seems to be that the healing process that we've been observing in recent weeks will continue and will gradually lead into a bottoming out and an economic upturn A crucial issue that Governor Angell raised is the question of the saving rate One way of looking at that process is that what often has been the case in such periods is that we get a run-up in existing home sales, which in turn engenders realized capital gains financed by mortgage debt, which in turn creates funds that the surveys suggest go disproportionately into big ticket consumer items It turns out, obviously, that the national income accounts show a rise in consumption without a rise in disposable income and, therefore, a decline in personal savings And since we're starting from a saving rate that is probably slightly north of 5 percent, we do have some possibility of getting [added] consumer spending even in the context of what is clearly a very deficient income flow In that context it's interesting to note that a substantial part--perhaps almost all--of the fluctuation of the GNP since the fourth quarter is gross motor vehicle products, meaning auto sales plus the steel and all the various parts; GNP ex gross motor vehicle products for all practical purposes was zero or maybe a slight plus in the fourth quarter and will be roughly zero in the first and second quarters of this year That is another way of saying that it's a recession without the capital goods relationships that historically were the major elements that gave us much deeper declines than we are seeing currently  That leads me to the second probability, which is not [on a continuum], but one in which we could see a failure of the recovery to take hold, continued pressures on profit margins, business confidence falling, and finally a real dive in capital appropriations, which we haven't seen And that would induce a secondary phase of the recession, which would deepen rather considerably The probability of that is at this stage still rather moderate to small, but in my judgment non-negligible  I think that leads us then to a policy stance that really gets to this point If the economy is healing and recovering, then certainly no further easing is required at this stage; but if we get a cumulative erosion, which leads to clear evidence that the capital goods markets are beginning to cave, then I think the proper action is probably a significant drop in the discount rate Were the economy to go in that direction and those events were emerging, obviously from the discussion we had earlier in this meeting about enhanced consultations, that would clearly be on the table As a consequence, I conclude that as a practical matter, what we're dealing with at this stage is a symmetrical directive because anything veering off that strikes me as something that would be likely caused by events about which it would be useful to have a consultation of this Committee  There are other issues that we have to be aware of over the longer term We have finally jump-started M2 back into the range, and the existing projections suggest that it will stay there--perhaps somewhat on the higher side rather than in the middle And I think we may very well have to contemplate, though not necessarily immediately, that our next move will be not down but up As I look at it, I would    3/26/91  say that we have done exceptionally well in keeping money and credit aggregates over the last two or three years on a trend which, unless we are all wrong about inflation being fundamentally a monetary phenomenon, will lead over the next two or three years to a marked decline in the rate of inflation And at this particular point we have the luxury in a sense of responding to the recession fairly aggressively because we've had a constricted money supply If this economy begins to recover and we begin to run into accelerated money supply growth, it would be wise for us to be careful not to let it get away from us, having spent so much time trying to get it down into this particular area  The one interesting problem, which I don't know how to handle at this stage, is the exchange rate We cannot explain the exchange rate in terms of our standard variables It looks to me as though what we have is an historic discontinuity in judgment about the nature of politics and property rights in the United States and hence the value of holding dollar claims relative to the other major currencies I'm not overly confident that the dollar is going to reverse at this stage I have concerns similar to those Governor Mullins [mentioned] And the only argument at this point that raises the question of whether we should move rates lower for reasons other than business or economic activity is if we [were to] begin to view our exchange rate as creating some form of problem for us I think that's well in the future and a very minor issue--certainly not something that is contemplated in the intermeeting period, but something that may surprise us and become the other side of the problem we have been so concerned about for so long mainly, an exceptionally weak dollar  So, in summary, I would say as a practical matter that I see very little alternative at the moment other than alternative "B" with symmetric language Obviously, if there's a strong desire around the table for asymmetry, which I don't feel frankly, that's not a big deal one way or the other; it's more a practical than a strategic issue But for the moment I would stay where we are, watch the data as closely as we can, and unless we see this cumulative deterioration taking form, I would suspect that we ought to be patient and wait for the economy to turn President Syron   Governor Angell   President Parry   President Black   President Forrestal   President Keehn   Si   If that's a proxy--   President Stern   Governor LaWare   President Melzer   President Boehne   President Hoskins   Vice Chairman   Governor Mullins   Governor Kelley   President McTeer   President Guffey   Would the Secretary read an alternative B symmetric directive for purposes of a vote?   I think I'll change it to "might"   Yes   Call the roll   Are there any comments raised by the report on the examination of the System Open Market Account--agenda item 2? If not, would somebody like to move that?  SPEAKER(?) So move   Without objection We have a memorandum from Mr Mattingly on amendments to the Rules Regarding Availability of Information Virgil, do you have anything to add at this particular stage?   Are there any questions at all on this issue? If not, would somebody like to move acceptance?  SPEAKER(?) Move it   Is there a second?  SPEAKER(?) Second   Without objection Gretchen Greene, would you now report on foreign currency operations?   Questions for Ms Greene? If not, would somebody like to move to ratify the transactions?   No transactions That's easy Thank you In that event, let's move on to the report of the Domestic Desk Peter Sternlight   Thank you Questions for Mr Sternlight?    5/14/91   Governor Mullins   President Parry   Any other questions for Peter?   Would somebody like to move to ratify the actions of the Desk?   Is there a second?   The next meeting is July 2 and 3, but [in the interim] we will have one or more telephone conferences  END OF MEETING  -27-       Without objection Let's now move on to Mike Prell   Questions for Mr Prell?   President Parry   President Stern   They calculate that interest income in a very simplistic manner   Any further questions for Mike? If not, can we have our "tour de table"? Who wants to start off? Si   Who would like to start?   President Black   President Forrestal  -7-    5/14/91   President Parry   President McTeer   President Syron   President Stern  -11-    5/14/91   You mean [the volume of debt financing] doesn't explain it?   President Boehne   President Guffey   Vice Chairman   President Melzer   Governor Angell   President Hoskins   Governor LaWare   Governor Mullins   Governor Kelley   Thank you very much Let's break now for coffee  -21-    5/14/91  [Coffee break]   Thank you Are there questions for Don? If not, let me get started with an anecdote that I was confronted with at the meeting of the Business Council last Saturday They had me on a panel on Saturday morning with the Chairmen of IBM, Penney, Morgan Guaranty, Chemical, and Monsanto And a gloomier set of forecasts you will scarcely hear It makes the most dour view of this afternoon [that of] a raving optimist At the end of the discussion, it finally got to me They all looked at me as if to say "Well, what are you going to do about this?" And I turned to the audience and said "This sounds the way it always sounds right at the bottom of the business cycle" And the truth of the matter is, it did Now, that is not the same thing as saying that if that's what it sounded like, therefore, it is the bottom of the business cycle! But it is true that when the economy is at the bottom of the business cycle that is what it sounds like  In a sense I think the evidence is very clearly falling gradually into place in that respect The problem that we're having in evaluating it is in part the consequence of two things that have occurred, and they have been mentioned previously One is the structural change in inventory policy, which has limited the extent that inventory accumulation is followed by massive liquidation, with production levels substantially under consumption levels The total system finally drains out and pops back The second is the issue that Don was raising namely, that as far as monetary policy and the credit aggregates are concerned, we didn't have the counterpart to the tightening as the economy since the peak [turned] into the break, the liquidation, and the reversal What we're seeing at this stage is a far slower [than ususal process of adjustment], where in effect the contraction follows the very heavy and excessive debt creation of the 1986-87 period, the subsequent gradual retrenchment of debt growth and M2 growth, and basically, deleveraging beginning to occur, arriving at a point where I gather we had record equity issuance in April And the effects of this are very obvious We're seeing that the quality of balance sheets, as Mr Corrigan points out, is improved Despite the fact that the banking sector is still fragile, there is no question that the difference between the banking sector today and the banking sector six months ago is really quite stark The structural weaknesses that we saw back then and the yield spreads and the difficulties to borrow relative to what we have today I think indicate that we have a much sounder [banking] system now  I think the inflation numbers at this stage are really credible If you look at them in detail, if you look at them in an historical context and in an overall credit sense, unless inflation has ceased to become a monetary phenomenon, something fundamental is happening And I think it is extremely unlikely to reverse We're picking up the benefits of several years of fairly substantial improvement in all relationships of money, debt, and prices But in that context I think monetary policy gradually defused the overheated economy and slowed it down to a point that in effect what I was hearing at the Business Council was not that their orders were deteriorating but that they were absolutely dead Nothing was moving; everything was just absolutely frozen The only problem with that is  -22-    5/14/91  that it appears, unless our data are just all wrong, to be allegedly freezing at a point in which production, fortunately, is well below consumption levels And that has to run out It's not a question of an inventory pickup; it's basically the end of inventory liquidation, which has been the classic element to turn around the economy in every pickup after recession that we've seen in the post World War II period and I'm sure earlier So, when somebody says "What's the spark? What's going to move us?" the implication is that everything is in balance The problem at this stage is that it's not in balance Unless the data are all just wrong, we are undergoing a rate of liquidation at this particular stage, despite the fact that we have this structural change [in inventory management], that cannot persist very much longer because businesses are running out of stocks And at that point production begins to move, real income begins to move--the classic Keynesian stuff, to whatever extent it works--and that's when it works We get the multipliers working and the whole economy begins to move The problem is that it's happening very slowly  I think John LaWare raised the relevant question here This is a confidence issue We can sit at this level for quite a while and eventually everyone will get discouraged and pull the plug on the capital goods market Even though the capital goods markets have come in below our forecast, it does not appear from talking to a lot of people that what we are seeing are cancellations and major contractions What we're seeing fundamentally are stretch-outs in the capital goods markets because we can see the appropriations backlogs are holding Everything is holding The only thing that has changed is the fact that instead of doing it today, it's "manana;" but it's still there The danger is that they will become so discouraged that eventually everyone will start to contract and pull in their horns; and then we will get a secondary double-dip in the recession At this stage, even listening to all the gloom that I did on Saturday, I don't get the impression that there is a widespread initiation of cancellations of projects, as distinct from stretch-outs So, I think we have a little time The trouble is that everything is going in such slow motion because of the inventory and the credit [situations] that it may be too slow to get us out of this in time But the elements are here The basic [issue] is that we cannot sit with everything as it is now because the levels of production are too low relative to consumption, and something has got to give  One thing that disturbs me, which disturbs a lot of you, is that we are uncomfortable about where long-term rates are Obviously, should bond rates back up, then the mortage market will back up and we could abort [the recovery] in the residential real estate markets, which are still healthy But I suspect that the difference between the analysts and the managers, as Ed Boehne called them--and it was the managers that I ran into on the Business Council--is that the managers are operating as though they are serving the level of demand; the analysts are saying they're not And we're about to find out whether or not the data really tell us anything  All this suggests to me that we probably just ought to xerox the last directive and rerun it, because I can't see any argument that I at least find plausible to push us on one side or the other So, I would just put out as an initial recommendation, "B" symmetric Governor Angell  -23-    5/14/91   Okay That's two  SPEAKER(?) I do too Three  OTHERS Four Five Six Me too   You know, Roger, I would suggest that that is probably telling us that the capital goods markets are beginning to fade It may be one of the early signals the Committee gets about the need to be very watchful Who was it who said we ought to be vigilant? Was it Governor Mullins? I think the money supply may be a very weak tool, but I suspect in the current period it may be far more serviceable than it has been in a very long time   Yes And we also need to take a look at the weekly asset side of the intermediary system, which reconciles to the money supply--disaggregate it into real estate loans, business loans, [and so forth] and in a sense try to see what the obverse of money supply elements is Right now the data indicate a definite weakening in business loans, but I suspect that's being offset by issuances of securities in the long end of the market, so it's not a contraction But if we get what you're concerned about, I think we're going to see it on the asset side of the intermediary balance sheet and it would be quite suggestive of the type of problems we worry about   That's probably factually correct, but I think the tone of the balance of risks is symmetric In fact, I think you put it exactly right The balance of the risks is probably symmetric even though the policy risks may be asymmetric Si   Well, do you mean on the down side or the up side?   I would say on the down side that the major issue would be the money supply If it's beginning to show a kickback from the weak April and all of a sudden it starts to dip down again, I think we had better be careful Don did mention that  I think the data had been [unintelligible] but in the last loan officer survey even though the rate of tightening is much less it is still tightening And in a sense there are liquidity questions because it's very hard to figure out how in the world we would get significant interest rate reductions in the context of very subnormal money supply growth and an exchange rate that is firming not only against the European currencies but against the yen as well In other words, there are some people, and I have a certain sympathy for this, who are saying in effect that those are indications that monetary policy may be too tight However, if the money supply is moving adequately, I would say it's a hard argument to make But if we end up with a situation in which the money supply is beginning to shrink and/or the dollar is beginning to firm very extraordinarily, or if we get some really weak [economic] numbers--and that I would say at this point is unlikely unless something cracks--we need something I think the Committee has actually created enough of a bottoming here that some new force has to come on stream to knock the economy down As I said here the last time, the danger is really the capital goods markets If the capital goods markets hold up, I think we're out of the woods But as I think all of us are saying--that's right, Jerry raised it and I forgot all about it--the real issue here is that if all of a sudden the stock market falls on its face and breaks business confidence, then we ought to be prepared to move pretty quickly   If it is of the form that's cumulative But if it merely reflects what anecdotally already is in the system, that probably is not new information Look, durable goods orders for April I assume are going to be down If they're down by huge amounts, then we've got to look at it; but if they're just moderately down, I don't see that that is telling us anything new   Why didn't he say that! It's inconceivable to me that we can get through the next three weeks without something happening that is not important to talk about I would assume, even if there's nothing to say, that we ought to meet Does anybody else want to comment?   We just got it today   Down 37   Suppose the market goes down 180 points? Isn't that what monetary investors have in mind?   No, in one day   I would bet you that it had an effect in stabilizing this   Anyone else before we vote? If not, there is a correction   The one that was distributed   I'd like to propose that we repeat the directive, but obviously it requires some changes   Okay   Good morning, everyone Would somebody like to move the minutes of the July 2-3 meeting?   Without objection Mr Cross, will you bring us up-to-date on the Foreign Desk?   Questions for Mr Cross? If not, would somebody like to move to ratify the transactions as requested?   Without objection Mr Sternlight, the Domestic Desk   Questions for Mr Sternlight?   Other questions for Peter? If not, would somebody like to move to ratify the transactions of the Desk?   Without objection We now move to an issue we have discussed previously, which is alternative operating procedures We have considered it on innumerable occasions and we're revisiting it today with a memorandum from Don Kohn   Questions from the Committee? I don't know what to make of that long pause   No, I started with questions, assuming I'd get comments Now I better ask for comments Comments, then   President Black   President Melzer   President Parry   President Forrestal   Peter, may I just follow up and ask you what you feel are the consequences of the [funds rate constraints] on your [operations]? I would presume that as a consequence you end up periodically with either a collapsing funds rate or an accelerating funds rate on a Wednesday afternoon at the close of the maintenance period   How often does that occur during the year, either way?   Three or four--something like that?   Do you sense that there are any destabilizing occurrences as a consequence of that?    8/20/91   President Hoskins   President Syron   Any further comments? I appreciate the [difficulty] of trying to [develop] a study that approaches this    8/20/91  question If I knew all the things we were to study that we don't know-- I'd be curious to ask Don and David Is there any significant, unexplored statistical or analytical area from which we might focus on this issue that would be a productive use of the resources of the System?   Al   I think we're all acutely aware that holding steady with the funds rate is not the same as a stable monetary policy Even though we focus on that as an instrument, I don't think there's anyone around this table who believes that a flat funds rate is equal to a stable monetary policy   So, it may not be a bad idea to expand our insights into this area It may not be directly usable but I think if we learn something, the payoff is very large   Go ahead, Al   It logically follows the first   Well, the second is directly derivable from the first; it should not be difficult to convince--   But in a sense, therein lies what policy is all about It is, in effect, what we have endeavored to do just to balance two--in fact, a lot more than two--variations from our intermediate expectations Any other comments? If not, unless I hear any objections, I assume that Don's suggestion probably does capture the general tenor of this discussion and I would ask him to go forward with that And we shall wish him well, because I'm not sure what-- [Laughter]   That's what we intend    8/20/91   Another round   Okay Shall we move on then? Another item that has come up previously and was deferred to a study relates to the directive language concerning intermeeting adjustments This is an issue that Governor Kelley has raised and he in conjunction with Don Kohn has brought forth a memorandum [See Appendix] Governor, would you like to chair us through this?   You have given it some thought   Questions?   I'd just like to add that it doesn't necessarily follow that holding that list of objectives constant through that period of ups and downs is necessarily a contradiction   You can create that type of phenomenon The issue is Does that occur consciously or has it just become a mantra of some kind for us   Vice Chairman   Well, the problem there is that just procedurally, if you have, let's say, a list of five items and a Committee this large to make a judgment, the time frame required to solve that matrix--   --goes way beyond lunch, dinner, and whatever else One possibility is that we can alter this list in a very generic way once a year or something of that nature as we do the monetary aggregates when we're looking at them in a sense as a separate policy orientation for the period ahead rather than at every meeting Were we to do that, we could actually do that almost independently of the deliberation process of a specific directive in the same way that we do the monetary targets I'm not certain that we need to change these every meeting But I do think that we should either freeze them permanently--meaning that this is the Committee's formal set of objectives in the order of our priorities, which is invariant to specific economic conditions that we're confronting--or have some greater flexibility where they might change over a period of time or in cases where there was a very specific indication such as  -12-    8/20/91  the stock market crash or, as we'll be discussing later, this very peculiar M2 problem that we're running up against [In the latter case] there are potential recommendations to alter the directive with that characteristic being in a sense a specific short-term type of adjustment for a specific meeting I don't know how that strikes you, Governor Kelley, as a recommendation; it sort of comes to grips with the problem you raised but hopefully doesn't get into the problem that Jerry Corrigan raised   As part of the discussion?   President Parry   President Melzer   Governor Mullins   President Syron   Any further comments?   Any further comments? It strikes me that we've made considerable progress on the issue that you've raised, but we haven't resolved it yet If I may, Governor Kelley, I would request that for the next meeting if you could perhaps get views in somewhat greater detail from all the Committee members and the nonvoting presidents, you may find that there is a much more solid consensus than may appear here But I think there was a growing view somewhat in your direction on this question If you can query everyone with respect to their specific suggestions, you may be able to bring before us at the next meeting something capturing this discussion with alternative recommendations Clearly, item 4b is one alternative; the one that I mentioned is another; and there may be a third, or something else you can come up with Get it down to two or three specific things and we may be able to resolve the issue at the next meeting So, if you wouldn't mind, I'd--   One possibility being to eliminate it completely   Or change it to something different   Okay Our next meeting is on October 1st And we have 9 minutes until we begin our 100 pm luncheon   Dining Room E, a celebration   Okay We're now up to [our review of] the economic situation Mike Prell   Questions for Mike?   Are there any biases in the inventory change numbers as a consequence of the [change in the] price base? In other words, do real inventory levels change or will they be significantly altered with the move to 1987 prices in the November base revision?   Do we know the direction of the effect?   One of the things about which there could be a concern is that we are viewing the outlook in the context of a set of homogenous goods--units from which we interpret there is liquidation of a certain dimension--and it could conceivably turn out that a goodly part of our presumption is wholly the result of the arbitrary choice of a price base   I would suspect that the forthcoming durable goods order series is quite crucial to this in the sense that  -17-    8/20/91  if the rate of liquidation is what it appears to be, that figure should be moving up, not sideways or down   President Parry   Any further questions for Mike? If not, would somebody like to start the Committee discussion?   President Parry   President McTeer   President Black   President Syron   President Forrestal   President Stern   Vice Chairman   Yes, this does suggest supply as the relevant issue   Well, that's what the matrix is trying to suggest   President Guffey   President Boehne   May I just ask How do you reconcile that now with the continued strength in your manufacturing survey?   Have you matched the actual report that you get against the rhetoric of the individual who is associated with that [company]?   President Hoskins   President Melzer   [That's] the reason the crop is so huge; I gather they've got the supply to use   Governor Angell   Governor LaWare   Governor Mullins   Governor Kelley   Thank you very much I'm informed that coffee has arrived It's probably cold now!  [Coffee break]   [Military forces have surrounded the Parliament] building [in Moscow], but there are also 150,000 people around the building and the crowd is growing This is a confrontation that is obviously growing [unintelligible] The stock market, which was up over 30 points, is now up 8; it's still up It's an extraordinary historic event in the process of occurring I hope we can finish up so we can go and participate  SPEAKER(?) Or watch   Don Kohn   Lee   Any other questions for Don? If not, let me get started on the discussion Incidently, one of the problems I think we're having is that when a recession is over, by definition, the economy is at the lowest point in a cycle and it feels awful The anecdotal reports we're getting from a lot of people are a reflection of the fact that the levels of orders, activity, etc are exceptionally low It's very interesting to get a sense [of the views] in the political realm; there is a confusion as to whether "the recession ends" means the receding has come to an end or that the economy is back up to normal I think the overwhelming evidence is that it's the latter [view] that we run into So, we observe different views, as Jerry points out, between economists and economists' bosses I think we're all talking about different things, basically, and that's an issue that is going to continue to confront us  The issue that concerns me most--the one that Jerry also raised with respect to the saving linkage--means in effect that there is a personal consumption expenditure restraint on this expansion And although residential construction is obviously moving moderately, nonresidential is not; capital expenditures are not; and export demand is moving but not exceptionally So, the whole dynamics of a recovery basically falls on the inventory dynamics There what we are clearly seeing is something that in a way is unusual With the measured rate of [inventory] liquidation that we are getting--assuming the numbers are correct--one would expect to begin to see the historic dynamics start to emerge here The way it has tended to run historically is that as liquidation begins to ease and production moves up to consumption, the lead times on the deliveries of materials begin to stretch out as we begin to get some squeeze on [production] facilities And the increase in lead times has created an increased desire for inventories on the part of the purchasing managers They start to increase their orders to reach their new inventory goals, which in turn puts still greater pressure on production facilities, which in turn is what that self-feeding process from the inventory side is all about However, if we look at the lead times in the  -36-    8/20/91  National Association of Purchasing Managers [survey], it's pretty clear that for production materials especially it is dead, flat It actually has been easing down recently And it is consistent with the notion that "just-in-time" has really taken over the whole inventory process But unless and until we begin to see some of that pressure emerging and the dynamics of new orders beginning to move in the historic pattern, we will have this very extraordinary concern that this [recovery] may stall on the final demand side before the dynamics take hold I doubt that that's going to happen; there is no reason to suggest that As Governor Angell points out, the commodity prices are soft and are in fact reflecting this very process, but they're not collapsing; indeed, the steel scrap price has even gone up a little and that, as Wayne knows, is my favorite commodity price There are good reasons for that It actually has been telling us a great deal about the durable goods part of the system In any event, while I do think that the odds still strongly favor the ignition of the dynamics and the acceleration [of the expansion] and, indeed, the likelihood is that the next Greenbook forecast will be revised up, the risk structure has nevertheless clearly increased  So, while there is clearly no policy purpose that I can see in moving rates lower immediately, I would suggest nonetheless that with a directive without change--the "B" version--we ought to be asymmetric toward ease with the recognition that if events continue to deteriorate, we would move But we ought to be careful to make sure that that is in fact what is going on and not be whipsawed by the statistics as they go back and forth At the moment it is very difficult to make the case that the economy is falling back into a double-dip recession The recovery is slow, sluggish, and frustrating, but it is still plus And it could very well become a significantly larger plus than any of us senses, certainly from the anecdotal evidence  If we get to the point where the evidence suggests that further easing might be necessary, I suspect that would require a discount rate move I think we'd have to be prepared to do that if events move in an adverse direction In any case, I would like to put on the table as a suggestion that we adopt variant "B" asymmetric toward ease And frankly, I would prefer version II of the text that Don suggested [in the Bluebook] with respect to the language of how the money supply concerns are evolving and are affecting policy as they very obviously are President Syron   Okay President Hoskins   President Black   President Parry   Governor LaWare   President Stern   Governor Angell   President Keehn   How would you go on the directive language version?   Governor Kelley   President Forrestal   President Melzer  -39-    8/20/91   Governor Mullins   Vice Chairman   It's the obvious problem President McTeer   President Boehne   President Guffey   Okay   Well, I want to split the vote because I think that's an important difference What we'll do is vote separately on the language because, as I read it, we have a fairly substantial consensus on alternative "B" asymmetric but not on which version of the language And I think it would be best if we voted separately   What's wrong with having a recorded vote?   Okay, good enough [Laughter]   Since he has the official scorekeeping, I can [check] the score I have Corrigan I; Angell I; Black II, Forrestal I; Keehn II; Kelley I; LaWare--   Mullins I; Parry--   That is very slightly in favor of version I, so I would propose for a vote alternative "B" asymmetric toward ease and version I with respect to the language Could you read that?   Will you call the roll?   Good morning, everyone We have Tom Hoenig with us--officially this time--and I gather, Tom, that this is your first day as president   Would somebody like to move the minutes of the August 20th meeting?   Without objection Sam Cross, you have a number of issues on the table   Any questions for Mr Cross?   Any other questions? Peter Sternlight, the Domestic Desk   President Corrigan, do you want to add anything?   Questions for either Jerry or Peter?   What we need is a Solomon!   Governor Angell   Any further questions?   The trouble, unfortunately, is that what we can't do is suspend them temporarily as a primary dealer   It's like executing somebody technically and then resuscitating them If there are no further questions on this issue or to Peter, may I have a motion to ratify the actions of the Desk?   Is there a second?   Without objection We now move on to the economic discussion Mike Prell  MESSRS PRELL and PROMISEL [Statements--see Appendix]   Questions for either gentleman?   President Syron   President Parry   Governor Angell    10/1/91   Any other questions for the two gentlemen? If not, shall we move ahead with the round table? Who would like to begin? Bob   President Parry   President Syron   President Keehn   President Forrestal   President Stern   Ed Boehne   Governor Angell   President McTeer   First Vice President Hendricks   Governor LaWare   Well, John, I'm glad you liked the waffle! Vice Chairman  -18-    10/1/91   The financial funds   Commercial and not residential?   You're talking now about the rental prices flattening?   Sale prices are flattening, which means that the rental prices are flattening?   New York was the leader in going downhill in certain respects   Bob, what is your judgment of commercial real estate price trends in the last month?   Does anyone else sense this?   Commercial?   The relevant rental prices are the new lease rental prices because the average is going to come down for a long period   Have you seen anything, Dick?   Bob, is there anything in Texas?   Does anybody else have any sense of developments?   They have to start somewhere   The rate of decline is [abating]?   Tom Melzer, do you want to comment on this and make your report?   Governor Kelley   Governor Mullins   Anything further? Does anybody else want to make any comment?   Well, I did, but I didn't want to push you, Tom   I thought you might just like to sit here and listen for the first time   Please do   Thanks, Tom Why don't we break for coffee?  [Coffee break]   Questions for Don?   Further questions for Don? If not, why don't I get started We have a very unusual set of problems, but the least difficult strikes me as in the area of policy The reason I say that is that at this stage we seem to be treading what in retrospect is very likely to turn out to have been the right path If we go back historically, as Jerry and a number of others have in this discussion, what is clearly happening is a long-term phenomenon where in the first half of the 1980s, in part as the result of the 1981 Tax Act, we created an extraordinary expansion of credit The grossing up in the flow-of-funds sense of both the funds raised per dollar of nominal GNP and the degree of intermediation were all fairly extensive There was a really major financial expansion It finally petered out somewhat in the middle part of the 1980s and then got really dragooned with the 1986 Tax Act, which took away all of the real estate incentives that had been the major spark that had engendered the credit expansion  Since that period we have had the grossing coming down dramatically; by the grossing I mean the types of activities in which state and local governments borrowed at the [tax exempt interest] rate, invested at the Treasury rate, and picked up a guaranteed rate of return There was a lot of that going on I'm talking about the very large amount of borrowing against realized capital gains and the sale of existing loans, which built up the balance sheet The whole thing was really quite explosive, and all of that is now in the process of turning around and, in fact, has been turning around for the last four years It is not something that disturbed us particularly until it began to fall into the money supply area  This may be premature, and I suspect it is a little premature, but I think what is occurring is that we're beginning to find that if past relationships on M2 were in place--or as Don likes to say "in train"--we probably would have a much weaker economy right now than is currently the case Now, that's a very tentative statement because we really don't have enough evidence But if one were to look back from, say, February 1992 and ask "How does this all  -27-    10/1/91  look?" I have the impression that the hypothesis that Don raised may have some validity namely, that the S&L evaporation has more to do with the money weakness than I think we realize In principle, we have always argued that M2 was determined essentially by the choices of the holders, which means in effect that from where the supply comes is irrelevant And our general view about the liquidation that was occurring with respect to the resolutions from the RTC was essentially that all that money was going into other intermediary places and to a degree in commercial banks and was leaving M2 fundamentally unchanged I think the proposition that M2 is mainly demand determined and perhaps Ml even more so really is questionable; it is by no means clear that the proposition that M2 is all [demand] determined makes any sense And indeed with the size of the contraction of the S&Ls, it probably shouldn't be a surprise for us that we're getting as much of a contraction as we are What is surprising is why now? Why not earlier? And that raises the question as to how quickly people adjust As I was mentioning to Don a while back, I remember how long it took a decade ago for the 5 percent passbook accounts to disappear People just sat there with 5 percent when they could have gotten twice that and more; it took a long while to unravel But it's fairly apparent that when you shake somebody and say "Look!" they change And when you have an S&L resolution, people [reset] their views as to where they should be relative to the types of holdings they have I think that's what is probably going to turn out to be the case This again raises as a hypothesis that when we look back in six months or thereabouts I suspect we will be looking at what really was a fundamental change going on in the structure of finance  I think that the real economy, if one could measure it in terms of whether it is good or bad, is really not bad Productivity has increased significantly in the manufacturing area over the years I would suspect, although the evidence is difficult to come by, that profitability at any given rate of operation tends to be higher; that there is a great deal more competitive capability in the American business system than there was a while back; and that what we are running into is a deficiency--basically in this case the intermediary system It surely is not in the area of bond issuance [unintelligible], as a number of you told me the other day, indicated that the view at is that the total investment banking industry was operating at capacity and that if there is any more issuance coming out in stocks or bonds their "due diligence" would begin to break down We're seeing an extraordinary [volume of] financing going on in the larger companies, but we are seeing a really extraordinary pulling back in the depository institutions I'm somewhat less inclined to take the view that John LaWare has taken I think there is a supply side effect from the capital side I'm not sure how it's going to be resolved but it's probably the 1980s that were off, not the 1990s  All in all, I think what we have here is that the grossing that went on throughout the '80s has come back to normal The general net funds raised is far closer to normal, but we have a really hobbled intermediary system, which is not only the S&Ls and commercial banks but clearly the insurance companies as well Were it not for the fact of a weakened intermediary system's effects on primary borrowings, one could argue that we'll finance the economy outside the intermediary system But it doesn't work that way And what I think we are seeing, as I put it to my friends at the White House the other day, is  -28-    10/1/91  that it's very much as though an economy which is picking up steam is running against a 50 mile an hour head wind My impression is that we'll make it through, but it will be a struggle  Having said all of this, I think we're getting some evidence that the commercial banking problems are not getting worse We're getting some indications that we have passed the worst in the S&L situation; we still have insurance problems but they're not getting worse So, the question at this stage is Can we get through the next several months? My suspicion is--and I would buy the staff's forecast on this--that we probably will And if that is the case, what we are testing right now is a major hypothesis as to whether the money supply contraction that we are seeing really matters or whether we are seeing an economy hobbling along with insufficient finance that nonetheless will be able to make it If that is in fact the case, we will look in retrospect and say, rightly or wrongly, that we probably have the optimum policy that one could conceive of, granted the types of problems that exist  Now, having said all that, we're not in February looking back at something which looks as though it has been cured; we're not there yet And I would be inclined at this stage to tread very cautiously, as I think we've done I'd rush nowhere quickly And that would lead me to conclude that policy should be somewhere between symmetric and asymmetric toward ease, but I'd be less inclined to move unless we begin to see further deterioration If the staff forecast is right, and if this hypothesis about money that Don has raised is right--and I think it is becoming increasingly more reasonable--then we should begin to see some strengthening in the data within the next six weeks If it fails and fails in an obvious way, it is telling us that this hypothesis is not correct and would lead one more toward the type of hypothesis that Governor Mullins raises I would recommend a directive--although I personally would feel comfortable either with symmetric or asymmetric toward ease--that is more toward the latter because it's hard for me at this stage to envisage that we might tighten within the next six weeks  Finally, let me say that irrespective of what is going on, I think we are going to have some tough public relations difficulties on the Hill, not only with the issue of Salomon but with this whole problem of a sluggish economy An economist's view is that a recession is over when the economy stops receding; and that by definition is the low point of a cycle, the worst point of a cycle Politicians believe the recession is over when the economy has recovered fully And we're going to be in this dilemma, as far as I'm concerned, for a goodly number of months But if the staff is right on the forecast-- So far things are falling into place even if the anecdotal evidence doesn't work, and I think we may well come out in that area In any event, I spoke longer than I intended to but I'd like to put on the table as a general suggestion "mildly asymmetric toward ease," if one can characterize a directive in those terms  MR, BLACK Is that "B" mildly asymmetrical toward ease or "A" mildly asymmetrical?   "B"   I frankly would not expect us to ease right here We could well ease; and if that happens, we might find that the economy turns around a lot faster than we now expect President Parry   President Forrestal   Vice Chairman   Mildly asymmetric?   President Black   Governor LaWare   President Boehne   Governor Angell  -30-    10/1/91   President Keehn   President Syron   Governor Kelley   President Melzer   First Vice President Hendricks   President McTeer   President Stern   We're still missing Governor Mullins   And President Hoenig   As I read it, I guess it falls between asymmetric and symmetric "B" But there is a majority for asymmetric by several, so I think that [unintelligble] If we use in the directive "slightly" rather than "somewhat," I think that probably captures the sentiment Would the Secretary read the directive?   Will you call the roll?   Okay, the next meeting is November--   November 5th We have a need to have a very short Board meeting before lunch So, if the Board members would just stay here and others would give us a few minutes to have a legal meeting, we'll be back at lunch  END OF MEETING       We need to approve the minutes Without objection Today, in lieu of Sam Cross, who as all of you know is retiring on December 2, we have Gretchen Greene I suspect that were Sam here we all would have wanted to wish him well and, Gretchen, if you wouldn't mind, by proxy please give him our best   Well, I think Sam is going to be quoted around here for quite a long time He has made an impression, which is quite rare for somebody at the FOMC And it's not superfluous to say that we will miss him Having said that, I can think of no one better qualified to sit in for Sam today than you Would you start?   Thank you Questions for Ms Greene? If not, it would be interesting to us if Ted would discuss the most recent events regarding our relationships with the Soviet Union and certain pending negotiations   Questions for Ted? If not, Gretchen, would you update us on the annual extension of the swap agreements?   Any questions? Would somebody like to move authorization?   Is there a second?  SPEAKER(?) Second   Without objection Let's move on to the Domestic Desk Mr Sternlight   Questions for Peter? We have a very uncurious group this morning! Why don't you go forward, Peter   Questions? Would somebody like to move the authorization for the [leeway] increase?   Without objection We also have to ratify the transactions since the October meeting Would somebody like to move those?  SPEAKER(?) So move   Do you want to [comment]?   Governor Angell   You know, I must say I agree with that Let me cite one of the problems I have The FOMC is scheduled to meet on a publicly announced date and is expected to make decisions The market knows that If we in the past had moved during an auction, everyone would have screamed bloody murder But the question essentially is Who is right in this question? And the question I'd like to put to a vote with you is If we were to do it some time in the middle of the auction, how much damage would actually be done?   But answer the question How much damage is actually done?   Well, you have to ask yourself What is the job of the market people? Their job is to make judgments as to what is going on in the market And one of those jobs is [judging] what we're going to do   President Black   Governor Mullins   Why don't the quarterly auctions schedule themselves around our meetings?   President Melzer   Vice Chairman   Well, what we ought to do is at least schedule our meetings--  -39-    11/5/91   President Forrestal   Governor Kelley   Well, we also ought to see if we can arrange not to have a conflict; this issue has come to us before  SPEAKER(?) Bizarre  SPEAKER(?) It's just crazy   This issue shouldn't be coming to the surface Tom   Okay Anyone else?  SPEAKER(?) I'd go now  -40-    11/5/91   Okay   The next meeting is December 17 and we will adjourn for our luncheon for our departing colleague   A one-day meeting  END OF MEETING  -41-       Without objection Let's move on now to the economic situation and Mike Prell   Questions?   President Parry   President Stern   Governor Kelley   President Melzer   Other questions? Tom   Further questions for Mike? If not, would somebody like to start the Committee's discussion? Bob Parry   Sure   President Keehn   President Forrestal   President Syron   President McTeer   President Stern   President Hoenig   President Boehne   First Vice President Hendricks   President Black   President Melzer   Vice Chairman   Governor Kelley   We can stipulate that!   Governor Angell   Governor Mullins   If they had an impact, they would have stopped at some point  -24-    11/5/91   Governor LaWare   Coffee has arrived  [Coffee break]  [CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN Mr Lindsey]   Excuse me, why don't you wait; we've just lost Governor Mullins Sorry about that We're back in recess pending the finding of a missing Board member Here he is Okay, go ahead   Any questions for David? If not, let me get started As I indicated at our telephone conference last week, I think what we are dealing with clearly is an historical process that has very little in the way of counterparts in the post World War II period This is an old fashioned asset contraction It is reflected  -25-    11/5/91  most severely in the commercial real estate area, with obvious consequences in the financial [sector] as we discussed It's reflected, strangely, in the residential single-family area even though the data themselves scarcely suggest anything even remotely close to the asset-price deflation in commercial real estate Nonetheless, what is clear--and one picks this up from anecdotal evidence and at these cocktail parties we all go to--is that individuals somehow perceived that the market values of their residences were actually much higher than they really were There was a sense in which the offering price they had in the back of their minds was the equivalent of a market [price], and what is happening now with the return of a degree of realism is basically that people feel that the prices of single-family residences are undergoing a fairly major decline All of the analytical work we've done suggests that this is a major factor in household purchases, especially durable goods outlays  Part of this process reflects not only the weakening in balance sheets, but it is also a significant element in the physical volume sense As Gary Stern was saying earlier, what we have here is another "inventory" problem, which we've been discussing pretty much all year--especially earlier in the year--and last year These inventories are not so much autos in the dealers' showrooms or unsold homes in the hands of developers, but too many cars in the garage and too many homes relative to the underlying demand In a sense, not having had an economic contraction in the 1980s, we just never had that adjustment Businesses and households picked up a much higher level of economic structures and of hard durable assets so that their balance sheets are all undergoing a fairly apparent adjustment process at this stage  What is clear about this whole process is that one would assume that there is some significant price deflation going on But I have been confronted with something, which I find really quite puzzling, in the differential behavior of the stock market and the bond market If in fact there is a significant decline in inflationary expectations, which one would assume in this sort of environment and which is clearly supported by the slow growth in money supply even if we make all of our various adjustments, one would expect that price/earnings ratios in the market would be high All of our history suggests that in a noninflationary environment price/ earnings ratios are significantly higher than in an inflationary environment Indeed, the level [of stock prices] today, calculated in a real rate of return sense, is fully consistent with the notion that the stock market is presuming that there is a disinflationary force out there and that a low discount rate on effective real earnings is appropriate But if this is the case, why are real rates in the long end of the market as high as they are? Or, more readily getting at the issue of trying to make that calculation, why are nominal rates as high as they are?  One possibility, which I suggested to some of you--and I must say it's unclear whether it's true or not--is that we all view the intermediation process as something that brings down the real rate of return of long-term instruments In fact, it is that phenomenon that creates the value-added in the intermediation process As a consequence, if you are focusing on what has clearly been a crippling of the intermediation process, and the symptoms of this are all over  -26-    11/5/91  the place, then the answer may be--and I'm not sure that this is a correct answer--that one of the reasons we have higher long-term real rates is that we are not getting the intermediation process that brings the whole basic rate structure down That should not affect the stock price relationships because that's external to the intermediation process But it is very clear that this issue is a major problem in trying to evaluate the extent of the disinflationary forces and how critical they really are Measured inflation is higher than is consistent with the hypothesis that what we are looking at is a gradual disinflationary process Part of this, however, may very well be the fact that there are significant increases in indirect business taxes that are showing up in the GNP accounts And this is partly the issue at the state and local government level It also reflects some of the excise taxes that were put in as part of the last budget agreement Indeed, take a look at the nonfinancial corporate business rates and remember that they break down prices into unit profits, unit capital consumption allowances, unit indirect taxes, and all that If you strip out the governmental actions that affect price levels--indirect business taxes and mainly subsidies, which usually come in in the other direction--then the rate of inflation that we are looking at through the second quarter in the GNP accounts shows that the total price increase for the quarter is 38 percent; excluding the direct taxes and subsidies, it is 31 percent Now, I don't want to make too much of that, but it may well be that one of the problems we have here is a measurement problem because it's fairly apparent that we could have a highly disinflationary process and if we stick a bunch of sales taxes on top, we get measured price indexes in the CPI that are fairly significant  The implication is that once we get beyond this particular period, the measured price inflation is likely to fall somewhat faster than is indicated in the Greenbook In fact, if I had a bet on it, I would take it The consequence of all of this is that we have seen, as everyone has mentioned, a very major crippling of financial intermediaries Obviously, the S&Ls are not lending; they're in trouble [as are] the commercial banks and insurance companies It's really interesting that the areas where we are seeing very strong lending are areas that are not touched by this, namely, the smaller finance companies, other than those involved in autos In fact, the most interesting statistics that were given to us yesterday in the Board staff presentation were the very dramatic increases--a 25 percent annual rate--in small finance company lending We're obviously seeing a tremendous amount of public offerings of equities and bonds If the loan demand is so weak, why is it so strong in certain areas? I think the answer has to be in part that we are dealing with a very weak financial intermediary system None of this is new We knew all of this two, three, four months ago We certainly knew it when the economy was coming out of the recession What we didn't know is how significant all of this was, as Mike Prell mentioned earlier There is no question that the economy was coming back in July and August It wasn't coming back in a huge surge, but [at a pace] consistent with the proposition that this overhang of disinflationary forces was not very potent In the last several weeks it is beginning to appear that that conclusion may not be correct; it can be a wholly false phenomenon I had to live through the summer of 1976 We all remember the "recession" of the summer of 1976; that's what got Jimmy Carter elected And in February 1977 there was this new "get the economy rolling" program which had to be pulled back  -27-    11/5/91  because the economy was at that point rolling too fast So, we have seen pauses before, and it is not inconceivable that this is exactly that The trouble is that we just do not know that this is going to happen And we have to think of policy in the context of a period which is very sensitive and one which in retrospect is going to look absolutely clear to all of our critics! What all of this suggests to me is that at this stage six-week intervals between contacts of this Committee are not particularly appropriate time lengths In discussing the issues of policy, I would suggest, irrespective of what we decide to do, that we really ought to meet--and I don't mean physically but in a telephone conference--to review what is going on  Having said that, in trying to balance the various forces as I see them, I think the risks of easing at this stage are very small I say that for two reasons One, if we were to move lower at this point, it would be in the context of the money supply showing a minus $4 billion when we publish it Thursday, leaving the growth of M2 for the year below the lower bound of the Committee's range If we look at the credit structure, it is very tough to envisage inflationary forces re-emerging anywhere near this level It's not interest rates that move inflation; it's finance And so far as finance is concerned, we just do not have inflationary forces running The rate of borrowing at this stage is the lowest it has been in the post World War II period It is just extremely difficult to believe that inflation will take hold unless one believes that inflation is not a monetary phenomenon And that, I suggest, just makes no sense whatever  Secondly, I think the evidence of our ability to move on the up side during an election year is fairly significant Earlier views were that the Fed could not move under those conditions I think what we were able to do in 1988 clearly indicates that there's a change in the tone of how money and politics run And, if it became necessary to turn around, I don't see any reason why we shouldn't be able to do that I certainly would say, and I hope, that the will of this Committee is clearly in that direction  So, I conclude from all of this that we ought to move lower Because of the uncertainties that are involved in the outlook, I would suggest that we only do 25 basis points Now, how we would handle that with respect to the discount rate is something that the Board of Governors will have to decide Having gone through all of that, I would suggest to you that we are in a very unusual period And while I hear this issue of a jump-start as being crucial, a jump-start is not the need of the economy because you can't jump-start the American economy It's like a battleship or an aircraft carrier, which has to turn We may at some point need an element that affects confidence I would suspect that it's conceivable, as Mike Prell pointed out, that we may have to do some ringing of the bell a lot more loudly at some point At the moment, however, I think it is very important that the Federal Reserve appear to be there because what has been going on out in the political world is the indication that nobody is minding the store We're the last game in town And to do something that suggests that we are there, that we are mindful of what is happening, and that we are up to date on everyone's concerns is a crucial factor that we have to keep in mind as the weeks go by We're going to find out one way or the other where this whole thing is going within a much shorter time than I think we suspect And in the interim, as I said  -28-    11/5/91  earlier, we have to keep in somewhat closer contact with Committee members and make judgments in real time  So, in summary, I would at this stage recommend half of alternative A, which I hope we would implement after the refunding is over, which suggests to me Friday Governor Angell   Well, with the alternative I suggested we don't need a telephone conference because the 1/4 point is contingent on a discount rate cut   I would suggest to you that the experience that we have had in the last couple of meetings indicates that this is a secure organization If that is false, then we have far more problems than we know If you feel more comfortable about it and you want to leave it asymmetric, I would recommend that we go asymmetric but my intention would be to move   Friday   Yes   I feel uncomfortable about it just because of that leak possibility Wayne, are you through?   President Parry   Well, may I make a suggestion?   Let's wait to see what conclusion we come to Then, let's put "when" on the table, if that is the conclusion, as a separate issue   Okay Bob Parry, are you finished?   President Forrestal   And would you be asymmetric?   President Syron   First Vice President Hendricks   President Keehn  -31-    11/5/91   President Boehne   President Stern   President Melzer   President McTeer   President Hoenig   Vice Chairman   The trouble is Which would you vote for?   President Black   Governor Kelley   Governor Mullins   Governor LaWare   I'm sorry, with the 25 basis points?   I've run out of people It's clear that there is a majority of the Committee for 25 basis points I count one, two, three, four, five; there is a majority for asymmetrical Let me ask you this Is anyone's vote dependent on "when?" Can we discuss that independently?   No, no, what I'm trying to say is whether or not the vote [unintelligible] we just took a survey What I conclude from marking down what everyone has said is that there is a  -34-    11/5/91  majority for both 25 basis points now and leaving asymmetric language The question I am asking is Was anybody's [decision] related to whether that would be done, if it were done, sooner or later? In other words, can we discuss that issue after we find out whether in fact that is the consensus of the Committee?   I'm merely asking whether these are independent events in a sense   Okay If that's the case, then I would ask that you read the directive  MR, BERNARD "In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to decrease somewhat the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions Depending upon progress toward price stability, trends in economic activity, the behavior of the monetary aggregates, and developments in foreign exchange and domestic financial markets, slightly greater reserve restraint might or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable in the intermeeting period The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with growth of M2 and M3 over the period from September through December at annual rates of about 3 and 1 percent, respectively"   Would you call the roll   Okay We now ought to have a discussion on the timing of this Do you want to start, Peter, on the issue of what would happen if we move 25 basis points Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday?   Before we get started with our agenda, I'd like to welcome our two new Board members to their first FOMC meeting I trust it will be both interesting and inspiring; I can pretty much guarantee the first   Would somebody like to move the minutes of the previous meeting on November 5th?  SPEAKER(?) So moved   Is there a second?   Without objection Gretchen Greene, would you bring us up to date on the Foreign Desk?   Are there questions for Ms Greene? If not, would somebody like to move the [amendment to the reciprocal currency arrangement with the Netherlands Bank] that was requested?   Is there a second?   Without objection Would you continue?   Are there any questions for Gretchen? Would somebody like to move [the ratification of the transactions in foreign currencies during the intermeeting period]?   Is there a second?  SPEAKER(?) Second    12/17/91   Without objection Thank you very much Peter Sternlight on the Domestic Desk   Questions for Peter?   Any other questions for Peter?   Now, what is interesting here is that there has been extensive literature on Operation Twist, and my recollection is that it's pretty mixed No one has been able to confirm that there is a significant supply-side effect occurring in that particular context On the other hand, there is also evidence, mainly in the recent period, that the Treasury rate is higher relative to private instruments than it otherwise would be, from which one assumes that there is a supply-side effect So, I would say that there is no really strong analytical evidence that confirms this one way or the other And what I find a little surprising is how strongly    12/17/91  the market responded to Brady's initial [remarks]; I think rates moved down 5 basis points at the long end of the market   Any further questions for Peter? If not, would somebody like to move to [ratify] the actions of the Desk since the last meeting?   Without objection We now move on to reviewing an issue that we have discussed previously You may recall that Governor Kelley raised a question with respect to the directive language relating to intermeeting instructions We've gone through a series of [discussions] on that and I thought it might be useful if Governor Kelley could bring us up to date on where we stand and perhaps make recommendations as to how we might finally resolve this question   I think that's pretty reasonable and I would support your point of view on this I think it's a clear improvement over where we stand   President Syron   President Black   Vice Chairman    12/17/91 -5-   Governor Angell   President Forrestal   Governor Mullins   Just a word to our two new members If you seriously believe that what you're hearing here is that people are falling in basically because other people are falling in, the same people will sell you the Brooklyn bridge! Governor LaWare   President Keehn   Okay Our next meeting is Tuesday and Wednesday, February 4th and 5th of next year  END OF MEETING  -38-       Does anybody else wish to make any comments? We will not have an official vote on this but will embody the obvious consensus in the directive when that is discussed and voted upon later in the meeting I thank Governor Kelley And I am impressed with the way he strong-armed everybody on the Committee into accepting his position! We now move to the economic situation and Messrs Prell and Truman will prevail   Thank you Questions for either of the gentlemen?   President Parry   President Syron   Any other questions? If not, can we start on our round table? Who would like to start off?   That wasn't bad; it's like a jump-start President Forrestal   President Parry   Incidentally, is there anything that is being done on the infestation to suggest that it can be eliminated at some point?   President Keehn   President Black   President Boehne   President Stern   Governor Angell   Bill Hendricks   President Syron   Governor Mullins   Governor LaWare   President Hoenig   Vice Chairman   President McTeer   How many are left?   Governor Kelley   That's on GNP?   Governor Lindsey   Governor Phillips   I'm informed that coffee is here  [Coffee break]   Thank you Questions for Don?   Any other questions for Don? If not, let me start off where Bob Black left off I, too, sense that there's more to what is going on in M2 and that its weakness is more relevant as it passes through to the economy than I would have been willing to believe six weeks or six months ago I think it's still obvious that a very big chunk of the M2 weakness is essentially structural; but to the extent that it is in fact taking disintermediation out of the system, it doesn't matter that it's structural; it's working there The only ways one can look at it as being non-relevant are either (1) through the displacement in mutual funds, which we've discussed; or (2) that in many respects the sharp declines in small CDs in the thrifts, for example, are not materially impacting home mortgage lending largely as a consequence of the extraordinary degree of securitization that has evolved in that market But having said all of that, we are still dealing with something that suggests that the normal relationships between M2 and the economy are at least in part holding, which also means algebraically that P* is still alive and well And if P* is alive and well, there is a good chance that the Greenbook may be overestimating the level of inflation And that, frankly, is my impression I do think that we're looking at success in bringing the inflation rate down a lot faster than we had any reason to contemplate When one considers that there has been an extraordinary rise in state and local indirect taxes--sales and other indirect taxes that have been embodied in the price level--I think we are getting a core inflation rate, ex-taxes, which probably is doing a good deal better than we might readily grasp  The economy is dead [in the water] It's not decelerating; we are not getting really major problems It is true that industrial production is down in November and that, on the basis of the weekly data we are looking at, it probably is going to be down in December We are clearly looking at some secondary inventory recession, which is not atypical of previous pauses in past economic recoveries What is really extraordinary about this particular period is what Jerry mentioned namely, that in the context of a period not really all that much different from a lot of pauses in the early stages of a recovery, we have had such a dramatic drop in consumer confidence that one would presume that something fundamental has really struck us We are all puzzling about it and, as Jerry pointed out, no one really knows exactly what happened But let me throw on the table a possible hypothesis based on an additional piece of evidence A very interesting survey came out last week as a Wall Street Journal/NBC poll It indicated that the average consumer or voter--depending on how you wish to look at it--perceived that the economy was terribly important but that what should be done was not tax cuts for themselves, or middle income income tax cuts, but tax cuts for business Even the capital gains tax cut got the majority vote in that context What clearly came through, as best I could see, is this really very profound fear of the long-term economic outlook What has  -29-    12/17/91  happened, I suspect, is that while the economy was coming back from the recession, it led to a willingness on the part of the average consumer to say essentially that it's coming back and that's okay But as soon as the balance sheet pressures put the wringer on this recovery, I think there was an abrupt reconfirmation of their concerns about whether the long term is really out there They observed increasingly that they are living in houses that are nowhere near the quality of those that their parents lived in, even though their parents may not have had the education or any of a number of other [advantages] they have had And they are worried about the future They ask Where is it all going? This situation creates a very profound fear  I must say that I find the fact that the savings rate is as low as it is in this particular context, frankly, slightly surprising I think there's a good chance that it may move up, which leads to a conclusion that is an odd one in the sense that the economy isn't all that far down You can't account for the consumer psychology with the unemployment rate where it is But far more importantly you cannot account for the psychology with the layoff rate The layoff rate is basically not fundamentally different from what it was in other years in the '80s, not even during the recessions And initial claims, adjusted for the [number] of those in the labor force, also are not showing anything really extreme Therefore, something different is basically going on It suggests that if this type of psychology eases, it won't be all that difficult for a modest recovery to resurface And since it is not all that far from the top of a recovery, the economy can probably come back pretty much in line with the Greenbook forecast But, as John LaWare points out, there is something really fundamental involved here, psychologically And it's going to be difficult to break this general attitude easily, although I do think that the balance sheet problems are probably now starting to ease because the market itself is creating a very significant countervailing force We now have record equity issuance, which is de-leveraging the system We have a significant volume of public offerings of debt securities, a significant part of which are being used to fund short-term liabilities, and that is taking off some of the pressure Lower interest rates, as Don mentioned, are having an important impact on reducing debt service burdens The market's courier system is working And unless it cracks open, it probably will proceed in that way and we will look back at this period a year from now and say that we were unduly concerned Frankly, that's my best expectation Indeed, I'm saying that I think the Greenbook forecast is probably right  As a consequence, as far as policy is concerned, my reading in this context is that the majority of the Committee favors some further downward adjustment in the rate structure If that is in fact what the Committee chooses to do, that suggests that the Board will have to determine how the discount rate should be structured to get the maximum effect of the easing, especially in the context of this psychology What I would recommend for today is that we vote to go asymmetric toward ease with a very strong presumption that unless improvements in the economy become evident rather quickly or unless we get significant evidence of a pickup in M2 in the period immediately ahead, it would be expected that the Desk would be requested to move lower So, I would recommend an asymmetric directive, which I would characterize as hard asymmetric; the balance of the evidence is going  -30-    12/17/91  to have to be that the economy is really showing surprising signs of strength [to preclude an easing move] There is a possibility that things that have been extremely dull could become very buoyant very quickly; were that to happen, I think we would want to stand pat But if that doesn't happen, the meaning of what I suggest is that we would move lower Governor Mullins   President Syron   President Hoenig   Vice Chairman   I might say parenthetically that I presume it would be the desire of this Committee to move with due dispatch should that consideration arise That has been the [stated position] of this Committee previously But it's important for us to be aware that it may be necessary to preserve what has been really an extraordinary success to date on inflation I must say, looking back, that I think we've had some lucky things happen to us One of them is that our policy has been able to rein in inflation at a much more rapid pace than we had contemplated earlier And it would be a shame if we were to let that get away President Forrestal   Yes Let me put it this way If it turns out to be more than that, the implication is that other things are going on and it would be appropriate under those conditions to have a telephone conference   President Melzer   President Black   Mr Hendricks   Don is a little concerned that maybe what I said wasn't clear I'm saying that my recommendation is to do nothing now but to have an asymmetric directive I don't think that has been--   Oh no, I'm sorry   "B" asymmetric   Yes I'm sorry if there was any confusion I'm recommending "B" asymmetric   No, apparently, [I wasn't clear] I'm sorry about that   President Parry   Governor Kelley   President Stern   President Boehne   Governor Angell   Many times President McTeer   President Keehn   Governor LaWare   Governor Lindsey   Governor Phillips   Tom, did I miss you?   Okay   No, I heard a long discussion but I didn't remember how you actually came out   Okay As I read it, the proposal on the table will be "B" asymmetric toward ease with the new language that Governor Kelley drafted earlier I'd like Norm to read it   Essentially, what I have in mind is that if events do not change and if the quality of the outlook remains unaltered from where we sense it today, additional ease would be appropriate   Well, obviously we're dealing here with a time-frame encompassing the period immediately ahead; we can always have another meeting   I don't want to be [too precise] I couldn't disagree with you, but I'd hesitate to phrase it that concretely   Call the roll   I wanted to welcome Jerry Jordan to his first meeting of the FOMC, but I understand that he attended his first meeting in August 1969 So, I have decided we'd just say "Hello, welcome back" and leave it at that! The first item on the agenda is always, of course, the approval of the minutes, and I would seek a motion  SPEAKER(?) So move   Is there a second?  SPEAKER(?) Second   Without objection The next item on the agenda is the report on foreign currency operations, and I'll call on Bill McDonough   Are there any questions for Mr McDonough?   Go ahead   Any other questions for Mr McDonough?   I think we ought to have that topic for a luncheon discussion at some point We have periodically done precisely what you're suggesting, but it's probably worthwhile to redo it every once in a while to make certain that we're all still in the same boat   No, I think the president is requesting the answer to the age-old question Does it work? And this is still a dubious proposition about which studies go back and forth I think the great value of the presentation a couple of years ago that Ted was mentioning was that it really went through the literature and the various studies which we have been engaged in and endeavored to conclude in what areas such intervention could be productive and have beneficial effects and in what areas it seemed unlikely to do so   Well, let's first double check on whether there were any other questions   Any further questions? If not, is there any objection to Mr McDonough's request for advance clearance for the DM sale? Finally, would you like to make that motion [again], Wayne?   I won't tell you what motion you made!   Is there a second?  SPEAKER(?) Second   Without objection As a somewhat related issue, we have an exchange of letters with the Treasury Department I call upon Ted Truman to elaborate on the subject matter   Any questions for Ted? If not, let's move on to the Domestic Desk, Mr Sternlight   Questions for Mr Sternlight?    3/31/92   Further questions?   Further questions? If not, would somebody like to move to ratify the transactions since the February meeting?   Without objection Mr Sternlight still has the floor with respect to the memorandum that he sent out a couple of weeks ago   Questions or comments?    3/31/92   Hold on a second President Black was first   President Melzer   I think the question, however, is Do we slow the rate of decline in the average maturity of the portfolio, do we stabilize it, or do we defend against a rise? And despite the $11 billion in Treasury coupon absorption last year, the average maturity continued to fall The question is Do we want to let it continue to fall or to stabilize it? I would be surprised if the markets reacted negatively to our taking actions that tended to stabilize or just slow the rate of decline toward ever shorter maturities in our portfolio I think the argument is that if we switch from [slowing the] decline to a rise, that could very easily turn out to be a counterproductive activity on our part But I gather from what Peter's memorandum is suggesting that the issue is essentially [whether] to slow the decline   The purpose then was to increase the liquidity of the portfolio for fear that it might not have been adequate in the event of some really significant problems with some of the larger banks?   I don't think Peter is recommending that we--   Governor Mullins   Vice Chairman   Okay Thank you very much, everyone Our next meeting is on May the 19th  END OF MEETING  -40-       Any further comment or questions? I gather from that that there is a general acceptance of the philosophy and thrust of Mr Sternlight's memorandum with respect to this issue If that is the case, I think we can move on to the economic situation and call on Messrs Prell and Truman   Questions for either gentleman?   President Parry   President Syron   President Stern   Further questions? If not, would somebody like to start our Committee discussion? [Does the silence mean the answer to] that is a no?   I think Bob Parry signaled me first   President Forrestal   President Keehn   President Black  -15-    3/31/92   President McTeer   President Syron   President Boehne   President Hoenig  -18-    3/31/92   President Stern   President Melzer   Vice Chairman   I think there's a lot of whistling in the dark there, too   Firming, not stable?   As recommended by a number of our colleagues!   Governor Angell   President Jordan   Governor Mullins   Governor Kelley   Governor LaWare   Governor Lindsey   Governor Phillips   Thank you We've run a little long and as a consequence I've a note from Norm which says that the coffee is cooling The bad news is that he gave that note to me ten minutes ago! Let's find our whether or not it's iced coffee  [Coffee break]   Mr Kohn   It seems as though we started on a high note but ended on a low one! [Laughter]   Let me start off in the vein these data are basically addressing I think we're all aware that by any of the measures we use for physical slack--that is, with respect to the GDP potential--the economy is very loose and has very considerable areas for improvement shall I say without any [price] pressures being evident as a consequence I'm not sure that that is in fact the case if one defines capacity in a financial sense The way I would read that as a concern is to reiterate some of the notions that several around the table have mentioned this morning most specifically, the rise in long-term rates in the context of what is really a relatively mild improvement in economic expectations We're all aware that gross private savings is not a particularly large number and we're also aware that the Federal government with its extremely heavy demands is absorbing a very large preemptive part of that If the economy were rising fairly sharply, one would assume that the net available savings after the government takes its preemptive [share] would be modest and that the demand would squeeze against a small base and drive interest rates fairly significantly higher What we are looking at is something which feels that way but it is hard to make the case, even with the optimism that is emerging here, that we're looking at a very strong surge in activity So, I conclude, granted with very little evidence, that the base of private savings off which we are running is inordinately low and that very small pressures are creating interest rate responses that could essentially act, for reasons we've all discussed, to choke off the recovery  The financial structure also has some of these characteristics in the sense that we are aware that capital restraints have made the flexibility of intermediation less than we would otherwise like it to be And if we are running into a net savings problem and an intermediation problem, which are obviously related, we essentially are saying that we are running up against some financial capacity problems I don't know whether or not one could ascribe the most recent weakness in M2 to this phenomenon Obviously, one can make the case, but I think it's premature to argue that these numbers mean all that much We're not really clear as to the structure of M2 and what causes it; and even though we ran into a problem last year, it is not clear in retrospect how significant that impact was So, I think we're treading ground at this point in areas for which we have no really hard evidence but a number of concerns that are suggestive of the possibility that indeed we might run into another stone wall and find that we're having difficulty reaching the [economy] as it recovers  If that occurs, we could very readily get a pulling back of capital investment plans And we could get some cumulative weakening [in the growth of economic activity], somewhat more than we're looking at here That, [coupled with] the external situation--not only Japan but some questions about Europe--raises some serious questions about the future in the context in which all of the hard evidence we're looking at today is really quite good It may well be that this is essentially a short-term housing development, which is driving appliance sales, auto sales, and the like There seems to be more in it There seems to be a pickup of profit margins; there seems to be a broader general view of some improvememt in the future; and capital goods expenditures do seem to be picking up And even though we may be running into a seasonal problem in the sense that six straight winters, I think, of above normal temperatures may be altering the  -31-    3/31/92  seasonal adjustment factors, it's conceivable that the March data, seasonally adjusted, are going to look weaker than one would ordinarily expect Then, we could get this [economy] turning very readily  At the moment, I think there is no question that monetary policy should stay on hold However, in view of the various developments that are occurring, it is probably premature to switch from asymmetric toward ease to symmetric Were it not for the financial factors that we're looking at, I would say this is a classic symmetric case But until we get beyond the concerns about the behavior of the financial markets, which we do not fundamentally understand, it strikes me that we should stay asymmetric if for no other reason than that the probability we would wish to tighten over the next six weeks seems rather remote And, having had an asymmetric toward ease directive in the last eight weeks and finding no need to alter policy, I would hope that we may be able to get through the next six weeks in the same stance So, while I must say I would have no difficulty accepting symmetrical language with alternative B, I would much prefer to see us stay with the asymmetric language until we get beyond this period of uncertainties about what all of these data really mean I'd be curious to get people's concerns, responses, and views Who would like to start off? President Syron   Governor Angell   I need to say one additional thing I realize we don't put a great deal of moment in the P* calculations, but we are below trend now in [that calculation] In other words, we have brought the money supply numbers down to a point which is certainly consistent with a noninflationary environment If anything, we've overshot the mark So, we actually have some room to respond to those who are concerned abroad that we would create an engine of inflation because I think--this is the wrong phrase, but--we have money in the bank The truth of the matter is, it's the sign that's negative   No, that's a very important point, I think that's true President Melzer   That's the argument for not releasing the directive Indeed, I think it would be a mistake for us to release it   Well, I meant if we had to release it today I'm not sure I personally would recommend going asymmetric   Vice Chairman   President Black   I thought I did not disinherit it In fact, I thought I was stipulating that I thought it was indicating that we had a little slack to accelerate M2 without violating our price stability goals   No, frankly, I think it's working   President Parry   Governor LaWare   President Stern  -35-    3/31/92   President Hoenig   Governor Kelley  MR KELLEY Mr Chairman, I'm not quite as agile as some of my colleagues I came in prepared to support symmetric and I'm still there! To me the risks have become symmetric and that suggests a symmetric directive I concur with you that an intermeeting change this time around is fairly unlikely; hopefully that's true That also suggests symmetric And generally, I think [asymmetric] is intended to be used when there's a meaningful expectation that there will be a move in a certain direction--a reasonable confidence that that will occur--and I don't see that here All of that having been said, I do believe that if there should be an occasion to change policy between meetings here, it is far more likely to be on the easing than the tightening side Also I believe that if we do get a downside surprise, the consequences would be quite serious and should be    3/31/92  guarded against So, for those reasons I would prefer symmetric but can accept asymmetric   President Boehne  BOEHNE Well, I came here supporting "B" asymmetric and I am pleased   Governor Mullins   I'm surprised that you don't   President Keehn   President Forrestal   President McTeer   Governor Lindsey   Governor Phillips   President Jordan   The consensus as I hear it is to support the last directive So, if the Secretary would read it for us--   Yes, I think that is right because the concerns that we have are [that] it will slip down; and if we say we're accepting that, then there's no meaning to having it consistent   If it has any meaning as a goal, we should have what you originally had in it   That would be my inclination Is there general agreement on that?  -39-    3/31/92   We have to be careful about these numbers because they are extraordinary numbers   Call the roll   Good morning, everyone Would somebody like to start us off by approving the minutes?  SPEAKER(?) So move   Without objection Bill McDonough, would you start off please?   I think it's apparent that we're moving in the direction that the Committee very strongly urged in the last year or two My own personal impression is that we should move in the direction in which [Bundesbank Vice President] Tietmeyer is suggesting with regard to selling US holdings of marks The second question that you raised, namely the balance of what we have in our portfolio, is really quite important to address because I get the impression-- indeed, I'm sure--that no coherent mechanism was employed in accumulating these foreign balances in a manner that was in any way related to what was a rational portfolio for long-term intervention purposes Now that we're finally getting to the point where we're slimming down toward a reasonable aggregative level, it's probably wise to put back on the table what in fact should be the long-term-- both strategic and tactical--position of the Foreign Desk And I think it might be useful to have some recommendations coming from you in that regard   I open up the meeting to questions with the specific hope that each member will use the occasion to indicate whether he or she is still on board with the position that we have taken to streamline significantly the aggregative holdings that we had as of a year or two ago Who would like to start off?   Does anybody have any questions?   We still have $20 billion DM   Well, I think we still have a very large block of holdings   Caution noted   Does anybody else want to express an opinion or raise a question?   If there are no further comments, I believe the content of what I just heard indicates that Bill ought to go ahead and see whether or not he can formulate the appropriate longer-term strategy I guess the next meeting would not be an inappropriate time to resurface this If there are no further    5/19/92  questions, I'll take a motion on ratifying--no, we don't have to ratify anything Let's move on to the Domestic Desk, Peter   Questions for Peter?   Any further questions for Peter or Jerry?   If there are no further questions, I will entertain a motion to ratify the actions of the Domestic Desk since the March meeting  SPEAKER(?) So move   Is there a second?    5/19/92  SPEAKER(?) Second   Without objection   Sure, go ahead   Thank you very much Our next meeting will be a two-day meeting, June 30th and July 1  END OF MEETING  -47-       Is there any objection? We'll assume the vote is in the affirmative Let's move on to the economic discussion   Questions for Mr Prell?   President Black   Governor Lindsey   Sure, go ahead   President Syron   Governor Angell   There's another way to come at this, which yields much the same results, in the sense that we've got this long-term trend, the P*, tracking the general price level The existing pattern of P* at this stage is at virtually zero if not a negative price level If one is going to presume on the basis of the data that we are seeing a resistance to coming down under the 3 percent level or even that it is somewhat off the zero base, then the question essentially is whether we are incorrectly measuring [M2] in the same context Namely, if M2 is artificially deflated and [that] created this particular zero [or slight] decline, we have the wrong M2; we have the wrong proxy for money If we had the right proxy for money, it would be growing much faster than the numbers we are looking at; it would be much closer to the opportunity cost even in the context that Jerry Jordan is raising the issue It would also mean that P* is back on track with exactly where the equation numbers are So, it seems as though the financial system in a general way is more in line with the real economic system, with the outlier essentially being M2 If we alter M2 everything else falls into place It's a disturbing consideration, but it sort of leads to the conclusion that all of our theoretical judgments with respect to the effect of the RTC on M2 have not been exactly correct and that there is a significant element of technical erosion in the data as a consequence of the liquidation of the small CDs and the thrifts There has been a fairly significant reduction in the thrift area without a spillover--as we all would have expected with the eliminations of the thrifts--from the thrifts into the commercial banks and other depository institutions Governor LaWare   Any further questions? If not, let's move on to the Committee discussion Let me make a request to those of you who have any insights into the commercial real estate area to put them on the table Very specifically, I think it would be useful to know if there are any indications of a pickup in commercial real estate transactions, [because] what we have been looking at is a decline in offerings and appraisals And until we see the bids coming in, we will be getting no indication of any stability Obviously, as the bids begin to move in, that will engender transactions and it may be a far clearer signal that we're getting closer to the bottom of [the decline in that sector] than any rather dubious price index for commercial real estate So, for those of you who have any sense of this, it would be useful for the Committee to get a better view of an area that has been crucial to us and for which our data sources have been less than correct Who would like to start off? Jerry   Jerry, would you like to comment on your general view on the District while you have the floor?   President Black   She's holding until maturity?   President Parry   President Forrestal   President Keehn   President Boehne   President McTeer   President Hoenig   President Melzer   Governor LaWare   President Syron   How did you answer the question?   Vice Chairman   Governor Mullins   Governor Kelley   Governor Lindsey   Governor Phillips  MSPHILLIPS Thank you I think I'm bringing up the tail end again and I'll keep my comments short It seems that since I've been here we've been on the cusp of a recovery, trying to get a recovery going Certainly the signs on the real side are more positive this time; certainly that's what we've heard this morning I find myself being concerned about and questioning its strength and its sustainability Some of the sources of strength that we've been pointing to the last couple of months--housing and exports--seem to be fading a bit And I think it's interesting that no one has really talked today about some of the problems in the economy that we seem to have forgotten about The first one that I'd point to is the federal deficit, which I think is a continuing drag on the economy We have talked about the state and local government shortfalls, and I've seen  -32-    5/19/92  a few tax increases coming out of some states but not a lot So, I think we're going to continue to see that as a drag on the economy  The major area of concern that I would point to--and I would magnify perhaps Dick Syron's [remark] with respect to its potential-- is consumer confidence, which seems to me to be very much tied into the labor market situation I think the 72 percent unemployment rate perhaps understates some of the weakness in the labor market because of the pervasiveness of unemployment through a variety of occupations and the restructuring that is going on in industry This whole concept of underemployment and downward mobility is continuing to lengthen the period of time it's going to take us to get a real recovery going Certainly, on the money and credit aggregates, which we've talked about so I won't go into it, I'd agree with Larry I don't think we ought to abandon M2; we ought to look to see what it's saying at least in part On inflation, I am concerned that we're still seeing a bit higher inflation than we'd like I would have to say, however, that we need to expand our research on what zero inflation is I'm beginning to wonder if we're not getting closer to it than the traditional CPI measure or even the deflator would imply On balance and in sum, I'm pleased that we're making some progress but the risk of another stall is certainly in the realm of possibilities So, I think we should be alert to weakness on the real side   Not only did that note about the coffee say that the note was an hour and a half late, but I think the coffee probably arrived an hour and a half before the note!  SPEAKER(?) You're right!   With that, I would like to call upon Mr Kohn   Any questions for Mr Kohn?  -33-    5/19/92   I think there is another problem with that in the sense that if we introduce a longer-term time frame for money supply where it tends to override the targets that we came out with at the beginning of the year, what we're in danger of doing is having two forecasts It's essentially the targets on the one hand and a specific one on the other In general that might be fine if the second forecast is close to the middle of [the target range]; but if it is not, we're raising an interesting question about what it is we're trying to do It's almost as though we're trying to find a degree of accuracy that I think isn't even remotely possible I would be more inclined to the argument that we drop that forecast than extend it too far because our ability to forecast is awful   I would prefer to drop it I have not given it any thought until this minute, but I ask What does it do for us? What would happen if we were to drop it?   Could you draft us a memorandum? Could you circulate to the Committee the pros and the cons?   Include President Forrestal's recommendation That ought to be addressed   There are a lot of anachronisms sitting in our directive Every time I read it I'm waiting for somebody somewhere to write a fun piece in some newspaper about the Federal Reserve directive! I hope Bill Saffire of The New York Times doesn't get hold of that!   Either one of them!   Yes   That's a mean thing to say!   Any other questions for Don?   President Jordan   President Stern   President Keehn   Governor Lindsey   Any other questions for Don?   Further questions? If not, why don't I get started Listening to this general conversation, it creates a somewhat better outlook than I was perceiving as I walked into the room--not a great deal better, but enough to be somewhat noticeable The general consensus around here, which is clearly supported by the data, is that the economy is moving forward on a fairly broad front but that nothing seems to be moving very quickly There doesn't seem to be significant, outsized momentum in any sector, but it does seem to be gradual and pervasive across a fairly broad [spectrum]  The crucial question, however, is how fast [the expansion in the economy] really is I think the issue that Mike Prell raised with respect to the first-quarter GNP problems is a clear indication that there is something peculiar in our data system There may be something to the argument that the payroll series could be more deficient this time than usual The general argument that we all can make with respect to month-by-month changes in employment is that the  -38-    5/19/92  standard error of the employment change in the household series is very high It isn't all that high if you take a time frame of four, five, six, or seven months, average two or three months on one end and two or three months on the other, and calculate the standard error of that change; it's obviously very substantially lower So, it's hard to believe that with a sample of 60,000 [in the household series], with some historical parallelism to the payroll series, that the argument has to be that the payroll series is really being representative and that the man-hour data that are implicit in it are the best indicator for industrial production because, remember, industrial production is weaker than the GDP Obviously, if we decided that the household payroll series was accurate and built up the gross domestic product side with those data, then the statistical discrepancy, which is the problem with the first quarter, would narrow very considerably And, obviously, what you would get is a significant rise in the saving rate in the first quarter which, of course, is where the discrepancy change gets offset in the accounts When you look at that, you ask if it is possible that the economy is really growing at 3-1/2 to 4 percent [and] that we have a saving rate which suggests that there is actually room for consumption to move faster than income; that is sort of a scenario that suggests there is more buoyancy in this outlook than the first-quarter data show The truth of the matter is that I'm not sure anyone can judge that The anecdotal evidence raises questions as to whether the economy has anywhere near that type of momentum Even though the orders data in manufacturing look somewhat better, they are not consistent with the type of significant rise in employment in manufacturing that one must presume would be part of the acceleration in household employment of the size or order of magnitude that we've been seeing in recent months I conclude that we're probably doing somewhat better in employment than the payroll series [indicates] but far short of the household series [increase] in that the economy in the first quarter was fairly good  The only question I would have with it is whether it is too much too soon in the sense that rather than going into the second quarter with inventory liquidation, we're going in with very modest liquidation and with upside momentum If one looks at the data as they are materializing with respect to auto sales, starts, and the like, they don't suggest a really robust second quarter  It also looks as though we are financing this recovery very heavily internally If you look at the household sector, for example, there's very little borrowing That essentially means that both gross asset expansion and gross liability expansion are very significantly below normal That is another way of saying that M2, which is on the household asset side, is exceptionally slow and that the slow borrowing, with everyone financing internally, is an element of risk aversion Clearly, that has also been the case, although I suspect to an increasingly lesser extent in the corporate sector where one must presume, if these numbers are correct, that a very significant increase in cash flow is going on and that even though we have some fairly heavy borrowing externally a very large amount of financing with internal funds is going on pretty much as usual  So, this is in a way an odd sort of recovery, one that we've discussed at length in connection with the question of balance sheet repair, which is another way of saying that a significant amount of  -39-    5/19/92  cash flow is going to pay off debt rather than going to the consumption of goods and services or investment The outlook does not seem to have changed significantly from the last time we were here when there appeared to be some form of financial ceiling on the economy basically represented by the balance sheet pressures and essentially reflected in the fact that every time the economy seems to pick up, long-term interest rates seem to go up What we have learned apparently is that that is having an effect on a number of areas, very specifically on the housing area, which leads me to conclude--pretty much as I have been concluding since the beginning of the year--that the crucial statistic in the outlook is nominal long-term interest rates To the extent that they have a significant effect in the housing market and the turnover of mortgages, refinancing, they have been a critical factor in the general forward thrust of the economy  I think we're also learning that the inclination at the long end of the market for rates to move lower with lower federal funds rates is increasingly dubious While I must say that I can't give a persuasive analytical argument at this particular stage, I nonetheless would be willing to put money on the table that moving the fed funds rate lower right now would not bring a lower long-term bond yield However, that may not continue to be the case As a consequence of that, I would be disinclined to try to move the funds rate lower now, but if it turns out that at some point it begins to look as though we might be able to prod the long-term rate lower were we to move the funds rate, I personally would be more inclined in that direction Frankly, my overall view is that we are probably more likely as a Committee to be moving to lower rates than to higher rates in the next several months The next move is more likely to be down than up, but I don't think the odds are skewed enough in that direction to argue in favor of an asymmetric directive I must admit that I don't have any strong feelings personally either way I would be somewhat inclined toward symmetry if for no other reason than that in listening to the tone of the individual District discussions, things are somewhat better than I would have suspected; but I could live with an asymmetric directive In either case, I would argue that we should adopt alternative B I would prefer symmetric but could very easily go with asymmetric if that's what the Committee wants President Parry   Governor Angell   President Forrestal   Governor Kelley   Governor Lindsey   I don't have a clue!   Let me say this I will be disinclined, frankly, to support moving lower unless we see some real signs that this [recovery] is starting to stall out And I'd need a little more than just a vague notion; I'd need a set of data suggesting a cumulative process that in my judgment probably would incline this Committee toward moving lower even from a symmetric directive But I would be a little cautious if we kept seeing a steady economic recovery and M2 looked awfully weak I would conclude from that that we have more of a problem with M2 than we have with the economy But if we saw both beginning to look rather shabby, then I think it would be incumbent on us to move lower I would also say that should we get a change in the economic environment, it would be appropriate for us to have a telephone conference and discuss it because, if there is a real change in the economic environment, the group around this table collectively would have a good sense of that If there seemed to be some evidence that this recovery was faltering and it were not confirmed in the individual Districts, I would question the data So, even though I'm saying we should keep our options open, I do think we ought to be cautious about moving too quickly unless the evidence really begins to mount This is a very unusual set of circumstances and a type of period where we could make the kind of mistakes that  -41-    5/19/92  monetary policy often makes at the bottom of the cycle I don't know whether that's "would/would" or "might/might"   President Stern   Banks have disappeared; depository institutions have disappeared The way we measure some or most of M2 almost surely--   It's an interesting question When does this long-term trend we are all forecasting begin to affect the M2 data?   Since you have the floor, Governor LaWare, why don't you stay with it  -42-    5/19/92   President Jordan   President Keehn   President Melzer   President Boehne   President McTeer   President Black   The reason for it, obviously, is that the original procedure would have given us an odd statement President Syron   Governor Mullins   President Hoenig   Vice Chairman   I know what the solution to that is Give the job to Don Kohn to get a new set of Ms! Although I will say this Unless it's very close by, that would certainly indicate that M2 is really very far off target I was quite sympathetic with President Hoenig's remarks about how we were talking about M2 earlier   In the last six weeks to two months I have been somewhat dismayed by what has been happening to M2 on the grounds that it has been a very useful indicator for us And I am increasingly coming to the conclusion that something is wrong with the measure As I indicated before, whenever you get a measure [that previously] explained several different things like the P*/price relationship, the income/velocity relationship, the relationship of balance sheets, and all those things [the issue is whether] you could just draw a new line and everything would fall back into place It  -45-    5/19/92  really raises a question as to whether it's the single [measure] that's out of line with everything else   Finally, Governor Phillips   I had put down that your preference is asymmetric   I tried to get a view of the Committee, and it's very clearly heavily asymmetric toward symmetric [Laughter] Let me say this I think that Don's recommendation with respect to the alternate sentence really makes a good deal of sense Unless I hear an objection--   The very bottom of page 15   Does anybody have any objections to the insertion of Don's recommended language?   We have not gotten there yet We're on the very last sentence, the bracketed sentence   Well, that's a good point   Agreed without objection Will the Secretary read the language?   Would you call the roll?   Is there a second?  SPEAKER(?) Second   Without objection Thank you very much Let's now move on to Bill McDonough and the foreign currency operations   Questions for Mr McDonough?   President Forrestal   President Parry   Go ahead   Any further questions?   Let me add to the general discussion here and broaden it to evaluate the question and the implications of    8/18/92  what sterilized intervention does and does not do I think we're all pretty much aware that there is very little intervention can do in and of itself to affect the average of any exchange rate over a particular period of time But the other side of that issue is not that we are going to get a stable set of bilateral currencies without any intervention at all because we're also aware that we've seen significant bubbles in exchange rates We have seen what amounts to, in certain cases, panic selling and clear issues of disorderly markets In principle, the same arguments [apply to] not intervening, on the logic that is implicit in the portfolio adjustment process with respect to sterilized intervention; the other side of that issue is that on occasion [the markets] clearly break down And the evidence does suggest that when that occurs we in fact can affect the market One has to ask how it is possible for intervention even of $1 billion to move the dollar/mark relationship by four pfennigs Clearly, that's not a fundamental issue The question is How in the world did that exchange rate for that particular period of time get that far down and be changed by a very small amount of intervention minutes later? The same argument that one employs to evaluate that is the argument that markets feed on themselves, get out of hand, and sometimes create some degree of instability Nobody in this Committee that I have spoken to is of the view that intervention has any long- term consequences But I do think the evidence is quite strong that it does on occasion have short-term consequences I don't know what to make of it, but the comments within the market in the last two or three days--and I heard it on the radio this morning--are that the expectation that central banks might intervene has stabilized the currency Now, I don't know whether that's true or false, but that type of market chatter which essentially is saying "Don't get locked into a position; be careful because you might get hit by the central banks" does tend to create a level of uncertainty in the market that is helpful Some uncertainty is not; I would suspect that this is  Now, I don't know in any individual instance whether [intervention] is useful or not I think that Bill is right That in this particular case we would now be sitting, at least for a while, with a much weaker dollar with spillover effects on dollar-denominated assets Would that correct itself? Probably But we are aware that there have been occasions in which disorderly markets crack the structure of the underlying base of the market and the market unfolds That's what happened when the stock market broke in October 1987; the whole structure just broke down underneath That wasn't a fundamental change--fundamental in the sense that there were external events So, while it's terribly important that we stay away from  if we can find times when the market is perceived to be disorderly, [intervention may be useful] And I would even define a disorderly market as one in which the shorts have become excessive--or longs, depending upon which side of the market it is A true test as to whether or not the intervention worked or not is whether those people believe that they were wrong In that case the markets will adjust There's no science to this; I agree with Bill The other day when the market was expecting us to intervene and it was self-evident that no matter what we did we could not succeed, we stayed out and I think that was wise Were we to go back and intervene within the next two or three days, I think we would fail It's only when the market begins to perceive that we're not going to be there that I think we have a shot at it So, it's a tricky issue    8/18/92  only conditions under which [intervention] can be effective--then a single isolated move probably requires marginal reinforcement at a later date or at some point merely to indicate that there is no pattern which is easy to [discern] If we had done only the [first intervention operation] and then stopped completely, I'm not sure that we would have gotten the effects, [in terms of introducing a] degree of uncertainty about when central banks move I was not one who believed at the time that the second intervention would accomplish very much other than what I just said I was frankly surprised when in fact it did work immediately I thought it would have a very mild effect; but in my judgment the point was that it would be useful merely to have that action there For the same reason, I think it would be a terrible mistake to try to [intervene] now, because I think the markets are expecting us to do so If we were to do it, it wouldn't have any effect And it then becomes a tar baby to the market; we can't get ourselves out of it Governor Angell   President McTeer   This issue is pretty clear legally The President of the United States and through him the Secretary of the Treasury--who if push came to shove statutorily could demand that we do certain things, not necessarily with our portfolio but on their behalf--is in charge There's an ambiguity in the law with respect to whether we could act independently I suspect that we could find a lawyer in this city who would say that we could buy deutschemarks while the Treasury is selling them The operations have evolved over the years as a joint venture between the Treasury and the Federal Open Market Committee Sometimes it has worked well; sometimes it has worked less than well But in general the issue has very rarely come to a confrontation where we took a hard line position and the Treasury took a hard line position and there was no agreement, at least in my experience Now, since Jerry [Corrigan] was about to talk in any event--and he has a longer experience in this than I do--I was curious to get his recollection on this issue   Let's hear from President Black and then shut this [discussion] down for now This is the type of subject that we can [return to] if we like in our general planning sessions over the next couple of days Even though it's not on the agenda, I'm sure it could very well surface It is an important issue and I think we're coming to at least a temporary close on this question I think it would be useful for us to go on after President Black has had his say   Well, I think there is an ambiguity involved The President's power comes from his Constitutional authority in international relationships   So, there's no question that there is a legal ambiguity surrounding this whole issue, which has never been pushed to fruition I remember we reviewed this in considerable  -10-    8/18/92  detail a few years ago; and the tortured logic of some of the stuff that I saw was really [unintelligible] The history of this issue is really bizarre   Not with our own portfolio, but they certainly--   Would somebody like to move to ratify the actions of the Desk since the last meeting?   Without objection   Let's move on to Peter Sternlight's report   Thank you Questions for Peter? If not, would somebody like to move to ratify the actions of the Desk since the last meeting?    Okay, thank you very much We will adjourn for lunch  END OF MEETING  -44-       Without objection They let you off the hook since this is a celebration of your last meeting! We now move on to Messrs Prell and Truman   Are there questions for either gentleman?   Governor Lindsey   Productivity is just doing too well!   President Stern   Is there a tendency that that 1 percent might be higher?   We are? [Laughter]   President Jordan   Any further questions for these gentlemen? If not, who would like to start our tour de table? [President Boehne]   President Parry   What is the latest status of these vouchers or other IOUs that the state government is handing out?   If the state treasurer were smart, he wouldn't accept them; it's lousy paper! [Laughter]   President Keehn   President Forrestal   President Syron   President Hoenig   President Black   President McTeer   President Stern   President Melzer   Governor LaWare   Governor Kelley   President Jordan   Vice Chairman   Governor Mullins   Governor Phillips   Governor Lindsey   Governor Angell   Mr Kohn   I think it would be helpful at this stage to get a judgment of the Committee on this particular point Do you want to say anything in defense of any of your proposals for the last sentence of the operational paragraph?   Jerry Jordan   Governor Angell   President Melzer   Let me cut this whole thing short With that qualification, could we all accept "B" at this point?   Why don't we do that unless somebody has some objection If I hear none, I'll just assume that we will go with "B" with the addition that Don suggested   Any general questions then to Don? Yes, Jerry   Any further questions? If not, I'll start off on the policy issues We've all been looking at various models In the earlier go-around members made major additions to macroeconometric models by employing such concepts as economies in ditches, the end of runways, terminal patients, and the python in a pig, or is it vice-a-versa! [Laughter] I have two models which I've discussed previously, and I'd like to raise them again merely on the grounds that I think it's fairly apparent that the basic structural models that we employ of necessity are not capturing what essentially is going on in this environment  The one we used in the Humphrey-Hawkins testimony is what I would call a somewhat benign model It essentially argues that there has been a diversion of cash flows in both the household and the business sectors away from purchases of goods and services to debt repair, largely a reduction in debt That obviously engenders a higher saving rate and a subdued level of economic activity But it basically stipulates that the saving rate is stable at a higher-than- desired longer-term level, that the balance sheet repair will continue until balance sheets get into pretty good shape at which point the amount of diversion of cash flow that is required for the eventual [recovery finally] supplies enough money, then spills over into goods and services, and ends up in gross domestic product That argument stipulates that if the balance sheet repair [process] is, say, to a substantial extent completed in the business sector and, say, halfway through in the household sector--which the data on debt service burdens somehow but very crudely imply--then one would conclude that we're over the major part of the adjustment or at least in the middle of it and are sort of going down hill One would not expect it to be an all or nothing adjustment on the balance sheet until the balance sheet repair is complete, but rather the beginning of a gradual moving away from savings toward purchases of goods and services as the balance sheet repair gets 80 percent complete, then 90 percent, and eventually 100 percent That argues for something not terribly different from the Greenbook projection a rather moderate, subdued gross domestic product increase but with characteristics essentially as described in the Greenbook  The alternate significantly less benign model is the one I raised at the last FOMC meeting It differs from the first model in regard to the presumption about the extent of balance sheet stringency--which you may recall I characterized as having many of the characteristics of the 19th century type of economic processes in the periods when we had a major speculative increase in assets financed by  -38-    8/18/92  debt, followed by a decline in market value of assets, debt burdens becoming oppressive, and people effectively seizing up on their expenditures in an effort to pay off their debts and restore their balance sheets The effect is an implosion in economic activity I stipulated at the last FOMC meeting that one way of looking at this process that we are involved in and have been involved in for the last three years is that it is one in which we forestalled this [adjustment] by continuously injecting liquidity--or I should say basically injecting funds and reserves into the system That stretched out the adjustment process and effectively worked toward ease and toward a sort of relaxing of the grip when we eased, but only for a limited period of time That is, one can view the essential player in the economy as having a desire to repair the balance sheet very rapidly but the process was being stretched out so to speak by some form of tranquilizer or whatever we may call it And that tranquilizer has a limited life expectancy so that when we ease we get an economy which is not collapsing but tending to stabilize But we have to ease continuously in order to get the economy just to stand still and prevent it from seizing up and collapsing  Now, at the moment I think we can be on either Model 1 or Model 2 If after the substantial amount of liquidity we have injected in the system we are still at a stage in which there is a significant endeavor to repair balance sheets at a pace that implicitly [consistent] with negative gross domestic product growth, then what we've heard around this table would lead us to conclude that the cumulative weakness is going to go an awful lot further This leads me generally to conclude that what we have to do at this stage is just to watch what happens I felt that the [strengthening in] the M2 data, which Don mentioned just this morning, was helpful It's not going in the wrong direction And it's at least not inconsistent with Model 1 If Model 1 is in fact working, then we've probably done enough at this stage and no further actions would be required on our part But we don't know that; the reason we don't know that is that it is conceivable, for example, that when housing sales figures come out at the end of this month they may be revised down sharply for last month and the newest month may be down; and automobile sales may start to go south And even though [businesses] have very significant cash flow and profitability, plant and equipment expenditures data, which we will be getting in several weeks, may provide at least an indication of what is going on in corporate planning All of that will at least give us an indication of where this whole process is going  Listening to various views of the Committee, I would suspect that one way or another a significant majority of us are somewhere around alternative B asymmetric toward ease, but with a general awareness that if the economy starts to look a little better or even just continues to grow, no action would be required Action would be implied only under the condition that expectations begin to emerge which suggest that the expansion is going to be running under the Greenbook forecast or if we get further important downward revisions that are relevant The basic reason I would argue in those terms is one that Governor Mullins raised namely, that we're running out of ammunition for potentially dangerous episodes We do have a stock market, whatever [index] it is we're looking at, which is quite high And I would hate to be at a point where we couldn't do anything to respond to that market because we had expended all of the ammunition  -39-    8/18/92  available to us But having said that, if in fact it is turning out that this malevolent Model 2 type of seizure is going on, I suspect we probably would have no choice at that point and would wish to move and hope that if we run out of bullets in the process that at least there's no one left to shoot at So, that's my addition to a python- in-the-pig!   Governor Angell   Jerry Jordan   Do we have room right now?   The basic question is clearing balances   Vice Chairman   President Parry   Governor LaWare   President Syron   The only argument I would have against John LaWare is that I feel a little uncomfortable or awkward about having been symmetric then asymmetric and going back My view is that the safety catch is on the gun, if you want to put it that way   Do you have that confidence?   You do?   I'm delighted   [Unintelligible]   All doctors have patients! That wasn't very funny Governor Kelley   President Forrestal   I think the risk in question is how much ammunition we have left That's the only risk I see   That's right and we may need it   Okay President Keehn   President Boehne   President Jordan   President Stern   President Hoenig   President Melzer   President Black   Governor Lindsey   President McTeer   Governor Mullins   Governor Phillips   I think we have a majority for "B" asymmetric toward ease If you'll read the language--   Take the roll  -43-    8/18/92   I think it is most appropriate for me to comment that as far as I can judge we've been handling the issue of confidentiality awfully well I haven't seen the slightest indication of any breach of security out of these meetings--the last two--and I merely wanted to note that fact and hope that whatever it is we're doing we continue to do With that, I'd like to request a motion to approve the minutes   Is there a second?   Without objection As you know, today is the first meeting in which Bill McDonough is in charge of both Desks in New York; he took over obviously very recently And I'd like to call on Bill for his usual start--the Foreign Desk report   Thank you Any questions for Bill?      10/6/92   President Black   President Syron   President Parry   Any further questions for Bill? If not, would somebody like to move to ratify the actions taken by the Desk since the last meeting?   Without objection Bill, would you introduce Joan Lovett officially?   Arithmetic is a pretty rough activity!   Go ahead Welcome   The bond market was about 1/4 point lower this morning and I think the bill rate is up about 3 or 4 basis points Is there any commentary around as to what this type of mood is suggesting?   Yes   President Melzer   It was also in the context, as I recall, of days when the bill rate was actually easing quite considerably   President Jordan   I'm sure I shouldn't read this and I don't have his permission, but I insist This is a Corrigan-gram which says we could put Bill and Joan on the road [Laughter]   Are there any further questions? If not, I think we have to get the ratification very quickly Would somebody like to move the ratification?   Okay Let's go have lunch  END OF MEETING  -52-       Without objection Let's move on now to Messrs Prell and Truman   Questions for either?   On this subject, do we have any evidence that the marginal propensity to spend out of interest income tends to rise as interest rates fall on the assumption that the [unintelligible] part of the standard of living of interest receivers is fixed?   Are you saying that they're moving out on the interest rate maturity curve for a higher yield?   President Parry   Governor Lindsey    10/6/92   It's true that it affects the net export position and personal consumption expenditures, but it does not affect the current account   It appears in a different line of the current account and, as far as the total system is concerned, it clearly doesn't matter   [It does] affect the GNP, but it doesn't affect the current account balance   It is in the services area   Not in that sense; it is put together with increases in US net exports   We also have the same problem with direct foreign investment If somebody came and dismantled an office tower in Los Angeles and moved it brick-by-brick abroad, we'd consider that an export   President Melzer   Governor Mullins   President Forrestal   President Hoenig   Governor Kelley   President Stern   President Syron   President McTeer   Any further questions for either of these two gentlemen?   Any further questions? If not, who would like to start the Committee's discussion? Bob Parry   Governor Angell   President Black   President Keehn   President Forrestal   President Boehne   President Melzer I'm sorry, President Syron   There's nothing to cede; it's just my mistake   President Stern   President Melzer   President McTeer   Governor LaWare   Governor Kelley   Governor Mullins   It has been only two years   President Hoenig   President Jordan   Governor Lindsey   What about the parable of the bees?   Vice Chairman   Governor Phillips   It's really quite late, so let's take a very short coffee break--in fact, 10 minutes  [Coffee break]   Any questions for Don? If not, let me start off This has to be one of the most difficult periods for policymaking that I remember The reason essentially is that we're dealing with an outlook that is far more difficult to fathom than I think any of us had really thought about It is by no means certain that the restructuring model we're looking at is of the type that I discussed here a couple of meetings ago; [that model involves] affecting the restructuring process and the improved balance sheet process by a level of interest rates that essentially over time restructures the balance sheets and induces a restoration of spending out of cash flows The alternate model I raised was what I called the "seize-up" model, namely that what we are looking at is an old 19th century major balance sheet seizing up under crisis conditions in which if we inject liquidity and ease into the market, it temporarily looks as though it is recovering but then as the stimulus runs out it reverts to the old [19th century process] of very rapid balance sheet adjustments And what we find is that the cash flow that is being engendered gets disproportionately shifted toward balance sheet repair and savings and there is general weakness in economic activity As Governor Mullins indicated, this is a sort of periodic "fall" problem; it's the third straight year that we've run into this I'm not sure that the date is particularly relevant, but there is evidence that [economic activity] does not wish to accelerate I do, however, think it is premature to conclude that what we are dealing with is a  -41-    10/6/92  cumulative process in which the previous injections of liquidity have petered out and the economy is now beginning to "seize up" again and move toward a negative growth pattern If that were actually occurring right now, it's hard to believe we would have the auto and truck sales numbers that were released yesterday, which were fairly good I also wonder whether the other evidence of reasonably good retail sales would be emerging; and I wonder whether loan demand, which may be nothing more than a shift from external financing to commercial bank financing, means all that much These are very fragile indications [on the positive side] and I must tell you I scrounged very hard to find them Nonetheless, it is not immediately evident that we are moving toward a cumulative deterioration  As a consequence of that, I would be reluctant to move toward further ease at this point But I do think we may be at the cusp of some deterioration which just hasn't cumulated in the usual pattern that one would expect We have some fairly unstable financial conditions, especially the stock market, that a number of you have alluded to There is unquestionably a potential danger in easing and I think we have to be very careful of that when we are looking at the market responses to what we are doing or what everyone thinks we are doing We are largely getting a response from the dealers who inventory bonds and who react very rapidly to what they think we are doing It's not altogether clear that they are going to judge their retail markets, their pension funds, correctly It may very well be that one of these times, when we see bond markets getting very strong with the expectation of ease, we're going to find that that's a result of a build-up of inventories on the part of dealers who are unable to sell them to their customers, and the markets will reverse very sharply  So, we have a very touchy problem here I'm aware, as you all are, that everyone expects us to ease and that becomes a self- fulfilling activity While the case for easing right now is quite strong, I would be far more inclined to wait for a short while--maybe a couple of weeks--to see what is developing in the financial markets, what is developing in the foreign exchange markets, what is developing in Europe, and what is developing in the overall economy I do not think one can argue, especially in the context of some of the discussions I've heard here, that this economy is slipping off the edge It may; we may find evidence of that within a reasonable period of time I would argue further that if we do not get improvement within the next couple of weeks, the odds will then very strongly favor [the hyposthesis] that this "seize-up" model I mentioned at the beginning is functioning So, having gone back and forth in the last 48 hours looking at all sorts of numbers, I myself would feel most comfortable with a hard asymmetric directive toward ease, reflecting the fact that we would do nothing at the moment But unless we begin to see some firming in particular indicators, I do think we should move lower I say this without a great conviction because anyone who has a great conviction at this stage about what the economy is doing or what proper policy is I think is under a mild state of delusion  I would like to say finally that I wish we had the luxury to sit back and do nothing until after the election, as is the conventional procedure of the Federal Open Market Committee I don't think we have that luxury However, I don't think the markets have been viewing anything we have been doing as politically motivated  -42-    10/6/92  There are obviously those who make those statements, but I don't think that's a serious issue confronting us So, I would dismiss that as a consideration; it's not something we need to be overly concerned about But if the money supply weakens and the markets behave poorly and we have the evidence that we've getting cumulative deterioration-- or more exactly that the economy is not picking up, which is I think the main criterion at this particular stage--I do think that we should move toward ease And ease in this context I would say definitely would require a discount rate cut and some action on the funds rate So, I would put that out as a recommendation to start the discussion and hope somebody may be able to expand on it with some great insights as to how policy is functioning   Yes   No, I'm arguing for "B"   I may have said "A" then "B" I'm arguing for alternative B asymmetric toward ease, with the expectation that if the economy fails to show signs that it's [improving], we will reconsider whether to move President Jordan   Jerry, let me just comment on this for a second I think you're raising a crucial question about whether we should lock back in on a specific aggregate We obviously are confronted with the difference between the yield curve effect on Ml versus M2 and M3 It would be nice if we had a particular conviction that one or the other or some other M was the best one; if we did, then clearly we should lock in But I don't know if we can say that merely locking in, irrespective of whether in our judgment it's the right measure on which to lock in, is a wise move So, while you're raising a correct issue--that we really ought to review our guidelines --I think it's regrettable but it's a little late in the game for this meeting But I do think that should be on the agenda for the next meeting because we did, in fact, say that we would do it before next year, and the next meeting would be the appropriate time to do it But to make a judgment that we are locking in on M2--enthroning it as you put it--presupposes that we have confidence that that's the right measure I would much prefer to be uncommitted to which particular money aggregate we are functioning with until we have a judgment as to what we want to work with If M2 is wrong and we lock in, we're going to have far more difficulties in aligning ourselves than if we lock into something when we have considerable confidence I don't think we have that confidence at this stage President Forrestal   President Parry   Governor Angell   Governor Lindsey   I think initial claims, which come out [soon], are a very crucial indicator of short-term deterioration; it has been one of the problems The retail sales figure [could] show weakness   I might say that the decision will be made obviously also in conjunction with the Board of Governors on the discount rate, so that issue gets involved   President Black  -46-    10/6/92   Governor LaWare   President Stern   Governor Kelley   President McTeer   President Boehne   President Syron   President Keehn   President Hoenig   President Melzer   Governor Phillips   Governor Mullins   Vice Chairman   President Jordan, I never did get an indication from you as to how you came out   Let me just say something that I think is important for us to focus on This is a very close call here and what I don't want to do is to convey a sense that I have some strong conviction as to what is involved here I want to make certain that we're not getting a Committee vote which merely acquiesces in a view that I have stipulated because, as we have all indicated around this table, this is an extremely difficult period I want to make certain that we get a vote which is essentially a Committee vote rather an acquiescence to the position of the Chairman Ordinarily, I would never say such a thing! [Laughter]   The fact is that we all recognize that this is a very tough decision we are making and it's best that we all say exactly what it is that we [prefer] As a consequence of that, I want to read off my notes to be sure that I have gotten everyone's view and priorities correctly Accordingly, I'm going to poll each of you, starting from the bottom President Syron would prefer easing at this meeting but will accept asymmetric toward ease The same is true of Governor Phillips [and of Governor Mullins] Do I gather this correctly?   But that's not the [unintelligible] question   That there is a case for ease now is unquestioned, but what's your priority?   Your priority is asymmetric?   So, your preference is asymmetric but there is a case for easing; it's the other way around    10/6/92   President Melzer votes "no" on ease and symmetric language with "B" Governor Lindsey very specifically indicated a desire to ease now Governor LaWare wants symmetric now   I'm sorry, "B" Governor Kelley wants asymmetric toward ease, but I gathered from your comments that while you could accept [a move toward] ease you would prefer not [to move]?   President Hoenig is asymmetric toward ease but could accept ease, if I gather correctly   Governor Angell would not be in favor of ease, but would do asymmetric toward ease I would suspect that the Vice Chairman is asymmetric toward ease because that's his conviction   I wonder whether President Jordan finally has his solution   Okay, as I now reconfirm what the views are, there is a majority for asymmetric toward ease in the form which I originally stipulated it Therefore, I would request that you read the [directive language]   Call the roll   Good morning, everybody The first item of business is the recognition of the fact that this is Bob Black's last meeting His first meeting was much closer to the 19th century than any of you would know It was in 1960! That's really extraordinary I wish to implore all of you that we not become unduly sloppy in our intellectual procedures with Bob leaving the group In any event, we'll see a lot of you in the future, I presume, Bob I tried to think of a few things to say about you; it's very difficult to add anything other than refer to the extraordinary esteem which all of your colleagues very clearly have shown to you through the years And while I've heard a lot of nasty things about me and about other members of this FOMC, I can tell you that I never once have heard anyone say anything other than positive things about you It goes without saying that we're going to miss you and miss you dearly for your wisdom and your extraordinary insights and experience It's not going to be easy for us   Why don't you fax it!   The second item on the agenda is an important announcement from the President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York   With that I'm not sure I can get approval for the minutes because I'm not sure what we were doing back then! But I will request it in any event Would somebody like to move the minutes of the last meeting?  SPEAKER(?) Move it    11/17/92   Without objection Before Gretchen goes to confession she better report to us   Questions for Gretchen? If not, let's move on to Bill McDonough  [Secretary's note Mr McDonough requested authorization to negotiate renewal of the System's swap lines for another year]   Questions for Bill?   Any other questions? Would somebody like to move Bill's recommendation?   Without objection Bill, do you want to continue with the report of the Domestic Desk?   Bill, do you have any evidence from those forward federal funds contracts or from short-term money market instruments that the near-term firming in federal funds futures, which    11/17/92  looks to be about 25 basis points, actually tilts over after the first of the year? Are we close enough yet to draw inferences as to whether that in fact is what the markets are saying?   Other questions for Bill? If not, would somebody like to move to ratify both the previous actions of the Desk and Bill's request for the intermeeting leeway change?   Okay, I think we ought to take a short luncheon break and then proceed to our next agenda topic  [Lunch recess]  -48-    11/17/92   Our meeting went into recess and we are now back in the official meeting for our final topic on which I request Don Kohn to edify us   Mr Winn   We have a fundamental problem The problem essentially is that we are a public institution and that unless we have reasons to withhold, we really are obligated to make available whatever information we have on what we do So, the question that we have to [consider involves] the efficiency of the discussion and the deliberative process and the elements that contribute to that There isn't any question, at least in my mind, that if we were to have television cameras parked all over the place and this meeting were "live," we would have a wholly different discussion I must tell you about experiences that I have had under the Sunshine Act For example, when I was Chairman of the Social Security Commission, which was subject to the Act, it turns out that the lawyers indicated that we did not have to have public representation at lunch and dinner And lo and behold, all of the politicians--and these were the senior members of the Senate and the senior members of the House of both parties--negotiated like mad at lunch and dinner and the public sessions were absolutely sterile; nothing happened at them On the Financial Economic Commission, which was a bipartisan commission also loaded with members of Congress on both sides of the aisle, I understand from a statement publicly made by Bob Strauss, the co-chairman, that in order to come to conclusions they had to go off in the corner and negotiate  The problem essentially is that there is a presumption that somehow we can be a deliberative body in the Sunshine on very sensitive issues But the Congress, when it gets involved in that kind of situation, knows better; they're trying to repeal human nature and it doesn't seem to work I think we have to try to remember that we're obligated not to start with the proposition that everything is secret unless we want to let it out We have to start in the other direction We're obligated when we seriously believe that the efficiency of our deliberations would be sufficiently undercut by various forms of disclosure to define why and to make that notion available to the Congress either through testimony, or written material, or through responses that we would make to Mr Gonzalez's questions But it is important that we define what it is we're doing The trouble, unfortunately, is that there is a large element of hypocrisy involved, which is very difficult to deal with In other words, we can't give examples to the people who are telling us to go in the open [showing that] when they are [deliberating] they don't [do it in the open] Regrettably, that's not the appropriate response to this And it is very difficult to communicate to people because Mr  -49-    11/17/92  Gonzalez has said publicly that he thinks our meetings would become far more productive if conducted in the open Now, the chances of that are zero I don't mean 1 percent or 2 percent; I said zero And I'd use a lower number if they would let me! But we have to be able to define a rational position because we do have the very difficult problem of being a central bank in a democratic society That's not an easy job If it weren't for the hypocrisies involved in a lot of this, it would be relatively easy to do So, what I'm really asking of you in this meeting is (1) your views as to what you as a group would feel comfortable disclosing and at what particular time; and (2) where you think we have to be very careful There is a tradeoff here basically between the efficiency of our deliberative process, which is very crucial to the country, and the public's need to know They do have a need to know and they have a right to know Vice Chairman Corrigan   May I just ask Do we have people who are transcribing this and taking this down?   This is going to be a meeting from which we will try to obtain the best set of arguments and the best conclusions that will apply, so I want to make sure that we will have a record of what is said   I'm sorry Go ahead   Governor Lindsey   President Jordan   President Hoenig   President Syron   President Melzer   I think you raise an important issue regarding the distinction between actions we have taken and are historically ended at that point [and those that are not] Let us say, for example, that we eased today We did something; it's a fact That's differentiated from indicating our intentions of what we might do, which would induce the markets to discount that, in part And then it would whipsaw the markets   And we would lose freedom of action because if we get caught in a situation where the markets have assumed we're going to act in a certain way, it's very difficult for us to pull back It's the disclosure of the potential alternate policy moves of the Committee between meetings that is the sensitive issue because [disclosure of that information] creates market changes which make it more difficult for us to take an intermeeting action that we perceive we need to take I personally see no problem in announcing decisions after the fact We cut the discount rate, we announce it; we move the funds rate, we announce it That frankly doesn't bother me very much What does bother me is putting on the table and in the public our deliberations about potential future [actions] and our inclinations and the conditions that would drive [such actions] That would then, by interacting with the market, alter our decisionmaking process and create a significant loss of flexibility in the actions that we might have undertaken   President Parry  -54-    11/17/92   Frankly, if you want my impression, nothing will buy us anything We have to decide what we think is the right thing to do, acknowledging that we are a public institution and that we have an obligation to make available anything other than that which inhibits due deliberation on our part If we try to play offense or defense, as Jerry says, that's fine if they let us carry the ball But they own the ball, and they're not going to lend it to us If we do something thinking it will change how they behave, I'm not sure in which direction it would be We have to make a decision based on what we think is the right thing to do, give our explanation to Congress and the new Administration to an extent, and if some legal authorities decide we have to do it in a different way, that's their responsibility I don't think we can buy a bushel of corn That's probably the wrong analogy Ed Boehne   President Stern   Vice Chairman   Huge Imagine circulating this document to get an okay from all the people around here!   That is the problem I mentioned   Markets would respond and affect how we function  -56-    11/17/92   It doesn't have to be at the same time Governor Angell   I frankly think that would get us nothing   Governor Phillips   I think that our General Counsel ought to write an op-ed piece in which he quotes both sources of information today and then asks the obvious questions!   Would you take the first part of the policy record, which is an evaluation of what is going on, and release that more promptly?   The only thing that we really have to protect is our tilts [in the directive] and our contingencies and anything that relates to actions we have not taken but might take That's where the real issue arises   After the fact   Well, why do you say that we have to do it the way you suggest?   Oh, I agree with that   Did the CFTC deliberate in closed--?   President Forrestal   President Keehn   President Black   The problem, unfortunately, is that under the Freedom of Information Act, we need a statute to protect us In other words, if we were to start to make [detailed] minutes right now, they would be subject to a Freedom of Information suit   I don't know General Counsel, what is the--   Governor Mullins   Governor Kelley   President Melzer   President Boehne  -65-    11/17/92   Any further comments anyone wants to make? This has been a useful discussion, and I think we've pretty much gotten everybody's point of view Let me suggest the following I'd like to sit down with a summary of these comments, think about it, discuss it with some of you perhaps, have a telephone conference within 10 days or two weeks or so and report to you what I've concluded from this and possibly make recommendations--one recommendation being to do nothing--and suggest how we ought to proceed from there In the interim, I will write a letter to Mr Gonzalez indicating that this meeting took place, that we had a considerable discussion, and that we will be proceeding on it shortly   Are you sending copies to everybody? We have them   I should think so Our position is very clear There is important agreement in this group on the principles of what it is we're doing The crucial issue is the deliberative process and how to protect that process That's the [unintelligible] of these issues  Okay, I think that concludes the meeting May I just add quickly before you go, first of all, that needless to say this [discussion] is confidential in all respects as are all meetings but especially this one And secondly, we are scheduled to meet on December the 21st; that's a Monday The question before the group is Should we meet in the morning or would you rather meet in the afternoon?  SPEAKER(?) Morning  SPEAKER(?) Afternoon  SPEAKER(?) It doesn't matter  -66-    11/17/92 -67-   Is morning acceptable to everybody?   You are coming in Sunday night?   Then Monday morning it is Okay, thank you very much, everybody  END OF MEETING       Without objection Let's now move on to Mike Prell   Questions for Mike? If not, would somebody like to start the Committee go around?   President Keehn   President Parry   President Black   President Stern   President McTeer   Bob, I noticed that there are reports of improved drilling rig activity How significant is that and what do you make of it?   Do you really sense any carry-through off the rebound of the gas prices?   And especially if we don't, we are not going to get it   President Boehne   President Syron   President Hoenig   Governor Lindsey   Which one? [Laughter]   President Melzer   Governor Mullins   Or more   President Jordan   Vice Chairman   Governor Kelley   Governor LaWare   Governor Angell   Governor Phillips   Thank you, Governor Coffee is available for us  [Coffee break]   Unless somebody has an objection, [I assume] it is acceptable to continue on and complete the short-term issues before we go to the ranges for 1993 So, I would conclude that unless I hear an objection   They are, but the question is which do you want to do first?   Do you want to say something, [Don]?   Well, the answer is yes we can, but if we're going to do that, I think it would be appropriate to stay with the schedule that we have here and basically to deal now with the ranges or at least the [briefing by] Don Kohn I'm a little concerned about all this since there is a technical problem about trying to merge these into a single discussion I'm not sure that it will work I'm willing to try, but I'm not convinced it's a good idea Why don't we try it your way and go forward We may find that it will require us at some point--I reserve the right as Chairman--to alter the procedure in mid-course if it will speed up the work   Yes, why don't you start with the long run and raise the issues Then we'll try to integrate them [and] see  -23-    11/17/92  if we can conclude the short term and then go to the long term for a final decision   I would suggest that that's the ideal procedure   I'll try to cover both aspects myself; I frankly don't tie the short-term decision and the long-run ranges together, but some of you may In that respect we'll see how things materialize  I must say that my impression with respect to the ranges is [along the lines of] what we suspected we might have to do back in July but we were not sufficiently cognizant of the forces that were driving money at that time, which we are today If one looks at the old opportunity cost relationships and the sharp divergences that have occurred between velocity and our old opportunity costs, it's fairly obvious from the patterns that have emerged in the most recent period that had we known back in July what we know now we would implicitly have factored in a significant rise in velocity and, accordingly, we would have had a much lower range of M2 consistent with the nominal GDP numbers that in fact have pretty much materialized as expected So, the question of whether we should revise our ranges down in my judgment is not really a choice between whether we should or shouldn't but by how much and when I myself am inclined to be a little more cautious than the projected alternative II of 1-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent on M2; I'd much prefer 2 to 6 percent myself, but it's obviously not a big deal one way or the other I think the more interesting and difficult decision is when  Obviously, if we do it now, we can phrase it for what it is namely, a technical adjustment we should have made back in July But as we said then, we felt we needed more information and we said we would respond at a later time Indeed, we could do that now The disadvantage of doing it now is that it is [more] difficult to get the message out that this is really a technical adjustment than it is if we do it in Congressional testimony in February under the usual procedures If I were sure that we could get the message out now in a form that I think is necessary, I frankly would be inclined to do it now But I'm not sure that that's feasible, and I'd be most curious to get everyone else's view with respect to this question But I do think it would be difficult not to lower the ranges after the Feinman and Porter study and after what we indicated was the nature of our discussions in July and the considerations that we had My recollection is that what we stipulated back in July almost requires us to lower the ranges at this stage, granted the type of velocity changes that we were contemplating at the time But I don't tie what we will do with respect to the ranges in any way to what I think our short-term considerations are today with respect to policy because I  -24-    11/17/92  don't think it's a monetary policy question I believe it's strictly a technical question, and I myself would like to handle it in that way if we could  With respect to short-term policy, you may recall that we came out of the last meeting with [a directive that incorporated] hard asymmetry toward ease, with the basic presumption that the Desk would ease in the intermeeting period unless the economy showed significant improvement I mentioned at the time certain key developments Specifically, as I recall, the one that had been worrying me the most at the time of the last meeting was initial claims, which had been moving up and suggesting that the economy was in fact beginning to go into a cumulative erosion If that were occurring, we would have expected claims to move up to the area of 500,000 weekly, adjusted for emergency unemployment claims, and perhaps penetrating above that In the event and almost immediately, initial claims turned in exactly the opposite direction--and I might say in a rather credible form in the sense that the level came down successively week-by-week and it was matched by levels of insured unemployment that also were exhibiting that same phenomenon We were also looking in the same context at other elements underneath those data which certainly were indicative of apparent changes in the labor market, as reflected in the income and product accounts and in [other] broad measures of economic activity that we generally watch It was fairly apparent that the motor vehicle sales numbers were impressive The retail sales figures--granted they could very readily get revised again and again-- were capturing a [more positive] tone And, unless we are reading into our various District reports the actual biases coming from the national retail sales figures, I must say the reports we heard today from the Districts are quite consistent with the data that we're seeing on the national level; there does not appear to be an inconsistency And the evidence of shortfalls in inventories in the retail area prior to the Christmas season is giving a general tone of much lower levels of discounts than we saw last year That is as good a measure as one can get about the tone of the Christmas selling season  The general short-term outlook strikes me as clearly [pointing to] a modest upward momentum I don't think we have seen any evidence of this economy seizing up, as Governor Kelley indicated I'm not saying that it is moving forward at an accelerating pace, but it seems to be gathering modest domestic support I would point out that there are several characteristics of this [situation] that do create risks on the up side The first is the old, classic inventory lead-time relationship Remember that lead times on deliveries of materials are very short and that backlogs as a percent of shipments have been coming down; this is increasingly a just-in-time type of economy If we get any pressure on that system, it means that minor bottlenecks begin to occur That very easily can happen in the United States where the travel distances are so great as distinct from Japan where just-in-time means people just throw it over the wall because everything is close together That's not true here It is not inconceivable that with all the computer technology we could still get modest pressures, which would start to move lead times out Once lead times start to lengthen, purchasing managers start to order further in advance and that's the old classic inventory cycle which opens up profit margins, engenders increased capital investment, and creates the type of environment which historically always looks after the fact  -25-    11/17/92  as if it were unforeseeable In other words, we sit here now and say that nothing is really moving except a little in housing and a little in retail sales, but [the improvement] is offset by weakness in exports I've been through many of those cycles; in fact a lot of you here whose hair is as grey as mine--and maybe some of you have more of it--have lived through the same phenomenon It's very difficult to see that phenomenon in advance It comes on fairly quickly and it is not easily foreseeable  Superimposed on that is the virtual inevitability of an investment tax credit The Clinton people have committed themselves to it not as a short-term device, but as a permanent long-term vehicle I forget who mentioned this earlier, but once tax hearings start things begin to get very interesting I don't think we fully understand the extent to which there are pent-up constituency pressures in the budget process which are really going to be unleashed once the Congress is [in session] and everything is in play The belief that President Clinton is going to be able to constrain that phenomenon is not well based in history [Laughter] And the issue of effectively putting President Clinton in a position where he may well end up vetoing everything in sight for a period of time is not a scenario we can just discard because he is going to have to impose himself on that process or it is "deuces wild" as we used to say, and things could really begin to move That clearly is not something we all are looking at with any degree of benevolence  Having said that, there nonetheless are quite significant negatives in the world economy No disinflation is occurring out there, but we see the makings of a world economy being on the edge of deflation As Jerry pointed out, the Japanese and German economies are in much less viable shape than is suggested by the conventional wisdom There are very significant downside risks if for no other reason than that [the existence of those risks] is not the conventional wisdom in those countries and I don't think they are in control of how they would react psychologically if everything began to come up short There's unquestionably a convergence of the [unintelligible] process in the European Community that is involved, and it is important to recognize that the endeavor to converge the EC [economies] has all the aspects of constraints of one form or another, which can have a major impact over there The spillover effects into the United States are very difficult to [ascertain], but we are seeing clear evidences, mainly in the last several weeks, that the European/Japanese [unintelligible] system is really weakening I would only [point to] two specific indicators, which we don't [usually] look at all that much the commodity price trends, specifically in metals in the last number of weeks, and the price of gold, which we very rarely take into consideration But when we remember that gold is and probably always will be a true measure of the sense of people's view of paper currencies, then we get gold prices under pressure at the same time that commodity prices are moving Granted, it is less in non-dollar terms [but] it is suggestive of the fact that there's a psychology that is consistent with an EC convergence And the restrained attitudes in Japan about expanding are rather graphic When Ted Truman and I were over there a while back, I was impressed by the extent of the optimism that pervaded in spite of all the awful numbers we were seeing I must say that made me uncomfortable because there were no countervailing forces out there It's always dangerous to have optimism if it doesn't work  -26-    11/17/92  The issue I find the most difficult to deal with is the one that David raised namely, the question of short-term non-inflation but longer- term inflationary expectations still embodied [in interest rates] One would think we could arbitrage this in some way, but it doesn't work We've seen that in the past Remember how long it took in 1979 when inflationary pressures were really roaring away and the rates on long-term US Treasuries just kept sitting close to the 6 percent area?   No, I'm talking about earlier on   Yes   Well, maybe I'm thinking of slightly earlier   Yes, and then all of a sudden--I think it was from mid-1979 for the next six or eight months--long-term yields went up 400 basis points or something like that  SPEAKER(?) That's right   What that told us is that these things don't happen slowly; they break I have a suspicion that what we have here is the reverse namely, that at some point if short-term inflationary pressures stay down, this is going to break and hopefully it could break in a positive direction But as a consequence of all of this, we have a very unusual situation where the United States economy does seem to be crippled in the short term; I don't believe we have the characteristics of a double or triple dip; I don't think we're seeing that While we saw shortfalls in growth before, that was in a context of very severe debt repayment and debt pressures; while they're still going on, I think they're going on to a lesser extent And the stirrings in the bank loan markets are suggestive of this particular process Clearly, while we have great qualms about the money supply data indicating very much of anything, they are nonetheless suggesting, if not clearly, that the balance sheet [adjustment] processes are reasonably completed at banks  In summary, as I indicated before, I would look at the ranges independently I would prefer, although I don't feel strongly about it, going with 2 to 6 percent [for M2] and I would be slightly inclined to wait until February rather than to try to do something now, but I don't feel strongly about that either Looking at the short-term outlook and listening to the general discussion, I would say that we should hold policy steady I would be somewhere between asymmetric--not the hard asymmetric that we were on last time--and  -27-    11/17/92  symmetric, but I think the range here probably isn't very wide I'd be somewhere in that particular area President Parry   We don't owe them The reason we are discussing this today is that it was part of an agreement reached within this Committee   We said "we might"   We didn't promise   We suggested that we might review it before but we never made a particular promise The only promise we made was to ourselves to review   Governor Angell   President Jordan   President Parry   President Forrestal   Governor LaWare   President Black   Governor Lindsey   But to 1-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent?   President Syron   President Boehne   President Stern   President Keehn   We still can do that in February   Yes, that's correct   Governor Kelley   President McTeer   Governor Mullins   I agree with Gary and could argue for widening the range myself Governor Phillips   President Melzer  -39-    11/17/92   That's correct They will convene January 3, but then they may technically adjourn again   President Hoenig   Vice Chairman   I personally feel very strongly that it's best politically and otherwise to [view] it as technical   It has been a very interesting discussion, and I think Governor Lindsey was right This coordinated approach [in our discussion] has certainly helped to bring out issues which wouldn't have been brought out otherwise   Well, that's in fact what my suggestion was essentially going to be We're going to have to send a detailed letter up to the Hill with the Feinman-Porter study I would suggest that as part of the letter it would be useful to do precisely as you suggest To indicate that if anything, as David has said, our nominal GDP has been doing better And since we have been getting the nominal GDP that we were presuming we'd get with the current ranges, in that sense we have a very strong case to say that we have succeeded The mistake was not on the GDP side; the mistake was on the indicator, which is the money supply And I think that can be done  Frankly, I think Mike Kelley made a very important point when he raised the issue of this period being a media vacuum He probably didn't emphasize that enough The ridiculous stories that are coming out about the Federal Reserve tilting toward Clinton, not doing this, or doing that, are all absolute fluff The one thing I'm pleased about is that it essentially has been all soft stuff There was a story in this morning's Wall Street Journal which has us as a group opposed to Paul Volcker as Secretary of the Treasury! Now, how bizarre can they get? I frankly agree with Mike, but I had not thought about it in those terms until he mentioned it, that there really is a very significant danger [of media invention], which is a reason for proceeding the way Dick Syron suggested and then essentially burying [the decision] in the February testimony with a lot of technical discussion That will work if the economy is up If the economy is up, this issue is absolutely irrelevant The question of M2 as a problem is gone; it becomes [unintelligible] for a few of our friends If the economy is in the soup, this issue is not going to be our major problem I must say that I came into this meeting not quite sure where I stood but, having heard all of the discussion, I'm pretty well convinced that the approach we ought to take is the one  -42-    11/17/92  that Dick was [suggesting] We have not released this study yet, is that right?   Oh, yes   We've sent it up to the Hill but we haven't--   Is that right?   Well, it's so complex that unless we do it--   That's what I was thinking   Yes, I was thinking of that   I also think we probably would be better off with a range of 2 to 6 percent if for no other reason than it's a smaller change, although I think the points that Governor Angell made are certainly [relevant] My only problem with Governor Angell's [position] is not his insight but his confidence in the forecast of M2, which I don't share   That's exactly the reason why   I don't disagree with that as a general view Let me go on to say further that, after listening to the [discussion], once we take one of the votes--however we vote--I'd like to go around [the table] again on the other because there are views that could conceivably change  -43-    11/17/92   I think the answer is that we would only vote if we came to a conclusion that we were going to do something now   Vote to consider it? What does that mean?   Yes   I must say I would frankly prefer that From the point of view of the political sensitivities that we're going through now, that strikes me as the way to [do this] with the least fallout If it weren't for the media vacuum, I would opt to do it right now and get it out of the way I'm not sure we have that capability I'm not sure we can do it, and I think the risks of missing are too large   Yes, I'm much more comfortable with that   That's correct   Is that something that we could accept? Would everyone be willing to do that?   Yes  -44-    11/17/92   We would say that there are technical reasons that are coming out of the Feinman-Porter study which clearly suggest [that the ranges should be cut] I would even say that we ought to indicate that our hypotheses of last July are in fact being confirmed by later studies That would be the general thrust of our approach We would put it in a technical context as a two-stage activity Then, when [the time comes for] the Humphrey-Hawkins testimony in February, [we will cut the ranges], assuming the economy is doing as we expect And if the economy does something different, it's even better this way   Yes   That's correct   Let me put it to you this way If you ask whether we are confirming our view to contain the success that we've had to date on inflation, the answer is "yes" I think that policy is implicit among the members of this Committee, and the specific instruments that we may be using or not using are really a quite secondary question As I read it, there is no debate within this Committee to abandon our view that a non-inflationary environment is best for this country over the longer term Everything else, once we've said that, becomes technical questions I would say in that context that on the basis of the studies, we have seen that to drive nominal GDP, let's assume at 4-1/2 percent, in our old philosophy we would have said that [requires] a 4-1/2 percent growth in M2 In today's analysis, we would say it's significantly less than that I'm basically arguing that we are really in a sense using [unintelligible] a nominal GDP goal of which the money supply relationships are technical mechanisms to achieve that And I don't see any change in our view   That we're not serious? I'd say at this stage that we have achieved a very substantial amount of credibility   I sense no evidence that any member of this Committee has indicated second thoughts on that question nor has anyone gone public with second thoughts or indicated any fundamental change in their individual philosophies Bob, I'm not really concerned about that   That may be They will be convinced only after a period of time; and we will know they are convinced when we see the 30-year Treasury at 5-1/2 percent   When you look at the decomposition of the [30-year] coupon into its short-term cohorts, say, one-year maturities of futures, it's very clear that the substantial part of the inflationary expectations is five years out and forward   I don't think that is a monetary policy response I think that's a fiscal policy, global/American economic policy response and does not reflect on the Federal Reserve   Well, it's conceivable that part of that is an accommodation of the markets on our part But we're going to change that only with time; we're not going to change it through playing around with words or charts or ranges It's going to come only from what we actually do Anyway, can I then assume that we will proceed in that direction and hopefully be able to pull it off with a minimum of problems?  Listening to the comments on the short term, especially if we [include] the three members of the Committee who are significantly desirous of easing now, it's fairly clear that we have a central tendency toward asymmetry I would describe it as normal or even slightly soft rather than the hard asymmetry that we used last time So, even though I am aware that one can't mix this in the way in which I'm trying to mix it without breaking some crockery here, as I read it we would be close the average [view] of this Committee if we voted "B" asymmetric toward ease, and I would propose that to the Committee  -46-    11/17/92   No, that's not the way I got it   Corrigan is either way   That's the simple way Why don't we just poll the members?   Let me just say what I have I've got Corrigan either way   So, I took that as a Corriganesque--   Angell I have as symmetric; Hoenig as symmetric but could accept asymmetric   I have Jordan ease; Kelley symmetric; LaWare symmetric; Lindsey ease; Melzer symmetric; Mullins asymmetric; Phillips prefer ease but could accept asymmetric; and Syron ease   I think the particular choice of words is really far less important than what it is we would do under various conditions [The wording] almost doesn't matter Clearly, if the economy continues to show the signs [of improvement] that it has been  -47-    11/17/92  showing--remembering that our next meeting is only five weeks away--we will probably sit tight It would require a really important, surprising turnaround in a relatively short period of time to initiate action under this type of directive The only reason I would argue myself for asymmetric is that I don't like switching back and forth If the next trend is toward expansion, if we wait until December to go to symmetric or do something else, I don't think that matters much If, however, we switch prematurely, it will look a little unstable I must say I am personally somewhat inclined in that direction not because I think it's a major policy issue but because I think it's a--   Especially when it's five weeks until the next meeting   Call the roll   Good morning, everyone I think you all know we have a luncheon for Bob Black that I hope everyone will be able to attend I'd like to welcome Al Broaddus to his first meeting at this table We look forward to his joining us on a regular basis starting with the next meeting as the newly installed President of the Richmond Federal Reserve Bank  There is nothing unusual about the agenda this morning so I'd like to get started right from the top Would somebody like to move approval of the minutes of the November 17th meeting?   Without objection Bill McDonough, you're on for the Foreign Desk   I didn't have a chance to pick up the cause of the runup in the dollar against the DM from 157 to 158 this morning What explains that?   Let's be very careful about sneezing in this room! Any other questions? If not, we shall move on to the Domestic Desk, and Joan Lovett will bring us up to date   Questions for Joan?   I think there's another force that is beginning to work here that we can see when we unbundle the whole coupon yield into the 1-year futures As you are all aware, there has been a very significant decline in [rates in] the 10- to 30-year area; indeed, one is sensing that there is a really fundamental shift in the outlook as reflected in the various positions along the yield curve What we may finally be seeing is a downward revision of long-term inflation expectations There may be a hope--and I underline the word "hope"--that the budget deficit may be addressed in this particular period because the only time that it can be [cut] is during the so- called "honeymoon period" I think there's a market expectation that something fundamental may happen and that is being addressed in the longer end of the market; and even though we're getting this upward surge in the short end, it's more than offset on the long end and the    12/22/92  total effective yield in the 30-year coupon has been coming down I think there is an intermediate cycle of the type that Jerry Jordan is talking about which has been superimposed on that process If that is true, then there may still be further downside rate possibilities in the long end of the market Indeed, what this is saying essentially is that the yield curve is going to flatten and possibly flatten quite significantly If, however, the honeymoon comes and goes and we get the usual no action, then I think we're likely to see that go right back where it was, or maybe worse   Any further questions for Joan? If not, would somebody like to move to ratify the transactions since the last meeting?   Our next meeting is scheduled for Tuesday-Wednesday, February 2-3  END OF MEETING       Without objection Let's now move on to Messrs Prell and Truman  MESSRS PRELL and TRUMAN [Statements--see Appendix]   Did I hear you correctly when you said that the gold exports in October appear to have come from the coffers of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York? Has anyone looked lately?   The Federal Reserve Bank's basement is a foreign country When they move it out of the basement into the United States, it's an import Then, when they ship it out again, it's an export   President Syron   Governor Lindsey   There's also another way of looking at it How that shifting of the net borrowing ex ante from government to the private sector works its way out in the financial markets is also related to this   Not if the elasticity of the demand and supply of funds is different between the two sectors, as it surely is   [Some of those effects] obviously are occurring today    12/22/92   There is another possible way of looking at this If the federal borrowing requirement is lowered and a cost is imposed on the economy or on business, there's also the perception that economic activity will slow in the process And that would not fully offset the downward pressure on long-term rates that would occur as a consequence of the reduction in the budget deficit   It depends on the elasticity of demand for financial instruments and the incidence of the costs and the incoming productivity trends The net effect of that has to be to lower GNP It's a tax and its effect really depends on what is done   Yes Any other questions?   Further questions? If not, who would like to start our Committee discussion?   President Keehn   President Parry   President Forrestal   President Boehne   Excluding California   President Melzer   President Hoenig   President Stern   President Syron   President McTeer   Didn't that cause something of a riot?   Do you have a question, Bob?   Are you about to suggest something? [Laughter]   What is the difference at this stage as you see it between northern and southern California?   Governor Angell   Governor LaWare   President Jordan   They are including Canada in that?   Vice Chairman   That could be the ending of the campaign!   Governor Lindsey   Governor Kelley   Governor Mullins   We didn't appreciate it   Governor Phillips   We have coffee out there or will have momentarily, if it's not there already  [Coffee break]   We have just learned that the NBER has ruled that the current recovery began in March 1991  SPEAKER(?) It's not a really timely call   If you think you can match that, Mr Kohn, you're welcome to try!   Questions for Don?   Governor Lindsey   President Parry   We could actually [target] nominal GDP, but we'd come out awfully [unintelligible] on the policy side The problem I have with that [and a reason we're] not doing it is the forecast, which doesn't readily address itself to this automatically Look, the whole purpose of money targeting is that it is a proxy for nominal GDP If we can do it directly, do we need the proxy?  SPEAKER(?) Right   Governor Angell   He views it as real and you view it as price   Which money supply?   Any other questions? Let me start off by first identifying what I consider to be a more buoyant outlook [among the participants] in this meeting than I frankly had expected It's clearly more buoyant than the Beigebook, which is the closest thing we have to a region-by-region look And especially, as Bob Parry points out, if we expunge southern California, things are really moving at a surprising pace I do think, however, that we have to be a little careful about these volatile moves, and that applies in both directions Tom Melzer noted that we were unduly pessimistic last October I would point out, however, that policy didn't change as a consequence of that--that the [policy] mechanism does not capture these swings and I hope it will not As a consequence, I don't think  -27-    12/22/92  we are about to jump on board the most recent swings until we understand what the process is One of the more interesting aspects of what is going on at the moment--it's something that a number have alluded to--is that we basically have a productivity-driven recovery, or more exactly arithmetically the gross domestic product increase is largely attributable to the rise in productivity and to a marginal extent to the rise in average hours worked The outlook for that particular variable is really quite critical to a number of the issues that have been raised around this table There is an interesting question as to whether, in fact, we can have continued strong growth without employment growth Obviously, theoretically we can The question really gets to the issue of whether or not this productivity surge we've been looking at is abnormal or not It is quite unprecedented in the context of how little economic growth we have had since March 1991  There are essentially two hypotheses about what those increases are attributable to, both of which could turn out to be right The first is that the level of output per work hour at the bottom of the recession was quite low relative to the inputs of both physical capital and human capital In a sense that's saying that the economy was not operating at an efficient level relative to its inputs In that case, by just tightening up one can very readily reduce labor input and create within a certain range a rise in output per work hour One presumes that that can continue to increase until we run up to the upper edge of that range, meaning that the existing capital, both physical and human, is being employed at its most efficient levels  The second possibility here is that the norm of long-term productivity growth, which is implicit in this concept of a range, has tilted upward In that case, we're not looking at 1 percent or slightly more than 1 percent [as the norm], but conceivably all of a sudden something has occurred which has changed the longer-term productivity growth [trend] Some anecdotal evidence suggests that there is at least something to that Jerry [Corrigan], I don't know if you remember that breakfast where we had a very interesting representation of manufacturing corporations who were raising the point that this restructuring that is going on had only really begun, which is the same issue that you were getting from the New York [business leaders] It strikes me that what may be happening--and I say "may"--is that we have looked for years and years for the significant impact of productivity growth coming off the major computer input in telecommunications and high-tech capital assets and, as you may recall, we got very little of it I think the reason is that we did not have the software Essentially we could not really employ that degree of computational power without a major upswing in the analytic capabilities in using the equipment In the last five or six years, or maybe a little longer, there has been a very dramatic increase in applicable software One need only look at the stock market price of Microsoft to see the market valuation of this particular asset coming on stream The people Jerry and I were talking to at the breakfast were talking about [unintelligible] systems manufacturing I remember one of the people there was an old friend of mine from a company called which used to put DC motors into the rolling mills of a lot of the steel operations; that was their market So, I raised the question Is the big steel business now basically heavily DC motors? And he said "We don't even    12/22/92  think that way anymore What we think of is complete computer operating systems of manufacturing" If you go around and speak to people, what you find is that in the last two or three years there has been a major change in the way manufactured goods are created And if you look at the data in the nonmanufacturing area, we are finally beginning to see some definite quickening in output per work hour in that area as well  So, what we may well be looking at, and what the restructuring is essentially all about, is the stripping out of big segments of employment Companies are literally taking divisions and just wiping them out A lot of that is directly applicable to the information systems that are created by the telecommunications- computer matrix That is, a very large part of overhead has been communications overhead, meaning in the extreme form [a situation] where everyone just writes memoranda to each other But the communications managerial systems have improved very dramatically to the point where people have been washed out of the system at a very rapid rate  If this is the beginning of something of quite important significance, the question is whether it is in fact saying that our potential GDP is being underestimated Something may be going on here The trouble is that we will not be able to know that for a while It is quite conceivable that part of the problem that we're looking at is that the marginal cost of adding new people is so great at this stage that it may be creating somewhat of an illusion about the relationship between capital and labor; it may be creating an attitude on the part of a number of managers that they just will not hire new people except under duress because the obvious medical costs, employment training, and all the other costs are very large And the big upswing in the temporary employment rolls is really quite impressive and clearly out of line with what the previous history of temporary employment has been  So, we may have a technical problem here which is obscuring what is going on and may be making it appear to be a much bigger issue than it is But what is certainly the case, if the Greenbook GDP figures are right or if those figures are any stronger than that, is that we are going to get one of two scenarios One is that we will get a very marked increase in actual employment growth, because it's difficult to imagine the average workweek going very much higher than it is And if we are at the upper ranges of productivity growth, then the arithmetic of the system basically says that it all falls out to increased employment The alternate scenario is that we are badly missing a major secular change in the productivity trend, in which case this is going to work out somewhat differently It's not clear to me how it will play out in the sense that we do know that without a significant increase in employment, we will run into problems with how to get consumption continuing to [increase], especially when the saving rate is as low as it is And this is a low saving rate despite the fact that we still have significant debt repayment going on The debt pressures are clearly still there  I suspect the outlook, therefore, is a bit uncertain because of secular changes that are occurring, and I'm a little hesitant at this point to argue that we have a clear view as to how it will come out I'm not saying, incidentally, that there are negative elements  -29-    12/22/92  in this There is, however, as pointed out by a number of you and in the excellent memo that the International Division put out, a very clear indication that the rest of the world is in really sad shape We don't need the published data from foreign statistical agencies to tell us what is going on As a number of you have mentioned, in terms of the general view of the multinational corporations, sometime a couple of months ago the order series for the foreign affiliates of US corporate manufacturers all of a sudden just went "bang" There was a hole and Germany apparently just fell off the cliff That's true in a lot of discussions I was a little surprised at the Canadian [situation], but presumably that's not all that much different But there is a potentially fairly significant drag coming from the international side, which affects this [outlook] as well  On the positive side, however, there are two elements that suggest there is considerable support remaining in this buoyancy that we're seeing The first, which hasn't really been mentioned except by Mike in the Greenbook, is that inventory/sales ratios are really quite low And if the economy starts to move faster than is generally expected, then lead times on production, orders, and deliveries will start to move out and the desired levels of inventories in the system will begin to move up We could see even with all the computer-based controls and everything else like that, a bigger inventory accumulation than is forecast in the Greenbook There's nothing like inventory accumulation to feed through to profit margins, which feeds through to capital investment, and it would be very easy to turn the Greenbook forecast into a lower estimate The problem I have with that is the low saving rate Mike wrote somewhere that we have a low saving rate pending the next revision of the national income accounts on what the history is all about That may be a very prescient insight We do know that as existing home sales begin to move up, as indeed they have, we are creating realized capital gains on the sales of homes which in turn are substantially financed by net increases in mortgage debt on existing homes [The result is] cash to the sellers of homes which is unencumbered cash and is not all that distinguishable from disposable income That means, in effect, that there is more income and more household savings--or at least it's perceived as savings--on the part of the household community They basically look not only at the existing stock of wealth and how it's changing but also, as is obvious from the data, how it is markedly affected by the actual capital gains cash flow which occurs as the turnover of houses increases  All in all, the evidence we're looking at clearly has taken on a better tone and potentially a very significantly better tone for the longer run if productivity and potentially [favorable factors] that may be emerging are real and not just going to boomerang On the other hand, I do think we have to be careful about being overly buoyant because it's very difficult with the extraordinary globalization of the world's economies to believe that the United States can move in any vibrant manner independently of what is going on in the rest of the world So, we have concerns, mainly with regard to the rest of the world We don't have any real insights into what could happen in the event there is a major political turnaround in Russia or the Ukraine or elsewhere These are orders of magnitude, if they occur, that would have extraordinary impacts for one on our defense budget Think of what would happen to defense appropriations if all of a sudden there were a totalitarian swing in Russia The  -30-    12/22/92  turnaround [in defense spending] could be quite remarkable and, needless to say, would have a very important effect on economic activity  In closing, I merely want to say, listening to the discussion around this table, that we clearly have moved away from asymmetry toward ease and have moved somewhat in the other direction How far we go or what is the longer-term future for policy will unfold over time But I must say that I am encouraged by what I have heard around this table so far   President Parry   President Jordan   Let me respond, incidentally, to Dick Syron's body language, which may have occurred because I've been holding back so far from making a recommendation Basically I think you are inferring that I would go beyond symmetric The answer is That is not my view at all   Vice Chairman   President Boehne   President Forrestal   The challenge is not now; it's ahead in the meetings in the future   Governor Angell   President Hoenig    12/22/92   President Keehn   President Stern   President Melzer   Governor Kelley   Governor LaWare   President McTeer    12/22/92  MRMCTEER "B" symmetric   President-elect Broaddus   Governor Lindsey   Governor Phillips   Governor Mullins   Wayne, I must admit that you got everybody's attention! I think we have a fairly uniform position in this institution and I would ask the Secretary to read a "B" symmetric directive   Call the roll    12/22/92   Good morning, everyone The usual procedure, as you know, is to approve the minutes first But prior to doing that I'd like to call on Governor Mullins   I might say that what has happened here is that the arcane terminology of the Federal Reserve is being used against us  The normal notion of what is in the minutes of corporations, as you well know, is three paragraphs When it gets to the fourth paragraph everyone objects because it's getting too specific And that's usually after a whole day's meeting! The impression I have of this issue is that by any stretch of the imagination these are minutes What we used to term "minutes" is not the usual employment of the term in corporate America What corporate America terms "minutes" is far closer to what Governor Mullins and his committee suggest we put out We're merely taking an action to alter the language, which is creating a regrettable difficulty for us as I see it   I have no doubt that there will be such comments   No, we won't announce anything; we will just do it And that doesn't have that kind of--   If I may just interject I've been thinking about this overnight I don't know of any minutes that have an executive summary, and I would question whether that is a desirable move if our basic purpose is merely to put out something that is more inclusive of the available information The executive summary doesn't address that problem    3/23/93   What's left!   Given the full policy record, isn't he inclined to do that anyway?   I think you're raising a separate issue, which ought to stand on its own merits, and that is whether we look good or bad As I understand the proposal that Governor Mullins and his subcommittee are making, it is to consolidate already existing documents and in effect not to create anything new It's the new that I think we want to avoid in this particular context And as far as I'm concerned, the issue being raised should be on the table at some point and maybe we ought to discuss it; it really should be in the context of the subcommittee's work But I personally don't feel comfortable with anything new in here In fact, the message is precisely to make the point that there is nothing new, not that we're trying to improve this   Do I gather from the discussion that apart from the executive summary the recommendation being made by Governor Mullins' subcommittee is acceptable to the Committee? If I hear no objection, I will presume that that is in fact the case On the issue of the executive summary, I think there's a technical problem at this stage Tom Melzer raised perhaps only a few of the problems he would have raised if he had had a chance to look at the proposed summary in the normal course of events to make amendments, and I assume there are others here who would have the same problem The notion of an executive summary has merit and it ought to be discussed, but I would like to recommend that we postpone it for now In other words, I propose that we release what we already have put together and discussed without the executive summary and if it seems desirable to consider the latter, to do so at the next meeting or the one after I personally have mixed feelings about it I'm not saying that I wouldn't necessarily vote for it, but my initial reaction is to be a little cautious In fact, I haven't given it terribly much thought so I don't want to say one way or the other how I may come out in the end I'm not sure how mechanically we can effectively implement the executive summary even though we don't desire to do it this time; it just means we have to postpone the whole thing until the next meeting Does anyone have any comments on that?   What it reminds me of more than anything is the communique of the G-7, which takes half of the meeting to argue out If we're going to have an executive summary, it is a statement of policy of the FOMC Everyone legitimately is going to want to get his views in on exactly how it is phrased, and I suspect that that may take a lot more time than anyone contemplates at this stage I would recommend that we go ahead and vote on the new version of the "Minutes of the FOMC," excluding the executive summary at this time, and would ask whether there is any objection to that Hearing none, would somebody like to move what we now will call the "Minutes of the FOMC Meeting"?  SPEAKER(?) So moved   It has been seconded Without objection it is approved Let's move on to Bill McDonough on foreign currency operations Bill    3/23/93   Questions for Bill?   Let's move on to the Domestic Desk   Questions for Joan?   How does the market respond to the notion that if a weakness is propelling the decline in long-term rates, why when the economy was a lot weaker than it is now weren't long-term rates lower?  -6-    3/23/93   The reason I raised the issue is that when you're looking at a 10-year or 30-year bond you're looking at basically either inflation expectations or real rates And to the extent that over that time horizon expectations of a weaker economic [performance] would have impacts on those [rates], then you can't really argue that the passage of a year or two can affect that That means that since a year ago the longer-term outlook was far weaker than it is today, one would expect that long-term rates would be lower than they are today if that were a substantial explanation   Yes In other words, to the extent that short- or intermediate-term weakness is driving the long-term rates lower, the question is Why didn't recent periods in which the economy was perceived to be much weaker not change the rate? I'm not talking about the rate of change in long-term rates; I'm talking about the level, which is what is crucial to this discussion   Prices?   My own explanation is, however one looks at this, that this is a decline in inflation expectations And I could argue that we had a weak economy, say, a year or so ago without the expectation of significant change in long-term inflation That's what strikes me as the only credible explanation, whether you attribute it to the budget deficit or policy or any variety of other [factors] That's what makes sense   President Broaddus   Any further questions? If not, would somebody like to ratify the actions of the Desk? I assume there have been some!   Would someone like to move it?  SPEAKER(?) Move it   Is there a second?   Okay The next meeting is--   May the 18th  END OF MEETING  -47-       Without objection Mr Prell   Questions?   President Jordan   President Parry   Further questions for Mike? If not, who would like to start the Committee's discussion? Ed   President Forrestal   President Keehn   President Parry   President Broaddus   President McTeer   President Hoenig   President Syron   President Stern   President Jordan   Governor Mullins   President Melzer   Vice Chairman   Governor Angell   Governor LaWare   I measured the decibel level and Wayne is about 3 or 4 percent higher than his normal!   Governor Kelley   Governor Phillips   Governor Lindsey   I think we have cold coffee!  [Coffee break]   Mr Dave Lindsey  -33-    3/23/93   Thank you, Dave Let me start off by making a few purely self evident observations One, at a 3 percent funds rate and effectively zero or slightly negative real rates, there is no way that we can stay at this level for any extended period of time without courting the types of problems that emerged in the late 1960s and the late 1970s For us to fail to be fully cognizant of the mistakes that were made in the past would be extraordinarily unfortunate for the economy, the country, and a lot of its institutions And when we do move, it's unlikely that everybody will cheer, needless to say; they never do Indeed, if we waited until the cheering was there, we wouldn't be doing the job that we have to do and are called upon to do  In my judgment this is not the time to be immediately concerned about this problem I do not disagree that the measured price indexes are showing some firming I think, as Governor Mullins said, that the CPI is an interesting construct If we take it apart in very considerable detail and realize how it is put together, our general confidence in its ability to measure prices does not get enhanced It's like sausage meat Nonetheless, it's measuring real things A problem that I have with looking at the data at this stage is the issue that a number of you raised earlier--namely, that the cost structure is not going anywhere The underlying materials costs are There is a significant firming trend in a large series of materials prices and I think that's going to continue I don't think we have seen the full effect of endeavors to increase profit margins from the price side in a number of manufacturing products, including chemicals, paper, and [others] And I must say that I'd be most surprised if we did not see a firming in the general price level The increases in steel prices very obviously are being significantly assisted by trade policy, which is as [dangerous] a process as one can get into; fortunately it [does not extend to] too many other places but it is a very dangerous type of policy, which I think we are all deeply aware of  I think everything we can see is exceptionally well behaved in the crucial area of labor costs, which on a consolidated basis obviously comprise the great chunk of our underlying cost structure There is no ambiguity here; wage rates are clearly under control And we are not yet seeing, despite our saying that we might, any signs of a significant pickup in contract wage pressures on the union side, which incidentally is now a very small part of the economy--and it's an even smaller part if you take out the government workers that have unions The major area of wages in our system is basically outside the union area; and compensation, which is far more important these days than the underlying wages, is [not] under very significant pressures One of the reasons we have seen such a huge increase in temporary versus non-temporary employment over the last several years is that the underlying cost structure is enforcing pressures to restructure, [inducing firms] to go to temporary workers to try to alleviate all sorts of costs And basically that is succeeding That is, unit labor costs clearly are under very significant restraint Productivity is picking up in a fairly substantial way, and I suspect it is basically real Having said that, however, it is a mistake to try to look at the price indexes or the cost indexes themselves as an  -34-    3/23/93  indication of anything other than what history has been I don't know of any really significant inflationary pickup that has been foreseen very far in advance I might also add that I've never seen deflation foreseen very far in advance either The forecasting capability in this area, especially through econometric models, is very dubious  The one major factor that gives me great concern about moving too fast in the area of restraint is that we have at this stage a still severely impaired financial system The ordinary structure of moves that the Fed takes is usually to restrain credit growth And the purpose of restraining credit growth is because we perceive very extraordinarily expanded credit as feeding the underlying inflationary fires In fact, while we all talk in one form or another about NAIRUs and slack and the like, as far as monetary policy is concerned we are looking at or should be looking at the financial system because it is our job to restrain the expansion of credit before it becomes an inflationary force in the economic system At this particular stage, there is absolutely no evidence that we have anything other than an extraordinarily restrained credit and financial system Leave M2 aside; M2 is a different problem We are not getting an aggregate level of finance that is anywhere near being consistent with very strong nominal GDP growth What we find is that we are getting a significant profit margin opening up which is financing a good deal of the activity [Businesses] are financing essentially from cash flow, not from credit So, the way I look at this particular system is that I think at some point we are going to have to move; and I think we're going to have to move in a somewhat aggressive manner It's just that I cannot get myself to believe that this is the particular point  I'm worried that if we galvanize ourselves too soon and the economy slips back or sags or if we should get two straight months of very low inflation, we will dissipate the vigilance that I think is required here I'm worried that in endeavoring to move too soon or getting ourselves psyched up to move too soon we will find ourselves in the same position, though in exactly the opposite direction, that we were in 6 or 8 months ago And I remember sitting here and saying in effect that unless the economy picked up in two weeks we would have to move I knew at that time that if there had been a vote on the table to lower the rate structure, it would have passed I'm saying to you that we have to be very careful about reacting to short-term numbers The problem that I have is that I cannot get myself to believe--and I'm more than willing to be convinced--that we can have the type of accelerating inflation problems we've been trying to constrain without first seeing some evidence in the credit markets If we're going to restrain economic activity without constraining credit growth, I say to myself Well, we could stop acceleration in inventories but we are not going to do it with 25 basis points; we can try 400 basis points and that may not be enough We can constrain the growth in capital investment by getting a significant reversal in the bond market, and I agree fully with Jerry Corrigan's concern Frankly, if I were in the private sector at this stage, I would be having fits on the bonds in my portfolio This bond rate decline is running faster than I think it probably should, granted the particular evidence Then there is the stock market, which is high at this particular stage So, I must say that I've listened to this discussion--and I've been in the forecasting business since the late 1940s--and I will tell you this business cycle is different from anything any of us has seen It has different dynamics; it has  -35-    3/23/93  different characteristics; and the one thing I cannot get myself to believe is that we are at the point where inflation has accelerated I think we're going to get to that point; and if we stay at this funds rate indefinitely, we are inviting a major problem It's just that I think the time is not this meeting It may be the next meeting David Mullins raises an interesting point that there are two CPIs to be released between this meeting and the next one  I must say I almost prefer that we make our next move out of a symmetric directive rather than an asymmetric one because I'm not sure in this context that we're going to be dealing with evidence that's going to become very clear except very close [to the time for a decision] My feeling is that when we have to move we may have to do so with very little advance notice because this is such a different type of phenomenon Having said all of that, I would like to put on the table that we do nothing at this stage; that we stay symmetric but recognize that the risks are on the up side from a policy action standpoint I don't want to put that in the directive because if we were to move at this stage to an asymmetric directive tilted toward tightening, we would set in motion some of the other forces that we don't need My view is that when we have to move that we should move and not get terribly involved in how we say it or how it is structured in terms of asymmetric directives or the like So, I would say that my preference at this stage is to stay where we are and be vigilant But I do acknowledge most of the issues that have been raised by Wayne Angell, David Mullins, and a number of the others here That there is a potential here of our being caught behind the curve and that if we get caught behind the curve, we are going to have to catch up very quickly As everyone knows, when you have to catch up you have to go faster and harder than you ordinarily would, and that's what usually causes the next recession If I believed that's where we were at this stage, I would be jumping up and down [in favor of moving] But I must tell you that when I talk to people and look at the details of what is out there in the economy and the structure of the financial system, the presumption that we are at the cusp of significant inflationary pressures does not yet strike me as credible The next meeting I may say to you that I've now seen enough to say that something has fundamentally changed I cannot in all honesty say that that's what I see out there now So, that's my impression at this stage   Let me put it this way It involves an implicit premise that the wonderful security that we've kept here for the last number of months will continue  -36-    3/23/93   No, on the contrary, I think if anything we were very cautious on the down side in trying not to be ahead of the curve On the up side we have to be I think that's in the nature of a central bank because if we are too easy coming down, we set into motion a secular upward bias [in inflation] There should be asymmetry in that respect; we should be ahead of the curve on the up side and behind the curve on the down side   Well, we can't be too far ahead of the curve because the markets don't give that much advance notice Governor Lindsey   I would say it's certainly significant evidence, but we'd have to make certain that-- Well, let me put it this way The CPI strictly by itself and only by itself I'm uncomfortable with If we don't get other evidence on the underlying cost structure of the economy or in the financial system that is confirmation, it's an interesting [question] of what is happening in those indexes I don't know the answer to that; I don't think I have enough information in just the numbers you gave   Well, that is the consideration I think we'd have to be aware of In other words, if we get evidence that is significant and of concern [to the markets], I would say that we'd have to move If we were at a 5 or 6 percent funds rate, I'd say we probably could sit tight But at this [funds rate] level I think the bias is [to move] since we know we can't stay here I don't disagree with what Governor Angell had to say on the issue of [reducing inflation] from its current levels But I'm hesitant at this stage to think in terms of hypothetical considerations This is such a complex issue that we really want to know what else is going on at all times But I do agree that if we are in a position where the markets think we should be moving against the CPI and we do not, we're in trouble President Jordan   It was to supplement, not to move away   Nor do we at this point!   Is that a question!   President Forrestal   President Syron   President McTeer  -40-    3/23/93   President Boehne   Did you indicate a preference on the sentence?   President Hoenig   Governor LaWare   A man of few words President Keehn   Vice Chairman   President Stern   Governor Kelley   President Broaddus   Governor Phillips   Governor Mullins   President Melzer   Then we're several months late   Governor Angell   Governor Lindsey   I was saying What do you do in an environment in which the credit markets are dead and you decide you want to slow down the economy? The question is Why do you do it? The other question is How do you do it? And I say that under those conditions you need extraordinarily stringent tightening whereas if you're responding against a credit expansion you can do it by increments   When was the last time you saw inflation without support from the credit market?  -45-    3/23/93   You're taking alternative--   Alternative language?   Okay Let's try "B" symmetric with the alternative language   Call the roll   Good morning, everyone There are going to be thunderstorms this morning, but I trust that we can integrate them in an appropriate [unintelligible] that is in sync The impression I get is that the authorities up above, knowing that this is Jerry Corrigan's last meeting, have decided to let us know they are aware of that If anyone can read the drumbeat as to whether it's pro or con Jerry, please let us know We, of course, are going to be having a farewell lunch in Jerry's honor in Dining Room E after the meeting  Let me say before we start You may recall that a number of meetings ago I raised some questions about the security of this operation which--to use a kind word--was "dubious" for a while I think our record in recent months, indeed pretty much back to the end of last year, really has been extraordinarily good I cannot honestly say that I have seen a comment that I would unambiguously read as coming out of an FOMC meeting I think you are all aware that what will be going on here today has very considerable interest outside So, all I would suggest is Let's not lower our guard Let's be cautious, and I think we can fend off the clever endeavors on the part of a lot of our media friends on the outside who will try to infer how this meeting came out I don't request anything new; I think what you've been doing is fine Let's just have an awareness not to let our guard down inadvertently  I will raise some questions [later] in the proceedings when we get into our discussions about exchange rates, concerning which I have a memo from our colleague, Ted Truman I'd like to read it to you so you will be up-to-date on what the issues are It relates somewhat to this confidentiality issue but it's not directly in that context, so I'll leave it for later Shall we start off? I ask for a motion to approve the minutes for the meeting of March 23  SPEAKER(?) So moved   Is there a second?  SPEAKER(?) Second   Without objection Al Broaddus, I assume, is available at the moment to give us a rundown on the very interesting work with which his group has been involved   Is he going to have to take an exam on what's in those volumes?   Thank you   I must say I didn't have a chance to read the fat books but I did read the summary, and it really is useful in segregating the various types of problems that confront us I'm not saying that I feel overly encouraged about different means that we could employ other than what we are doing I guess we all hope that somewhere down the line we're going to be able to deviate from "funds only," if I may put it that way, as a policy But I think the type of data systems that you set up for an evaluation will enable us to continue until we can fundamentally come to grips with a view that presumably for us [fed funds] continue as our optimum operating policy procedure  Questions for President Broaddus? [Hearing none,] I guess everybody has read the two books and all the questions have been answered!   And thank you very much, indeed We'll now move on to Gretchen Greene and operations of the Foreign Desk   Thank you very much Let me just add something about that intervention episode It resulted from fairly close coordination between the Fed and the Treasury When we began over here to see the spillover effects on the exchange rate, on the bond market, and on the stock market, the notion of a deterioration in confidence became, I think, somewhat more evident than it had been previously We had been arguing here that we had a necessary condition to get a response in the market from intervention because the market did not expect intervention, meaning it was net short And in our discussions with the Treasury we suggested that a two-pronged approach be initiated that day One was to intervene moderately in the market but visibly This clearly came as a surprise to the market; just watching the screens one could immediately see a variety of the shorts begin to cover Concurrently, we knew that there were opportunities for both Messrs Bentsen and Summers to make remarks that day, considering the fact that in the period immediately preceding, the President--and obviously even earlier Secretary Bentsen  -4-    5/18/93 -5-  and Secretary Brown--had made comments which suggested, as Gretchen pointed out, that there was perhaps some concerted American policy to strengthen the yen The truth of the matter is that no such policy existed These were in the nature of ad hoc comments by commentators who were not discussing American policy, but really were observers of the scene who concluded that history tells us that if the exchange rate of the yen rises, the Japanese surplus will fall In fact, we are not certain what would happen Indeed, my suspicion is that if we actually tried to create changes in exchange rates by consistent intervention, the secondary consequences in the markets, mainly in the expectations area, would very likely make the correlations which are fairly robust between real exchange rates and current account deficits break down So, what we were trying to do was to indicate that these comments were nothing more than academic discussions about relationships I think we were about 20 percent successful, which is about 10 percent more than I would have thought But it came out pretty well In fact, I told [my colleagues] that I thought the [outcome] that day was about as good as it gets in this endeavor to intervene in the markets and not to expect that there is an easy process here by which one can readily manipulate exchange rates To his credit Larry Summers, who is very knowledgeable about all of this, has been very cooperative with us; he has made certain to keep us fully informed about any issues and discussions that they have been involved in, and we have tried to reciprocate Hopefully, that process will continue Any questions for Gretchen? Tom   Do you mean before or after?   Well, remember, the statements came after the intervention The intervention was a perceived success, if one puts it in those terms, before the statements were made But I think the statements reinforced it; that in large part turned around the concerns that existed It was probably not that it moved the dollar higher, but that it may have forestalled an erosion of some of the gains that had occurred earlier in the day as a consequence of the intervention   Any other comments? Let me just take a minute to fill you in on some comments that I heard at the Basle G-10 meeting the weekend before last and early last week There was quite an extraordinary number of subdued people in Europe; there is an underlying fear that that system is continuously eroding They are continually revising down their estimates; they are talking as though the upturn is somewhere off in the future, whereas earlier in the year they were talking--in sort of government-speak--about the turn being at hand and the official forecasts were [being revised] up The mood was really quite a good deal more subdued last week They're particularly concerned about the shortfalls in revenues impacting on their budget deficits The French were, I think, particularly traumatized by that The mood is really very soft--if anything, the worst I've seen this year The British obviously are feeling somewhat better, but even among the Brits a slightly hollow cheerfulness is evolving  In any event, let me turn for a minute to an adjunct on this exchange rate discussion and read to you three points that Ted Truman is recommending relative to our discussions about exchange rates It comes basically out of the experience that we've observed first with Secretary Bentsen, then the President, and then Secretary Brown Item one Exchange rates are like interest rates, and if a central banker discusses one, the central banker will be understood to be discussing the other The best comment for the Federal Reserve is "no comment"  [Item two] We are going through a delicate period in terms of exchange rates and, any talk, no matter how analytical, is likely to take on exaggerated importance Even a "no comment" from someone who has previously commented is a comment My answer is that the best    5/18/93  way to handle that is to ask the reporter "May I go on deep background?" Then, when they shake their heads, I say "no comment"  Item three The new Administration, or at least those parts of it with which the Federal Reserve deals regularly, is sensitive to the fact that talk about exchange rates, loose or any other kind, tends to be unconstructive While it would be foolish to think that the Treasury Department would be able to shut down entirely all other sources of Administration comment on exchange rates, it is somewhat embarrassing if the Federal Reserve becomes part of the problem Of course, the Treasury from time to time may feel it is necessary to make an official comment on exchange rates, but we hope that those comments are deliberate and well considered The recent record shows that the Treasury is prepared to work with the Federal Reserve on such occasions That's the end of Ted's comments and I must say I fully subscribe to them  Let's move on We have to ratify the actions taken by the Desk with respect to intervention against the yen I would ask somebody to move it   Is there a second?   Without objection Let's move to Bill McDonough and the operations of the Domestic Desk   Questions?   Any other questions for Bill? If not, would somebody like to move to ratify the actions of the Desk?   Do I hear a second?  SPEAKER(?) Second   No, I don't consider that a restriction on me This is something that I want to do I think it is important that I get the views of this Committee before making this particular decision Frankly, I don't consider it a diminution of the Chairman's power; I want to emphasize that   Well, let me put it this way I've been around this Committee for a number of years and I think I can say that I pretty much know how every single member of this Committee would come out under [any given hypothetical] event In other words, I could take the vote myself if I had to and I bet I'd get it on the nose three times out of four! The reason for that is that I know where you're all coming from We get updated periodically on what our basic views are So, I don't consider that a major concern Obviously, I'm not arguing that we are setting any precedents; this is not a precedent This is something quite extraordinary I hope that we don't have to talk again shortly; but if we do, we shall And with that I would like to get a vote on an asymmetric directive and have the Secretary read it   Call the roll  MRBERNARD Chairman Greenspan Yes Vice Chairman Corrigan Yes Governor Angell No President Boehne No President Keehn Yes Governor Kelley Yes Governor LaWare Yes Governor Lindsey Yes President McTeer Yes Governor Mullins Yes Governor Phillips Yes President Stern Yes   Officially our next meeting is when?   July 6-7 I assume that all of you are joining us for lunch to give our best wishes to Jerry  END OF MEETING  -55-       Without objection We now move to Mike Prell Mike   Well, this is a very crucial period for us And even though Mike Prell went on at some length, I'd like to weigh in and add to his comments Let me just say in looking at these data that I come out with the same concerns you do, Mike The problem that we're confronting is one in which we have to be able to understand what is causing the price movements we are seeing here that have deviated from our most likely expectations I think we can rule out that the usual money and credit phenomenon is pushing inflation  -8-    5/18/93  We can barely find the figures even though they've come up a bit; we have a very faint pulse but not much more than that You raised interesting questions about the labor market slack issue and I do agree that there's something there, especially the size of the defense adjustment that's going on But there, too, it is rather tough in my view, with the excess capacity especially abroad and the labor market questions that we have here, to argue readily that there is something of significance working There are some elements that I think do clarify the issue One is that profit margins very clearly have been rising, and rising quite significantly In the context of coming off rather weak demand, and a cumulative weak demand, it's pretty apparent that there has been a considerable endeavor to restore margins from subnormal levels and that this process is [being reflected in] very formidable profit figures that continue to emerge not only for the industrial sector but pretty much across the board We probably haven't run through that process as yet but it's obvious that the higher profit margins get, the less they can be expected to continue to move higher And correct me if I'm wrong, Mike, but in the Board's model, as margins rise, the pressures on prices fall The high margins imply that we will begin to get softer prices as the momentum from the rising margins ceases to be able to be carried through I don't know if we're there yet, but there is something very specifically there  An issue you didn't discuss that I do think is of some importance, but frankly I don't know the order of magnitude, is the protectionism that has been emerging very subtly but in a pronounced manner There is no way to describe the steel price increases of late other than [as a reflection of] protectionism This is not an issue of there being available supplies from abroad that are pushing our prices down; but squeezing the amount of imports enables the domestic mills to move their prices significantly higher Needless to say, they have done so with alacrity And while [the importance of] steel isn't what it used to be, it's nonetheless enough to have an impact in the durable goods pricing structure that is visible Remember that almost by definition durable goods means "made with steel" And that really tends to spread [the effects] out in a particularly long line  I don't now what the regulatory costs are but as we were discussing in a Board meeting the other day, I'm sure that the Disabilities Act has had some impact on costs We view that and the Clean Air Act largely in terms of capital costs and equipment But remember that on a consolidated basis capital costs become labor costs And in a consolidated sense it doesn't matter whether the pressure on the cost structure is from capital or direct labor because we consolidate out materials; it doesn't matter one way or the other If in fact this is the type of inflation we are dealing with, it is a stagflation type of inflation except for, of course, the profit margins, which are very difficult to deal with My [suspicion] is that it's part of all this I do think the issue that was raised with respect to inflationary expectations may be the most relevant consideration here if what we are dealing with is a continued increase in the general price level That's because in all of our analyses of inflation we endeavor to find the transmission mechanism by which the actions of workers in the wage bargaining process and of managers in price markups take place The conventional wisdom in our models is that [the transmission] is largely induced through changes in psychology That is, labor force and economic slack are supposed to    5/18/93  change people's attitudes But it's only when those attitudes change and indeed we get low [settlements in] wage contracts that the anti- inflation process occurs If we get the slack but nothing happens, all we're saying is that something broke down in the process That essentially means that people--despite the fact that they're losing their jobs and despite the fact that unemployment is rising--still view the outlook as inflationary and they want wage increases Or, alternatively, it means that the business community--despite what we would all view as a very weak economy--perceives that in fact the economy is really strengthening and that they can get price increases And if their customers believe it, the price increases stick But we have to look at the actions that people are taking Clearly, when we get a PPI or a CPI we are looking at the end result of actions taken by people And the question is What is driving them? At the end of the day it doesn't matter what is driving them if in fact they are behaving in a manner that is bringing the price level up This is something that I think we will get into when we get to our policy discussion I hope it is where our discussion will take place because if anybody seriously believes that we can move interest rates at all in this particular context and [unintelligible] choke off [unintelligible] inflation, I would say that history tells us the chances of doing that are zero short of a 200 or 300 or 400 basis point rise in interest rates  So, the question really gets down to how we view this other structure Unless we are willing to abandon fully all of our notions of what has historically created inflation--meaning forget the credit aggregates, forget the slack market issues, forget all of the cost pressures that occur as a consequence of regulations--we cannot readily explain what is happening Unless we're willing to forget all of those elements involved in our ability to forecast--I don't see how we can unless we abandon all intellectual rigor--as far as I can see we cannot explain what is happening other than by this inflationary psychology [process] And that, in my judgment, may in part reflect political questions as to whether there is stability in the system and what the longer-term outlook is--whether in fact there are really serious problems in the long term  I do think the issue that Mike raised about accelerating demand may be quite relevant That is, we were going through the second half of last year on an accelerating path and that could very well have altered the basic expectations of everybody And the actions we are looking at, remember, are historical The price changes that occurred in April, which are our latest price data, probably were made weeks before as far as planning is concerned And the only evidence that we have since then is that wage rates in April have softened considerably That is a somewhat useful cost development As you may have observed in the Greenbook, the Board's staff is reducing [its projection of] the ECI, the employment cost index, for the second quarter; it is down dramatically from the first quarter Therefore, the fundamental issue, as I read the Greenbook, is that the essential thrust of this last acceleration is where the inflation expectations are coming from rather than the politics or anything else If that explanation is true, we should find that out within a reasonably short period of time But I will tell you that at this stage we are pretty much testing the limits of our theoretical knowledge as to what the actual inflationary process is really doing  -10-    5/18/93  There is also the obvious question as to whether the price data themselves are creating problems for us For example, a not insignificant part of the April CPI is a big increase in owner equivalent rent, which popped up If one looks at owner equivalent rent as a ratio to the quality adjusted price of homes--a sort of rate of return estimate--that has been rising fairly significantly of late And that's not what one would expect in the rate of return; one would expect it actually to be going in the other direction Now, I don't put much weight on either the numerator or the denominator of that because, as you all know, the sample that is taken on owner equivalent rent, which accounts for something just short of 20 percent of the total index, is dubious and highly unstable So, it is conceivable that the implicit price forecast in the Greenbook is right; and that would mean that all of a sudden the rate of price increase will slow fairly dramatically But I will say this The fact that Mike shows a significant amount of humility [is] something that I think is relevant to this type of analysis All I can suggest is that anyone who in their comments around the table can add anything to what we know about this price process will contribute a great deal to our colleagues' base of information, which as I see it is pretty slender indeed at this particular stage Who would like to start off?   President Stern   What, incidentally, is the accounting addition of import prices on the CPI? In other words, to what extent are import prices affecting the CPI and in what direction?   President Jordan   President Syron   Any further questions for Mike? If not, would somebody like to start the roundtable?   President Broaddus   President Parry   President Keehn   President McTeer  -20-    5/18/93   President Forrestal  FORRESTAL Mr Chairman, things are looking fairly good in the Sixth Federal Reserve District Economic activity in the area has continued to expand in the early months of this year And perhaps more significantly, the expansion is now fairly broad-based since it has spread to several industries that previously had been lagging, namely financial services, communications, and manufacturing As the expansion has become more widespread, a number of long-standing fiscal problems of the states in terms of their financing have begun to ease, and I think that will have implications as the federal fiscal policy emerges The manufacturing industry has benefited from fairly good activity in single-family housing and the continued surge in activity due to hurricane rebuilding in south Florida The auto assembly plants in the District, especially the Saturn and the Nissan plants in Tennessee, are operating at very high capacity And this jump in manufacturing activity in the first quarter has led to considerable job growth in the District In fact, the Southeast accounted for over half of net manufacturing jobs added to payrolls for the nation in the first quarter Even the depressed extraction industry in Louisiana has turned around and, as natural gas prices have increased, activity off the Louisiana shore has risen to levels we haven't seen since 1985 The generally good performance around the District is dominated by Georgia and Florida, where sales tax receipts have been very strong; but other states have seen improvements as well As I've indicated, even Louisiana is beginning to emerge from the doldrums So, [the improvement] is not only broad-based in terms of economic    5/18/93  sectors but geographically as well Now, this better performance than the nation may not continue very long because the activity due to the hurricane rebuilding will begin to slow  The one serious negative note that I've picked up--and it has been referred to before--is the uncertainty about the fiscal and political situation Tom Hoenig heard it 100 times; I think I heard it 110 times in the last three or four weeks It's ambivalent in the sense that the business people in the Southeast, as reflected in my report, are fairly optimistic about their own businesses and what might be emerging in the economy Or to put it another way, they're not unduly upset about the first-quarter numbers But this uncertainty about the fiscal situation may very well begin to be reflected in business investment and employment plans for the rest of the year Business people are telling me constantly that they're not able to begin to do their business planning because of the fiscal situation and the health care problem  In spite of the good economic activity and in spite of the inflation numbers that have been reported, I don't hear anybody talking about price increases at all They're not seeing them at the wholesale level and to the extent that any of them have tried to pass any prices increases through--the minimal increases that have occurred--they are not able to make them stick At the same time there are no wage pressures at all that I can tell  The credit situation seems to be improving Banks are reporting higher loan demand, particularly in the consumer sector, but they also are seeing better demand in the commercial area  Looking at the national situation, our forecast shows a continuation of the moderate rate of expansion that we've had over the last year Like many others we've revised our forecast down, based on the first quarter primarily, and we're looking at growth in real GDP of about 2-3/4 percent for this year, which is about 1/2 percentage point lower than our previous forecast Overall, it seems to me that the outlook, despite that reduction, is pretty much the same--with the continued working off of imbalances and the slow employment growth that we've referred to before We see the economy as somewhat stronger than the Greenbook and this divergence continues after the second half of the year The difference for the most part is in the area of consumption expenditures, where we see more strength; and we see more inflation notwithstanding slow employment growth I wouldn't want to over-emphasize these differences, however I think our general path is fairly consistent with that of the Greenbook I certainly don't have any insights into the inflation numbers I'm perplexed, as I guess most other people are Thank you   President Stern   President Boehne   President Syron   Governor Lindsey   President Melzer   Governor LaWare   Governor Kelley   President Jordan   Governor Angell   I didn't say it wouldn't change the attitudes; I said it wouldn't change the--    -31-  --the result    5/18/93   Governor Phillips   Governor Mullins   Vice Chairman   I don't know whether the coffee is cold or not, but it's out there  [Coffee break]   David   Thank you, David Questions?   Any other questions? If not, let me start off Frankly, I found this a really interesting meeting in the sense that there is a new view about what is going on out there which I found quite intriguing In fact, I think it explains part of what the big problem is It's interesting to go around the table, especially hearing the presidents, and to get the sense of this political pessimism which seems to have emerged It's a relatively recent phenomenon It's the type of thing that we, of course, have been exposed to inside the Beltway to some considerable extent The Washington Post has been publishing all this to a large extent There  -38-    5/18/93  is some evidence in the political polls, which show a deterioration in the view about where the country is going, etc What is new is that I haven't heard this in the business community at the level that I've been hearing it around here What this suggests to me is a possible explanation of what, indeed, is going on in the inflation area  As I indicated earlier, I don't think one can look toward the fundamentals for an explanation One of those fundamentals is protectionism; but even though it is a key factor, it cannot be contributing a large-size impact on inflation at this stage I think the effects of regulatory changes are real, but again we're talking a minimal effect of 1 or 2 percent It strikes me that what we are dealing with here are very strong and in a certain sense accelerating psychological expectations--pessimism or concern about whether this country has the capability of politically solving the problems which the markets have been terribly concerned about The deficit has been hanging out there for a long while and it is only very recently that [unintelligible] the current services deficit starts to turn up in the long run In effect we've seen in recent years an extraordinary tilt in the yield curve, which is very suggestive of that The long-term view is one which is scarcely positive  Now, if you superimpose a deep-seated pessimism on the outlook and if you argue that the transmission mechanisms that we're all used to are fundamentally psychological, then the reason why slack labor markets affect wages is essentially that people react in a certain way; they [assess] their prospects and they bid in the markets accordingly, and those markets work And it's true, as I indicated before, in the price area as well So, the major issue in examining inflation is not to start where we usually do in trying to look at slack markets and money and credit and to watch the transmission affect the price level It's really important for us to recognize in looking at prices--assuming that prices are correctly calibrated, and there are problems, so obviously that is a question--that the price levels and the wage levels tell us what people are doing And then it's up to us to figure out why they're doing it That they are doing it is without question The question that we've really got to confront is What is the mechanism? I must say, having looked at all of the data and having done all the contemplating that I could, I cannot believe that anything other than inflation expectations is embodied in here Clearly, actual inflation can run up wholly independently of the real world for a while; ultimately, the real world will cave in The problem, however, is that before the real world works, the very fact of the price movements themselves has real world effects So, we're dealing here with a very interesting problem in which the underlying inflationary expectations can have real world effects We cannot view this type of outlook by stipulating that there are fundamentals and then there is the psychology, because that's not what happens What happens is that when interactions begin, they basically change the fundamentals  Now, I don't know whether or not this [increase in] inflation is a bubble or a blip as some of you said I don't know whether it's deep-seated and irreversible It may well be that the President will get his budget passed very quickly and this whole [issue] will dissipate That's the expectation on the Hill I frankly don't know whether it's true or false I do know that great certainty at this particular stage about what any of these variables is doing is  -39-    5/18/93  probably ill advised What we have to deal with here is something that I would suspect we have to watch very closely I think Governor Mullins is right that a 3 percent funds rate is too low I think we've known that for quite a long while; the issue has never been that The issue is When do we move? I would suggest that while there is a remote possibility that we may not want to move at some point in the future, it has to be pretty remote  My inclination for today--and I'm frankly most curious to get other people's views--would be to go to a tilt toward tightness and to watch the psychology as best we can By the latter I mean to watch what is happening to the bond market, the exchange markets, and the price of gold, and try to sense whether inflation is accelerating or dissipating It is perfectly credible, having lived through these types of things many times in the past, that this [upturn in inflation] can suddenly begin to deflate It has happened innumerable times in the past I know that both Governors Angell and Mullins have argued that there is a 25 basis point ratchet in the long bond I respectfully submit that you know, more than anybody, that if you really seriously believe that that is a ratchet, it can go either way I must say I agree fundamentally with the philosophy that both of you are raising and the only point I would raise is the rachet issue   That's the point I'm trying to get at In any event, my initial inclination--and frankly this is a very tough issue and one that has all of us sort of swimming around--would be to have a tilted directive and to keep a very close eye on the situation and see day by day what is happening If this [inflationary expectations sentiment] simmers down in the marketplace, then I think the next sign post is what actually happens to the price indexes because that clearly will have a significant psychological effect I also think this is one of the rare times when we ought to have more frequent telephone conferences as events evolve And rather than take any action today, which I don't think would be desirable for a number of reasons, I would very much like as a starting point to go to an asymmetrical directive and then just watch developments and perhaps have one or more telephone conferences until we get a better feel on this We are in an unstable environment and I think it can go either way That would be my recommendation  I have one other issue I'd like to throw on the table I hesitate to do it, but let me tell you some of the issues that are involved here If we are dealing with psychology, then the thermometers one uses to measure it have an effect I was raising the question on the side with Governor Mullins of what would happen if the Treasury sold a little gold in this market There's an interesting question here because if the gold price broke in that context, the thermometer would not be just a measuring tool It would basically affect the underlying psychology Now, we don't have the legal right to sell gold but I'm just frankly curious about what people's views are on situations of this nature because something unusual is involved in policy here We're not just going through the standard policy where the money supply is expanding, the economy is expanding, and the Fed tightens This is a wholly different thing Anyway, I'm most  -40-    5/18/93  curious to get your views in these various respects, so please don't be afraid to throw things out on the table   Yes   Costs?   I'm not sure I referred to "fixed" costs   No, what I was arguing then--remember the two-month moving average on inflation then was higher than it is today and either it was going to come down dramatically or not--was that it wasn't going to matter whether we moved from a symmetric directive or from an asymmetric directive My impression now is that we are truly asymmetric and that we are looking at a process which is different from the one that existed previously I did not have a view that what we were looking at was essentially a risk driven by inflation expectations In fact, I don't think I raised that issue; my recollection eludes me This is different I think this relates to a large extent to the political-psychological issues I thought Jerry Jordan [said] it best When he looks just at the data everything looks fine; when he goes out into the boondocks he sees awful attitudes I don't know how many of you said it; I didn't write it down, but there were five or six of you who said that And it's certainly very startling   Well, that's another way of saying just raise rates   I think we would confuse the market I don't know how they would read that It would take them a long while to figure out what was going on Supposing we intervened for $200 million and didn't sterilize; I don't know what it would do to the funds rate  -41-    5/18/93   Yes, that's frankly my impression   I think it's an interesting idea but it's too complex Why create uncertainty when what we're trying to do is to eliminate it?   This is the longest period we've gone since when without changing the funds rate?   Let me put it this way I would have no intention of acting on that directive without full consultation of this Committee because it's a very important move   That depends The evidence may be sufficiently startling that a vote may not be required The answer to the question is that I don't like to take votes on the telephone; I don't think we've had many and I would prefer not to But this is a very unusual situation, and I'm not sure how I would [do it] We could have a vote in that event   I think that's right   That is a very legitimate issue, and I would be fully willing to agree to that because it does raise an interesting question as to what the meaning of asymmetry is if we're effectively going to go back into a meeting The Desk can move from symmetry as well as asymmetry But it does raise the interesting question as to what would be the appropriate vehicle I do not feel strongly on this question and I would yield to whatever the Committee would be interested in doing   That is a very thoughtful note That's the other side of this argument, and I think it's important to put that on the table   No, not necessarily It would be a judgment that something is deteriorating and the Committee must address it If this simmers down, and I think there's a reasonably good chance it may do exactly that, then we can remain tranquil until, say, the next PPI/CPI comes out If that is tranquil, then we can afford to stay where we are, as far as I'm concerned   Let me put it to you this way My preference is to have an asymmetric directive on the grounds that, as I listen to the Committee, that's my inference as to what the [consensus] is However, it's my inclination on a very serious issue of this nature to consult with the Committee--because it's a very important move if we move--and I think the Committee should be satisfied that everyone has had his or her say in this regard In that context, I don't think it's going to look that bad whether there is a symmetrical directive or not The question basically is the choice of the Committee as far as I'm concerned Vice Chairman Corrigan, you've been around here for a long time What's your view?   When you say "look a little better," look a little better in what sense?   I think the substantive issue here is a crucial one, and how we want to handle it relates to the secondary picture of the question President Broaddus   You're raising an interesting point There's a timing question here Let me just say for the sake of argument that we move from a symmetrical directive three weeks from now because of certain events that are occurring If we do that, it gives the impression that we are moving because 24 hours before something happened whereas if we--   It means that there is a process--   President Syron   President Parry   Governor Lindsey   President Keehn   Well, let me just say that I'm not sure that whatever happens in the real world over the next period of time is going to be significantly influencing our decision relative to whether we were symmetrical or asymmetrical Normally when we talk in those terms we are talking about real economic variables and we are looking at whether or not the economy is [weakening] or strengthening It happens in a gradual way Remember that when we were asymmetric toward ease for a long period of time it was because what we were seeing was a gradually sagging economy And we could anticipate how we'd react This is really quite different This is almost a bubble It is either going to go burst and disappear or it's going to build up I don't visualize looking at that sort of process in the same manner I think how we stipulate our directive is probably irrelevant to how we will want to behave So, as I said before, I don't consider it a big deal one way or the other And I don't think it will significantly affect what this Committee does or how we do it I think it's strictly a perception question of how we wish to be recorded in this particular meeting and under what conditions And there are arguments on both sides of that   Let me state that we have another tool, which we're not discussing, that can be used here--not as far as policy is concerned because I think we've all concluded that policy will be what it is--because we're talking now about the question of perceptions We haven't discussed the fact that we do have a policy record--I beg your pardon, minutes And we have the capability in those minutes, depending on how they are stipulated, to characterize what we are doing And that should readily capture the particular  -47-    5/18/93  problems that we are all addressing here So, in viewing this I think we ought to try first to find a means by which to separate what policy is and then to discuss the issue of how we wish to be perceived If we can make that distinction--and from what I can judge I think most of us would be willing to do that--they should be handled separately President Jordan   President Forrestal   President Hoenig  -48-    5/18/93   President Broaddus   Governor Angell   President McTeer   Governor LaWare   President Keehn   President Syron   Yes, having heard the conversation here, I think that's the real question It's not what happens if we're right, but how we want to appear if we're wrong Since we are the central bank, if we're going to be wrong, we should be wrong on the side of preserving the currency That's where I guess our bias should be, provided we don't allow that to affect how we are going to--   Well, I take that as a serious question and I think it's going to depend to a very substantial extent on what happens out there I hate to go out of a meeting with the degree of uncertainty that we have But the uncertainty is real; and we're not going to change the level of uncertainty by making believe that it is unreal Let's face that We happen to be meeting at this particular date because that is what was on our calendar If we were meeting on a different date, we'd probably have a greater degree of certainty about what is going on Governor Kelley   President Stern   Governor Mullins   Governor Phillips   President Melzer   Vice Chairman   I'm inclined to agree strongly with that in the sense that we haven't moved interest rates up since 1989 We haven't moved at all in over six months This Committee is going to be highly visible And no matter what it is we do over the next 3 to 6 or 9 to 12 months, it's going to be quite important for us to be as close as we can to each other In other words, it's important since there's no doubt from our various conversations that the underlying philosophy of every member of this Committee falls within a relatively narrow range in terms of what should be the economic and monetary policy of this country I think it would be very tragic if a group of this extraordinary capability--as Bob Black used to say, this is the best Committee he has seen in all the years he had been on the FOMC-- were perceived to be in disarray It's very important that we act as a Committee and try to avoid, where we can, any evidences that this Committee is in disarray or something of that sort If it ever gets to the point where this Committee is either in disarray or perceived to be in disarray, there is no other institution in this government that can substitute for us And if my [assessment of] what in fact is causing the problems we are confronting is correct--that it's a deep- seated psychological deterioration that continues--it is crucially important that we stand tall as a group and try to find the means by which we can merge our differences in a way in which the vast majority of the Committee can support There have been occasions in the past when I've raised the issue of "Let's try to vote together because it's a crucial issue" but they were very few I think I raised it a couple of years ago; I may have raised it two or three times in the last several years I don't think it's something that ought to be raised often because one of the great strengths of this Committee is the capability, which I think we exhibited today namely, that we have interaction where a lot of minds are changed I know my views changed several times as this meeting evolved because of the evidence and the strength of the arguments that came up That's an extraordinarily valuable facet of this Committee If we at any time endeavored to  -53-    5/18/93  sort of force ourselves into a mold, we would lose that So, there are two sides to this question All I want to say is that Jerry Corrigan won't forgive us if we don't get this right!  In any event, as I read this Committee as to where we stand at this point, there is a significant majority who are willing to support an asymmetric directive, using alternative B I think we are in a position where before any action is taken--or indeed if any evidence emerges that would even raise the question of whether we should or should not act--we would want a telephone conference My best hope is that this whole psychological thing will dissipate, which it could conceivably, that the next set of price data we end up with are benevolent, and that we won't speak to each other for the next six weeks! The chances of that are less than 50/50 But leaving that aside, are there any other issues that people would like to surface at this time before I call for a vote?   Correct   Good morning, everyone The first item, which is not on the agenda, is to welcome our old/new colleague, the new President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York I gather from Norm Bernard--who is the world's greatest expert on all such issues-- that Bill McDonough is not the first Manager to move up to the presidency of the New York Bank; Allen Sproul who was Manager in 1938 to 1941 did the same But you can't be first in everything, Bill! We welcome you and are delighted to see you move up to this side of the table where I can hear you better   That would be novel! [Laughter] The first item on the agenda is approval of the minutes I would ask somebody to make such a motion   Is there a second?   Without objection I'd like to call on Governor Mullins to move the election of the Vice Chairman, who will hold office through the end of this year and until the next election at the first meeting after December 31   Is there a second?  SPEAKER(?) Second   Any other nominations? If not, we have one individual [nominated] and I will ask for yeas and nays All in favor say "aye"  SEVERAL Aye   Thank you I assume that there was somebody out there with a "no" vote, but you didn't want to know about it! Anyway welcome, Bill   I'm looking forward to your working with the rest of us in this new position; the work is not all that much different from your previous activity, but it clearly has a very different spin to it and we wish you well   That was not an answer to your question! For the first item of general business I'd like to call on Gretchen Greene to report on the operations of the Foreign Currency Desk   The first thing is to make sure your microphone isn't covered up by anything!   I don't recall any evidence that the French or any of the others actually have covered their borrowed positions in any [significant] amounts against the deutschemark since the debacle Is that correct?   Well, with the approximately $70 billion--even with, say, a 3 or 4 percent decline in exchange rates or ultimately more--if they're going to have to cover at some point, this will be a very large hit on the budgets of those countries I noticed that there was  Is that true of the other countries as well?   Other questions?   [Unintelligible] just a few minutes ago indicated that that was not his plan That's not an answer to your question, I understand; but that's at least what he said in Tokyo   Any other questions? If not, let's move to the Domestic Desk and Joan Lovett   Questions for Ms Lovett? I guess you covered [everything] Would somebody like to move to ratify the actions of the Desk since the last meeting?  SPEAKER(?) So move   Is there a second?   Okay, the Committee is adjourned for lunch and our next meeting is September 21st  END OF MEETING  -44-       Without objection Let's now move on to our economic discussions with Messrs Prell and Siegman   Questions for either gentleman?   President Parry   Any other questions? If not, who would like to start our tour de table?   I'm delighted to hear Illinois hasn't moved! President Parry   President Forrestal   President Boehne  -10-    8/17/93   President Broaddus   President Syron   You even got the President of the United States in your District!   President Hoenig   President Stern   Spillover!   President McTeer   Sorry about that!   President Melzer   President Jordan   Governor Lindsey   Governor Mullins   I have a blind trust and I'm delighted!   As long as it's a convertible couch! [Laughter]   There is a question about the seasonalities in all these If you look at patterns, it's clear   There's a concept which is credible for long-term real rates, which are stable There is not one for short- term rates In other words there's a cyclical characteristic--   Governor LaWare   Governor Kelley   Vice Chairman   Governor Phillips   Governor Angell   Thank you We now adjourn for coffee  [Coffee break]   Questions for Don?   Governor Mullins  -30-    8/17/93   The full maturity   That is the constant dollar value of the coupon   Which is a different concept   Hoey   If we went to symmetric you say?   Remember that this is a relatively short intermeeting period   My suspicion is that something that would require us to move rates in this period would be such a startling event that I think we'd want to speak--   --just to [consult] each other on what is going on   President Forrestal   Well, may I suggest that these are questions to Don Kohn?   You're getting into policy discussion and that's out of order at this moment   Technical questions to clarify the position of Don Kohn? Any further questions of fact or interpretation  -33-    8/17/93  of what was perfectly clear on the part of Don Kohn? If not, let me start off because I'm going to be getting into exactly that question; let's do it a little more formally Let me just say that I don't have terribly much to say about the economy as such I think it's moving along moderately I think our diagnosis of the forces driving the economy has been reasonably on the mark Some numbers have not been exactly right, but they never are, and that's not really the relevant question Qualitatively, I think we've understood that basically what we are dealing with is an economy confronted with balance sheet problems, problems of excess debt from an earlier period as asset values declined And we basically were confronted with a situation in which we very consciously brought the federal funds rate down to levels below those we could expect to be maintained indefinitely into the future We brought the rate down to 3 percent a year ago on the expectation that the economy would evolve essentially in the way that it has evolved As a consequence of that, we have chosen not to change policy In other words, the presumption is that we got it right a year ago and we've chosen to stay pretty much where we are The concern that we were running into, which one could very readily capture in discussions of this Committee, is that we would fall behind the curve when we had to tighten policy; there was a latent concern that we would lock ourselves in and not move The presumption that at some point we'd have to move the funds rate up as the economy continued to expand I think was fairly pervasive around this table The only question that we kept asking ourselves was when  Above all, I'd say the general philosophy of this Committee has been that, whatever we do, allowing something of the nature of what occurred in the 1970s and the early 1980s [to happen again] would be a real tragedy [We felt] it was essential that we focus on being ahead of the curve [in anticipating inflation] just as we all considered that it wasn't all that terribly important to be ahead of the curve on the down side In other words, this issue of price stability sometimes requires a different type of intermediate-term asymmetry, where we try to be lagging somewhat on the down side but ahead on the up side to offset the bias in our economic system That bias is very clearly in an inflationary direction  With our asymmetric directives early this year and with the Humphrey-Hawkins testimony, I think we ought to be reasonably pleased that we have altered the view of the markets such that the presumption that we will do too little too late on the up side has changed One doesn't have to go back very far to read as a fairly general view that we would be behind the curve and that that would allow inflationary pressures to reemerge Whatever one may say about the last several weeks, that issue has not come up It's dead We have changed the perception of the way the markets are functioning and we have essentially prepped them for an eventual rise in interest rates I was interested as to the way the market would react to this posture that we took It is very hard to argue that if the central bank takes a position that we are going to be vigilant on inflation that [such a position] would make long-term rates go up Now, the answer is that it does happen, and for a very interesting reason Clearly, inflation expectations cannot be perceived as going up, or else we've literally missed the mark But what clearly has happened--and we've observed this recently on several different occasions with our asymmetric directive, with my testimony, and the like--is that we saw what the Vice Chairman called a hiccup It is interesting to ask what that is  -34-    8/17/93  because I think it's important for us to understand what the markets are doing If we eliminate the notion that what we have is [rising] inflation expectations, we are therefore led to conclude that what is going up is real long-term interest rates And the question is why  Obviously, nothing fundamental has changed in the economy, so it has to be something of an expectational variable And the reason I'm certain is that what we are looking at is something we've all perceived all of our lives namely, that whenever there is a major element of uncertainty, or more exactly a diminution in the state of knowledge, the position of a human being is to withdraw As a consequence, whenever one is dealing with any type of asset in which there was a net long position, the creation of uncertainty--meaning the reduction in the state of knowledge of what is going on in the world--leads to a pulling back, a disengaging, which means "sell" That has nothing to do with the type of asset or what it's long-term future is It is not a change in the state of knowledge; it is not an effort to move toward improved liquidity or toward safety Those are rational concepts which are made on the basis of knowledge I'm talking about the proposition in which knowledge is diminished and uncertainty in the true sense of the word occurs If that is in fact the case, what we would expect to occur under those conditions is effectively the type of hiccup that we're talking about namely, it has to be a temporary affair because it cannot last very long So, however one reads these events, they are clearly consistent with that phenomenon But it's important for us to recognize that the presumption that we can go out and basically argue that we are going to suppress inflation and that, therefore, long-term real rates will go down or long-term nominal rates will go down, I think is a misperception and clearly one which is not supported by the data But that is not to say that there's something unexplainable here If long-term rates went up and stayed there, then we would be looking at a different phenomenon But I don't think that's what this particular proposition was  In any event, this whole period, as a number of you have noted, very clearly indicates that we should be quite pleased at the way everything has come out That is, we are essentially in a policy position that we haven't changed for a year That is another way of saying to ourselves, rightly or wrongly, that we think we got it right And I believe the markets think we got it right The fact that the stock market has moved the way it has, the fact that yield spreads have come down, as Governor Mullins indicated, the fact that long-term rates have moved appreciably lower suggest that all the [properties] that are related to monetary policy are behaving in a positive manner One thing that is not is the rate of real growth, which is essentially [a result] of balance sheet restraint and repair, a process we have been observing for quite a long period of time  I conclude from all of this--and this gets to the question of what we mean by asymmetry--that we can afford at this stage to move back to symmetry provided two things One is that we are doing it on the basis that we are encouraged by the inflationary data we have seen and that, therefore, the [prospect] of having to respond to adverse inflationary information has lessened But more important is that we reemphasize our longer-term views that this is not a change in our policy, that indeed we still expect that at some point short-term real rates will have to move higher As a consequence of that, I'd say  -35-    8/17/93  that we have moved tactically, not strategically Frankly, the reason I feel somewhat more comfortable with symmetric--although obviously I could readily be convinced that asymmetric is not a bad position to be in for a lot of reasons, especially those that Don Kohn raised--is my suspicion that we may have to sit where we are now for a number of months And I'm concerned about the credibility of the Federal Open Market Committee sitting with an asymmetric directive time and time again when the purpose of that is essentially to signal an intermediate trend--a philosophy and a strategy, not a set of tactics And while there was no way for us to convey what we have conveyed in a manner other than the way we have done it, I think having done it--and in my judgment having succeeded--we effectively can move forward and go to a symmetric directive The argument for going to symmetric now is that if we don't do it now and the economy continues doing what it's been doing, we run into the tar baby effect When then do we do it? In the same sense that I was concerned that we would get ourselves locked in at a 3 percent federal funds rate when the [inflation] pressures require us to move higher, I'm also concerned that we'd get locked into an asymmetric directive, which we would have great difficulty changing We can change it now because the data are very encouraging and we can lock in If we don't change it now, the rationale of going back to symmetric at a later time will have to be because we perceive the economy to be weakening, and that would involve a wholly different type of reaction on our part If that were to happen, that would mean a different set of policies; that might even change the sense of where we are strategically because that is not implicit in the basic path on which we're going  So, let me just say that I think the issues that are being raised here about the meaning of the directive are very crucial And very importantly, while I don't sense the slightest indication of a desire on the part of anybody here that we should move and literally change the funds rate in the period immediately ahead, I think how we convey our posture at this particular stage will determine whether we in a sense harvest in an effective manner what is a very significant amount of central bank credibility or whether we create difficult problems for ourselves by sending confusing signals So, as you can well imagine, while I'm inclined to go to symmetry, I recognize that there are arguments to maintain asymmetry That is not, as I said, an uncredible position But I'd like to hear arguments against the symmetry position if that's the position that the Committee itself thinks is a more viable one Governor Mullins   Well, they did do a study in the other direction, when rates were going up They looked at the extent to which the long end of the market came down when we raised the discount rate   And I think we saw similar sorts of ambiguities then In theory, if we move in a restrictive direction we would expect long-term rates to fall, or more exactly the forward rates to fall   How would you be increasing them other than the risk [unintelligible] issue that I was raising?   For 10 years?   But I think that's what is happening here   President McTeer   Governor LaWare   President Syron   President Broaddus   Governor Lindsey   Vice Chairman   President Forrestal   President Boehne   Governor Phillips   President Parry   President Keehn   Governor Angell   President Stern   President Hoenig   President Jordan  -42-    8/17/93   Governor Kelley   President Melzer   Since I assume we're going to vote in that direction I just want to raise the caution here to everyone to be very careful about the press because that could be quite damaging to how we wish to proceed on this--whether or not we let the minutes handle it or make an official statement or something of that sort The one thing we certainly want to be very careful about is that an inadvertent remark by somebody in the System about policy strategy and a variety of related issues can create some real difficulties for us in this period In any event, I do read that a majority is supportive of symmetry and I'll ask Norm to read the appropriate paragraph   Okay, would you call the roll   Good morning, everyone We welcome our two new colleagues [at the end of the table] from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York I'll ask as a starter Would somebody like to move the minutes of the August 17th meeting?  SPEAKER(?) So move   Without objection I call upon our Vice Chairman for nominations for slots now open for Manager for Foreign Operations and Manager for Domestic Operations   I just want to note that Joan Lovett was not able to join us today because her mother died late last week and we have Betsy White here as her temporary replacement Nominations have been made Are there any further nominations for either of those posts? If not, I will ask for a motion May I have one from you?   Is there a second?  SPEAKER(?) Second   All in favor say "Aye"  SEVERAL "Aye"    9/23/93   Opposed? The "ayes" have it unanimously We congratulate you, Peter; and I trust that similar congratulations will be extended to Joan at the appropriate time Why don't we start off with Peter with his inaugural analysis of the foreign currency operations   Thank you Questions for Peter? If not--   Is there a second?  SPEAKER(?) Second   Without objection Now, I call on Betsy White Although she has been at several FOMC meetings, she too is making her inaugural presentation   Thank you Questions? If not, would somebody like to move to ratify the actions of the Desk since the [last] meeting?  SPEAKER(?) So move   Is there a second?  SPEAKER(?) Second   We will adjourn, and our next meeting is on November 16, 1993  END OF MEETING  -38-       Without objection Let's now move on to the staff report on the economic situation I call on Messrs Prell and Truman   I'd just like to raise a question with Mike or Ted We discussed very briefly last night this interesting path of long-term rates relative to the simplistic model There's an interesting question that's implicit in this; namely, that if, in fact, this is a primitive model, one could postulate that we could drive the funds rate down to zero, hold it there for a very long period of time--which we have the physical capacity to do--and therefore look forward to a significant further decline in long-term rates Now, obviously, I don't think anybody here believes that that process would happen That raises an interesting question as to whether the relationships that are being picked up in the model are    9/23/93  basically the result of the fact that short-term rates are generally perceived not to be significantly out of line with productivity and that the events that surround the short-term market will eventually begin to affect the long-term market And so long as the Federal Reserve does not endeavor to force the short-term rate away from where it otherwise should be, that model is merely reflecting the fact that the same forces affecting the short-term rate will ultimately affect the long-term rate But I seriously question whether we can infer from that sort of relationship any significant policy issue because I have this suspicion that were we to try to drive that relationship by monetary policy, we would automatically find out as of that day that it doesn't work any more I was just curious to get your response to that [issue which I raised in] our conversation last night   Any further questions for either gentleman? President Jordan   President Broaddus   Vice Chairman   President Parry   Governor Mullins   We don't   President Syron   Any further questions for either gentleman? If not, who would like to start the Committee discussion? President Forrestal   President Keehn   Thank you President Parry  -14-    9/23/93   President Broaddus   Thank you President Hoenig   Thank you President Boehne   President Jordan   President McTeer   Is this a high-price type operation?   President Syron   President Stern   President Melzer   Governor Lindsey   Very interesting   The Koreans and--   Is that going in both directions?  -24-    9/23/93   Right, I would agree with you I think the CRA issue has created a political [fallout] that has gotten out of hand with respect to expectations, and it will be very tough to fulfill a lot of what people are hoping to see   Well, I think it could be appropriately embodied in the minutes of this meeting   Vice Chairman   Governor Angell   Governor Kelley   Except for death and taxes!   Governor LaWare   Governor Phillips   Governor Mullins   They need that for revenues!   Do we have some coffee and some doughnuts?   We'll adjourn for coffee and come back with Don Kohn  [Coffee break]   Mr Kohn   Thank you Questions for Mr Kohn?   Further questions for Don? If not, let me get started But first let me raise an issue which has been disturbing me more than the economy in recent weeks, and that is the initiatives up on the Hill with respect to the structure of the Federal Reserve System As Don Winn will be discussing, there are hearings forthcoming in the next few weeks on the Gonzalez bill, and Senator Sarbanes will be there as well Secondarily there is the issue of the consolidation of regulatory agencies under a central independent agency When I looked at both of those initiatives, I concluded that they didn't necessarily have very much behind them That probably is still a correct presumption, but I'm no longer sure that that is the case We here at the Board, I hope in conjunction with those of you at Reserve Banks, will be increasingly sensitive to the fact that this issue is surfacing and we're going to have to respond to it We are going to have to appear as a sort of partial Committee at the request of Mr Gonzalez I'm going to have to go up there [Given] the people who are being asked to testify before the House Banking Committee, it clearly suggests that we are leaning up against a stacked deck It really is a wholly unbalanced operation But instead of shrugging it off, I'm inclined to increase quite significantly our general positioning to make certain that we don't allow something to sneak up from behind and result in some major changes in this institution purely because we were too complacent In any event, Don Winn will be discussing with us the current initiatives at lunch   The witnesses are all there to say that the Gonzalez and the Sarbanes bills are perfect   Well, ask that of Don Winn; it's not clear what is going to happen In that regard let me just say that we  -34-    9/23/93  have been successful in keeping the issue of the minutes reasonably under cover I think we have to be especially circumspect in the next couple of months and keep our heads down as best we can  Let me just tell you that the last thing we need during this sensitive period is any indication that there is a loose cannon in this organization Maybe I'm being overly sensitive about what the risk to our institution is, but I much prefer to be overly sensitive and too cautious and find out after the fact that it was all unnecessary than to be on the other side of that issue I just want to emphasize that this seems to be bulging in a way that makes me a little more nervous than I'd like to be We'll review that summons a little more with respect to the legislative initiative at lunch, but I didn't want to discuss a number of things at lunch other than just what the legislative agenda is So, I just want to put that on the table  I think the policy questions are less difficult, less a matter of concern The more I look at the data the more I'm inclined to believe, as some of you have hinted, that there is something wrong with the numbers we are looking at It's just not credible to me that we can have a significant rise in employment and in hours both from the payroll series and the household series--two measures that are about as independent as one can get of an economic phenomenon--and say that the GDP indicates productivity declined in the first half of this year Now, I don't know what is going on in the statistical system, but I'm almost certain that out in the real world in an economy that is growing, the thought that we are having declining productivity just doesn't square with my understanding of the real world  Historically we have had alternate measures of output--for example, gross domestic income Granted, the income side of the national income accounts is a little more flaky measure--with the proprietor incomes categories and even some of the profitability numbers--than the output side, which is the reason obviously that the output side is used But if you look at it, you get something that frankly looks a lot more credible You get a much lower rate of increase in gross real incomes in the second half of last year, or more exactly in the growth of gross domestic income in constant dollars; that grew a lot more slowly than the GDP and it was moderately faster in the first half of this year I haven't looked to see what happened to the productivity numbers but my suspicion is they were still going down a little I'm inclined to believe that when we look back at this period with the better annualized data, which may be a year or two years from now, it's going to look better because we can't have the unemployment rate declining, the initial claims falling and, as Governor Mullins said, a tight labor market with average hours of work moving up, and have declining productivity It just doesn't make sense Something is wrong with the data system, and I suspect-- or I hope--that eventually that will get resolved If you look at the  -35-    9/23/93  industrial production index and its counterparts in other elements of GDP, it does look as though it was extraordinary even before the revisions; but with the revision we're still getting some evidence that the real part--the goods part--of the GDP may be running somewhat under what we're picking up in the industrial production index It's a close issue and, frankly, I haven't had a chance to have somebody look at it in the detail that I would look at it But the numbers just don't square If that is in fact the case, we may be not all that far from potential here I'd say the economy is moving [up at a rate] that has to be over 2 percent at this point, maybe 2-1/2 percent I realize that this may seem to be making the figure look the way I think policy ought to run, but since I don't sense that anybody out there is talking in terms of any radical changes, I won't press this issue  The one thing I heard around this table, which I did find rather encouraging, was some semblance of a pickup in transactions in commercial real estate--not in prices But the first stage of a bottoming out of the commercial real estate operation has to be that the number of transactions has picked up, because we [previously] had a terrific decline in the bids for the properties The offering rates came down somewhat, but there was no meeting [of supply and demand] and nobody was doing anything And it's only when the offering rates come down to the bid prices that the thing changes And it's about time because if you look back at when the whole thing began to change, we have experienced a very significant number of periods where leases have been renewed In other words, we've actually had most of the leasing adjustment and the [market clearing] valuations are beginning to emerge and apparently the ice is cracking If we have been dealing with a significant balance sheet stringency problem in both the household and especially in the business area where commercial property collateral has been a critical factor in the whole system of restraint and if this [restraint] is beginning to ease, it may be that we're seeing the first stage [of a turnaround] in commercial banking itself; it may be starting to nudge back And this little modest quickening of M2 may be something; then again it may not be But I don't think the outlook has deteriorated at all; I don't think it has been great on the other side I suspect that eventually we'll come out of this, but I don't think it's going to be soon We still have a way to go [It's clear] looking at the various relationships in the balance sheets that those relationships are not anywhere near back to where they were in 1987 And it should be fairly obvious, having gone through what we've gone through, that if anything the desired equity/debt ratios have probably gone up, not down, since 1987 So, we probably are still working our way through that; but as we've discussed many times in the past, the economy can accelerate its growth before the so-called head winds go to zero  As far as I can see, leaving aside the quality of the figures, the process that we're going through seems to me exactly what we perceived it to be over the last year As I recall, we got to a 3 percent funds rate a year ago I like to interpret that as We finally got it right and decided to sit with it In retrospect it may not be the wrong interpretation that we happened to hit the right level of policy Despite the issues that Jerry Jordan is raising about a lot of things going on underneath, which is unquestionably true, we probably have not been badly fixed for the last year And unless the data that come out a year or two years from now suggest  -36-    9/23/93  that the economy actually is growing far faster than we think and we should have been tightening, my expectation is that we'll look back at this period and say that for once we got it right for a longer period of time than has ever been the case in the history of this institution In any event, listening to what I have heard around the table I don't see any inclination, at least on the part of anyone who has spoken up, to move off where we are, which at the moment is a symmetric and no change directive And I personally don't see any particular reason why we should veer from that prior to the next meeting, which is in mid-November   President Forrestal   Governor Kelley   Governor LaWare   President Hoenig   Vice Chairman   Governor Phillips   President Stern   Governor Mullins   President Parry,    9/23/93   President Melzer   Governor Angell   President McTeer   Anybody else? If not, we'll put that out for an official vote Would you read--   [Call the roll]   Good morning, everyone As you know, the first item on the agenda is a review of FOMC practices with regard to recording and transcribing FOMC meeting discussions and the desirability of preparing more detailed meeting records for eventual public disclosure There are basically two issues to be covered The first is the question of the release of certain FOMC records to the public, specifically the meeting transcript or some alternative detailed document going back [in time] and the discussion record going forward, including of course the question of whether or not to continue to record the discussions The second is the Committee's response to Chairman Gonzalez's most recent request for all tapes and transcripts going back to 1976 I would presume that the decision made with respect to item one will in turn provide the basis for the response to Chairman Gonzalez To start us off, I believe you have documents sent to you from both Virgil Mattingly, who will brief us on the legal issues, and from Don Kohn, who will discuss considerations related to various options before the Committee Which of you gentlemen wishes to start? Virgil   I am most concerned, as I suspect the rest of you are, that the openness and free exchange of views so essential to monetary policy will be unduly compromised if we are forced into a premature, detailed disclosure of our deliberations We    11/16/93  will only succeed in stifling originality, new ideas, and speculative notions, which so often open us up to new insights for the Committee as a whole  We are authorized by statute to fashion and implement the monetary policy of this country We are also required by both statute and tradition to maintain the maximum amount of disclosure consistent with our ability to deliberate effectively The Congress has given us the authority to decide within limits the scope of disclosure As you all know, we have been struggling with this issue for quite a long while, trying to find the right disclosure [practices] to maintain records for scholars and others interested in our deliberative process As part of our decision we have to address the policy change at the Justice Department, which we discussed via telephone conference last month, and issues raised more recently by the National Archives We must recognize that whatever course of disclosure we choose, we will have to divert key policymaking personnel to the endeavor and accordingly incur significant costs in the process  From previous discussions of this matter it's clear that there are many views within this Committee on the appropriate way to approach this issue I'd like to start off with my general view of how to approach this and then open up the floor to questions for the three of us, followed by individual positions annunciated by the individual members of the Committee As a result of the preliminary discussions that Virgil outlined with respect to both the Justice Department and the Archivist, I personally believe that we meet our responsibilities under FOIA and the Federal Records Act, as well as the requirements of the deliberative process, if we go to an MOD for future meetings, releasing deliberations with a lag of three or more years Thus the meetings of 1994, for example, would be published at the end of 1997 or later Tapes and transcripts employed in developing such MODs could, upon completion of the MODs, be dispensed with If we adopt such a recommendation or something similar and find in the months ahead that we are unable to protect the deliberative process in these meetings, we will have to consider altering our rules and returning to a much earlier procedure of detailed note taking I recognize that if we move in that direction, the Congress may choose to legislate a different procedural change in our disclosure policies That is, of course, their prerogative Should that occur, I assume it would be the judgment of this Committee that the quality of monetary policymaking would be impaired Should hearings be held leading up to such potential legislation, I and others will surely endeavor to make that case  With regard to the transcripts that have accumulated since 1976, I would recommend that we release lightly edited versions with a five-year lag I think, for example, if three years is appropriate going forward, a longer delay is required for the [historical] transcripts since the individuals, as has been pointed out, were unaware that what they said would be disclosed For reasons I raised in my letter to Steve Neal, which I presume has been circulated to all of you, I'm uncomfortable with releasing these transcripts But the Archivist informs us that the documents must be maintained and that these documents at some point would be subject to public disclosure under FOIA As I indicated at the beginning, the answer we communicate to Chairman Gonzalez after this meeting with respect to the transcripts will depend, of course, on what decisions we make here    11/16/93  this morning I would now like to open the floor for questions to either Virgil, Don, or myself President Boehne   President Parry   One being that there's no release?  SPEAKER(?) No release   Well, I think the question here really relates to whether in fact we can avoid eventually releasing the transcripts Basically we can't dispose of them under the Archivist's regulations; and under FOIA, eventually, as they age they will clearly be made available by some judge or other And I think we do have an obligation to try to make as much [information] available as possible While, as I indicated, I'm uncomfortable with a lot of this largely because of all the technical problems involved in releasing transcripts for which there is no means of evaluation, I nonetheless have concluded that our choices are extraordinarily limited; and I would much prefer that the decision as to what we do be ours and not the court's or the Congress's    11/16/93   I see no way to avoid that In other words, a conference call by its nature, unless it's strictly a conference call that is not relevant to deliberations of the [FOMC] is part of the record and would have to be included   The only reason I would argue, frankly, is that it is costly to transcribe all of this And under certain circumstances--for example, if we have a telephone conference in which the sole purpose is the staff reading a report of some form--it may be far cheaper merely to transcribe part of it, such as the Q&As, and have the physical report sent on So my concerns are not on the issue of openness but on the issue of costs   President Melzer   Governor Angell   I think that's right It's easier, actually, to read the Memorandum of Discussion in that respect also   Oh, no question Governor LaWare    11/16/93   I think [unintelligible] satisfy the Committee's request The subpoena--   It's a Committee document, a Committee subpoena   No, I'm really referring to [the fact] that the subpoena is of the [House] Committee--   --not the Chairman  -11-    11/16/93   I'm trying to say that, as Virgil indicated, the authority has not been delegated to the Chairman as I understand it Is that correct?   President Forrestal   President Syron  -12-    11/16/93   I think that is an open question and I grant that you have a point there I frankly don't have a position; I could be persuaded in either direction I would argue that it is not automatic that of necessity we would tape and transcribe every single meeting We haven't done that in the past; it has not been the practice of this Committee to do it in the past and it's a judgmental question as to what is proper and what is not   It's the rights--   It's the rights issue As I described in my letter to Steve Neal, these [raw] transcripts are essentially hearsay in the sense that they are transcriptions by individuals of what they heard on the tape And as we all know, in such situations [words] get garbled and put in different positions And the person who [made] the remarks does not have any capability of editing them or making certain that the tape was heard [correctly] and checked against the transcript So there is a privacy issue here which I find disturbing I've indicated that before this Committee many times and I've indicated that both in public and in letters to Steve Neal   Governor Phillips   That is correct These are decisions that in my judgment have to made by this Committee as a result of the responsibilities that we have under the law Vice Chairman   If the jokes are any good, I don't see any reason why--   They're old jokes  SPEAKER(?) All jokes are old jokes   I'm sorry, did you finish?   President Hoenig   That's the reason why a memorandum of discussion, which a number of us discussed as a plausible alternative, going back doesn't seem--   President McTeer   President Keehn   Going back? Three to five years? Well, I think three years is too short; I was recommending five   Basically it's a judgment call I think it's a question essentially of what types of FOIA requests we may get and what the Justice Department would be willing to support us on My guess is that five years is an easy one and would be more appropriate than ten It's strictly a question of [deciding] what the statute enables us to do   You're talking about the disclosure question?   It's Chairman Gonzalez who feels very strongly about it I assume that there are others in the Committee, but at the hearings where I have been testifying I have not heard anything resembling a groundswell of support But I really don't know that In other words the issues have not materialized except at these most recent hearings And there weren't enough people who commented on this for me to derive any reasonable judgment as to where the House Banking Committee stood as a group   Sure, if we change our operating--   As I indicated in my opening remarks, I think we can, as a consequence of the discussions that Virgil has had with the Archivist and the Department of Justice, successfully maintain our deliberative processes with an MOD three or more years forward and five years or more or, say, just five years going back If that does not work, if in fact we find that under a regime such as that or something comparable we cannot maintain an effective deliberative process, in my judgment we would not be carrying out our statutory requirements to fashion and implement monetary policy In that case, I think it would be incumbent upon this Committee to find a means by which we are within the law and which enables us to maintain effective deliberations The Congress obviously always has the choice, if it wishes, to construct its own set of rules as to how we deliberate We do have the issue of accountability, which I think is important for us to meet; but the ultimate choice in that respect would be Congress's I think it is we who have the best capability of making a judgment about what the appropriate tradeoff is between efficacy of our deliberative process and the making of monetary policy on the one hand and the requirements for accountability in a democratic society on the other I say that basically because we have the most experience in dealing with this We know how the system works; we know where, if we are constrained, the usefulness of our discussions breaks down At the extreme the issues that we confront are sufficiently complex that we have over the years been seeking each other's views It's not an easy process I don't think people outside of this Committee understand the nature of the subtleties of the process anywhere near as much as we do, and as a consequence they cannot be expected to make an appropriate decision on the level at which I think it is really incumbent upon us to make  The Congress has given us the authority to [make that decision] within limits and I think we have the responsiblity to do that If we take a position in this regard which is perceived to be outside the realm of what the Congress has conveyed to us as our limit of authority, we probably would confront some form of legislation which will override the position that we take And I must say that's the reason why I made the suggestion that I did In the context of the discussions that Virgil has had with the Archivist and the Justice Department, I do think that we should be able to implement successfully what we have to do I may be wrong on that If I am, I would be very much open to see what changes we would have to make, because our fundamental statutory imperative is the making of monetary policy If we can't do that, the issue of accountability is irrelevant We have to keep that in mind so that our first order of business is to make sure that our deliberative processes are protected The recommendation that I made [reflects] my judgment, having been here for more than six years, that we could do it But, as I said, I may be wrong And when I say that, I mean that if we adopt something of this nature and find two or three meetings down the road that it is not working, I think we are required to change it   Of course I'm sorry; I did not make that point explicitly in my opening remarks but clearly that was my intention Governor Mullins   Fourteen members could--   Sure, they could delegate to anybody  MULLINS And what is the procedure in the Senate? Is it the same?   Frankly, I had thought, but merely from hearsay, that the MOD was a significantly contracted version of an edited transcript I found out from the examples that have been proposed here that that is factually false The difference is really very negligible; for all practical purposes an MOD has all the information that is on the transcript It's frankly easier to read and in many respects, if the purpose is scholarly, probably is more useful to the public But if you're asking me do I have any strong opinions, that's--   No   President Melzer   Governor LaWare  -20-    11/16/93   Governor Kelley  -21-    11/16/93   Let me just state this Clearly, if we run into the type of concerns that Governor LaWare was raising, I think it would be appropriate that the [Federal Open Market] Committee request a hearing before the [Banking] Committee and try to explain in some detail what it is that we do and why we do it and why it is so important for us to [protect] this deliberative process I don't sense an inability on our part to carry our case before the Congress, and I think we should not be in any way restrained in our endeavor to do so So, rather than fail to make our case, I think we should seek Congressional hearings and other public forums because this is a very crucial issue for this country It would be a mistake for us not to be as supportive as we can of our basic underlying procedures, which have carried this Committee as far as they have I must say, as I have said before, that I have been very impressed with the way this Committee functions; I think it's an extraordinarily efficient Committee I have sat on an awful lot of private boards and public boards, and there is nothing as effective in the deliberative process as this Committee has been in the past six plus years And I think that is a case we have to make to the House Banking Committee, to the Congress as a whole, and to the public at large because we, more than anyone else, know the implications of a deterioration in that deliberative process We are the central bank and we have to speak for ourselves There is no one else out there who is sufficiently  -22-    11/16/93  involved, except at the periphery, with what we do and we must be very forthcoming in addressing this particular subject President Boehne   Any other questions? The floor is now open for individuals to express their views Vice Chairman   And three years going forward?   Governor Angell   President Syron   In other words, you'd do a transcript both forward and backwards?   President Melzer   President Broaddus   President Jordan   President Forrestal   Actually, I might say that the last version of the lag under the 1984 bill, which as you know never got through the Congress, was three years, was it not?   Oh, it was the '79 bill which was--   President Stern   And on the timing going back?   And going forward [you favor a lag of] three years?   Okay Governor LaWare   I missed it; your going forward time [lag] is what?   Three years for the past?   So you have three and three Is that right?  -29-    11/16/93   President Boehne   President Hoenig   I tried to make that point at the hearings   President Parry   It's pretty clear that we are going to be moving on through lunch and into the afternoon before we get through, so why don't we take our regular 1100 am break at this point  [Coffee break]   President Keehn   You're staying with the existing minutes and--  -33-    11/16/93   President McTeer   That's as distinct from lightly edited with annotation?   So you want a raw, annotated transcript?   Governor Phillips   Governor Lindsey   Going forward?   I'm sorry, I thought that was the past; I missed it   Five for both?   Governor Mullins   I'm sorry, are you talking past or forward?   Sure   We've never had concurring statements   Sure   Well, I must say, I'm not as pessimistic about this as Governor Mullins We are confronted with an immediate problem, which is essentially the transcripts, that has to be resolved I think we've got to come to grips with how we handle ourselves in the future, and I am not of the opinion that if we do something now and it's not working the way we want, that we can't change it Remember, nobody here is talking about [releasing] tapes or transcripts immediately If it turns out that we are unable to hold onto our deliberative process, I think it is essential that we change [our procedures] And that would be a unilateral change It is something that does not require legislation My own view is that legislation is not going to turn out to be necessary Frankly, the reason that I have argued the way I have is that I happen to think it's the appropriate policy I had that view before the transcript issue came up So, I personally am not responding to any of our recent problems with the House Banking Committee I just think it's good policy to do something about the way we [make information available] Frankly, I hadn't focused at all on the past transcripts because I thought they were FOIA-protected as staff operations and it never entered my mind But moving forward to do something which is more forthcoming is something I myself have been supportive of for quite a long time I have problems with the immediate release of minutes because I do think that's real stuff and their immediate release would in my view fundamentally alter the way we do business But I must tell you I can't get overly excited about the question of [whether to release] transcripts three, four, or five years out That's because basically the business cycle lasts three or four years and it's hardly likely that anything we're saying [currently] is going to get compromised by positions we took in an earlier period  But let me just say that the most important issue here is that I'm not sure how Congress is going to behave one way or the other David may be right; it may be getting worse I'm not sure that is necessarily the case But the point that I would raise [relates to] the presumption that whatever we do--aside from what we do with the historic transcripts--once we do it we're locked in concrete I don't think we ought to view whatever it is we do going forward as locked in concrete because these laws are evolving The Archivist is evolving, the Justice Department is evolving It may turn out that presumptions relevant to this are inappropriate And I would have no hesitancy myself to argue for change even if it's six months from now or three months from now So I don't see that we have to be judging [anything] at this point other than the necessity under all conditions of protecting the deliberative process, which I hope is the unanimous view of the people around this table Aside from that, which is our number one unquestioned priority, how we do it is variable And in my judgment the recommendation I made solves it for my purposes Would I like enhanced minutes? I would say that in the  -39-    11/16/93  event we cannot hold our confidentiality with tapes and transcripts, I would very readily go to enhanced minutes with no tape, because I think that would be necessary I don't think we'd have any choice but to move in that direction But I don't see that as a highly likely outcome at this point Governor Angell   My impression basically, knowing the people around this table, is that they may start to become hesitant but they're going to be unable to maintain it [Laughter]   Absolutely  SEVERAL We all agree on that   Let me [move toward a decision] Even though I've taken extensive notes here-- [Laughter] It would be tough to write a transcript, but they would actually be usable We have a number of different issues on the table And the question basically is [how to proceed] If they were all fundamentally independent, then as good mathematicians we could vote on them one at a time But, for example, on the issue of [what we do] going back, in anybody's mind is the choice of raw transcripts or edited transcripts a function of the timeframe or the judgment on the length of time before we would make them [available]?   I thought not So what I can do is ask for preferences Well, it's a little more complex going forward, so let me start with the historical setup I'll ask first that we literally go around the table and have individuals respond to a first choice and "could accept" type question We're talking now about the raw transcript with annotation, a lightly edited transcript with or without annotation--   --releasing both, and Memoranda of Discussion So how many is that?  SPEAKER(?) That's four   That's four [choices]  -40-    11/16/93   Retrospectively   Is that acceptable? Okay It's easier to go down [my list] Vice Chairman, can I ask for a quick sentence?   Governor Angell   Well, redacting is for all of them That goes without [saying]   President Boehne   President Keehn   Governor Kelley   Governor LaWare   Governor Lindsey  -41-    11/16/93   President McTeer   Governor Mullins   Governor Phillips   President Stern   President Broaddus   President Forrestal   President Hoenig   President Jordan   President Melzer   President Parry   President Syron   The consensus is lightly edited It's unclear as [to the issue of annotation] Let me put it to you this way I assume that the question of annotation is a secondary issue relative to the other So it is lightly edited and what I'd like to do is get a show of hands on annotated or--   Well, when you start to do that it bothers me--   Yes, we do   Amongst the members it's one, two--   --three, four, five, six, seven, eight  SPEAKER(?) Well, that's it Let's go to the next issue   Two among the Committee members and for both there were two  -43-    11/16/93   The nonvoting members are also roughly the same; there's not a big distinction between them [and the voting members] If there were, I think we'd want to think about it Unless somebody questions my accounting, I got a majority   There is a majority All I'm asking, since some of you didn't say whether or not it was with or without annotation, is for a show of hands, first without annotation   Annotation is basically comments in-- Well, rather than give my view, why doesn't the person who would annotate it [tell us]   It's an interesting question It also depends to a large extent on who is doing the annotating Remember what annotation means Annotation means that somebody has gone over this and decided whether it is right or wrong Now, the problem unfortunately is that whoever is annotating is not going to capture all the wrongs but they will be certifying that they are right   Well, it's an impossible situation We don't have real-time evaluations of whatever it is we're doing and we're trying to make guesses [about] the past Frankly, while I was originally attracted to annotation, my concern is that if we have annotated, the presumption is that if it's not annotated it is accurate   And I'm not sure that that's factually correct  SPEAKER(?) Isn't that also true of editing?   Well, this is where the Archivist is relevant If he decides that the editing does not do violence to the raw transcript, the raw transcript can be dispensed with If not--   Let me put it this way There is no good answer to all of this We did take the vote Where we are at the moment is a decision on annotated or not So, all those who prefer unannotated? [Secretary's note In a show of hands a majority indicated a preference for no annotation] I think we solved that problem  The next question is the time [lag] involved There appears to be a heavy [leaning toward] five years but I'm not sure and I'd like to go over that again Let's do the first and second choice, okay? Vice Chairman   No   The [issue] wholly is that if the first choice doesn't get a majority, we can move to second choices as to  -45-    11/16/93  whether-- I don't think this is a [big] issue or anything, but go ahead Governor Angell   The number of years The past   President Boehne   President Keehn   Governor Kelley   Governor LaWare   Poor four! Governor Lindsey   President McTeer   Governor Mullins   Governor Phillips   President Stern   President Broaddus   President Forrestal   President Hoenig  -46-    11/16/93   President Jordan   President Melzer   President Parry   President Syron   One interesting aspect of all this is that five shows up in everybody's [answer], just not in the same place It looks to me as though five is the best--  SPEAKER(?) I think the more-than-fives clearly--   The fives have it, as best I can read   Sure   Other than our own concerns, I'm not sure that we ought to be adjusting to anything other than what we think [is appropriate]   I didn't get that sense That's certainly not my point of view   Let's go to the hard part It's called "from here on" Oh, I'm sorry, there's another question out there, the question of who does the editing I sensed for those who raised the question that [it would be] the Secretariat, not [the FOMC members] In other words, we would not as a Committee oversee any of this process Basically these are unofficial records of the Committee and would be handled as such And as a consequence they could be delegated to the staff for these purposes   Yes   Light means the type of editing which in the view of the Archivist is such that [the option of] dispensing with the raw transcript is available That's what that means   That's a good question I think the standard would be, to a greater or lesser extent, something closer to but not quite to the [type of] editing that goes on for Congressional hearings You can't change the substance   Unless it's gibberish I know when I go over my Congressional testimony--I haven't done it since I've been here--but when I was in the private sector there were sentences which were utter gibberish Even I didn't know--  MR, ANGELL But even though we voted not to do annotated, if there's a sentence that's not [included] would there be an annotation saying "sentence unintelligible"?   I think the criterion has to be--   That's the only objective standard I could conceive of Is it agreed then that the Secretariat does it?  SPEAKER(?) Right   Okay, next Now, again--here I'm going forward--is anybody's view of the vehicle a function of the timeframe in which it takes place? So let's start off in the same manner, first and second choice, going forward Vice Chairman   Governor Angell  -48-    11/16/93   I take it in all cases that we're talking about lightly edited Let's stipulate that President Boehne   President Keehn   Governor Kelley   Governor LaWare   Governor Lindsey   President McTeer   Governor Mullins   Governor Phillips   President Stern   President Broaddus   President Forrestal  -49-    11/16/93   President Hoenig   President Jordan   President Melzer   President Parry   President Syron   We're voting on it independently of the timeframe   I don't think enhanced minutes has any timeframe [unintelligible]   MOD as first choice? I haven't voted yet; I need to decide--   Oh no, the [unintelligible] influence my vote! [Laughter]   I'm trying to get the voting members first   Three And four--   We ought to have lunch   As I interpret it--this is not an easy type of vote and if anybody objects please speak up--looking at the first and second choices, basically, it is between an MOD and an edited transcript It's not clear-cut; we're all over the place on a lot of different things   No   Two voting members are for enhanced minutes   Well, rather unfortunately, if I stay with an MOD, for the voting members it's four, four, and four   Sure   That's right Let's take a minute because this is what I was expecting might happen Let's define what we really mean by enhanced minutes What concerns me is that the MOD is unambiguous and the edited transcript is unambiguous, but I'm not certain that the view of this Committee of what we mean by enhanced minutes is unambiguous   But we do that now   No, wait a second My own problem is that to have a fully detailed MOD without the names on it--  SPEAKER(?) That doesn't make [sense]   Well, the point is this I've thought that what we do now is about as complete [coverage of] what we talked about as one can imagine The only meaningful concept of enhancement, as far as I can judge, is adding names  -52-    11/16/93   But wait a second   There are several who have been in favor of enhanced minutes I think we ought to go around quickly and get a one sentence description of what that means to each of you   Does that mean shutting off the tape?   Can I suggest that there is a more important question? The really crucial question is whether the tape is turned off or not   All the other issues are really irrelevant because, if you turn off the tape, you automatically go to enhanced minutes If you leave the tape on, then doing enhanced minutes doesn't get you anything   I will just tell you that my own view is that this is the wrong time to turn off the tape There may occur a later time when that is the desirable thing to do I think it's premature It's an action at this stage that I don't think is warranted It's unnecessary It may become necessary But the question has nothing to do with enhanced minutes because if we do enhanced minutes and leave the tape on, I don't know what the purpose of that would be   Go ahead, Tom   Well, I have no intention of moving forward with a vote that is very close   Let me make the following suggestion As I suspected, this is a very close vote There is no way, I can tell you, to squeeze a significant consensus out of this easily Because it is difficult, I think a suggestion that Don Kohn made earlier is probably the appropriate one My own recommendation at this stage, having heard this, would be to enlist Don in his recommendation   We did that   Not essentially, we did it   Okay, I'm willing to--   I might suggest that the first one is really Do we keep the tape on or turn it off?   Let me say this I don't want an official vote I request that you withdraw the motion on the grounds  -56-    11/16/93  that we're not necessarily trying to find [a consensus on] a series of events but a series of choices--or I should say on a specific fixed issue Look, turning on the tape or not turning on the tape is not a decision on what we're going to do It is a vehicle to determine where people want to be I think it's helpful but it can't be a binding vote It has to be a preference because people can--   Well, I'd just as soon not have [a vote] in an official sense, if you don't mind I think it's going to create--   --more problems in trying to come out [with a decision] on this   Can I tell you what the best vote at this stage is?   Whether we delay until the December meeting or whether we do something at the present one  SEVERAL Yes, that's right   Let me get an unofficial show of hands as to whether we should delay until the December meeting or act now First, to delay until the December meeting  SPEAKER(?) This is prospective?   Oh yes, obviously One, two, three, four, five, six And we have twelve That does it   I thought the voting members had it Let's do voting members very specifically Voting members only   Delay One, two, three, four, five, six, seven    -57-  Seven    11/16/93   That solves the problem Let me tell you Of all the issues that I have been involved in, this is the closest vote that we have had I would submit to you that if we tried to work our way through today to find a reasonable consensus we would be here until 5 o'clock this evening This is a very complex issue and I think the ability to focus on this [unintelligible] Having had this very broad discussion, returning it to the subcommittee for [filtering], if I may put it that way, is the least worst of the choices we're confronting I don't know any way at this point to get a general consensus where everyone would feel comfortable I'm appreciative of the fact that we have solved [the issue for] the past And in certain respects I think developments over the next several weeks may change some of the things that are going on Vice Chairman   Well, I don't disagree with that The only thing we voted on was delay, not--   It's a lot more difficult if you don't have a consensus   No question   There's no question that if we could get a consensus in this Committee on going forward that would be far superior to not [reaching a decision]; I don't deny that Just remember that the issue of hearings is essentially not to be terribly much involved in precisely how we go forward The really crucial point is to try to emphasize how crucial the deliberative process is and [to urge] its protection That's only partially related, if at  -58-    11/16/93  all, to the decisions we will be making with respect to what we go forward with   A thoughtful thought   Absolutely   I think that's a very good [idea]   Absolutely Does anyone strongly object? Another problem we may have is scheduling   No, he didn't ask [unintelligible]   The only thing he requested was the historical--  SPEAKER(?) So we're responding to that   I absolutely agree with you, Bob I think we will find at the end of the day that through proportional voting or representation or what have you, we will come out with a consensus of this Committee The combinations here are too complex to simply put forward [proposals] and start working through the confusion And I don't think we should pressure this process; it's too important I think John LaWare's recommendation is very sensible I would ask the Secretariat to survey all of the members to see where we could possibly squeeze in [a meeting], even if it comes out to be an evening or, if absolutely necessary, a weekend But what we need first is a document, then a date; and then we will just stay until we get the issue resolved Governor Phillips   We have   I think we have to respond to him precisely [in terms of] the content of this meeting   I assume that if he requested that we voluntarily offer the transcripts, the answer of this Committee is "no" Is there any dissent to that? That's the impression that I've gotten from all the members It is our basic view that we've done it appropriately in the manner we suggested; that is an issue that we  -60-    11/16/93  have made a decision on If the Congress chooses to override us, that's their prerogative   We've made the decision to release the lightly edited transcripts after five years   I think the [unintelligible]   As I understood the context of this discussion, the answer to that question is "no"   We did If you wish to go around and--  SPEAKER(?) It's the same   Okay, let me ask Are there any other dissents in the Committee or amongst the nonvoting presidents?  -61-    11/16/93   If a subpoena is issued, we will have to deal with it One possibility is that we could go up and discuss these other alternatives with them   Yes   I got the general impression that we would do the early ones as quickly as we can feasibly turn them out   I, frankly, do not know the answer to that   I don't see the means by which we basically can negotiate our way out   I can't--   Can I suggest this? Unless I hear something to the contrary, the answer to Chairman Gonzalez is "no" We will release the transcripts in lightly edited form We will do that starting with five years back and do the remainder as quickly as is feasible If that is the case, and unless I hear something to the contrary, we will now move to the next item on the agenda   That's a good question   Let's do that Why don't we just get our food and come back here  [Lunch recess]   Would somebody like to move [the minutes]?  SPEAKER(?) Move it   Is there a second?  SPEAKER(?) Second   Without objection Peter Fisher and after you, Ted Truman  -63-    11/16/93   Why don't we first see if there are any questions Questions for Peter? If not, you may move on   Why don't we have Ted go first   Questions for either gentleman?   That's a very useful notion I didn't realize it was that long; but if it is, it's longer than it should be   Ted, could you see that that gets on the agenda?   No, but I think it's a useful one Anybody else want to come forth in this discussion? If not, would somebody like to move the renewals?   All in favor say "aye"  SEVERAL Aye   Opposed? The "ayes" have it Joan   Questions for Joan? If not, we need two motions One is to ratify the actions of the Desk of the past month Would somebody like to move that?   Without objection And secondly the leeway request   Without objection Thank you very much Moving on, Mike Prell   Any questions for Mr Prell?   President Parry   President Jordan   President Syron   Further questions for Mike? I guess we don't like the answers! [Laughter]   Who would like to start our Committee [discussion]? President Hoenig   President Keehn   President Parry   President Forrestal   President Stern   President Broaddus   President Boehne   President Syron   President Jordan   President Melzer   Vice Chairman   President McTeer   That will create some interesting consequences Governor Mullins   Governor Kelley   Governor LaWare   Governor Angell   Governor Phillips   Governor Lindsey   Thank you Mr Kohn   Questions for Mr Kohn? If not, let me get started It strikes me that in part the fits and starts were not something that was going on in the economy but something that was going on in the data One way of looking at that is to ask whether other measures are giving the type of volatility that the GDP data have given It's clear, for example, that gross domestic income-- granted a somewhat inferior measure--in exactly the same context has been a good deal smoother than the GDP It's also hardly credible, with two independent estimates of increasing work hours during the first half--both the payroll and the household surveys--that productivity measured against GDP, not the nonfarm business product, could have gone down It's just not a credible economic phenomenon That leads one to conclude that this recovery has been smoother than the data show and it raises some interesting questions about whether it is self-sustaining, which a number of people have commented on, and whether there is any significant breakout here that we seem to be observing It is certainly the case that industrial production has shown some definite strength of late And the November data, just looking at the weekly numbers on motor vehicles and a number of other related weekly industrial components, indicate that [the] November [index] is already up significantly  -86-    11/16/93  The obvious question that we have to ask ourselves is What is it that's going to induce an acceleration much beyond the Greenbook [forecast]? And I think the argument has to be that the missing link in all of this is the inventory patterns We have seen a very significant contraction in inventories in terms of days' supply, largely reflecting just-in-time [inventory management and the resultant] increasingly evident compression And the compression is being driven to a large extent by quality control requirements which relate in turn to the issue of the competitive pressures One of the interesting insights that I learned from your Vice Chairman when I was out there was this notion that when inventories are very low, the just-in-time pattern [allows] fairly rapid movement from one segment of a production process to another or from one establishment to another The finding of a fault in a particular product or a particular element in the fabrication process means that it can get fixed relatively quickly In other words, you don't have two months' worth of widgets which are slightly off If it's just-in-time, you have three days' [supply]; so you don't lose the quality and you don't lose the production And that pattern is apparently driving a very substantial part of this inventory issue  Historically, we never would perceive of any inventory acceleration in a business cycle sense until we began to see the process of lead times on the deliveries of products begin to stretch out The normal cyclical process that we used to observe fairly consistently from cycle to cycle was that we would begin to get some slight pressure on capacity, which would cause delivery lead times to stretch out The purchasing managers, being concerned about the now longer lead times, would then start to order more and build up their so-called safety stock That in turn would overload the system even more and create a still greater increase in lead times and still more ordering, and you'd get the standard inventory process which was characteristic of much of the business cycle before this one There is no evidence at this stage that any of that process has begun The lead times as we measure them off the purchasing managers' reports or their equivalent delays in deliveries are remarkably quiescent That doesn't mean they're going to stay that way It does mean that if we are apt to see some semblance of acceleration, one of the signs may well be some lead times beginning to move, some industrial commodity prices beginning to move, as for example steel scrap has been doing of late, which is an interesting but at the moment the sole indicator coming from the commodity markets We also, I suspect, have to see some credit expansion No matter how we look at these numbers, they are not the credit numbers of a boom So, I would find it hard to believe that we're going to see anything resembling a significant pickup unless we spot it in the lead times or in the credit numbers And it's more likely to be in the credit numbers because they move somewhat faster; it's not that they are a better advance indicator but they're more current And I think we may find--excuse the expression --that M2 might turn out to have certain elements of information in it just as we have buried it But I think the more important question is the [domestic] nonfinancial [sector] credit, which has been quite quiescent even though it has shown some modest improvements  The foreign markets look awful and I think the Japanese economy is scary The German economy doesn't seem to be going anywhere and I think the Japanese economy is demonstrating basically that the cycle of balance sheet strains, which the UK went through, is  -87-    11/16/93  very evident in Japan And since the depth of it is so much greater than ours, the presumption that they're going to pick up I just find noncredible So I think that we're not going to get very much of anything from the export markets Finally, with a five-week intermeeting period, it seems to me that there's very little that could happen to alter significantly anything that we are working on so far as policy is concerned I'd conclude that a symmetrical, no change directive until the next meeting is a "gimme putt" Ed Boehne   President Keehn   Governor Mullins   Governor Kelley   Governor LaWare   It's about time!   Governor Lindsey   Governor Phillips   President Melzer   President Broaddus   Bob Forrestal   President Syron   Governor Angell   President Jordan   President Stern   President Parry   President McTeer  -89-    11/16/93   President Hoenig   Let's try "B" symmetric   [Unintelligible] if we ever find an appropriate time The next meeting for monetary policy is December 21 We'll be in touch very shortly  END OF MEETING  -90-       Governor, since you're standing, will you move the minutes of the last meeting?   Without objection I think you're all familiar with the memorandum dated December 17th that relates to the delegation of responsibility for Decisions on Appeals under the Freedom of Information Act of denials of access to Committee records Is there any discussion on this issue? Any questions? Would somebody like to move the delegation of this responsibility?   Without objection Thank you The next item on the agenda is an interesting analysis by Dave Stockton and Jack Beebe on the relationship of price stability and economic performance, which I believe was initiated at a System-wide conference a while back And I turn [the floor] over to you gentlemen   I know that we've done very considerable work in the United States to weed out the statistical effects, which I'm sure exist in other countries, of the normal noise in the variables that creates an inverse correlation between price change and real GDP when we look at the implicit price deflator on the one hand and the gross domestic product in constant dollars on the other In other words, if you have an independently estimated nominal GDP and an independently estimated set of prices and you consider that there is noise in those variables, you're going to end up picking up some negative correlation But for the United States I think we've done enough in this area to demonstrate that even adjusting for that by [using] industrial production versus price, which is not subject to this problem, still creates a very robust relationship The causation question is where the big debate is So I was just curious Have we run Granger-causation tests on US data? I've forgotten what came out of that   Well, it doesn't necessarily follow that the causation must be in one direction or the other It can be both    12/21/93  And so the concurrent relationship could be consistent with unit labor costs being pulled down and hence the price level But do you recall whether or not in a strictly statistical sense the Granger-causation results were significant?   I assume that the contemporaneous increase in productivity is not of an order of magnitude that is so large that it is far more than the price inflation decline which, therefore, couldn't explain it In other words, I assume that what we're looking at is something in which an argument that productivity increases cause low inflation is not refuted at that level   Other questions?   Yes I think there is fairly widespread acceptance that inflation rates over 10 percent are clearly disruptive; and probably a very large majority [believe that] from 5 percent upward The crucial question is what happens to the academic evaluation about inflation of 5 percent [or less]; there [views] start to spread all over the place   Can I ask Have we or has anybody ever tried to isolate the impacts by trying to subtract out of the GDP the costs of fighting inflation?   You can basically raise the GDP by finding something in the reservoir of water, because I will tell you the GDP of the District of Columbia went up when the water pollution question came up because of all the retail activity and everything else that went on And one questions what the measured GDP actually means, especially in this particular context   But I think Bob is right that if you can set up an analytical model, cause and effect, and can demonstrate at the crucial points that there is micro evidence, such as the relationship between inflation and the price dispersion [effects] of uncertainty and the relationship between uncertainty and the cost of capital and growth, then you can build the argument, even if the data at a macro level are insufficient largely because those data have a very considerable amount of noise in them If indeed a very forceful and very tight inverse relationship exists, it is quite possible that if there's enough statistical noise in your data system you can bring 100 percent R square down to 2   Well, I thought the memorandum was really quite useful I think the results that were obtained showed a fairly extensive advance in the state of knowledge in this area   Other questions? If not, before we go on to the substance of our meeting, the conventional [agenda], Sandra Pianalto is here for the first time and we'd like to welcome her Where is she? There she is Welcome, Sandy And as I think we're all aware, this is the last official meeting for Governor Angell We will at our next meeting have a going away bash for him I just want to say today that you may leave here but your philosophy will remain in this organization largely because, perhaps subliminally, you have implanted ideas amongst your colleagues that they now think are their own And as a result they will cherish them immensely But for those of us who have observed you over the years--and I've had the privilege of doing this--you are going to be sorely missed for a lot of reasons Most important to me is the extraordinary integrity that you have exhibited in this group and the absolute adherence to the issue of principle and what is appropriate and important public policy for a central bank We're going to have somebody else sitting in your seat but he or she will not have replaced you We will all officially wish you well at a later time, but I want to say that personally and professionally I will miss you But that doesn't mean I'm going to give you a couple of extra strokes the next time we play tennis!  Shall we go on to our normal procedures? We'll start with Peter Fisher and the Foreign Desk   Questions for Peter? If not, is there any objection to the request that the Desk made with respect to [the disposition of] currencies? If not, I will assume that you have authorization to move as required Let's go to the Domestic Desk and Joan Lovett   Thank you Questions for Joan? If not, I would entertain a motion to ratify the actions over the [intermeeting] period  SPEAKER(?) So move   We have one additional item on the agenda, which I want to raise with you But before I do I just want to comment on this notion that Al Broaddus raised about the pressures that are on this institution, which are many and variable and have continued for a long while I beseech you to separate monetary policy discussions, if you will, from all of that In other words, we cannot trade off in any way the policy prescriptions that we decide at this table on the grounds that some other event is occurring which might change our view Monetary policy is our primary responsibility; everything else is secondary And we should isolate this activity in the central bank from all other issues over which we are going to be on the battlefields  One issue we have to decide today is the question of what we do with the request of Chairman Gonzalez with respect to the October 15th tapes He has essentially come to the view that he would like to come down here--not he himself, but his aide--and listen to the tapes and look at the transcript That's a stepping off of an earlier position where he wanted us to ship all tapes and transcripts up to the Hill As best I can judge, and I say this with some vagueness, he's accusing us of conspiring somehow in that October 15th meeting to hide the transcripts or somehow decide not to tell it like it was For all of you who remember, that particular meeting was one in which we discussed at considerable length the pros and cons of releasing transcripts and, indeed, we concluded at the end of that meeting that what we wanted to do effectively was to replicate that particular discussion up there [on the Hill] By any evidence that I can see it's extremely difficult to [determine] where this accusation is  -40-    12/21/93  coming from Indeed, in a letter I sent up to the Chairman recently I spelled out my views as to what the evidence was  But the type of environment in which we exist, as I've indicated previously, is one in which there is a deep-seated suspicion of this institution It's regrettable but I guess it comes with the turf I think it's important that we put the notions of that particular conspiracy behind us That is not the same thing as saying that I believe Chairman Gonzalez will cease to pressure us I think it's important, however, for our position with respect to the remainder of the Congress and the public at large that we are not being perceived of, as he would invariably accuse us, as trying to hide the tapes because there's something there Accordingly, I'd like to put this whole issue to rest; [I'm talking about] the October 15th issue, because I don't think we're about to put the other [issues] to rest very quickly And I would recommend to this Committee that we allow Chairman Gonzalez's [staff] attorney to listen to the tape at a meeting with several other people of our choosing That is, my preliminary view would be to invite the senior aide of Congressman Leach, who is the ranking minority member on the Banking Committee, and the chief aide of subcommittee Chairman Kanjorski whose committee essentially oversees this organization The obvious reason for doing that is to prevent the inevitable danger that arises with people picking and choosing individual lines and sentences of which there are probably two or three mild ones in that transcript Frankly, I've read the transcript and the accusations are wholly without merit There is no evidence in that transcript [to support those accusations] There are a few sentences which, [taken] out of context, could very readily be employed to raise an issue and that's one of the reasons I want to be sure other people are there who can basically say "This is nonsense"  I must say, I make this recommendation with some reluctance because of its potential precedential nature The October 15 meeting, however, was not a deliberative meeting on monetary policy Were a request made for any of the transcripts or tapes of monetary policy and the deliberative processes that we go through, I think we'd have no choice but to say "no" unequivocally They may choose to find a means to obtain that, but that's the Congress's initiative As far as we're concerned, I think we have to stand pat on that I have given this issue considerable thought and [gone over] the various alternatives I've been around this town, in and out of government- related jobs, since 1968 and I know the politics of this town pretty well And I will tell you it's my very strongly considered judgment that it is important that we do this and get it behind us I would, therefore, put it out on the table as a recommendation and would like to respond to questions Vice Chairman   Questions? Well, comments or questions, then   Governor Kelley   That's what he has requested   Yes, his people   That's correct   Correct   That is what he has written in a letter   No, in fact he indicated via telephone that he wanted one of his people to come down to the Board and listen to the tape He's made that request   Governor Lindsey   My recollection is that they called They did call to come down to listen to the tape at some point, did they not?   Well, let me put it this way My recommendation is to do it here  SPEAKER(?) [Unintelligible] take notes   That is possible But, remember, if the results are ambiguous, that doesn't necessarily mean that we have to get it fully clarified because I'm not sure that we'll ever satisfy certain people  -43-    12/21/93   Let me suggest this It's conceivable that this may not resolve it totally, at which point we will then address the condition that we face I don't think we ought to make a decision on that at this point because it may not be necessary   Governor Phillips   I think it will resolve the October 15th issue It will not resolve the issue of assaults on this institution from various different areas   Please remember, these are not monetary policy deliberations   I would think not   As I think the Vice Chairman said, this is not a particularly delightful activity President Syron   May I say something? That's a very proper part of the discussion for next month   Next month we're going to be discussing the whole procedure of how we are going to move forward with respect to our means of taking minutes, communication, and the like   The answer is "not to my knowledge," but we have yet to [unintelligible] President Broaddus   Governor Angell   In a letter?   In fact that's one of the issues that--   In fact, when we were discussing it earlier, that's exactly what I suggested that we do In the letter of response to Chairman Gonzalez we will say As you will see, the tapes show the following   President Keehn   Well, that is a very interesting question And I think that's the type of thing we ought to discuss in the February meeting relative to how we proceed generally   Why don't you ask our General Counsel?   Governor LaWare   Well, that's the down side of it   Thank you President Hoenig   Well, obviously, he can not stop us from making those materials available to other people   If he decides that he will not participate under those conditions, we may choose to go forward without that participation   I would say that would be a mistake   Yes, check with Don and he will--   President Forrestal   I don't think there's any problem   President Parry   Remember that the accusation will be [that we engaged in] some form of conspiratorial action And those members of the Banking Committee who might disagree with the Chairman will nonetheless feel obligated [to investigate] in the circumstance where there's an accusation of this nature and we refuse to release the evidence I would say that it would be quite easy for a majority to be marshalled for such a subpoena because, indeed, it's an accusation of not insignificant dimensions It's not a minor transgression that he's accusing us of President Melzer   President Stern   I do not get the impression that he wants to give me a forum to rebut [these accusations] I've requested it on many occasions and have gotten no response President Boehne   President McTeer   Well, in view of Susan's remarks, she may have pinpointed the fact that there are not enough to get the critical mass of objectivity   I would be disinclined at this stage to do that I say "at this stage" because it's a lot of material for people to start publishing and because we're considered highly visible people We may have to go in that direction; I don't deny that I would just as soon do that as a second step   The answer of course is yes, obviously   Well, I think that's an abridgment of the first amendment myself   Well, let me just say this I think you're quite right That type of request is inappropriate, for a long series of reasons, which I think should be self evident mostly   President Boehne   I'm sorry   Sorry about that He didn't say very much but it was eloquent   Well, if no one else wants to comment, I take the general conversation as an affirmation of our going forward with this, and I will report back to you as soon as feasible on the outcome of this issue   I don't think we need it   It's the sense of the Committee  SPEAKER(?) We don't need a vote   Our next meeting is?   February 3rd and 4th   Yes, it will I think I'll leave that up to Don and his colleagues to work out   Since there's a second, without objection Let's now move on to Messrs Prell and Truman on the economic report    12/21/93   Thank you Questions for either gentleman?   President Parry   Well, this is a technical question Why don't you just have somebody do it    12/21/93   Any further questions? If not, who would like to start the Committee discussion? President Broaddus   President Keehn    12/21/93   President Parry   President Hoenig   President Forrestal   President Jordan   President Syron   You're not making your point clear   Are you saying that the electric price cost structure goes up but there has been a shift to nonelectric furnaces--?   Yes   I see   Well, the non-mini-mill electric furnace operators are the big [unintelligible]   Okay, I'm just curious   President Boehne   President McTeer   President Melzer  -17-    12/21/93   President Stern   Governor Angell   President McDonough   Governor Kelley   Governor LaWare   It's 65 percent   Governor Lindsey   I accept that   Finally, Governor Phillips   Thank you very much I'm certain the coffee is available While we do need to go on our break, let's make it reasonably short  [Coffee break]   Questions for Don?   Any further questions? If not, several people have mentioned that we ought to speed this meeting up so I'm  -30-    12/21/93  going to [compress] my views since I generally agree with a number of arguments that have been made First of all, let me just say that it's rather obvious at this point that the acceleration we are seeing is very heavily motor vehicles, though not fully by any means We also see it in the steel markets and in a number of the commodity markets It's remarkable how big a factor the motor vehicles industry still is in this economy The sales levels have moved up to where they are significantly above the scrappage levels that one would calculate from an engineering point of view as the normal structure of scrappage This does not mean that the sales levels can not go higher, but they can't grow [over time] at the pace they've been growing And since we're talking about the rate of growth in GDP, even if automobile sales flattened out at these higher levels, by definition gross auto product with no inventory change goes to zero change So I think we are seeing a combination of both motor vehicles and residential construction, with the latter tending also to be a lead factor on the auto sales themselves I don't know whether or not I subscribe to Mike Kelley's view that it's hard to believe it can go higher; it can go higher, but it is running up against resistance  If all that we were looking at were autos and construction, I would say this expansion is going to flatten out very fast The trouble is that the process by which that occurs engenders incomes; and even though the leaders can slow down you all of a sudden find, if you look at business cycle history, that when they begin to fade the secondary industries begin to come in This would be probably non- computer-related capital goods types of activities because the cash flow that is being engendered in the corporate sector and the business sector generally I think is fairly impressive We are looking at the likelihood, just in the rate of gain in industrial production, that we probably are getting some inventory effect in here It can't be large but the presumption that we can get [monthly] industrial production increases of 7 and 9 and that all that is going into consumption, just does not square with history Nonetheless, we still do not yet see any indications that the lead times of material deliveries are moving To be sure, the operating rates have moved up; but the extraordinary rise in the import penetration across the board in this country has made domestic operating rates less indicative of the nature of pressures in the system There's an extent to which we have become extraordinarily well internationalized  One can argue that the saving rates are low and that, therefore, consumption expenditures will slow abruptly But the trouble with saving rates, as we all know, is that they are notoriously poor estimates And very often we find out after the fact that they weren't what we thought In any event, the evident willingness on the part of consumers to start taking on debt is an indication that they are not at this stage being unduly pressed and unwilling to spend because they're running out of income So I think that the 5 percent [GDP growth rate], or whatever we get in the fourth quarter, is technically unsustainable In fact, as the Greenbook indicates, if we disaggregate it, gross auto product [accounts for] more than 2 percentage points but 4 is coming from the [unintelligible] statistical adjustment The issue is whether or not, as Governor Mullins said, this expansion is sustainable, and it looks increasingly sustainable It doesn't look yet as though we are getting the surge in credit demands in the system that is usually the [tinder] for inflationary acceleration But I think, as Don pointed    12/21/93  out, that the credit numbers are finally beginning to move We don't see it in the loan data but we're beginning to see net debt in the nonfinancial sector starting to rise It's still moving at a very slow pace relative to history but it is finally beginning to move  All this leads me to conclude, as a number of you have concluded, that the days of accommodation have got to be [about] over I think we very correctly moved the rate down because of the balance sheet structural restraints that we were exposed to; it has turned out to be an exceptionally successful policy The balance sheet adjustments have indeed occurred--not yet fully; there is still clearly some way to go, but the rate of change has slowed dramatically And while there are further marginal increases and balance sheet adjustments to come, they are no longer absorbing--as I used to put it--the excessive head winds impact that we saw at an earlier time Therefore, this recovery seems finally to be moving in a manner which, while not requiring a significant tightening by the central bank, surely does indicate that the degree of accommodation must soon be eased Now, I don't know when that [should occur] but I find it very difficult to believe that we can go very long into 1994 without starting the process That's because unlike the way we usually think of things--that we will do one thing at a time--it's pretty obvious that if this recovery is taking on the broad general characteristics which historically say that it's got some legs to it, then we will be in the process not of a single upward adjustment but a whole succession of them on the way to restoring [unintelligible] or positioning [our policy stance] closer to neutrality And I agree, as Wayne Angell said, that it [means a funds rate] closer to 4 percent than to 3 percent I think that that policy is largely necessary and that if we avoid it, we will be making a bad mistake  The only question in my judgment is When do we begin? I don't see any material reason to begin today I can conceive of conditions--in the event that a lot of these things begin to accelerate--where it might be desirable to move before the next meeting But if that happens, I think it would be worthwhile having a consultation of the Committee rather than putting something in the directive at this time which authorizes the Desk to move [during the intermeeting interval] This will be a crucial move It will begin a major policy [adjustment], in my judgment, and I think the point at which we start is something that requires that the full Committee be consulted prior to that action being taken I, therefore, conclude that at this stage we ought to vote formally on an unchanged policy and a symmetric directive, with the clear understanding that unless this outlook suddenly deteriorates at a far more rapid pace than seems even remotely likely we would consider moving to that path fairly early in the year I would merely put that out for general discussion President Jordan   Well, let me say that I fully agree with that and I would say the issue is credit   President Boehne   President Parry   President Broaddus   President Forrestal   Governor Lindsey   President Syron   President McTeer   President Melzer   President Hoenig   Vice Chairman   President Keehn   Governor LaWare   Governor Angell   President Stern   Governor Kelley   Governor Phillips   Governor Mullins   We've got everybody Let's try "B" symmetric   Call the roll   Good morning everyone We welcome Cathy Minehan   I trust you won't dominate the meeting but if you do, so be it!   Would somebody like to move the minutes of the February meeting?   Without objection Peter Fisher   Questions for Peter? I assume that the econometric model that gave you that forecast has a number of linear equations in it [Laughter]   Would somebody like to move approval of the Desk's foreign exchange transactions since the last meeting?  SPEAKER(?) So move   Is there a second?  SPEAKER(?) Second   Without objection   Sure   Okay, I'd like to call on Joan Lovett next    3/22/94   Questions? If not, would somebody like to move to ratify the actions of the Desk over the intermeeting period?   And to increase the temporary leeway   Without objection, both are approved Mr Truman   President Jordan   President Broaddus   Vice Chairman   President Parry   President Hoenig   First Vice President Minehan   President McTeer   President Boehne   Let me just add a point here When Treasury approached us, we toned them down a good deal; we set up a lot of road blocks in periods when they wanted to move And we have that capability of restraining actions which I think this Committee, myself included, feels uncomfortable with If we decide that we want to disengage, we will lose whatever power in that area we have to influence the system, and that has pluses and minuses to it Obviously, we can't acquiescence in a system that is inappropriate But there is an interesting tradeoff here, which I think we have to be aware of, when one asks what the consequences are I think one of the consequences if we pull away from this is that there will be a set of policies in this area that we would find less agreeable It would be worse for the country It might be better for the Federal Reserve; that's a possibility But I think we have to keep that in mind I'm not saying that anytime somebody comes up with one of these proposals we should dive in I feel increasingly uncomfortable because my inclinations, frankly, are similar to much of what I just heard But there is a lot riding on how this whole thing comes out If we say no, there will be both pluses and minuses I might add   It's a partial price, I would say We have never been in a position with this Treasury of essentially thwarting something about which they feel strongly Basically Secretary Bentsen, I think, feels very strongly about this; he was an ardent supporter of NAFTA It is his belief that American interests in the international financial arena rest to a large extent on our extending those interests throughout Latin America and enhancing America's international trade position through a NAFTA-type agreement in that part of the world This is part and parcel of that operation And in many ways if we pull away, I think we lose a good deal of influence in trying to determine how that all comes out There is a limit I'm not saying we should merely do what the Treasury says because in fact if we had done what the Treasury probably had in mind before we put our hands up, I think we would have been acquiescing in a very loose policy One second, Bob Parry is first   Governor LaWare   Vice Chairman   President Parry, quick question?   You know, this is a much more profound issue about the nature of the Federal Reserve System than I think we realize It really gets to the issue the Vice Chairman was raising earlier as to what type of institution we want to be And I sensed this whole philosophical debate in the discussion we have been in the process of going through dealing with the issue of supervision and regulation and a consolidated bank regulatory system I think one can make a very strong argument for the central bank as a narrow institution that basically maintains strictly central banking operations In that narrow sense, it's not obvious to me that we would be involved in swaps and it's not obvious to me that we would be involved in currency intervention We would restrict ourselves strictly to domestic monetary policy--and this gets to this other issue--with an add-on of other functions like supervision and regulation and the like  What this question is really all about is the stance of the central bank in a broader context, in other words a role in which we do get involved in issues which are in many aspects at the Treasury's lead If we want to influence those or want to affect them, it's obvious if we try to do that, as we indeed have been doing, that we run into certain types of questions about the nature of central banking per se I think the issues that are being raised here are quite legitimate They are not issues that relate directly to this narrow question, however They really are fundamental to the nature of what type of central bank we wish to be And there are strong arguments on both sides I have seen the influence of this institution in this Administration and in previous ones and I would hate to give it up I think we are a force for good And if we decided to pull in our horns, I think we would be doing a disservice to the nation I fully recognize the concerns that have been expressed today, and I'm as uncomfortable as any of you And unlike Ed Boehne, I do carry intellectual baggage into this discussion I'm afraid my views are more like those of Presidents Jordan and Broaddus than anything else, but I do recognize that there are other issues involved Anyway, President Broaddus   President Jordan   Governor Lindsey     What did you see in the paper this morning?   That's US news   President McTeer And I hope you have the last word because we are running up against time   We still have the question of the announcement, and I call on Don Kohn to discuss that   Governor Lindsey   You're just suggesting that it would be in the form of a provisional statement similar to the last time   Meaning in other words that it's not an irrevocable decision of the Committee but of the Chairman?   President Melzer   Tom, let me just say that that's an interesting issue, but that's a very major question and I would hate to have that decision made at today's meeting I almost prefer to stay with Governor Lindsey's suggestion and then when we get to the final decisions make that judgment   President Forrestal   Governor LaWare   Vice Chairman   President Jordan   No, I don't think Larry is saying anyone will believe it I think what he has in mind is that it's useful when we intend to have a whole package to put it all together That's what I think his--   Well, that's a good point And the answer is possibly   I would say we have a good shot at it by May In fact, precisely for that reason it would be useful President McTeer   President Broaddus   President Keehn   Governor Kelley   President Stern   President Hoenig  -58-    3/22/94   President Parry   President Boehne   Who is the chairman of that subcommittee?   Is that everybody? Jerry, you said yes to announcing Is that right?   Governor Phillips   Ms Minehan   Well, let me make the following request I don't deny that it will appear precedential In fact, I think it's naive to believe that if we announce today that it's not going to come out that way We do have a marginal value in my doing it and then making it official at the time we do everything else It's not that it's a big deal, but it's a bigger package to announce and it probably is wise to do that Unless there is strong objection, that's what I think I'd like to do   He would basically say the Committee itself has not come to a final conclusion   This will be part of a broader package Okay our next meeting is--   May the 17th; this really is a long intermeeting period  END OF MEETING       Does anyone else want to have the ultimate last word? Let's then move on to our economic discussion and Messrs Prell and Truman  -15-    3/22/94   Questions for either gentleman?   President Parry   Governor Lindsey   Any further questions? If not, who would like to start the tour de table?   President Boehne   President Keehn   President Broaddus   Sure   President Parry   First Vice President Minehan   President Stern   President Jordan   Vice Chairman   President Melzer   President McTeer   President Hoenig   Governor Kelley   Governor LaWare   Governor Phillips   Governor Lindsey   Let's keep this coffee break a little shorter than usual  [Coffee break]   Questions for Don?   President McTeer   If nobody else has questions, why don't I get started I'd like to take a minute to put the current period in some historical perspective We have had extraordinary financial turmoil, and it's worthwhile to go back in time and see where it came from and where it's likely to go My impression is that we are looking at the aftermath of the 1987 stock market crash, which is the first and perhaps the only major stock market crash in history that actually was beneficial to the economy In other words, it appeared to me in retrospect that the crash stripped out a high degree of overheating and sort of got right to the edge of where the overheating got into the muscle of the economy and stopped We came out of it with a very shaken environment but one which recovered relatively quickly As a consequence of that, from the 1987 stock market crash on, all the key risk spreads started to narrow We saw it in, say,  -39-    3/22/94  the rates on six-month commercial paper versus the Treasury bill rate; we saw it in BAA corporates versus Treasuries The only abnormality is the junk bond trend which was affected by the emergence of that market But there has been a general decline in those risk premiums, which has led increasingly to the view implicit in the market that there is a risk-free environment and one that incoporates, as we have noted previously, extraordinary rates of return on stocks and bonds Those returns not only have been significantly higher than average but remarkably stable There has been very little volatility in the stock market until recently And as a consequence of that, we saw the emergence of a huge mutual funds industry, which was able to promise above average yields and stable yields I don't know the size of the industry now--$2 trillion or something like that--but it has become the major player in the marketplace  Everything we know about markets is that abnormal rates of return, especially those built on capital gains, cannot persist Indeed, the closest example of this in recent times was the pre- September 1992 hedging, or I should say investments, in a number of European currencies You will recall that the Swedish kronor was yielding significantly more than most money market instruments and the deutschemark So everyone figured that the kronor was locked into the deutschemark, and investors took positions in the Swedish kronor at high interest rates, hedged it in the deutschemark/dollar market, and got blown apart This sort of led to the beginnings of the ERM falling apart  I think we are looking at something not terribly significantly different in this current situation Prior to our move on February 4th, the market had drifted into a state of somnambulance at low risk premiums, and there were steady upward price pressures While we all recognized at the time that the stock market was a little dicey and we were worried about the mutual funds, I don't think we were aware of the apparent underlying speculative elements involved in the markets on a worldwide basis that I think our February move unearthed I think it was a wakeup call which basically got everyone to look up and say How long can this go on? And if our wakeup call had not occurred on February 4th, there would have been another wakeup call coming some other time within days, weeks, or months I believe we in effect dislodged a brick from an edifice when it was vulnerable to being hit by something What actually eventually hit it was the Philadelphia Federal Reserve's February publication That morning the CPI came out at zero and the bond market took off; it rose to 639 percent on the 30-year bond, which was 10 basis points above its level before we moved, and by the end of the day the Philadelphia Fed index for February came out, it closed at 654 percent Now, it wasn't the Philadelphia Federal Reserve index itself that moved the market; that was a catalyst The way we knew that is that when the March index came out and the index turned around, the bond market tried to rally and it rallied for about 10 minutes and got its head cut off So really, these are secondary catalysts to a far more fundamental restructuring that's going on Views of the market structure are undergoing a major review at this stage and portfolios are undergoing dramatic changes We have seen some increase in yield spreads but they are still quite low by any historic standard, which suggests to me that the adjustment process in the capital markets, in the portfolios of pension funds, mutual funds, and individual households, still has a long way to go I'm not saying that means that interest  -40-    3/22/94  rates have to adjust; I mean that portfolios are out of kilter and are still being adjusted  When we moved on February 4th, I think our expectation was that we would prick the bubble in the equity markets What in fact occurred is that, as evidence of the dramatic shift in the economic outlook began to emerge after we moved and long-term rates began to move up and hence the discount factor on stocks began to move up, we were also clearly getting a major upward increase in expectations of corporate earnings While the stock market went down after our actions on February 4th, it has gone down really quite marginally on net over this period So what has occurred is that while this capital gains bubble in all financial assets had to come down, instead of the decline being concentrated in the stock area, it shifted over into the bond area But the effects are the same These are major capital losses, which have required very dramatic changes in actions and activities on the part of individuals and institutions I believe there was a view that the capital gains in the bond markets were largely permanent because the economy was perceived as coming off a relatively high fourth quarter but would begin to ease at a somewhat faster pace, and it didn't do that And this development created a very significant shift as to where the capital losses occurred, although it may not have significantly altered what the actual possible losses overall would have been, combining the stock and the bond markets  With the improved economic outlook, risk premiums have remained quite low And the reason they are continuing quite low is that the risk to the economy is not perceived to be a crucial one So even though we had some pickup--for example the risk spreads of the six-month commercial paper vis-a-vis the bill rate have gone up moderately--it's the first rise in a long time and the spread is still basically low  There is a very strong view, which is reflected around this table, of a very solid economic outlook Indeed, I'm hard pressed to remember when the outlook itself looked as unequivocally expansionary as it does today We are always able to find reasons why it's going to cave, and there are lots of different figures we can adduce The only real danger to this economic outlook, as I see it right now, is the financial structure And that, as I think the Vice Chairman said, has a low probability of inducing a downturn But if the financial system were to be ruptured, it would not be terribly difficult to bring the economy down very quickly If you want precedents for that, I suggest that you merely go back and read the business annals that go back 50 or 100 years They show economic conditions looking absolutely terrific three weeks before the roof caves in So the outlook is one thing; history I think has to temper it Nonetheless, there is no doubt about the very strong underlying forces in the economy  The one area, as I think I said at the February meeting, that has potential upside risks is the inventory situation, which continues to be fairly tight I think the lead times are probably just now beginning to move out Somebody here mentioned steel mill inventories picking up; I've heard some of that myself We are beginning to get the first signs that the inventory numbers may be moving up, and if  -41-    3/22/94  that's the case, that would maintain a higher level of economic growth than I think we otherwise would have gotten  There is no question that we have cut the tail of the probability distribution for the economic outlook, even though in a modal sense the outlook itself is not all that much higher than it was six months ago so far as 1994 is concerned There was a good deal of concern six months ago that the economy might fade very fast The truth of the matter is that it has not And in the event, even though the modal expectation hasn't changed, the probability distribution has changed, and I think that's a major factor that has moved into the bond market and the whole constellation of interest rates  I thought the most interesting aspect of the discussion around this table today was some element of surprise--and I don't know how to phrase it but it involves almost everyone with the exception of Al Broaddus Everyone is concerned about a pickup in inflation, tightness and stringency picking up, and the fact that commodity prices are moving, but there is no apparent acceleration in wages or final goods prices  This raises a very interesting issue that we ought to think about I don't know where it leads us, but a year or so ago I raised a question about the absence of financial tinder--meaning credit, debt, and money supply--in the economy, even as the economy was picking up and we were beginning to see some shrinkage in excess capacity But a year or so ago, we had soft inflation and excess capacity Looking strictly at what the data show to date, the inflation rate, if anything, is somewhat less than we had expected We have very detailed data for January and February, or more exactly probably half-way through February We have very detailed data on daily spot prices of a lot of things And we have some data from purchasing managers' reports which have never been terribly useful with respect to inflation We have very clearly seen some pickup in underlying commodity prices; we have seen very little evidence of accelerating inflation in any of the data on final prices Even the February CPI, in which the core rate was up 3 percent, is not a clear indicator I'm not inclined to pick pieces of it and isolate them, but there was a 6 percent increase in owners' equivalent rent, which was way above average If you bring that down to average, that takes off another tenth of a percentage point  The reason I raise this question is that we have an economy which doesn't look like anything that we have experienced in the last 30 years In the last 30 years, when we saw a tightening of slack in the system, we also saw a pickup in credit demands and we had inflation That, however, has not been the universal experience in this country If we go back to the 1920s, there were several periods of significant tightness in markets but no significant credit expansion and no inflation; that was also the experience even in the 1950s I raise this issue because we are pretty far along in this business cycle So why is inflation not showing its head a little more? Now, the next set of numbers may come out and I'll be sorry I said this, but the earlier experience raises the question Is it automatically the case that when the economy is tightening up that inflation takes hold?  -42-    3/22/94  I would submit that looking at the simple short-run Phillips curve, which is what we are doing, without a credit variable in it, may be misspecifying the process in question As we all know, the shrinkage of credit has basically reflected balance sheet strain in the latter part of the 1980s and has at the same time been associated with extraordinary weakness in all of the aggregates To be sure, there has been a pickup in credit--in loans and debt, but from very low levels and the numbers do not support, at least historically, any significant inflation pickup I must say that I find this whole process very puzzling, because it does not seem likely to me that it can continue in this way I'm sort of waiting for the credit numbers to really begin to move, for the patterns to begin to look like those I have found so familiar, being a business forecaster for a number of decades  There is something different going on I don't know yet what it means, but there are two facts that coincide with one another that at least should raise our awareness One is that we are not yet getting final demand price increases, and it may very well be that we are getting extraordinary productivity increases that are keeping unit labor costs down and the competitive pressures there That is why, of course, commodity prices, which are clearly going up, are not working their way through the system in a direct manner This is the type of situation where we are looking at a credit picture and a lack of inflation that is more reminiscent of the '20s than of the last 30 years And that is something we ought to keep in mind, because if we are basically going to presume that there is an automatic relationship, I think there is at least a question as to whether that is true I'm not sure that really affects what policy should be because I don't think there is any question that at some point and in some manner, if we have accommodative monetary policy at the central bank, credit has to become excessive and it has to become inflationary or all of our concepts about how the monetary system works will have to go into a radical revision, which I can't at this stage even remotely contemplate  Where this leaves me, putting the inflation issue aside for the moment, is that I think we have to restore policy to neutrality as fast as we can What I really have in mind here is to eliminate the excess degree of accommodation, which I assume is basically feasible If we were dealing strictly with the economic outlook as it stands now, there is no doubt in my mind that this economy could absorb a very large increase in interest rates without a problem The difficulty I have is that I don't think the financial system can take a very large increase without a break in its tensile strength--which we strained significantly the last time but did not break It's a risk, frankly, that I think we should be quite concerned about  So, we have the issue of, one, moving as fast as we can and two, doing it in a manner that doesn't break the markets But as I see our objectives here, there is another characteristic as well One of the elements that I think we have all been observing with respect to the markets--and one of the reasons why there has been such a level of instability in the markets--is that when we were perceived as moving on the basis of economic data, the markets had a certain sense of what it was we were doing Now, Jerry Jordan doesn't like that approach to policy and I have considerable sympathy for his point of view, but it did give the marketplace a semblance of knowing what we  -43-    3/22/94  were doing Now they are worried that they don't know when we are going to move, so we have this Sword of Damocles hanging over the market They don't know whether we are going to move in 2 days, 5 days, or 12 days; they have no basis to judge and they are understandably nervous So the question is, having very consciously and purposely tried to break the bubble and upset the markets in order to sort of break the cocoon of capital gains speculation, we are now in a position--having done that and in a sense succeeded perhaps more than we had intended--to try to restore some degree of confidence in the System And that means we have to find a way, if at all possible, to move toward a policy stance from which we will not be perceived as about to move again in any short period of time  That essentially leaves us, as far as I can see, with two options moving the funds rate up 25 basis points or 50 basis points I don't think we have an option, incidentally, of doing nothing There is no case that I feel comfortable with for doing nothing, so I would frankly reject "B" But leaving that option aside, I do think we have an interesting choice A 50 basis point increase would move the funds rate to 3-3/4 percent In my judgment that would not be perceived of as neutrality or where we ultimately have to be My own view is that eventually we have to be at 4 to 4-1/2 percent The question is not whether, but when If we were to move 50 basis points, I think we would create far more instability than we realize, largely because a half point is not enough to remove the question of where we ultimately are going I think there is a certain advantage in doing 25 basis points because the markets, having seen two moves in a row of 25 basis points at a meeting, will tend almost surely to expect that the next move will be at the next meeting--or at least I think the probability of that occurring is probably higher than 50/50 If that is the case and the markets perceive that--and they perceive we are going to 4 percent by midyear, moving only at meetings--then we have effectively removed the Damocles Sword because our action becomes predictable with respect to timing as well as with respect to dimension My own impression, if we decide to move in that direction, is that the last move we might want to make--say, for example, the funds rate was at 3-3/4 percent and we decided 4-1/4 percent might be neutrality--is that perhaps we should add 50 basis points at that point That would ring the gong as the end and we could in effect withdraw from the race, provided that during this period rising inflationary pressures did not actually start to become real as distinct from prospective  So, I must say at this point, having struggled with this issue for quite a long time and having given considerable thought to trying to convince myself that 50 basis points might be the best move, I come out thinking that while 50 basis points has a very good logical argument for it, it's too soon It doesn't quite get us there and I'm not sure that it gains the advantages that we would want My own inclination at this stage--I may sound a lot surer about what I think ought to be done than I am because we know the markets are very tricky--is to do 25 basis points today, but go asymmetric because the chances of our lowering rates in the intermeeting period ought to be zero  There is the possibility that the numbers may turn out to be a lot stronger than we are projecting--remember that the Greenbook has industrial production effectively slowing in March In fact, the  -44-    3/22/94  weekly data results for March point to a decline, not a rise, so there is also the possibility that this expansion could slow and ratify the Greenbook projection If that in fact turns out to be the case and we get a removal of any significant pressures, then we have the opportunity of maintaining a slow pace in moving up into a neutral policy area because that has been our program all along; this had nothing to do with inflationary pressures If, however, wholly independently of our process of going to neutrality, we begin to see that this economy is not slowing--or more specifically, if we see that inventories are really beginning to move up, because that's where I think the vulnerability is--then we will have a second set of decisions to make We would still have the path to neutrality to implement, which as far as I'm concerned we have to get to, but we would have an added factor on top of that--an additional tightening superimposed on our move to neutrality because, in effect, we would be seeing an economy that is actually beginning to heat up My own guess is we are not going to see the economy heat up until the funds rate gets to 4 percent, meaning that I think we have enough time to move meeting by meeting, which gets us to a 4 percent federal funds rate at midyear Then I think we will be in a far better position  That's the way I came out I took a lot longer to discuss this than usual because I've been thinking about it longer-- productively or otherwise, I'm not sure But I lay it out as it seems to me and frankly am very interested in any counter-arguments or issues that people would like to raise, not only with respect to the policy but with respect to all the pieces Where I come out really depends on this evaluation of the outlook because what concerns me at the moment is not the economy; the economy looks terrific to me I'm worried that we could break the back of this financial system and find out in retrospect not only that this situation has the negative characteristics of some of the data of the 1920s, but we could also find out that the experience of the 1987 stock market crash, which was benevolent, is not something that is likely to be replicated Ed   President Parry   President Broaddus   Governor Lindsey   Let me just respond to that because I have great sympathy for the point you are making Ideally, we should be symmetric for exactly the reasons that you state The problem that I have with it is that I'm thinking of two separate potential monetary policy paths, which may be additive In other words, if the situation is evolving in a relatively stable manner, then the symmetric language reinforces the fact that we are moving only at particular times The probability of our easing is very small, and I think we can probably handle the problem that you raise in the way the minutes are written  -47-    3/22/94  In other words, the minutes could reflect our thinking that the asymmetry is not a break from this pattern but a wholly different option in the event that our evaluation is inappropriate That's the way I would look at it   That's true, but nobody will know the directive was asymmetric until they see the minutes   Let me put it this way As far as I'm concerned, the asymmetry is there only in the event that the economy or inflation begin to look much stronger than we at the moment anticipate Now, if that occurs, one other possibility is that we can leave the directive symmetric and decide to go with a conference call That's another possibility   That's the equivalent, as far as I'm concerned In fact, we are in such an important period of the expansion that I think the more we talk with each other, the better off we are I find consultation frankly quite useful President Jordan   First Vice President Minehan   President Hoenig   President Forrestal   Governor Kelley   But you would prefer symmetry?  -50-    3/22/94   Okay President Keehn   President Stern   President Melzer   President McTeer   Governor Phillips   Governor LaWare   Vice Chairman   Let me just say that I've been back and forth on this symmetric/asymmetric issue and, as far as I'm concerned, a conference call serves exactly the same purpose Indeed, it might actually be preferable because we do gain benefits from having the symmetric language in the minutes So I will support symmetric as well and would propose 25 basis points and symmetric language Would you read the directive   The only problem is if we change the directive, is that we don't know the consequences of doing that So let's not   But it's an interesting question Let's review that in the intermeeting period Do you want to read the--   Would somebody like to open the meeting by making a motion to approve the minutes?   Is there a second?  SPEAKER(?) Second   Without objection I'll call on Peter Fisher for a report on foreign currency operations Peter   Questions for Peter?   Let me just add that I've had a number of conversations with Mr Tietmeyer    5/17/94   The issue never came up, at least not in my conversations Governor Lindsey   President Forrestal   Okay, any further questions? If not, would somebody like to move to ratify the actions of the Foreign Desk since the last meeting?  SPEAKER(?) So move  SPEAKER(?) Second    5/17/94   Without objection Joan Lovett   Questions for Joan? Jerry   That's one of the advantages of announcing   If there are no further questions, would somebody like to move to ratify the actions of the Desk since the last meeting?   The next meeting is on July 5 and 6, the Humphrey-Hawkins meeting This meeting is adjourned  END OF MEETING  -39-       Without objection Let's now move on to Messrs Truman and Prell   Questions for either gentleman?   Governor LaWare   President Boehne   President Jordan   President Hoenig  -11-    5/17/94   President Broaddus   Further questions for the gentlemen? If not, would somebody like to start the Committee discussion?   President Keehn   President Parry   President Broaddus   President Forrestal   First Vice President Minehan   Thank you President McTeer   President Boehne   President Stern   President Jordan   There used to be a big stainless high alloy industry in this country, but it has evaporated   President Melzer   Governor Kelley  GOVERNOR KELLEY Thank you, Mr Chairman I'm essentially the same place I was in March, so I'll try to be a little brief today We have moved policy considerably, three times now, which I think has been entirely appropriate The reason that I feel particularly comfortable with that comes largely from the fact that I think interest rates were too accommodative for present conditions and needed to be changed And probably we haven't completely eliminated that yet and we do have a little more to go Consequently, I would expect to support a policy move action in the second half of this meeting  My comfort doesn't primarily arise from an especially high level of concern that we are near full capacity and on the cusp of some type of an inflationary flashpoint I certainly do recognize that there's considerable strength out there and we get confirmation of that from the consistent reports--and I'm sure they're correct-- from around the Districts that there is a good deal of momentum Consequently, there surely is the possibility that the economy could overheat But I think there's reason for at least a bit of skepticism that that is going to happen A brief recitation, if I may; I did this the last time we were here and most of these things have been referred to in one form or other already this morning I won't talk further about interest rates; we know how much they've gone up Their restrictive impact is just beginning to be felt Mike Prell made reference to housing in particular Second, one factor that I think is important that we haven't talked about much is the impact of unit labor costs We've done very well in that regard recently In fact, it has been getting meaningfully lower now for some four straight years Staff tells me that in the case of the unit labor cost index, which has been decreasing substantially and consistently, that that impacts the economy with a six-quarter lag This means that we've got a lot more favorable impact to come from the restraint that is already in place  On the productivity side, we've recently been looking at a 2 percent increase Staff has raised its estimate of trend to 1-1/2 percent, but if I understand correctly, they are only expecting 1 percent over the remaining part of the forecast period All the private sector conversations I've had suggest that we might continue to do quite well in that regard rather than fall back If that turns out to be the case, it does two things for us, obviously First of all, it holds down cost pressures; and secondly, it extends the amount of capacity that the economy has available before it gets itself into difficulty  In the area of consumer spending, we've talked before about the very high level of debt that was built up through the 1980s; that plateaued for a while but did not come down, and now it has begun to rise again This leaves me with a considerable question in my mind as to how long the legs under consumer expenditures may be Indeed, if they're very long, I would worry about that a lot because we're in a new territory now in terms of consumer debt Not unrelated to that is  -25-    5/17/94  the fact that autos have been a part of the push so far and that probably has approximately peaked We've talked about foreign economies; I won't go into that any more but their weakness impacts on us here And then, of course, fiscal policy continues to be mildly contractionary, at least over the rest of the forecast period  All in all, I have considerable confidence that there's a lot of underlying strength in the economy, a lot of good solid momentum, and that things look very favorable I believe that the economy can keep growing despite whatever constraints are out there and that our recent policy actions as well as those restraints give us good prospects for keeping inflation well in check Thank you   Vice Chairman   Thank you Governor LaWare   Governor Phillips   Thank you Governor Lindsey   Thank you, Governor, and that brings us to our coffee break Let's take five, seven minutes  [Coffee break]   Questions for Don?   President Jordan   If there are no further questions, why don't I begin? One of the interesting aspects of this whole period has been the extraordinarily parallel pattern of movement between dollar-denominated long-term rates and the deutschemark and the whole series of other currencies, despite the fact that there are no very persuasive reasons why all of these rates should be fundamentally coupled You have to ask yourself under what conditions you get a coupling of rates for noneconomic reasons, or for reasons other than the basic type we usually see  The answer essentially lies in the notion, at least in my hypothesis, that if there is a risk premium out there which is generic, its impact will tend to be relatively the same depending not on what currency is involved but whether there is uncertainty about long-term commitments in financial markets and price stability in the markets If we hypothesize that there has been a very significant increase in international portfolio holdings of many currencies, then if you get a major element of uncertainty--for example, if I'm a portfolio manager and I have long commitments in US Treasuries on the expectation that prices are going to go up, and the markets go against me--what has happened is that my whole sense that "I know what it's doing" has collapsed And the tendency, whenever uncertainty of that nature arises, is for human beings to disengage from whatever they're doing, to pull back And pulling back in the US Treasury market means going from 10-, 15-, and 30-year issues into the short end of the market, tilting the yield curve back up But it also presupposes that any element of speculative uncertainty which exists in the holdings of long-term deutschemark relative to short-term deutschemark also induces an adjustment by sales of longer-term  -31-    5/17/94  securities and purchases of shorter-term This adjustment obviously can spill over into all sorts of portfolio holdings, provided there's a large amount of communication  It is just very difficult to know why it is that US dollar- denominated issues have so dominated the markets, and indeed why we at the central bank, by tightening, have obviously dislodged a lot of positions while creating a concept which is analogous to a generic risk premium that explains not the intercurrency movements but the movements from speculative positions--that is, from longer-end price- sensitive positions back to the shorter end It also explains in part the nature of the financial bubble that we obviously have run into This is a very interesting phenomenon because what we see is a very large increase in implied volatility in the long end of the market coming off the options, but only a very modest increase in the yield spreads of a number of the different types of instruments we use to measure credit risk We've gotten a very small rise in the rate on six-month commercial paper over six-month Treasury bills; BAA corporate yield increases have been very small relative to US Treasuries during all of this period Junk bond yield spreads are not moving up, which is another way of saying that the concerns about the economy as such are not being undermined by all of this financial instability What we come up against here is that there is a great deal of uncertainty and a lot of nervousness And indeed some of it is purposeful on our part because if we are going to pierce the bubble, the only way we're going to pierce it is essentially to create a degree of uncertainty  The issue of uncertainty as being helpful or unhelpful is really not clear-cut We experienced periods of relative certainty in the latter part of 1993 which everybody just looked at as though the markets had no downside price risks; everyone was committed The yield spreads were very marginal, and indeed they had all been coming down dramatically from the 1987 peaks after the stock market crash, and there was an element of euphoria that really gripped the markets You could see that in huge increases in mutual funds, both stock and bond funds In fact, what we were dealing with largely was a situation in which there was very little uncertainty That clearly was a very unhappy state of affairs; the mere fact that uncertainty did not exist was not a good; it clearly was a bad And our endeavor to break that pattern, which we had to do even though it turned out to be a much bigger problem than we suspected, was a very purposeful endeavor to create a degree of uncertainty and readjust holdings from weak hands into firmer hands as far as speculative securities are concerned As a consequence we have taken a very significant amount of air out of the bubble We had discussions in this Committee not on the desirability of raising rates and tightening the markets because the economy needed it--I think that was a universal view--but there have been differences here about how much the financial system could take before its tensile strength broke And I think what we have reached in conclusion at this particular point is the defusion of a good part of the bubble I think there's still a lot of bubble around; we have not completely eliminated it Nonetheless, we have the capability I would say at this stage to move more strongly than we usually do without the risk of cracking the system  I think the economy is probably stronger than we suspect, partly for reasons that I raised back in February; the inventory  -32-    5/17/94  situation just strikes me as too tranquil, and before this is all over I think we've got to get something moving on the inventory side Look at the lead times on deliveries of materials; they've just moved up modestly Slowdowns in promised deliveries have clearly moved up and that's far more than an issue of the weather in the month of February So there are the makings here of stronger inventory changes than I think we recognize  The most interesting aspect of the economic outlook as I see it is that this far into the recovery--and it's almost immaterial whether or not you take Jerry's view that in effect we're only in the first year of the recovery--the actual inflation rates, wage rates, and the like are lower than one would ordinarily expect This raises the question, which I've raised in earlier meetings, as to whether the lack of financial tinder is a relevant consideration here in holding inflation back The truth of the matter is that it almost doesn't matter, because as Gary Stern said--and I think quite legitimately--we may not know what the future looks like but we do know at this particular stage, with the relative lack of imbalances that exist in the economy, that the chances of overdoing a tightening of monetary policy and creating a cascading down in economic activity are really not very large If we overdo it, what we will do is push economic activity farther out The chances of our breaking the back of the economy at this point--with inventory levels as low as they are, capital goods markets still with significant momentum, and the orders as strong as they are--have to be pretty low The obvious problem is that errors on allowing inflation to take hold, even if the data raise questions as to whether it will, involve another type of risk altogether As a central bank we obviously can't take that kind of risk  The sentiment of the Board of Governors, as you probably know, is to move the discount rate, as nearly all the Reserve Banks have requested, by 50 basis points today And the implicit view of the Governors is to request of the Committee that we allow all of the increase to pass through There is a balance of concerns as to how we should state that, but if we are going to act, I do think we should indicate that we are taking out a substantial part of the degree of accommodation that existed through the 1993 period But I'd leave open the issue of any further moves; while we may pause for markets to interpret that, we ought to make adequate leeway to move should events require that we do so My own impression is that we probably will not have to move before the next meeting if we do 50 basis points now  I find it unlikely that we are near the end of this pattern, but I do think we are now becoming more data dependent There really are two credible economic scenarios that we have to keep in mind One is something quite similar to the Greenbook forecast and, if that scenario evolves, the inflationary pressures on the system will come down If it doesn't evolve, if we still have momentum in the system, I think the pressures are going to pick up on us to move--not immediately, but sooner rather than later The crucial issue as far as I'm concerned, however, even though it's not a critical matter in the forecast, is to watch what's happening to the financial system-- what's happening to bank loans, to credit extensions, to the degree of financial tinder that is either not moving or moving We need to be very careful about this very large risk premium that exists in the financial markets, which basically says that this bubble is a bigger  -33-    5/17/94  one than we had anticipated We've caused a good part of it to dissipate, maybe even most of it, but it's very obvious from the implied volatility numbers we're getting out of the options that these markets are not about to simmer down very quickly  So, I merely have put the issue out on the table I have a particular view, were we to move 50 basis points, on whether we should go symmetric or asymmetric My preference is symmetric, but frankly I don't think it means very much because if the economy accelerates we'll be holding special Committee discussions, with or without symmetry in the directive language My own inclination would be to go symmetric at this stage, but I don't feel very strongly about it With that I open this issue up   President Parry   Excuse me, I'll just read you a very preliminary draft   I just happen to have it here! This implies that we move on both the discount rate and the funds rate "These actions, combined with the three adjustments initiated earlier this year by the FOMC, substantially remove the degree of monetary accommodation which prevailed throughout 1993 As always, the Federal Reserve will continue to monitor developments in the economy and financial markets to judge the appropriate stance of monetary policy" I think that captures where we want to be   President Melzer  -34-    5/17/94   Neither do we President Broaddus   President Boehne   First Vice President Minehan   President Stern   President Hoenig   President Keehn   It's going to be announced as a part of the discount rate announcement In other words, there's no need to make two separate announcements   It's not by me; it will be by Joe Coyne Governor LaWare   We played with that I think it's a tricky issue and I'm trying to avoid--if we ever tried to write a communique around this table we would be here for a good six months! President McTeer   Governor Phillips   It was at the point when we thought that the structure of the financial markets could take more   At the very beginning we were concerned that we would be hitting the markets too hard   President Jordan   Vice Chairman   Governor Kelley   Governor Lindsey   Call the roll   Before we get under way today, I want to welcome Governor Janet Yellen who is attending her first Committee meeting   She was exposed to her first Board meeting yesterday You survived that, and I wish you well today   Cathy Minehan is at her first meeting as President of the Boston Bank and we congratulate you   Finally, while Bill Conrad has been here before, this is the first time he is representing the Chicago Bank So I have many announcements--more than usual for this organization Let's start by having somebody move to approve the minutes of the July 5-6 meeting   Is there a second?   Without objection Peter Fisher, would you take us through the foreign operations Desk report?   On that there are two ongoing thoughts that are supposed to be insights into what happened First is the notion that the moves on the part of those two central banks were suggestive of the fact that declines in European rates had come to an end The other is that because the public debt/GDP ratio in both countries is exceptionally high, the rise in interest rates was suggestive of the fact that the deficit might be more of a problem To which of those two, if any, do you subscribe to explain this phenomenon, which scares every central banker I know?   Further questions for Peter?   Any further questions for Peter? If not, Joan Lovett will you carry us through domestic operations?   Questions for Joan? If not, would somebody like to move to ratify the actions of the Desk since the last meeting?  SPEAKER(?) So move  SPEAKER(?) Second   Thank you very much and our next meeting is--   September 27th  -37-    8/16/94 -38-   Yes, but we first need a Board meeting   May I suggest that the Board members join me in the other room?  END OF MEETING       Without objection Let us move on to the economic situation and Mike Prell   In looking at the divergence between the permits and the starts in this morning's release, as you know, it could possibly be that we had a significant increase in non-permit single-family starts Do we have those data yet?   Any further questions for Mike or, I might say for that matter, for Ted Truman who has no formal remarks to make? President Parry   Governor LaWare   President Stern   President Jordan   Governor Blinder   Any further questions for Mike or Ted? If not, would somebody like to start the round table?   President Forrestal   That suggests that the literacy rate isn't very high!   President Parry   President Parry   President Hoenig   President Minehan   Okay, President Boehne   President Melzer   President McTeer   Are they just wondering or do they know for sure?  SPEAKER(?) Bet on it   Listen, any banker who doesn't make some loans he should not have made is not doing his job The only trick is to figure out which of those that he has made are in that category   Doubtless   President Stern   Do you expect problems in the spring wheat crop to be serious?   Does that spill over into Saskatchewan, do you know?   Governor Lindsey   What are you doing with imputed interest?   No, I understand that, but it's in the NIPA   There are also directors' fees in that line which should be in the cash flow   Barely   First Vice President Conrad   President Jordan   Governor Phillips   Governor Blinder   Governor Kelley   Vice Chairman   Thank you Governor LaWare   Governor Yellen   Thank you I assume coffee is there?   Let's recess for our usual coffee break  [Coffee break]   Questions for Don?   Any other questions for Don? If not, let me get started Let me just say first that after listening to the roundtable discussion and looking at the usual long sets of figures, what I come away with is that despite the longevity of this recovery, there really are few signs of aging There are marginal evidences of imbalances, marginal evidences of pressures, but in general it still looks as though this recovery has a considerable set of momentums associated with it First of all, profit margins are still rising and indeed, they are coming in above expectations That is an extraordinarily rare characteristic for the latter stages of a business expansion Inventory/sales ratios are low, especially if one strips out the trade markups to produce constant dollar factory values of inventory/sales ratios Those ratios have been coming down very dramatically as the "just-in-time" processes have accumulated at a fairly substantial pace I suspect that we finally hit bottom in the spring with "just-in-time" That is, the room for further declines in inventory/sales ratios has become very significantly limited and, as a consequence of that, the process of going to zero change means a boom in inventory investment  Unquestionably an important concern here is whether we are looking only at the end of "just-in-time" or looking at inventory investment that is substantially unintended and that could back up as the DRI overhang analysis suggests First of all, we do know that a substantial part of the inventory change, especially in the trade area, is imported goods Internal estimates by Board staff indicate that imported goods accounted for roughly 1/3 of the inventory change in April and May This obviously means that to the extent the added inventories came from imports, to the extent that there is any unintended inventory accumulation there, it is the imports and the  -29-    8/16/94  foreign producers that get backed up, not domestic Secondly, if there were a significant element of unintended inventory accumulation here, we really would expect to begin to see it in the new orders series A goodly chunk of the inventory accumulation is clearly very directly intended inventory accumulation, because a lot of it is in capital goods areas where the order patterns have been very strong But from anecdotal evidence on orders and the actual detailed Commerce Department data on orders, it is very difficult to make the case that there is any significant element of unintended inventory accumulation in these numbers I think there is some evidence on the basis of inventory numbers that orders for furniture did back up a little, but it is really at the margin and very little evidence suggests that we have a particular problem there We also are not seeing evidence in the inventory structure of any serious difficulty even on the other side It's true that there has been slowing down in deliveries, but lead times on new orders have shown very little evidence of rising, especially in the production materials area And so it is suggestive that we neither have an exceptionally tight inventory situation or a loose one That seems consistent with a middle stage of the business cycle, one that is neither negative nor particularly positive  I do think we are getting some slowdown in the rate of growth, but the crucial question is from where? We tend to look at the gross domestic product as the measure of what the economy is doing and there is some serious question in the last two or three quarters whether or not that is low-balling the rate of growth As we discussed previously, looking at gross domestic income, which is conceptually equivalent and leaving aside the issue of very weak data for the second quarter, the growth in gross domestic income was several tenths above the growth in gross domestic product in the fourth quarter and the first quarter Disaggregating the gross domestic product into the value of industrial production and "all other" and substituting the industrial production index for the value of industrial production as a conceptually equivalent measure of aggregate growth, again we get stronger growth than is in the GDP numbers What this is indicating is that we have to be a little careful about these measurements For example, I find utterly noncredible the probability that, in the real world, productivity declined in the second quarter The reason I say this is that if you get an expansion in the economy, leaving aside its nature, and you get rising profit margins, you begin to wonder where the profit margin rise is coming from It clearly is not through increases in prices The question basically is how to reconcile this situation in which we get this huge increase in work hours and therefore in compensation of employees against a slowed GDP that suggests, other things equal, that margins are declining, not opening up I am merely saying that I am a little suspicious of the GDP figures, although I grant that the underlying work hour figures themselves may be exaggerated in the second quarter But it is very hard to reconcile the anecdotal evidence and the basic data with which we deal to believe those productivity data, and that is one more reason at least to wonder about some of the GDP figures  In the current period, there is very little doubt that we are not getting a significant amount of deterioration I think it is certainly the case for the interest-sensitive sectors--residential construction and to whatever extent we can say that weakness in motor vehicle sales is other than shortages I think there was a very  -30-    8/16/94  persuasive case put forward by Mike Prell's associates at a Board meeting the other day that a very large part of the decline in motor vehicle sales is the result of shortages and not a basic weakness in demand Nonetheless, I think one must argue that there is a slowing down in that particular area, and it is being offset, probably not fully, by expansions in the capital goods markets, which I suspect may again be underestimated in the GDP sense in constant dollar terms because the communications equipment prices just do not look realistic, as a number of people are beginning to conclude This suggests that real producers durable equipment is probably rising at a faster pace It may also imply, I might say parenthetically, that the capacity measures may also be affected on the up side However, I think we are getting clear evidence of improving world economic growth vis-a-vis our earlier views, which suggests that the export markets are moving and doubtless the exchange rate will have some impact there as well The drag from nonresidential construction is clearly at an end The indications that values of commercial real estate are beginning to stabilize and are beginning to move up in certain local areas are consistent with the beginning of a turn in office and other commercial construction We are running through the backlogs of very major deterioration in the nonresidential building area, and I think that sector will cease to exert weakening pressures Very currently, we are seeing initial claims for unemployment insurance that are quite low, and that suggests that the labor markets are doing rather well Growth in employment seems quite significant Not only are orders strong but there is impressive evidence that unfilled orders are accelerating on the up side both in current and constant dollars A statistic we don't talk about very often, but it is not irrelevant because it is a leading indicator, is the extraordinary rise in net business formation, which BEA shows as a fairly sharp upswing--again something not consistent with a late stage of the business cycle So it strikes me that, as Don Kohn puts it, with the reverse head winds coming in the bank credit data, loan data, and the like, it is beginning to get a little nervous-making, I must say This stuff is really beginning to move  All in all, it is very difficult to get around the general notion that, even though there is some evidence of a slowdown in the rate of growth, it still appears to be coming in at a somewhat higher level than I suspect we are used to looking at, if all we are looking at is the gross domestic product figures themselves Also, there is an underlying momentum here that suggests there are a couple of big legs left in this business cycle  I think one has to conclude, as far as policy is concerned, that another upward notch in rates is clearly called for at some point Therefore, the question we have to ask ourselves, which is not inconsistent with what Jerry Jordan was raising, is if we believe that, why not now? I think the question really gets to a notion of what we expect we will ultimately have to do I frankly don't know whether or not the staff's estimate of a 100 basis point increase is the right number I do know that there is a not insignificant probability that 50 basis points may be enough if we do it now I don't know what the probability is but if somebody said, is it 1, I'd say it's a lot higher than that Is the probability greater than 50 percent? I doubt it I think it's a third, maybe 40 percent, but who knows I do think that if we move 50 basis points now, the probability that we will not have to move before the end of the year  -31-    8/16/94  probably is greater than 50 percent One of the reasons I say that is that implicit in the 100 basis points that they have in the Greenbook is the fact that long-term rates are coming down and we are getting a new sort of dynamic in the system coming from residential construction In that context, we need an upward adjustment of short- term rates because the shape of the yield function is beginning to move closer to normality I'm not sure about where long-term rates are in that particular context But I do know that as we look at the situation now, unlike where we were in the early stages of our tightening moves, where remember I was terribly concerned--maybe overly concerned but I doubt it--that if we did more than 25 basis points we were risking the stability of the system With the May move, I think we clearly demonstrated that the bubble for all practical purposes had been defused, and that we needn't worry about larger increases at this stage With the passage of time, I think the moving of securities from weaker hands to stronger hands has now made it far less likely that a 50 basis point move at this point would shake the markets in any significant way, if at all  I'm a little concerned that 25 basis points would merely raise the issue of when the other shoe is going to drop I am a little nervous about raising the rate more than 50 basis points because frankly I'm not sure we need it If we don't need it, there is no point in doing it and it's an element of risk that I don't think we need to take My own view--I'm being a little more detailed than I usually am so I hope people will excuse me in this respect--is that it's very important if we were to do 50 basis points, that we not give the impression that somehow we anticipate major accelerations and this is just the beginning of a long series of 50 basis point increases If the markets believe that, then I think we have a very serious potential of creating a major negative market reaction I think we have to be very careful to avoid giving that impression The only realistic way we can avoid that is to issue some type of statement with any move that we make that implies that we are in the process of reassessing where we will go--in other words, our intention to hold for a while without tying our hands, which we cannot do  After talking to my colleagues on the Board of Governors, I think there is a sentiment on the part of the Board to raise the discount rate 50 basis points in line with what a number of the Reserve Banks are requesting I think implicit in that, in the view of the Board, is to request this Committee to allow all of the increase to pass through Also, I might add, implicit in that general policy view is our adoption of symmetric instructions to the Desk The more I think about that as a potential sort of policy package, the less I like all of the other alternatives I started off at either no change and asymmetry or 50 basis points with symmetry on the grounds that 25 basis points struck me as risking the other shoe dropping syndrome But I must say, the more I listened to this group and your comments on the elements involved and such things as the housing starts figures this morning--incidentally, Mike, the adjusted permits if we add back the nonpermit issuing areas are down only 8, not 17   In other words, if we had a very weak residential construction area or a weak motor vehicles area, I would say we might want to pause and do nothing But I think the evidence is increasingly convincing that we probably need to do 50 basis points I must admit that I was going to start out more even-handed - -on the one hand, on the other hand, if you will--but I convinced myself to steer away from that [Laughter] So with those apologies, I open up the discussion Bob   President Hoenig   Governor Blinder   President Jordan   President Broaddus   President Parry   President Melzer   President Minehan  -34-    8/16/94   Let me read a suggestion that hopefully captures what is involved here so that nobody is blindsided on this The potential statement would read "The Federal Reserve will continue to monitor economic and financial developments to gauge the appropriate stance of policy But these actions are expected to be sufficient at least for a time to meet the objective of sustained noninflationary growth" That is as good a crafting as I think can be done to capture what it is we are trying to do and yet not tie our hands, because tying our hands would be a terrible mistake, and I don't think it's credible in any event   Governor LaWare   Governor Phillips   Governor Lindsey   President Stern   Governor Kelley  -35-    8/16/94   Vice Chairman   President Boehne   Governor Yellen   President McTeer   First Vice President Conrad   President Melzer   Yes, I think so   "Noninflationary growth"  "Noninflationary growth?"  -36-   "Sustained noninflationary growth"   I would think not Noninflationary to me means noninflationary; 3 percent is not noninflationary   We are talking about objectives, we are not talking--   Okay, read the directive   Yes   Call the roll   Who would like to move approval of the minutes for the August meeting?  SPEAKER(?) So move  SPEAKER(?) Second   Without objection they are approved President McDonough   We need a vote on that motion; would somebody like to second it?  SPEAKER(?) Second   Without objection We welcome Rick to this organization Peter Fisher, would you start us off?   Questions for Peter?   President Broaddus   President McDonough   President Forrestal   President Parry   Could we arrange a facility with the Bundesbank to discount those securities or to take a loan and use the securities as collateral?   The purpose of a central bank is to create liquidity   Go ahead, Tom   President McTeer   Okay, any further questions for Peter? If not, Joan Levitt   Did I say "Levitt?" I meant "Lovett" I'm sorry   Questions for Joan?   President Jordan   Any further questions for Joan?    9/27/94   Further questions? If not, would somebody like to move to ratify the actions taken since the last meeting?   Let me say that under our new procedure for announcing our decisions, Don Kohn thinks that 215 pm is the appropriate time to announce anything coming out of the meeting, including a statement such as we have made in the past that no action was taken We violated that last time largely because we finished our meeting early and a lot of staff members came into the Board Room from outside, and security was an issue at that point So, I request that no one mention anything that occurred within this meeting even to your associates outside until the 215 pm announcement time when Joe Coyne, I gather, will be making the statement that the meeting is over Is that correct?   Yes, no further announcement   Okay, and the next meeting is November 15 Let's adjourn for lunch  END OF MEETING  -45-       Without objection Let's move on now to the staff report and Messrs Prell and Truman   Questions for either gentleman?   Go ahead   Of course, personal income and wages and salaries collapsed! [Laughter]    9/27/94   The average hourly earnings approach is infinity for that group   President Parry    9/27/94   President McTeer   I think there's an interesting answer to that Most of those adjustments that we ̀see are the dealer responses as distinct from those of the retail pension funds and the like If you are a dealer and you believe that the chance of the Federal Reserve lowering rates approaches zero, all of the unexpected shocks have got to be on the up side So if you're taking a long position in, say, 10- or 30-year securities for a trading play and you know that we are not going to do anything for a while, that is one discontinuity you don't have to be concerned about But if there's a concern, if there is a Damocles Sword overhanging the system, you are very reluctant to hold inventories net long And as a consequence of that, it is very likely to be a combination of both of those In other words, the 50 basis points implies that we will not be active for a while, and then the statement reinforces that That is just another way of saying to the bond dealers that it's safe to hold inventories, at least so far as potential unexpected Fed policy is concerned   I think both I think the notion is that we tightened and said we are not going to tighten further It's an effect of the tightening and the statement that nothing is going to happen thereafter That was essentially our basic thrust as you remember at the last meeting, and I think the markets responded to that double effect   I think bond dealers would prefer that (1) the Fed never did anything, (2) that no one released any statistics, and (3) that everything was trading incrementally Under those conditions they would feel comfortable Any further questions? Cathy   Further questions for either gentleman? If not, who would like to start the round table? President Forrestal   Thank you President Parry   President Boehne   Vice Chairman   President Broaddus   Governor Lindsey   That's okay, Peter was replaced by Joan "Levitt" [Laughter]   President Minehan   Thank you President Jordan   President Hoenig   President Moskow   Do you want us to ask what your affiliation is in this regard?   President Stern   President McTeer   President Melzer   This is a manufacturer of what?   Governor LaWare   Governor Kelley   Governor Yellen   Governor Blinder   It means you agree with him on 1/2 percent?   Finally, Governor Phillips   Thank you Coffee is available Let's break for coffee and return  [Coffee break]   Don Kohn, would you start us off?   Questions for Don? If not, let me start out I think the evidence is fairly solid that the industrial momentum that we have been seeing in recent months has a head of steam behind it; we can see it in the order books; we can see it in the backlogs; it's fairly widespread But as Governor Blinder pointed out, the growth in industrial production this year clearly has been concentrated to a significant extent in durable goods and has been  -34-    9/27/94  especially heavy in areas related to capital goods But these areas are where inventories are rising most and why they are crucial to measures of industrial pressures and overall pressures In tracing this phenomenon over the last year or two, we are aware of a very rapidly dropping inventory/sales ratio when calculated to exclude the margins of trade In other words, factory-valued inventories as a ratio to consumption have been falling at a fairly dramatic rate until very recently Indeed, the decline has been enough to hold the level of real inventories to a very slow growth path until very recently As we discussed at previous meetings, all we have to do arithmetically is to take the "just-in-time" decline in inventory/sales ratios and flatten them out and inventory investment surges Indeed, that is what apparently is happening at this stage; it's where the second- quarter run-up in GDP occurred  I'm a little skeptical that the reduction in the rate of inventory investment in the third quarter is going to be all that substantial The reason rests on the question of whether increasing backlogs suggest that lead times are stretching out, as Tom Melzer pointed out with respect to his one-observation sample The stretching out is confirmed by the lagged deliveries, but it is not confirmed by the lead times that are reported by purchasing managers So it's not clear yet exactly what the full state of play is, but it is clear that lagged deliveries tend historically to have been a more potent indicator of what the inventory situation really is In any event, it's quite inconceivable that the August industrial production increase of 07 percent was substantially or all an increase in consumption There is no evidence of that The implication is that there was a substantial increase in inventories in August when one factors in reasonable numbers on imports and exports of various industrial materials  That's not the same thing as saying that that is what is going to show up in the deflated book value data The inventories implied in the industrial production numbers or the real inventory data produced for autos, oil, some steel, and a variety of other actually measured totals don't quite square with the book value data, which tend to be a little flaky My suspicion is that the deflation process is very tricky as one goes from book value to constant dollars; it's a weak statistic But I think both sets of data, whether one is deriving them from the industrial data themselves or from the book value data, show that the decline in inventory/sales ratios has come to a halt and may very likely be tilting up ever so slightly at this particular stage This is what one would expect as the economy begins to approach capacity limits and backlogs begin to stretch out The normative desired levels of inventories tend to rise because obviously if firms are trying to protect their production schedules, the time it takes to get deliveries of new materials from suppliers will largely dictate what we used to call "safety stocks" in evaluating the inventory situation Safety stocks at this stage are probably rising slightly There is no evidence of major shifts, but it's very unlikely with the backlogs picking up as they are that these safety stock numbers are not moving at least somewhat higher This suggests that the second-quarter number, while it may be somewhat hard to interpret, is not in any regard suggesting an overhang of inventories or providing any evidence that those inventory accumulations are unintentional If they were, we would see it in the orders data Although it may well be that the data we will see  -35-    9/27/94  tomorrow for durable goods orders will give us a different signal than we have been getting, to date there's very little in the anecdotal reports or in other data that suggests that orders have simmered down in any material way  The question on which I think we have to focus at this point is whether there is an inventory recession threat at the end of this cycle Because if there is a significant pickup in inventories that is perceived to be voluntary, past history has always raised the question as to whether that pickup is overdone It is unlikely, I might say, that monetary policy can restrain inventory accumulation by higher short-term interest rates The reason basically is that since inventories are there to protect production schedules, the contemplation of inadequate stocks at any particular time weighs very heavily on purchasing policies There would need to be some extraordinarily high interest rates to impede the accumulation of inventories when they are perceived to be necessary for sustaining production In any event, it's fairly obvious that we are not dealing with a loan availability problem because with the very high degree of securities holdings by the commercial banking system we can get a very large loan/deposit ratio increase with a big shift from securities into loans and no bank credit expansion So the factors subduing inventory accumulation have to come from the final sales side If there is an effect, it's got to be because residential construction and existing home sales are slowing down, with the result that sales of household durables are slowing down This means the realized capital gain on the sale of existing homes that has a big impact on durable goods spending is also going down When that sort of thing gets going, inventories will back up very quickly Consequently, the concern that one might have that the inventory building will be overdone and lead to an inventory recession a year or two out becomes essentially moot  Price pressures are building with the rise in backlogs and delayed deliveries But I must say I was somewhat impressed--I don't know if my memory is faulty--that while everyone around the table, with few exceptions, was talking about stronger activity, even if you chose different words, I did read your comments on inflation as implying slightly less upward pressure on prices There was surprisingly little talk of more price pressures around the room I'm not sure one can make very much of this, but if prices were in the process of accelerating at this stage, I think we would have heard more around the room on that point But that is scarcely a scientific judgment  One other important issue that I think we probably ought to focus on at this stage is the extent to which profit margins are rising They are moving up, or at least they had moved up at a very abrupt rate until very early this year, which is another way of saying that unit consolidated costs have been rising much less than prices Indeed, if one looks at the data, as inadequate as they are in the national income accounts, we are getting a spread of well over a percentage point in the rate of change between unit costs on the one hand and prices on the other What that suggests is that productivity obviously is moving up and unit labor costs are being contained The discussion we had previously indicated that the rising costs of raw materials were not moving into final goods prices and that those rising costs are being absorbed by the subdued behavior of unit labor  -36-    9/27/94  costs But the presumption that there has been no pass-through at all is belied by the fact that margins are opening up When margins open up, what we are observing is in effect an ability on the part of a lot of producers to move the price level  Now, we are saying that inflation is 3 percent Well, 3 percent is not a small number; it is not small over the long run in the consumer area But granted it is not that good, it is less than that for goods at the final CPI level; it is probably more than that at the PPI level I was a little concerned, even though in the last published report the CPI was reasonably contained, that the PPI core number was somewhat higher Moreover, it apparently was being held down by still faulty seasonal adjustments, at least if we take our doubly seasonally adjusted processes to heart If we doubly seasonally adjust the seasonally adjusted rate of change of core PPI inflation, the last observation was, I think, at least 01 percent higher than the published number So I think what we are observing is the opening up of margins in much of the underlying structure But unit labor costs apparently have been so well contained by productivity gains at this stage that cost pressures have not flowed into final goods prices  The question that we confront at this stage that has been raised at this table, really for the first time in a broad sense--it started with Bob Forrestal and everyone just sort of picked it up--is the possibility of a short-term blip in the final goods price data If we look at business cycle patterns, we usually find that there is a cycle in prices The question that we have to ask ourselves is how much we care How much are we concerned about it so long as the peak- to-peak inflation rate in the business cycle gets progressively lower and the trough-to-trough level of price inflation gets progressively lower? That implies a long-term downtrend But as a number of comments around this table have indicated, we can not make the simple presumption that we can get an inflation blip and say "Well, it's a blip" The trouble with most blips is that they can be identified as such only in retrospect There are far more announced blips that turned out to be permanent changes than there are blips in the historical record So, we have to be very careful about viewing a blip as something that doesn't give us considerable concern  However, it is true, with profit margins up to the highest levels we have seen in well over a decade, that if pressures begin to increase the rate of growth in unit costs, history also suggests that there is a tendency for profit margins to start downward in the later stages of the cycle So there is a good deal of potential absorption of final prices here that could occur as a consequence of declining margins Indeed, there is a significant decline in profit margins in the Greenbook, and as a consequence, while the staff forecast has a very modest acceleration of inflation, implicitly the underlying costs obviously are accelerating at a far faster pace I think that is a reflection of an expectation of a slowdown in productivity gains, which to date have been the major factor in suppressing the pass- through to final prices  As a consequence of all of this, one has to ask why we are this far into the business cycle expansion without the types of price pressures that we have seen on previous occasions I raised this as an issue before, and I'm beginning to suspect that we are going to  -37-    9/27/94  find out whether or not the extraordinarily still muted money and credit aggregates really matter In other words, we are approaching a point where we will get interesting tests as to whether inflation is a Phillips curve phenomenon or a monetary phenomenon If we look at it from a Phillips curve point of view or its equivalent, slack in the industrial area, then we are on the edge of some severe inflationary pressure if we are getting rising inventory accumulation If, however, we think that prices are a monetary phenomenon, we are more likely to see the types of changes that occurred prior to the 1930s where we had a noninflationary long-term environment largely locked in by the gold standard, but periods of significant pressure during which inflation never really took hold, because the credit aggregates never really took hold, as they couldn't in that type of environment So, this particular business cycle may be about to tell us a lot or, I fear, it may be mushy where the end result will be somewhere in between, so we won't learn very much Reality tends to do that to us more often than not!  I do think, as a number of you have mentioned, that the issue of the subnormal growth in monetary and credit aggregates has to mean something There is something there We have argued that M2 or M1 are awful as indicators and that the monetary base is terrible, but we are in the business of creating money We are a central bank If we think all of that is beside the point, I think we've got to worry about a number of things we are doing It may turn out that it's beside the point, but I don't think we can make that presumption  My impression of what is going on, pending the outcome of this academic debate, is that we have to assume that the pressures are there; the risks of making alternate assumptions I think are just too dangerous If that is in fact the case, I would agree with the staff's version that more monetary policy restraint is probably to be expected The reason is that we have seen stronger GDP growth than we had anticipated and we won't know until 1995 or beyond if what we are looking at is a situation where monetary policy suddenly has turned weaker as a restraining force, maybe because of the inventory situation, or if the policy is as strong as ever but just more delayed We may find that there is some significant new underlying strength in the economy, which is offsetting what has been a significant impact from monetary policy actions already taken It is true that there are significant lags in monetary policy, but remember these are distributed lags It's not that nothing happens for a year or 15 months and then suddenly the effect is felt There is a gradual progression of effects We have to presume at this particular stage that we are running under the projected impact If we assume that our judgment about the basic economy's underlying strength ex monetary policy has not changed significantly, that assumption is rather dubious But what this suggests is that we do know something about the effects of monetary policy actions to date; we know that their effects are there and moving What we don't know, and will not fully know until 1995 and later, is how powerful in retrospect the underlying expansionary forces were  My own impression of all of this is that I suspect we are going to need to move further somewhere along the line I would doubt very much that the degree of restraint that is in the pipeline at this stage, including the significant rise in long-term interest rates over and above what would ordinarily be expected from short-term interest  -38-    9/27/94  rate changes, is enough to give us the type of more subdued--excuse the expression--"soft landing" that we would all like to see I think that the subdued money and credit growth does suggest that we are not particularly behind the curve It's a difficult judgment to make, and one that I don't think we have strong analytical tools to give us any insight into  We have another issue here that has been raised by a number of people Because of our statement "for the time being" in our last move on August 17--which most people interpreted to mean that we would not move at this meeting and would not move until the November 15th meeting--we have to have strong evidence to move more quickly My suspicion is that we probably could get through to the November 15th meeting If we do move then, I think that would probably require us to move another 50 basis points and probably move the discount rate as well  My own inclination at this stage is to go with "B" but be asymmetric for the reason that Don Kohn was mentioning, namely, we have a good deal of data coming in around the middle of October that could very readily indicate that our underlying view of the momentum of the economy was too soft and that this expansion is accelerating faster than we had expected If that occurs--if the data are an undesirable surprise--there will be significant market turmoil And if we allow it to simmer for the whole month until the next meeting-- remember, this is a seven-week interval--I think it could create inflationary expectations that might be more difficult to rein in than if we moved in mid-October What I'm saying is that at this stage we are getting close to the point where the data do matter because we've been under restraint long enough that we should begin to see some signs of its slowing impact on the expansion If we don't start to see that pretty soon, that will suggest that this economy is not growing at 3 percent but closer to 4 percent It's not all that difficult to engender that type of outlook Now, I think that's a low probability outcome, but I don't think it's one that can be readily dismissed  I have come to the conclusion, and I'd like to lay it out for debate, that we should not move today We don't have to and I don't think it's appropriate to move today We should be prepared to move if necessary before our next meeting, but hopefully we will be able to get through to the next meeting If we are able to do that, I think we will probably have managed policy better than we have any reason to believe we should be able to do Obviously, if the numbers come out in an adverse way, we will be on a telephone conference as usual for the type of consultation and discussion that we have had in the past Vice Chairman   You mean the hawk and the dove combine as a turkey [Laughter]   President Hoenig   Governor Blinder   President Forrestal   President Jordan   You are against the whole notion of asymmetry in the directive?   President Parry   Governor Lindsey   Governor LaWare   President Boehne   President Broaddus   "D"?   President Stern   President Minehan   President McTeer   Governor Phillips   Governor Kelley   President Moskow   Governor Yellen   President Melzer   Does that include US currency abroad?   Okay, I think the modal consensus is on "B" asymmetric Would you read the language?   Call the roll  -44-    9/27/94   Good morning, everyone We ought to congratulate Governor Lindsey who has just returned without mishap from Rumania with an addition to his family   What do you have, a girl?   What I have been trying to tell Larry was that he had better learn Rumanian pretty quickly because when she learns to talk if he does not understand Rumanian, he is in trouble!  SPEAKER(?) He's in trouble anyway! [Laughter]   I think we'll allow you to move approval of the minutes for the September 27th meeting   Without objection You all have before you the Report of Examination of the System Open Market Account that was distributed on November 3rd Are there any questions relating to that? If not, would somebody like to move its acceptance?  SPEAKER(?) So move  SPEAKER(?) Second   Without objection After we complete our general monetary policy discussion, I am going to raise some broad issues about our recent intervention in the foreign exchange markets I will also comment about the alleged increase in central bank participation in the G-7 process So, after Peter discusses his operations, let's hold off discussion of the broader questions with respect to intervention until later in the meeting We will have more time then for a general discussion With that in mind, let me call on Peter Fisher to report on foreign currency operations   Why don't you do that? We will then have general questions on all issues but leave the intervention discussion until later   Let me just say this If anyone objects to voting until we have had our discussion on intervention, we can delay the vote If anybody wants to object, object now and we will just postpone the vote   That's fine In fact, there is a certain symmetry in doing that So why don't we leave that vote until later?  I was a little curious myself as to why the dollar was as strong as it was yesterday You implied that the reason was because the foreign exchange market expected us to move today But last week and two weeks ago they expected us to move today What is the explanation?   Peter, you indicated that you inferred from the market that we are behind the curve in three areas and that we are in striking distance of reaching at least one or more of those curves Is there any view within the foreign exchange market that puts federal funds numbers on that?  -2-    11/15/94   Any other questions?   Any further questions? If not, we'll go on to Joan Lovett   We will save that for later on In other words, until we have the discussion, it would be inappropriate to vote on the ratification Joan   Joan, was that 479 percent the federal funds rate average since the last FOMC meeting?   What is it so far this month? Do you remember?   The month of November to date   So it would be more than 479 percent?   Would it be 482, 483 percent?   For November, okay   Okay You did my calculations for me, I thank you Any further questions for Joan? If not, would somebody like to move to ratify the actions of the domestic Desk since the last meeting?   I'd like to adjourn this meeting for just 5 minutes so the Board of Governors can go next door and take up the discount rate question Then we can come back and Peter will have the floor to answer questions after I make some brief comments  [Recess]  Secretary's note The Bank presidents were informed that the Board members at their meeting in the Chairman's office had approved an increase of 75 basis points in the discount rate, effective immediately for those Reserve Banks with pending increases of that amount   I want to raise a couple of issues following up on what Peter Fisher said earlier and just open up the discussion to general comments First of all, I understand that there were some questions about statements coming out of Madrid to the effect that the central banks would be playing an enhanced role in the G-7 process What that basically comes down to is nothing more than the central bank deputies being involved with the finance ministry deputies in formulating the agenda for the meetings, and that actually is pretty much what was being done in any event We central bankers  -44-    11/15/94  have not in any way materially increased our interface with the G-7 Indeed, as best I can judge, and I may have indicated this before, there seems to be more concurrence in those discussions among the governors on the one hand and the finance ministers on the other rather than there being country positions So long as that continues, I think that the central banks will have a very effective and important role in the G-7 process Should it turn out at some point that we get involved in the politics of the finance ministers, then I think we had better give this very significant second thought There is no evidence of that and certainly nothing of that sort was indicated or implied in the notion of increased central bank activities with the G-7 So, nothing has changed in any material way  On the issue of intervention, we had some fairly interesting discussions earlier and I would like to lay some thoughts on the table that have certain implications for the future I might add that, interestingly, my view about the way intervention works is something that Hans Tietmeyer and I happen to agree on I am not necessarily speaking for the Bundesbank, but I am pretty sure that they would not be in severe disagreement on this issue  First of all, I think there is a view in the financial marketplace that intervention is far more effective than it actually can be The analogy I like to use is that irrespective of what people in the markets believe, we can set the federal funds rate wherever we wish to place it, and market trading, market activities of all sorts have no effect There are people in the foreign exchange markets who believe that we as central bankers have the capability of doing the same thing to the exchange rate A number of French financial officials clearly do believe that A lot of commentators on the periphery believe that we central banks can fix rates where we choose The truth of the matter that I think all of us have acutely recognized is that that "ain't the case"  As a consequence, if we were to announce what we are going to do with exchange rates in the way that we announce what we will do in the federal funds market, inevitably the financial community would be disappointed The reason I say that is their belief that we can do more than we can; and when we do only what we can, they will necessarily be disappointed  We have all concluded that the only way we can have an effect in the exchange markets on a short-term basis--because nobody believes that sterilized intervention can have any long-term effect--is to catch the markets by surprise If in effect we catch them in a short position, it is very obvious that we can create a run-up in the exchange rate and indeed that has occurred on many occasions There have been numerous occasions when we failed, when for one reason or another we either misjudged that the market didn't expect us to act or we felt that we had to act even though the market knew we were going to act in order to "show the flag" as the Treasury likes to say on occasion  I think the important point, however, is that we succeed some of the time because, if we create a presumption that we might intervene, we establish an atmosphere on the part of a lot of traders, who wish to take short overnight positions against the dollar, that they should be a little cautious Indeed, it does seem to be the case  -45-    11/15/94  that when we have, in a sense, a dull but nonetheless a Damocles Sword hanging over the markets, that often will deter individuals from raiding our currency  While I think we all to a greater or lesser extent believe in efficient markets, the truth of the matter is that sometimes they are not There are periods when we get a confluence of forces driving down the exchange rate Such a development may at times lead to market conditions that cannot readily be viewed as involving the functioning of truly efficient markets  When we were negotiating with Treasury officials, who were concerned about the exchange rate weakness that Peter was discussing, their initial choice was to do a full blown, multiday intervention, multilaterally We argued that we started off with one-day shots unilaterally, then one-day shots multilaterally, and now they were proposing multiday shots, multilaterally, and one had to ask where we would go from there The argument that we put on the table was to mix it up because if the argument is that we cannot effectively do anything unless there is a surprise, we have to create some surprises So, what we agreed to in this instance was that we would intervene unilaterally but would do so two days in a row As Peter points out, there were some positive effects there I don't know whether we stemmed the dollar's decline effectively, but clearly one has to chalk up certainly the first day as a success The second day was actually, somewhat to my surprise, a mild success  Let me just say that as best I can judge, and obviously I can't read peoples' minds, I don't think that the issue was the upcoming election at that point It is possible; I obviously can't argue against that, but Larry Summers' recommendations were wholly consistent with his previous positions In my judgment they had no bearing on whether or not there was an election coming up That issue did come up in the news media, and I must say that I find no evidence or basis to support the media speculation  Larry Summers, and it is possible the Secretary at this stage, is still concerned about the dollar and thinks that we should be doing something more I believe they would like to see how the outcome of this meeting gets reflected in the market, but they still would like at least to discuss the issue of doing a multilateral, multiday type of intervention We said we would be glad to discuss that with them We have made no specific commitments, but I think it is important for the Committee to know that that issue is on the table and it will be discussed It is important to know what the Committee, which authorizes the actions on the part of the Fed in this regard, has to say on this question before we go into discussions with the Treasury But before we go to anything else, I do think we owe Peter a chance to answer some questions after which we are going to have to take several votes for the record Now, let me open the floor to questions to Peter [Pause] I do not believe that silence!   Why didn't you ask him before!  -46-    11/15/94   As I have done in the past, let me argue against the use of monetary policy to achieve exchange market objectives I am not necessarily referring to this particular instance, but this is something I think we have to be aware of Often when we have a weak currency, we are looking at significant portfolio adjustments Often we are looking at correct or incorrect views of differential rates of return between two currencies, not only in interest rates but also real estate, the stock market, all of those things What history seems to tell us, especially if we look at something that may be an extreme example here--the breakdown of the EMS--is that the types of expected differential rates of return are something like maybe 10 basis points a week That's 500 basis points or more at an annual rate I am concerned that if we run into one of    11/15/94  those situations and we hit it with 50 basis points and it turns out that we needed 300 basis points, the central bank is caught in the dilemma of whether or not to keep moving the rate I must say that it is tough to envisage our doing that because then we would basically subvert domestic policy to the exchange rate, which I think none of us, yourself included, wants to get involved with I am not saying that if we had done 50 basis points, that that might not have an effect if in fact the expected differential rate of return between, say, the deutschemark and the dollar was only a few basis points Yes, it would have worked, but I'd be terribly worried since we have almost no way of making that judgment We have to worry basically about getting ourselves into that process and finding it very difficult to extricate ourselves once we are there So it is a high risk operation   Let me just say that I don't deny that there should be a relationship It is just that if it is tying monetary policy directly to the exchange rate, it locks us in To have it in parallel paths or somehow related, I think the answer is obviously yes   Other comments, questions?   Differential rates of return In other words, if most of the exchange rate moves these days against the dollar are the result of portfolio shifts rather than, say, current account deficits or flows, then the question is why do people change portfolios? And the answer is that the risk-adjusted rate of return is perceived to be better in one currency versus another   You are raising an interesting question The dilemma we have is that if we withdraw and act strictly as an agent, we then lose any voice in altering or casting the structure of the policy that they would like to implement The points you are making, Al, are quite to the point; I don't disagree with that The question that we have to trade off here is, do we wish to remove ourselves from any influence on how these things are done? In my experience, because we are involved in the discussions, we have headed off a lot of actions that I think would have been detrimental, more so than what we have done There is unquestionably the problem that we are not the final voice on that; legally they are Nonetheless, we do have a de facto veto if we wish to use it, and the reason we do is because we participate in those discussions We have to choose whether we want to lose what is in my judgment a very valuable asset in tempering what the Treasury Department does It is not a simple tradeoff If you are asking me, do I disagree with the way you have put it? I personally don't I think that the question really gets down to, are we as a nation better off with our participating in these deliberations, granted at some cost to the Federal Reserve? I have argued that, yes, looking at it from the national point of view as distinct from the Federal Reserve itself, I think we are better off That's the way I come out, and it is one of the reasons I have supported this type of operation   Yes, ultimately, I would say, if we decided to bow out In other words, you can't be half in or out Either we are acting as an order taker, which is strictly as the agent of the Treasury, or we get involved in the discussion We either have to cut our participation completely and have Peter act as an order taker with no conversation except what he might say as a broker--don't do it now; the market is closed [Laughter]  SPEAKER(?) If the System is not participating in these operations, that's going to have some effect in itself on the way the Treasury views the operations--     That's practically what we try to do   Vice Chairman   We haven't used the swap lines Indeed, all the intervention that has taken place has been profit-taking, because we have been selling off our deutschemark and yen reserves President Jordan   Governor Kelley   President Stern   I want to call on Ted because Ted has been around here in this area longer than all of us put together I am curious as to how he would respond to this   No, on this general broad issue--the principles, which you infer, that various Treasuries have employed over the years   Vice Chairman    I have certainly heard all the arguments here and I must say that I have great sympathy My own view is that I wish Treasury wouldn't do it and I wish we wouldn't do it I think that would solve a lot of problems because I am not convinced that that's the way to stabilize our nation's currency I don't deny that there are occasions where intervention actually does stabilize the market The trouble is I can think of situations where intervention destabilizes it I am not sure that one can argue that there is a net advantage to intervention Nonetheless, we do have very practical difficulties, which I think a number of people around this table have indicated This far along in the process, post-1971, we would create some very extraordinary events if we were to endeavor unilaterally to pull away from this sort of activity So we are going to be involved in it and as a consequence, we are going to need Committee authority on occasion I'd like Ted to raise the issues that are involved here in the event, for example, that we get into these discussions with the Treasury and they come up with something that we find not fully unreasonable That's an odd way of putting it, but that's the way it comes out and I will ask Ted to outline some of the issues   Yes, let me raise one additional issue here You may recall that in an earlier discussion, you were looking for ways to restrict the size of our operations You wanted to try to disgorge some of our foreign exchange reserves When we intervene in support of the dollar, we are moving in that direction We are squeezing down our capability of acting and squeezing down the whole operation I am not sure the Treasury thinks this way, but there really is an asymmetry here whereby we should be more resistant about actions in which we are buying foreign currencies to support them because that expands our reserves Whereas were we to do anything to support the dollar, even if it failed, we would accomplish something-- namely we would reduce our foreign exchange reserves  SPEAKER(?) And at a profit   Yes, at a profit Governor Lindsey   I think that's absolutely right Peter Fisher   Any further questions, comments? Yes, Tom   No, I think that's right I agree with that My own personal belief, I think, is probably fairly representative of this Committee If anything, I might be more, if I may put it this way, on the hawkish side in this question But I recognize that we have very important responsibilities I think it is crucially important for the Federal Reserve as an institution to be a player here I think basically that is what Governor LaWare and Governor Kelley were saying   Let me put it this way If it is done, it would be a one-shot thing because if we ever try to do it a second time, it would fail That is what would happen   We will all starve if we don't stop this discussion!   Whatever you have to say, say it in half the time I think President Jordan has the floor   Peter, you have a comment?   We need a vote right now on the issue of ratifying the actions of the Desk Let me emphasize that the issue of ratification is strictly the question of whether the Manager had the legal authority to undertake the transactions We are not discussing the philosophy here I would like to raise that question and would somebody move for approval   Are there any objections? If not, consider it passed Now we have another question on the swaps, which is a one-year extension Just repeat quickly what the issue is   I suggest that we take a formal vote on that   Would you read the roll   Would somebody like to move that we go to lunch? [Laughter]  SPEAKER(?) No objection  END OF MEETING  -61-       Without objection Let's now move on to Mike Prell and the staff report on the economic outlook   Questions for Mike?   President Parry   It is not There is a bias in the measure of the degree of ease in the loan officers' survey What is the size of it? Do you remember, Don?   The trouble is that if you cumulated the first differences, you got a progressively greater degree of tightening, which at the end of the day should have strangled the total financial system   In other words, there is no evidence that that has been the case since then?   President Jordan   Actually, Mike, when we separate the GDP into its factory value components, don't we get results that are not all that different from numbers based on industrial production?   Okay   President Minehan   Governor Blinder   I just want to mention that the scrappage model that was developed by my former colleagues at Townsend-Greenspan is closely consistent with the numbers that we are getting from the income model I meant to show it to you; I have a copy As Mike said, there is an implicit scrappage demand element here that seems to be running stronger than the income flows are declining I understand that the short-term interest rate elasticity of the demand for motor vehicles is something like several hundred thousand units per percentage point in the loan rate   Governor Lindsey   You will also remember that you are looking at outlays, not appropriations The relationship is closer between cash flow or profit margins and appropriations You can view outlays as sort of a distributed lag against the appropriations data It is a quite considerable lag  -13-    11/15/94   Yes President Stern   Any further questions for Mike? Vice Chairman McDonough, did you have a question?   Okay Do you want to start our tour de table?   Okay You can start off   President Minehan   President Forrestal   President McTeer   President Parry   President Hoenig   President Boehne   President Broaddus   President Stern   That's a legislative issue   President Melzer   President Moskow   Governor Lindsey   You are in great shape today!   Governor LaWare   Governor Kelley   Governor Phillips   Thank you President Jordan   Governor Yellen   Governor Blinder   Thank you With that, why don't we adjourn for coffee?  [Coffee break]   Let me tell you this I thought that the two great remarks made previously were One, Governor Lindsey's half bridge; and, two, Governor Kelley's teakettle They have brought the theoretical structure of monetary policy forward immensely [Laughter]   Questions for Don? If not, let me get started I must say the discussion this morning has been one of the best discussions I have heard around this table in quite a long while I certainly don't have much to add to it Let me just say, however, that inventories in my view are going to be the crucial area that will determine to a large extent how much momentum this economy has in it It is not that inventories per se will engender the total gross national product, but as you recall when inventory investment is high, gross domestic product is high, disposable income is high, consumption expenditures are high, and we get a very significant multiplier from that phenomenon  We can't look at inventories independently of final sales nor the reverse because they are clearly interrelated We don't have data much beyond August and part of September, but there is a good deal of indication that inventory investment has not slowed in any appreciable manner in the fourth quarter I must say to you, I would not be surprised to find that fourth-quarter inventory investment turns out to be higher than it was in the third quarter First, we have a very robust rate of increase in commercial loans Commercial loans, with or without commercial paper and with or without the merger adjustments that we make, have been a reasonably good indicator of book value inventory changes If one looks at those data through the last week for which information is available, there is no evidence of any slowdown If we postulate, which I think the data will support, that inventory investment in September was significant when the industrial production index was unchanged from the August level, it seems quite noncredible that the increase in industrial production of 7 percent that we published today for the month of October did not create an acceleration in inventory investment in October This is consistent with the data on loans and, I must say, it is consistent with the indications that vendor performance continues to deteriorate  This is important because inventory levels, as has been indicated, are still quite low by any objective measure This is especially the case if we use what I think is more important in business-cycle forecasting analysis, namely, inventories at factory value as distinct from including the trade markups that we get in these data Inventory factory value as a ratio to consumption, for  -34-    11/15/94  example, is still low, and indeed it has not shown the level of uptick that we have seen in the data where there has been a disproportionate amount of retail inventory accumulation with a very large trade markup element in it  This says in effect that even though accumulation is quite large at this moment, that is, production levels are quite a bit above consumption levels, we are going to need quite a long period of that type of accumulation before the economy slides off While it is quite plausible that inventory investment may begin to slow over the next month or two, I find that quite unlikely It is more likely that this investment will proceed for a while with some momentum That is one of the reasons why the notion in the Greenbook that the upside risks are larger than the downside risks in the forecast strikes me as plausible That is not to say, however, that what we are looking at is a runaway boom The reason is that when inventory investment builds up rapidly, even though the levels of inventories may be low, it is difficult to sustain very large inventory investments that result in significant increases in inventory/sales ratios or inventory/consumption ratios At some point after we have gone through this inventory surge that I think may be in front of us--it may not all be behind us but it may be in the period immediately ahead--we are going to see that buildup slide off and the economy's growth slow down quite appreciably That's what the history is I think that the expectation that we will get very strong final demand rests in large part on how we view this pattern as unfolding  Clearly, producers' durable investment is moving strongly As Governor Lindsey pointed out, it does depend on what the profit numbers look like To date, there is no evidence that profits are deteriorating Indeed, we are still in a mode where Wall Street analysts are underpredicting the profits that are coming out So, while I do think we are likely to get some slide in profit margins, right now those margins show no signs of declining History tells us that when we are in this type of inventory environment with profit margins still strong, the decline--I might even say the slowing--is still an appreciable way off That is, we are still an appreciable distance away from any actual decline in the economy short of one induced by a financial problem, in other words short of a crack in the financial system which I'll get to shortly History tells us that the economy just continues to move until it wears itself out  As a consequence, the general discussion around here, which is somewhat skeptical of the economy's slowing down very dramatically, strikes a familiar chord with me I'm not sure, however, that I would dismiss the comments made by Governors Yellen and Blinder with respect to the pattern of monetary impetus because there is no doubt that that is a very relevant consideration You can very readily, as President Jordan points out, get yourself into a notion where all you have to do is keep jacking rates up and finally you get it right The trouble is that the process of getting it right historically has led finally to our knocking the economy off its perch  I don't think that policymaking right now is very difficult I think it is going to become exceptionally difficult when the expansion starts to slow, unit costs no longer get distributed over rapidly rising output, and price pressures begin to emerge as Governor Kelley's teakettle starts to whistle We will be looking at a  -35-    11/15/94  situation in which the growth rate of the economy is slowing down, while inflation is picking up This is in the context, as President Forrestal raised it, of a cyclical rise at the end of a cycle, which is really the quite relevant consideration We are going to be in a position where we are going to see the economy slowing and the actual inflation data picking up And we are going to have to be able at that point to recognize that that's the tail end and continuing to ratchet rates up would be a mistake But we are nowhere near that point as far as I can see at this particular stage  I think that we are behind the curve, and that it would be plausible, as I infer from what is going on around here, to move rates up more than 50 basis points because markets have built in something close to 60 I think that creating a mild surprise would be of significant value; creating a very strong surprise on the up side would be more risky because the stock market, in my judgment, is still a little rich although off its price/earnings ratios of a while back I would not want to argue that we couldn't break it down very easily However, what bothers me about doing only 50 basis points is that even though the markets are saying that that is what we probably are going to do, I think we have to distinguish between what they are forecasting we are going to do based on our past behavior and what they think we ought to do I suspect that while the majority think we are going to do 50, the vast majority will think that that is not enough and they will immediately price an additional 50 or more basis points in the December forward contracts In my judgment, we would be risking--a low probability risk but a potentially very large outcome if it were to happen--a run on the dollar, a run on the bond market, and a significant decline in stock prices This would be on top of a $750 billion paper loss as a consequence of the declines in bond and stock prices earlier this year We would find out what a wealth effect can do to economic activity in a way that would make us really quite uncomfortable So, I think that we have to be very careful at this stage and be certain that we are ahead of general expectations I think we can do that with 75 basis points  I don't know what that will imply about what we do in December I think it puts December somewhere between no change and 50 basis points I'm not sure I can say at this moment that I fully buy into the Greenbook's projection of where the funds rate should be That will depend on how the markets behave I would argue that at this point we should give serious thought to 75 basis points If we do that, I think we can go to a symmetric directive If we choose to do 50, I would argue that we should at least retain an asymmetric directive, but I must tell you that 50 makes me a little nervous No, I take that back it makes me very nervous and I would be disinclined to go in that direction   As I judge the Board's general view, a recommendation to increase the discount rate by 75 basis points would be approved Implicit in that would be a recommendation that the full 75 basis points gets passed into the funds rate The Board will be discussing the discount rate after this meeting President McTeer  -36-    11/15/94   Governor Lindsey   President Minehan   President Parry  -37-    11/15/94   I must say I personally agree with both of those recommendations President Forrestal   President Hoenig   I think that the preliminary view would be a statement that is pretty bland and promises nothing and doesn't mention the dollar President Broaddus   Governor LaWare   President Melzer   President Boehne   Governor Phillips   Monetary policy insights by analogy are getting to be legend!   Vice Chairman   President Jordan   As I interpret them, I think the comments around this table support that Governor Kelley   Governor Yellen   President Stern   President Moskow   Governor Blinder   More than 50 basis points in the funds rate?   I am sorry, that's right   Okay, I propose that we move 75 with symmetric language  SPEAKER(?) We may need a need a new word to describe 75 basis points in the opening sentence of the operational paragraph  SPEAKER(?) "A lot"! [Laughter]  SPEAKER(?) "Substantially"?   Yes, "increase significantly" instead of "increase somewhat," which seems clearly inappropriate  SPEAKER(?) Just say "increase?"  SEVERAL MEMBERS "Significantly"   Call the roll   Would somebody like to move approval of the minutes for the meeting on November 15?   Without objection I recognize President Jordan for a motion   Would somebody like to second the motion?  SPEAKER(?) Second   Unless I hear an objection, it's approved  Peter Fisher has a number of interesting things to discuss this morning Peter   Questions for Peter? If not, shall we go on to Joan Lovett?   Questions for Joan? Governor Phillips   Would somebody like to move to ratify the domestic transactions of the Desk since the last meeting?   The next meeting is January 31st and February 1st, and luncheon is served  END OF MEETING       Without objection Let's now move on to Messrs Prell and Truman   Questions for either gentleman?   President Jordan   Further questions?   This reminds me of a discussion I remember having at the CEA in 1973 when everyone was talking about the small inflationary effects that were on the horizon--02 or 03 percent Our models are really gross simplifications of the real world As I've indicated before, simulations on reduced-form structures, which without appropriate add-ons give us silly forecasts, should not be employed with a great degree of confidence at this stage I think our capability of doing the type of simulation that you are discussing here is really marginal We have to be careful about reading terribly much into it Just remember, it is the same econometric structure in the model that engendered a significant slowing in the second half of 1994, which didn't occur The difference is the add-ons and the underlying structure that we don't capture I'm not saying it is not useful to discuss what the potential impacts and lags are; it is just that I hope that everyone retains a large dose of skepticism in applying these types of structures President McTeer   Any further questions? Let's move on to the Committee discussion Let me just say, incidentally, that I've noticed at the last couple of meetings that our discussions of economic conditions have spilled over into an awful lot of policy at this point I request, if you can possibly do it, that you stay with an analysis of what you see and leave the policy prescription for the next segment, or we will be contaminating our agenda here in an inappropriate way   I think it was specified in the    12/20/94   I acknowledge your issue but still request that, if you possibly can, you stay on this side of the fence President Minehan   That is like Babe Ruth bunting a home run [Laughter]   Peter Fisher has an announcement that I thought we ought to interpose   If you are going to do 15 percent, you really want the market to do 10 to 12 percent on its own   Let's hope it doesn't happen again   To get good results on that or at least not disastrous results would be very helpful President Hoenig   President Moskow   President Parry   President Forrestal   President Broaddus   President Stern   That is the point I was trying to make before, Gary This business of a 1/2 percentage point increase in inflation at an annual rate as though that means anything--   You can round the numbers to the nearest 5 percent!   President McTeer   I don't know how successful this is [Laughter] Vice Chairman   Sounds like a leap to me President Jordan   President Melzer   Unfortunately, President Boehne had to leave because of an emergency he had to attend to I'd like to ask Rick Lang whether he could give us a brief survey of what is going on in the Third District   Thanks very much Governor Lindsey   That is for individuals?   What was it without transfer payments?   I don't!   Sounds like a 30-year bond rate of 5 percent! Governor Kelley   Governor Phillips   Governor LaWare   I've learned my lesson!  SPEAKER(?) A less-than-successful building project   Yes, that is right!   Governor Blinder   Governor Yellen   Thank you Is coffee available?   Let's take our usual break  [Coffee break]   Questions for Don? If not, why don't I start as usual? I'm impressed with the extent to which it is very difficult to find any negative factors in the current outlook You can not find it in the order patterns, which are strong across the board There are very few firms outside the defense-related area or long-term turkeys that are not doing exceptionally well [Laughter] The Christmas selling season is, as always, difficult to read The trouble with the Christmas selling season is that the constant dollar volume is really predetermined because retailers will sell what they have and the only thing that is indeterminate is the price But that is quite relevant to how the system works when you get into the first quarter Looking strictly at the data as they stand at this stage, it is very difficult to tell whether in this quarter the GDP growth rate is 3 percent or 7 percent We are making forecasts about how the system is going to evolve My own impression is that since it is extraordinarily unlikely that all of these positive events will continue without change for terribly long, one has to assume that this expansion will start to ease off at some point The only thing that I think we have to be careful about is that the easing may be more delayed than we suspect And until we begin to see the process of erosion in its early stages, we really have no basis for saying that the expansion is slowing down We are looking at history; we are looking at relationships; but there are no significant demonstrable imbalances in the system that basically say things have to change We are projecting that there will be a change, but that again is a projection As of the moment in the labor markets, initial claims continue at quite low levels The fairly strong pattern of C&I loans suggests that inventory accumulation is still moving at a reasonably  -30-    12/20/94  strong pace and that is bolstered by the orders pattern, which suggests that producers' durable goods are doing well Remember, a goodly part of inventories is supported by the capital goods and construction markets even though we don't keep the data that way  As best I can judge, profit margins are still on the firm side and even though profit forecasts are beginning to look more symmetrical rather than just continuously underestimated, the evidence on the profits side is still quite positive Prices, as a lot of you have noted, are firming in the commercial real estate markets, although my suspicion is that the nationwide figures may still be eroding albeit at a much slower pace I won't add much on homebuilding; it is a puzzle but I think that if it doesn't start to move down, then all of our historical relationships, all of our basic data, are lacking in predictive value I don't believe what is going on in homebuilding, but we will find out eventually  I think the interesting question is why wages are not responding to what is a very rapidly tightening labor market After speaking to some labor leaders and others who talk to their members and have a sense of this, I get the impression that long-term job insecurities are quite pervasive especially with respect to the portability of health insurance and pensions that make workers more cautious about changing jobs The layoff rates are very low; the turnover rates are really quite low by American standards; and there is a tendency among workers just to stick with what they have The effect of this, I suspect, is a major factor in holding wage increases to a very sluggish pace considering all the evidence we have been getting in recent months of labor market tightness This is crucial because so long as that is the case and productivity is positive, unit costs are very well contained Any endeavor to move final prices up in that environment induces competitors to come in and try to steal a firm's market share, which erodes the firm's pricing capability So long as we have some evident flexibility in the system, then prices can not readily move This doesn't necessarily mean that business firms have to run out of capacity; obviously, it just starts to get a little more costly or a little tight and we begin to get pressures But it is not clear from the anecdotal data and the macro data that we have that these pressures are severe I thought that the exercise that was done for the Greenbook Part II, which separated where the growth rates have been in manufacturing depending on which industries were at high operating rates, is tending to suggest that there is more flexibility in this system than our old conventional wisdom of capacity use would indicate There obviously has to be a limit somewhere, and when we look back on this we may well find that we have a system that is a lot more flexible than we presupposed  This is also true, I think, with respect to monetary policy While it is certainly the case that we have what historically would have been a not insubstantial amount of a policy impact by this time, the simulations that the staff has done, including the fact that long- term interest rates moved up faster than the normal process would imply, suggest that we are probably some 25 percent into the cumulative effects of our policy tightening at this stage That is not a small number, and we are now seeing very little effect as a consequence On the contrary, what we are seeing is an easing of credit terms in the banking sector and the old notion that we used to have 30-40 years ago--that the central bank would tighten, short-term  -31-    12/20/94  interest rates would rise, bank credit would suddenly be crunched by Regulation Q or some other factor, financing would be undercut, and the economy would swoon--clearly is an historic relic and the disintermediation that we used to see is just not there On the contrary, we are having difficulty getting banks to notice that interest rates are up The interest rates on automobile installment paper are really lagging Everybody is trying to protect market share, and this whole thing just doesn't seem to be coming together But it will It always does And the question is essentially pretty much when  I think it is really worth recognizing that there is something quite different about the timing of this recovery Ordinarily, a recovery has a much higher rate of growth in the early stages and slows in the later stages Probably what is happening here is that we really didn't have the classic movement to a cyclical recovery until well into the cycle, and we are probably now at effectively the earlier stages in a geriatric sense as distinct from the calendar What this suggests is that we probably still have quite significant momentum in the system, and it is not clear just when it will ease off I wonder to what extent we can attribute all of this to monetary policy and monetary policy lags Surely, we can attribute some of it; there is no question that that is the case But there is an internal dynamic in the economy that is wholly independent of the business cycle I do think the issue that Jerry Jordan raised is an interesting one, and even though it is very difficult to prove statistically, it may well be that the fact that inflation is relatively low may--despite all the discussions we have had about the inadequacy of the evidence--be contributing to improved productivity If that is the case, we will get some greater growth in potential I hope that one of these days I will be able to use one of these statistics after the fact, and finally say I told you so [Laughter]) without struggling I must say I'm a little concerned about the continued ease in bank lending terms which I suspect is greater than the numbers show  I seriously wonder what our monetary actions from here on will do to 1995 as well as to 1996 I think it is true, as a number of you have pointed out, that if we really look at the distributed lags--the average performance historically of monetary policy--it is very difficult to make the case that what we may do in the early months of 1995 will have significant effects in calendar 1995 in real terms I would only caution that if we get an unexpected breakout on the up side in inflationary expectations, the distributed lag of monetary policy will bunch up very quickly We have to be careful about that I do think the argument that most of the impact is delayed is clearly a correct view, but I think we have to be careful about the probability--even though it is low--of significant aberrations that could have important negative effects  All in all, if we decided that we needed to move the funds rate up at this meeting, which I don't support I must say, I doubt very much that that would have a negative effect on economic activity I think the economy's momentum is still quite strong I do worry, however, with or without the Orange County turmoil and the usual end- of-year problems, whether we would be taking undue risks in endeavoring to tighten in this environment I think that the odds that we are going to have to move shortly after the first of the year,  -32-    12/20/94  no later than our next meeting, are quite high However, it is conceivable that this expansion could fizzle out fairly quickly I frankly don't expect that, but I think we can't disregard that possibility Where I would come out at this stage is that I hope we will be comfortable staying where we are for a while I believe, as Don Kohn pointed out, that we have time to make further adjustments if need be, but because of the possibility that we might find it necessary to move after the first of the year but before January 31, I think it would be preferable to have an asymmetric directive Vice Chairman   Industrial production we get much earlier   Yes, it is a Federal Reserve number!   Governor LaWare   President Melzer   There has been some discussion that the new Congress would establish such a legislative goal   Governor Blinder   President Broaddus   That is a very low probability   President Hoenig   President Jordan   We inevitably are going to have to be discussing that because we are required to do projections of the monetary aggregates   Governor Lindsey   President Parry   President Moskow   President Forrestal   Governor Kelley   Governor Phillips   Governor Yellen   President McTeer   President Stern   Just to clarify One of the events that is not irrelevant is how the markets respond to what's happening   And I think that that is probably the most crucial "statistic" in a sense and really the only one that could make a material difference in this period I agree it is very hard to find data with anything crucial But I think that there is a very important issue here, namely that we not allow our an erosion in our credibility that we have built up and which has kept the cap on long- term interest rates I must tell you, it is too subtle an issue for any of us to predict Let's get to President Minehan and then I have a few things I'd like to say about this issue   This is an interesting result we are getting It is very clear that there is a heavy consensus for "B" However, there is a very sharp split on symmetric versus asymmetric unless we take the two members who have argued for an increase as being on the asymmetric side--but we don't usually do it that way What I would like to do, though, is more pro forma and that is to suggest the following as probably an appropriate way to come at this We are, as I think a number of us have discussed, in a crucial area as to how we should behave Given the discussion that we have had around this table, I don't think it would be wise to move before the next meeting without a conference call to be certain that everyone has a say with respect to how they view what we are dealing with I frankly don't know whether or not such a call will be appropriate; it may well be very clear during the period that it is not But I don't think we ought to move in the intermeeting period without having had a Committee discussion I would like to stay with the asymmetric directive with "B" because it captures, marginally as I read it, the view of the Committee But it is pro forma and I would suggest that the difference frankly between symmetric and asymmetric, as far as action is concerned, probably is minuscule So, I would like to put "B" asymmetric on the table for a vote   Call the roll   Would somebody like to move approval of the minutes?   Without objection The Committee has received a memorandum on the delegation of responsibility for appeals of staff decisions to deny access to Committee records under the Freedom of Information Act The need for this delegation stems from the vacancy that was created when David Mullins resigned from the FOMC The recommendation is to follow past practice and elect the individuals who are involved in the similar function with respect to the Board of Governors--Governor Phillips as the principal and Governor Yellen as the alternate--to serve in that function for the FOMC Does anybody have any questions with respect to that memorandum? If not, would somebody like to move it?   Without objection I turn to the Vice Chairman for a nomination to elect a Deputy General Counsel from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York   Would somebody like to move that nomination?   Would somebody second it?   Without objection Next we move to the election of an associate economist from the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Moskow, would you like to address that?   Is there discussion? Would somebody like to move it?  SEVERAL So move    3/28/95   Moved and seconded and approved without objection The next agenda item is a review of the Committee's Program for Security of FOMC Information There are a number of items in the memorandum you received I don't want to go over them necessarily Does anybody have any questions with respect to them? I thought they were pretty pro forma myself There is the issue of increasing from 4 to 7 the number of persons with access to Class I FOMC materials within each Reserve Bank; that increase would square the number with that for those who have access to Class II materials I gather that a number of the members have raised this issue There are a couple of other items of a similar nature Does anybody have any questions with respect to this matter?   The reason for the proposal to increase staff access to Class I is basically that Jerry Jordan and I think some others among you have raised questions about the current limit and have suggested moving it up from 4 The Secretariat, I assume in its exuberance, said "Well, 4 is an exotic number so why not try 7?" I wonder whether 7 may be too high and whether we ought to back off that to keep a gap between Class I and Class II Suppose we did raise Class I to 5 Is that a problem?  SPEAKER(?) No   How much higher do you want to go?   The basic presumption is that there are fewer people designated "top secret" than "secret" Now, whether that is a valid judgment--[Laughter]   I think the issue here is basically not the Class II; it's the Class I Since the proposal is to give all those who now have access to Class II access to Class I as well, is there any status to having Class I clearance? I don't know Mr Secretary, do you have any suggestions on this? I got away a very long punt! [Laughter]   Why don't we bring this back then at the next meeting? There is no urgency about it Does anyone else have any views that would be helpful?   The presumption is that since it reports the intervention numbers when intervention occurs, the absence of such a report means intervention was zero, which also is classified information That is sort of putting it backwards!  Does anyone else want to raise any issues with respect to this before we reconsider it at the next meeting? If not, the next item on the agenda is a review of the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations There's a memorandum Does anybody have any questions? Incidentally, all of these items would ordinarily be on the February meeting agenda and were moved forward for obvious reasons relating to the crowded agenda for the February meeting Are there any questions with respect to that memo? If not, would somebody like to move it?   Without objection The next issue, which also was moved from the February meeting, is the review of (a) the Foreign Currency Authorization, (b) the Foreign Currency Directive, and (c) the Procedural Instructions with Respect to Foreign Currency Operations including a review of the "warehousing" authority incorporated in (a) and (b) These items were, of course, discussed at great length at recent meetings and telephone conferences, and I am  -3-    3/28/95  just curious as to whether anyone has anything to add to the rather exhaustive discussions that we have had   Yes   Do you mean market risk?   One of the reasons why I was very careful to indicate to the Congress that we indeed had this warehousing facility with respect to the Mexican deal was precisely to put it up front Now, some members of Congress may not have understood it, but I must tell you that I got no negative responses, and the types of questions they were asking suggested to me that at least those who were asking questions had some idea of the nature of this whole operation On the issue of how we deal with the Treasury in this government, as fiscal agent we involve ourselves in various types of support for the Treasury and that does in one sense impinge on the independence of this institution The trouble, unfortunately, is that we can not be fully independent because there is only one government and there is an element here of trying to draw the line I think we are all somewhat uncomfortable about the warehousing facility I think we are all uncomfortable to a greater or lesser extent about our own swap line facility, and in discussions with the Treasury regarding all of these issues we basically have been to a lesser or greater extent somewhat in opposition to the initiatives of the Treasury But we also recognize, as I think I indicated here a number of months ago, that the central bank has very broad responsibilities to ensure the safety and soundness of the financial system We could move ourselves back into a very narrow central bank mode, and I would agree with you that in that respect there would be less risk for us But I am not sure whether we would be giving the country something of value I think we have to take some risks, but certainly the issues that you raise are valid ones I don't think there is great disagreement about the need to be very careful on these issues I think we have been careful and I hope we will continue to be   The strongest argument they have is monetary policy   The fiscal effect occurs when the ESF funds are created At the moment the ESF has a big set of assets and a big set of liabilities Nobody is talking about expanding the size of the ESF or increasing its capital through appropriations What we are talking about is refinancing its assets on a different basis and that has no fiscal effects   That is a legitimate question In my view the issue essentially is that if the Treasury requests us to do it, we have to give their request very serious consideration Their view may be that while the transaction is technically feasible in the private market, the inconvenience involved in arranging relatively large sums there raises questions as to the efficiency of the operation That is a reasonable consideration that we have to confront We have to be careful as to precisely how we get ourselves intertwined with the Treasury; that is a very crucial issue In recent years I think we have widened the gap or increased the wedge between us and the Treasury, as Ted was mentioning In other words, we have gone to a market relationship and basically to an arms-length approach where feasible in an effort to make certain that we don't inadvertently get caught up in some of the Treasury initiatives that they want us to get involved in Most of the time we say "no"   I personally am not uncomfortable with what we are doing I am uncomfortable with the thought that we might have to pick up the entire $20 billion warehousing, but that obviously is a very remote contingency President Jordan    3/28/95   The question really is whether or not our role or central function is to provide dollar liquidity to other nations on an ongoing basis or on an ad hoc basis If you are going to raise the argument that the international financial markets have changed from where they were under the Bretton Woods structure, the emergence of private global finance has to a very substantial extent made much of the purposes of the Bretton Woods structure of dubious merit in the current environment The reason I raised questions earlier about the use of swaps is that their role in the modern world    3/28/95  --especially the order of magnitude of the swaps if we look at them in the context of the size and types of problems that seem to have emerged in the EMS, Mexico and the like--seems to be an anachronism I am a little concerned, however, about setting up a study in the form in which you suggested That is an expensive undertaking I do think it might not be a bad idea, however, to have a couple of memoranda that discuss the broader questions without getting into the initiatives that you are suggesting Your proposal strikes me as a much larger project and use of resources than I think we are prepared to get involved in until we get a clearer focus on how we view this issue The important question that I think you are raising, Jerry, is how much of our post Bretton Woods structure at the Federal Reserve is an anachronism and what our role is in today's environment I would much prefer to have a few short memoranda on that than spend a lot of time trying to think of what type of structure we should go to from here So, unless someone has an objection to that, I will request Ted to see whether or not we could have some short review of the history of this issue It would involve revisiting a lot of the material that has been put together, but I think the central focus should be on the question of what difference the emergence of private global finance makes relative to the structure that we have had since it evolved in the 1960s   Yes   On the basis of the meetings that I at least have been involved in--and some of our colleagues have been in similar meetings--I think there is a general recognition that the size of the problem that emerged in Mexico and the size of the international facility that was perceived to be necessary to address it clearly rule out a generic facility There is not enough cash in the world to handle the problems without producing potentially large inflationary pressures through use of SDRs, IMF quota expansions, and all of that   Yes, including what I am sure the IMF would like, which is for the IMF to become a world bank lender of last resort That is about the last resort I should think for anything This has led us to the question of whether it is possible to have bankruptcy statutes for sovereign nations As you know, at the moment that does not exist and the question is whether there is a mechanism that would make it possible to address the types of problems confronting Mexico in a restructuring mode that is the equivalent of a bankruptcy facility rather than by providing liquidity, which is implicit in our swap and other relationships That discussion is going forward at the BIS Ted, I assume there is some talk at the Halifax Summit on this?    3/28/95   Vice Chairman, you have been as much involved with this as anybody  -9-    3/28/95   If there is no further discussion, I would like to combine the three foreign policy instruments and move them simultaneously Would somebody like to make a motion?   Is there a second?  -10-    3/28/95   Without objection Let's move on finally to our regular agenda and I call on Peter Fisher   Questions for Peter on either the domestic or the foreign side?   President Parry   Governor Blinder   One of the central banks that we ought to be concerned about other than the Bundesbank and the Bank of Japan, as large holders of dollars that they are not going to relinquish, is the Bank of Taiwan It holds close to $90 billion in Eurodollars and direct claims against the US, largely in Treasury securities They are traders, needless to say Whereas it is fairly difficult politically and strategically in the context of the G-7 to have major shifts in dollar holdings by either the Bank of Japan or the Bundesbank, I am not sure there is terribly much inhibition in that large sort of bloated stock of securities sitting out there We have some data; I haven't looked at it What proportion of their holdings of US Treasuries are short-term Treasury bills? Do you know?   Have you checked the data?  -14-    3/28/95   Peter, what has happened to the total custodian holdings of Treasury securities in the last 10 weeks or so?   Is that because of the Caribbean--?   Who in fact were buying dollars!   I assume there is no concern about the American dollar in the context of our holding dollars as custodians for foreign official accounts! I only got a chuckle out of the Vice Chairman!   I realize that   You mean the hundred dollar bill?   Any further questions for Peter?  -15-    3/28/95   Further questions for Peter? If not, would somebody like to move approval of the actions of the foreign Desk?   Is there a second?   Without objection The domestic Desk transactions?   Second?   Without objection Let's now move on to what used to be called the Chart Show Whatever happened to the chart presentation?   We don't have it today?   That sounds like a precedent to me! [Laughter]   Before we adjourn, Ted Truman has a very minor change to recommend in the minutes for our previous meeting Ted, did you want to read it or shall I read it from here?   Without objection [Laughter] May 23 is our next meeting and we adjourn for lunch  END OF MEETING  -52-       Messrs Prell and Truman   Questions for either gentleman?   President Jordan   Other questions?   Further questions? If not, who would like to start the discussion? President McTeer   President Minehan   President Parry   President Moskow   Quick, President Broaddus   President Forrestal   President Hoenig   President Jordan   President Boehne   President Stern   President Melzer   Vice Chairman  -31-    3/28/95   Let's take a 10 minute coffee break at this point  [Coffee break]   Governor Kelley, you have the floor   I think it is three years   Governor Phillips   Thank you Governor Lindsey  -34-    3/28/95   What I read mainly is that the variance is rising I couldn't quite figure out where the signs came out  -35-    3/28/95   Governor Yellen   Governor Blinder   Why don't you repeat that; I want to get all the signs right! [Laughter]   Let's move on to Don Kohn   Don, we have revisited periodically the issue of going back to some form of credit variable target to replace the funds rate target You sort of dismissed that in your statement   Either I use the word credit in a generic sense so that it could be money, it could be borrowing, it could be a credit variable, it could be a non-interest-rate variable Do you envisage that sort of target as even remotely realistic or are you going to forecast that we will be saddled--I use the word advisedly--with the federal funds rate, which I think everyone would agree is a less desirable target than something directly related to our central bank operations?   And certainly not abandon the funds rate target--   Well, we used to   When I first arrived on the scene in mid-1987, there were still remnants of different types of borrowing targets   Other questions for Don?   President Stern   Vice Chairman   Any further questions?   Further questions from anybody? If not, let me get started  It is pretty obvious that the growth of the economy is moving down in the direction that we had hoped Indeed, if the evidence did not show that, as I indicated at our last meeting, I think we would be facing severe difficulties at this stage with serious instability beginning to emerge The extent of the weakness clearly is not pervasive; it is still relatively spotty We see it, for example, in the interest-sensitive areas, as many of you have indicated The longer-term buttress to the system clearly has not been undermined The recent gains in backlogs of orders, for example, remain very solid One of the reasons is that a gap has opened up between orders and shipments so that even when orders fluctuate a little, the gap is still there; the second difference of the change in unfilled orders is really not discernible on any particular charts We are, however, seeing initial claims beginning to edge modestly higher And I don't know whether it means anything, but C&I loans have flattened out in the last two weeks after spiking up for a considerable period  The question has been raised as to whether there has been a change in the seasonals that explains why we are seeing weaker first quarters relative to fourth quarters than we used to see I think this is a very questionable proposition in large part because it is tough to find a change in temperature degree-days nationwide It is especially difficult, at least as best I can judge, to see a pattern in the southern areas of the United States--where one would presume that seasonality would be less of a factor--that differs from that nationwide We still get a big surge in the fourth quarter and weakness in the first in that part of the country Nonetheless, there are reasons to suspect that weaker growth may in fact be emerging this year, not because of seasonality but largely because of the operation of the business cycle  Gary Stern has raised an interesting question with respect to inventories It has always been the case that when business people comment that "my sales have not done as well as I expected," that is algebraically equivalent to "my inventories are higher than I planned" The question is how important is that development I think it is important enough to raise the possibility that the second quarter is going to be slower than the consensus expectation The Greenbook may be on track here We probably have a mini inventory recession under way, though not one that I would consider to be any particular cause for concern As I indicated at our last meeting, I don't think any measures of inventory levels are pointing to a large prospective overhang Indeed, the inventory data have been revised down I don't mean necessarily for the fourth quarter, but as I recall the annual revision for trade has actually brought the numbers down so that we are dealing with an inventory level situation that is very far from scary Nonetheless, we do have a short-term inventory cycle tending to emerge As a consequence of this, I think we are looking at the possibility that there is an element of euphoria about a soft landing that probably mitigates against it happening for the reasons that the Vice Chairman and a number of others have indicated  I think the downside risks are basically coming from the possibility of significant increases in stock and bond prices If you remember, some of our discussions about the necessity of moving in  -42-    3/28/95  early 1994 recognized that we were beginning to get wealth effects that were unsustainable and potentially creating bubbles Ironically, the real danger is that things may get too good When things get too good, human beings behave awfully I would be a little cautious about what stance we take In retrospect, I would change that sentence in my Humphrey-Hawkins testimony where I stated hypothetically that we might be easing rates The reason I would change it at this stage is not that I think the statement is incorrect It is a correct statement of policy, but I underestimated the degree of credibility that the Federal Reserve has accumulated in the last year or so As a result of this, as the Vice Chairman observed, the markets truly believe that we know what is going on in the economy to a degree that no one else really does Therefore, we got the largest swing in 2-year to 10-year maturities that I can recall in a long time That swing was basically the result of the disappearance from the markets of an expectation of significant further tightening The argument was not that the Federal Reserve is wrong and we are going to have to tighten Their money was on the fact that we were right and we would not have to tighten Now, I worry about that, and I worry about that basically because we could be our own worst enemies in this regard  I think that this raises an interesting question of policy, not about our fundamental policy but rather the symmetry/asymmetry issue about which I have mixed views Let me tell you what I think is the relevant issue here I think there is no alternative to "B" as the fundamental choice In an odd way, if it were not for this credibility/noncredibility issue and the extent to which we are affecting markets and therefore having wealth effects in the economy, I would say this is a classic case of symmetry It is very difficult looking at current conditions to see anything other than a balanced situation I think, however, that the symmetry/asymmetry question is really more appropriately a loss function issue In other words, it does not involve our best guess as to what we think the appropriate policy is, but rather what the consequences are of our taking a position on this matter, recognizing that it will be made public eight weeks from now My concern is that after the mini inventory recession unfolds and what is still a relatively strong capital goods market starts to create incomes and consumption, we may find that we wish we had been somewhat tighter somewhere along the line A change in our rhetoric including the use of asymmetry may be the desirable thing to do I definitely do think we ought to change our rhetoric I have no really strong feelings on whether we should be symmetric or asymmetric, and very honestly, I could go either way My own marginal preference is to go asymmetric, but I would find it perfectly acceptable to use a symmetric directive here One thing that concerns me about what I just said is that it is almost too cute It is taking fine-tuning to the point of sharp pointedness that may be overdone But I must say that I line up with the concerns that the Vice Chairman, Governor Kelley, and a few others have mentioned I would be inclined in that direction, but I am interested in getting everyone else's view on this issue and call on the Vice Chairman first   President Jordan   President Melzer   President Minehan   President Stern   President Parry   President Forrestal   President Hoenig  -47-    3/28/95   President Moskow   President Boehne   Governor Lindsey   Governor Blinder   I look at it as a question of probabilities In other words, the question really amounts to What is the probability in this long period that we will be moving rates up or moving them down? I would say that we are more likely to move them up, finding, for example, that the slowdowns we are seeing are partially false or reversed as has happened many times in the past I find the probability that this slowing will cumulate into a significantly weak economy that would induce us to move rates down is very low I think the major probability is that we will do nothing Since I think the likelihood of moving them higher is sufficiently greater than moving them lower, I lean marginally, tentatively, unsurely toward asymmetry, which is really a reflection of the fact that I think the major probability is that we will do nothing I read asymmetry not as an overwhelming probability that we will move, but merely a probability that one can basically identify   By a sufficient amount   And each of us has to determine what constitutes a sufficient amount   Governor Kelley   President Broaddus   President McTeer   Governor Phillips   Governor Yellen   I think as I read the view of this Committee, we would be at alternative B and mildly asymmetric Would you read the directive?   Call the roll   Would somebody like to move the approval of the minutes for the March 28 meeting?   Without objection We now turn to Peter Fisher who will report on the operations of both the foreign Desk and the domestic Desk   Questions for Peter?   I think the Governor is asking the question, "What in the world does it mean to say you are priced out of the market?"   Governor, what he is saying is a euphemism for indicating that they were wrong and that the price they are looking at now is too high to buy   Did I get it right, Peter?   Any other questions? President Forrestal   Further questions for Peter?   Governor Kelley   Especially if you have to sell   And to whom   And to whom [Laughter]   I'm sorry Peter, I just thought I would pick on you this morning I took a pill that says, "Pick on Peter"   Can I suggest that we consider this issue periodically? The issue raised by Governor Blinder is something that is very important for us to look at The way you phrased your answer, Peter, I think underscores that To maintain the status quo really makes no sense whatever The crucial question is What liquidity needs do we have and what are the implications? I hope that you and Don can get together and come up with a report that gives the Committee some insight into what the principles should be  Let me just state my own view of what I would like to see in that report What would have been the consequences, for example, if a few of the major money center banks had gone belly-up in 1990, which was not an altogether bizarre possibility, and of the possible discount window lending that could have required huge liquidations from our portfolio? Secondly, there is the interesting question of whether in fact we could get both that scenario and the need for a major accumulation of foreign currencies My suspicion is that the two contingencies probably would involve disparate economic events and it is very unlikely that they would come together But we could face the need to acquire very large amounts of foreign currencies over a short period of time  Finally, I think it would be useful to get a notion of the effect of changing the maturity composition of our portfolio on the portfolio held by the public That ultimately affects the sensitivity of interest payments in the budget, taking into account Federal Reserve earnings, to changes in market interest rates Clearly, we have been very much inclined over the years to try to stay away from a position where the short-term interest rate actions of the Federal Reserve could have pronounced federal budget effects To the extent that we lengthen the average maturity of our portfolio and the Treasury does not offset what we are doing, that creates a portfolio with an increasingly shorter average maturity in the hands of the public Therefore, the consolidated interest costs including Federal Reserve earnings tend to be more sensitive to changes in interest rates--obviously in the direction of higher rates being associated with higher federal outlays I don't know how sensitive that relationship is, but I do think that the argument should be to get as much liquidity as we mught conceivably need in the context of whatever we view as a potential amount of resources that might be drained from our balance sheet and then multiply it by some number like they do at the BIS--I think it is three [Laughter] I don't know whether three is the magic number, but there should be some criteria  I think Governor Blinder raises an important issue We have this huge portfolio, and we don't really have a set of principles that this Committee determines and I think we should So, I would appreciate it if, sooner rather than later, you could come up with a set of principles that we can then debate at some meeting Any further comments on this?   Further questions? If not, we need to take three votes The first is to ratify the foreign currency transactions since the last meeting   Is there a second?   Without objection Second, we will need to ratify the domestic operations during the intermeeting period   Without objection Finally, Peter has requested an increase in the intermeeting leeway from $8 to $10 billion May I have a motion on that?   The next meeting is the multiple day meeting, July 5th and 6th I gather it will be held in Dining Room "E" because we are going to be renovating this room This is as early as we have ended a meeting in quite a while [Secretary's note The meeting ended at 1215 pm]  END OF MEETING  -37-       Without objection Now let's go on to Mike Prell   Questions for Mike? Mike, I meant to look up something before we came in I don't know if you have the data with you, but what is the gap between new orders of durable goods and shipments in the last report?   My recollection is that we have a spread of several percentage points The reason I raise the question is to    5/23/95  gauge how much of a drop in new orders can occur in the near term without unfilled orders also turning down   President Moskow   In March?   President Parry   President Jordan   It strikes me that the concept probably does not have useful meaning unless we stipulate that we are in an environment in which the budget is balanced, prices are stable, and the exchange rate is stable The latter, of course, is a function of what other nations are doing as well To have a concept of neutrality when any of those three is moving, I think is quite ambiguous But the presumption of a stable economy, maximum sustainable growth at    5/23/95  stable prices, and stable exchange rates does raise a question as to what real interest rate structure is consistent with that Once we move away from that framework, then I think we are dealing with an indeterminate concept Is there any way, Mike, in which you can define neutrality apart from making certain rigid prespecifications?   The question would be--I'm sorry   President Minehan   Governor Blinder   Any further questions for Mike? If not, who would like to start our round table? President Broaddus   President Forrestal   President Moskow   Vice Chairman   No comment President Minehan   President Parry   President Boehne   President Hoenig   President McTeer   President Stern   President Melzer   President Jordan   Governor Kelley   Governor Phillips  -23-    5/23/95   Governor Lindsey   Governor Yellen   Governor Blinder   That is true of anyone's forecast!   With that, we will go to coffee  COFFEE BREAK   Don, is the price index that Taylor uses the fixed weight or the implicit deflator?   So, when the GDP figures are revised, his normative funds rate will go up?   You don't know what the dimension of that is, do you?   The crucial question that you raise is that of using his equation to capture what we were deciding over the last eight years, and I suggest to you that that may be a little fallacious in the sense that it can be misspecified by the choice of variables   That is exactly right   Any other questions? If not, I don't have much to add to what has been said in recent meetings because, in fact, the economy is moving pretty much as expected If you make the adjustment that Governor Blinder requires, namely that forecasts are always a moving average of actual events and they smooth out the real world, that is one of the reasons I recall saying back in our late January-early February meeting that one of the quarters in this first half was going to surprise us on the down side All I was doing was using the Blinder rule and it always works   No, it never is very helpful in that sense I think we have to look at this particular outlook in terms of what is engendering the softening That softening is very clearly the result of an inventory backup, which could be a little stronger than we may expect I think manufacturing may have a few more months, maybe three or so, of a lot more weakness than is implicit in our forecast The C&I loan figures may be pointing to a slowdown, but I suspect that we are going to find that the inventory reduction has been slower than we were expecting and that a goodly part of that was an unintended inventory backup That means that people have not yet come to grips with the squeeze down to a significantly lower rate of inventory investment As a consequence, I suspect that the third quarter is going to be softer than is projected in the Greenbook Were it not for the fact that inventory levels, no matter how we  -30-    5/23/95  measure them, remain quite low, I would say the concern that a number of you have expressed with respect to the potential for reduced inventory investment working its way through the income structure and inducing a weaker consumption pattern in a historically typical way would be something that we ought to be concerned about But no matter how we look at the numbers, the levels just remain too low for the inventory sector to be a matter of grave concern And because other sectors of the economy such as capital goods and exports, and I might add homebuilding, are showing signs of sustainability, we don't have the conditions that would induce the underlying system to crack at this particular stage  The reason I asked Mike Prell earlier about the size of the gap between orders and shipments is that I suspect that we are going to see new orders coming down in capital goods markets The only question is whether they will drop far enough to breach the shipments level and turn unfilled orders down I think that is a mixed call at this stage, but because there is so much of a gap there, we have leeway for fairly significant short-term weakening I must say that I don't expect all that much weakening in the expansion, largely because the profit picture still looks increasingly supportive That is, as the Greenbook indicates, the earnings surprises on the up side are still 2 to 1--profits are coming in more favorably twice as often as unfavorably The first-quarter profit numbers that were published are just gangbusters and profit margins are still rising This is really quite extraordinary, given the extent of the slowdown that is involved here What history tells us is that we just don't get a capital goods contraction in the context of rising profit margins, rising stock prices, and long-term interest rates that tend to be falling That may occur--it undoubtedly will at a later stage of the expansion The business cycle is by no means dead, but it just does not make any sense in an historical context to presume that we will be looking at significantly weaker capital spending Certainly, nonresidential building continues to strengthen and we are getting, as many of you have indicated, a gradual, underlying healing of that problem Indeed, the issue may be more what Governor Lindsey is concerned about There may be too much nonresidential construction going on already or at least showing signs of being overdone, and I must say I have a certain sympathy for that kind of concern  We did get a surprising statistic from the mortgage bankers last week I don't know whether to believe it or not, but the weekly seasonally adjusted figure on home purchases as reported by the mortgage bankers spiked sharply upward, and it does not look like a seasonal adjustment problem because the unadjusted number was the highest that we have seen in a very long time Moreover, all the qualitative evidence--the traffic, the intentions to buy, the consumer confidence elements associated with housing--is in the direction of a rise in housing activity The reason starts are weak is that we have a very heavy overhang of unsold homes through which the market has to work its way The underlying quality of this market is pretty sound  In sum, there is no evidence of a cumulative decline in the economy We have a very odd problem in the published inventory data, but we also have one in the unpublished data that involves stock adjustment inventories In the housing industry inventories of unsold homes will continue to hold activity down In the motor vehicles area I think, as President Moskow indicated, that the May data on sales  -31-    5/23/95  look somewhat stronger at this stage than those for April, although by no means as strong as they have been Nor, with all the weakness that we are seeing, do the initial claims for unemployment insurance suggest that this economy is in a continuous weakening phase The evidence does suggest that there are going to be a lot more surprises on the down side in the very short run than we may be prepared for  The debt issue that Governor Lindsey raises is an interesting one, and I would only respond by suggesting that part of the problem with this big increase in installment credit, which really is outsized, is a significant displacement coming from the mortgage market Up until fairly recently, a rather substantial amount of indirect financing for consumer durables has come from the turnover of existing homes That turnover has induced large realized capital gains that have been financed in the mortgage market Those funds are going disproportionately into the financing of consumer durables The slowness of the mortgage market in relation to the level of existing home sales is suggestive of the fact that less of that is going on, and it may be that--l-1/2 billion credit card solicitations--is that what you said?   Is that an official figure? Where did you get the number?   No kidding! That is scary!   Every dog and cat and moose has a credit card! I think that part of the problem is merely a shift in the form of financing, but I don't think we can look at those figures without some concern I do agree that the easing of credit terms is a potential problem down the road I say that even though, according to the bankers, credit terms are still tighter than they were in the late 1980s; but that is scarcely the standard that one should employ, as I think one of our colleagues indicated the other day  I would say that there is a bigger problem down the road related to all of this If in fact the economy tracks the Greenbook forecast, it is inconceivable in my judgment that it will continue doing so for an extended period That is because if this happens, the stock market is going to go straight up and then straight down And on the down side there will be an awful lot of demand implosion So, if this economy works as well as the Greenbook suggests, the really serious problem that we will have in setting monetary policy, which we are going to have to question ourselves on, will be how we should respond to asset price bubbles We know how to respond to product price inflation and the instability that is associated with that You may recall that when we moved in February 1994, one of the reasons was that an asset price bubble was building up Little did we know that it was much bigger than we had imagined and that it was more in bonds than in stocks In retrospect, it was terribly fortunate that that bubble got pricked at the appropriate time I am not sure that one can make a forecast that is as stable as the one in the Greenbook,  -32-    5/23/95  because implicit in such a forecast, given human nature, are actions that will probably upset it and that concerns me  So, one of the reasons why the real world is not very apt to look like the Greenbook is that the way the real world works is not like "that" but more something like "this" [Secretary's note The Chairman made a hand gesture indicating a smooth path when he said "that" and an uneven path when he said "this"] The only problem is that we don't know what "this" is until after the fact So, all forecasters can do is to draw straight lines through things The disequilibrium that is implicit in this forecast is an asset price bubble, and I am not sure at this stage that we know how or by what means we ought to be responding to that, and whether we dare There is always the question, if we make a preemptive strike against an asset bubble, of whether we could blow the economy out of the water in the process So, it is a slightly nervous-making type of situation I almost hope that the economy will be a little less tranquil, buoyant, and pleasant because the end result of that is not terribly helpful  On the product price inflation side, I think what we are looking at here is strictly the expected slowdown in productivity that occurs as a consequence of fixed costs not being spread over the aggregate volumes that we have seen As unit labor costs rise accordingly, we will be looking inevitably at the beginning of a decline in profit margins but not enough of a decline to prevent final prices from accelerating modestly However, that is a cyclical phenomenon and not one that I would be terribly concerned about I am certainly not as concerned about that as I would be about an asset price bubble, which is down the road, granted, but still something to be concerned about  Fortunately, as I see it in the short run, none of this is relevant! [Laughter] We can, as I see it, just do "B" symmetric and wait until the next meeting I think it is very unlikely that the next meeting is going to be one where we are going to be confronted with an economic expansion that is picking up, because my suspicion is--I don't know whether I'd pick the specific timing that Governor Blinder did--that the rate of expansion is going to be shading down a little in the period immediately ahead But I would not expect the slowing to be enough to undercut the fairly solid underlying status of this recovery for a while, perhaps a good while yet Vice Chairman   President Minehan   The way I put it is that I am more nervous about the asset bubble than I am about product prices That is not to say that I would disagree with you There may be more than a cyclical element in here that we won't know about until after the fact I think most of it--   Is cyclical, but such inflation is not acceptable as far as I am concerned President McTeer   President Broaddus   President Boehne   President Parry   President Forrestal   Governor Blinder   Governor Kelley   President Moskow   Governor Phillips  -35-    5/23/95   President Hoenig   President Stern   Governor Yellen   President Jordan   President Melzer   Governor Lindsey   Would you read the directive   It is symmetric   It doesn't matter   As long as they are the same for both Do we usually use "would" when the directive is symmetric?   I think we should use "would" We are voting on "B" symmetric Call the roll   This is the first meeting in our rejuvenated Board Room The map of the Federal Reserve Districts has been enhanced but not redrawn, so your Districts are what they were; you need not worry about that However, as in the old James Bond movies, there are a lot of buttons here that you can't see If I push one in an appropriate manner, you fall through the floor with your chair, and there is a pool down there with sharks and all sorts of other creatures That is not meant to influence your vote! [Laughter]   I don't think there is anything else that has to be discussed with respect to the Board Room What you see is what you get We will soon find out if it is a major improvement or just more expense [Laughter]  We have with us today First Vice President Colleen Strand from the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis She is attending the meeting for the first time under our new procedures We welcome her  Would somebody like to move approval of the minutes?   The July 5-6 minutes have been moved and approved We now turn to Peter Fisher for his report on foreign currency and domestic open market operations during the period since the July meeting   Questions for Peter?   Let me say that I think the Treasury people are aware that they cannot do this very much more without falling into the trap, where they basically are intervening all the time to no effect My impression is that this is the end of the series We have not been behind the Treasury pushing them in this direction, to say the least They have acknowledged that this is a risky business and that if they prolong it or try to do it too often, the market will come back and bite them I don't think there is a newfound insight that modest intervention of a few hundred million dollars or a billion dollars or whatever can really move the market I think the people who make the decisions at the Treasury are aware that the only way we can effectively change the exchange rate through intervention is to catch the market short against our intervention and the reaction is strictly that By definition, we cannot continuously surprise the market; at some point, it is waiting for us to move and catch us when we move I think there has been an element of luck here that we should put in the bank and let it draw interest and not try to spend right away  Any other questions for Peter? If not, would somebody like to move to ratify the foreign currency transactions since the last meeting?   Without objection Would somebody like to move to ratify the domestic open market transactions since the last meeting?   Without objection Let's now move on to the economic situation Are you going to use the big screens for your presentation?   I'm disappointed We have new technologies here that enhance the economic outlook, I do believe   Our next meeting is on September 26 and I think we'll have a very interesting meeting We adjourn for lunch  END OF MEETING  -39-       Dave Stockton has the floor   Questions for either gentleman?   Excuse me; may I just interrupt for a second? Let me request that everyone move their papers away from the microphones, the little disks directly in front of you I think the system works fine provided we don't block up the microphone system   President Parry?   President Stern   There is a major statistical problem We are all acutely aware that there has been a shift toward increasingly conceptual and impalpable value added and that actual GDP in constant dollars is becoming progressively less visible All of these intellectual services have historically tended to be written off as expenses in income statements, research and development clearly being the largest and most obvious of these We are moving toward an economy in which the value added is increasingly software, telecommunications technologies, and various means of conveying value to people without the transference of a physical good; entertainment is the obvious classical case So, we are getting increasing evidence that we probably are expensing items that really should be capitalized This is the issue with software We have all seen, as I think you are aware, a number of industries in which the ratio of stock market value to book value is much higher than one In fact, in certain industries it is a huge multiple The trend of market to book value has been rising very dramatically over the years, and I suspect we cannot extract all of that from changing market valuations of stocks in general What appears to be the case is that an increasing amount of capital expenditures in the classic sense is being misclassified as expenses and that obviously lowers the book value of the firm to well below where it would be if those expenses had more appropriately been capitalized The stock market is basically telling us that there has indeed been an acceleration of productivity if one properly incorporates in output that which the markets value as output If in effect there has been a failure to capture all the output that has been occurring, we will indeed show productivity growth that is too low It is hard to imagine that productivity is moving up only around 1 percent under the new weighting basis with profit margins moving the way they are and with the widespread business restructuring that is occurring I think the difficulty is not in productivity; I think it is at the Department of Commerce   Governor Blinder   President Moskow   President Hoenig   President Minehan   Any further questions? If not, would somebody like to start the roundtable? President Hoenig   President Moskow   President Parry   President Minehan   Thank you President Boehne   President Forrestal   President McTeer   President Broaddus   President Melzer   President Jordan   President Stern   Governor Lindsey   Vice Chairman   Used cars only or total?   Governor Kelley   Governor Phillips   Thank you Governor Blinder   Governor Yellen   Thank you I assume we have coffee available at this stage   Mr Kohn, you have the floor  -29-    8/22/95   Is there a particular reason why you use a one-year forward expectation of the price index deflator with overnight funds?   Except now, if you use a two- or three- month moving average, won't you get virtually a full percentage point higher?   What has the inflation rate been in the last three months?   I understand that You are not using the core rate; you are using the total CPI, is that right?   Any other questions for Don?   Am I grading these papers? [Laughter]   President Broaddus   President Melzer   Tom, there is no question that you are right on the longer-term rate spectrum, but if hypothetically we just squeezed reserves out of the system, two things would happen The nominal rate would go up and the inflation rate would go down, and the real rate would have to go up But I think that is not true in the longer run, which is where we can't affect it    8/22/95   I think it is not true in the long run, and it is not true in a long-term forecast of the real funds rate, if I may put it that way But for a short-term forecast of the real funds rate, I think Don is exactly right on that   Or a long-term projection of the real overnight rate--in other words, what the funds rate is going to be three years or ten years from now   Governor Blinder   No   Anything else? At the last meeting and at the Humphrey-Hawkins testimony, as Governor Yellen suggested, I indicated that the maximum risk of a short-term recession was probably past Indeed, the data that have emerged since then have increased the probability that the risks of recession have eased A significant part of this is unquestionably the fact that we are not seeing a weakening in final demand despite all the evidence that clearly points to a far more rapid pace of inventory adjustment than we had contemplated at the last meeting The lead times are continuing to fall and the inventory adjustment process is still going on It may be a bit premature to presume that the adjustment is complete at this stage or approaching completion There is no question that we are beginning to see order patterns that are stabilizing, but the adjustment has been too quick and the timeframe too short for us to believe that we are through it as yet I would not be surprised to see industrial production sagging for a number of weeks or a month or so before we work our way through this Nonetheless, I think the evidence clearly is emerging that the underlying structural weakness that concerned us is dissipating The evidence of much stronger growth in output is lacking but, as I think Dave Stockton said, the probabilities of that occurring have gone up Indeed, while the anecdotal evidence around this room has pointed with surprising unanimity to a pause, the Districts are doing better now as we go from one to another than they were three months ago I think that probably reflects the fact that the economy is coming back and growing at a faster pace, but real pressure on the up side seems a good distance away, judging from all of the numbers we have at this particular stage When we look at the individual company data and the anecdotal data on orders, it is clear that conditions are improving overall, but it is a mixed bag It is not the straightforward universal strength that the economy exhibited in the latter part of 1994  -35-    8/22/95  Whatever forecast we are looking at, I think a smooth pattern is not going to be the actual outcome Our forecasts are going to be tested by the fiscal crunch we are all talking about It is not self- evident to me that the crunch will involve a major contraction in federal spending I think there are two sides to this issue First of all, it is pretty obvious that if the debt limit blocks spending-- and indeed, as Larry Lindsey said, the chance of getting a debt limit extension through the House without a balanced budget in place is very small--we will have a dramatic shutting down of the government I am inclined to the view that, when push comes to shove, we are going to get consecutive one-week extensions of the debt limit rather than allowing it to push the economy down And the ambiguity with respect to the question of how appropriated but unspent funds are employed in various authorization bills, when there is indeed no authorization for the period after September 30, leads me to conclude that the rate of reduction in discretionary spending will be modest in the short term We will get very significant cutbacks in certain budgets, but overall, if entitlement spending continues as indeed it does in this particular context, the contraction in spending will be modest in the early stages It would be severe if a debt limit is allowed to go into effect  If in this process we end up with a very sharp reduction in federal spending, the fiscal drag issue will arise, especially if it is presumed that the decline in expenditures will be temporary Under those conditions we will not get offsetting pressure from falling long-term yields, but we will get a contractionary effect from a reduction in incomes That will require very difficult policy judgments on our part because I don't recall any historical precedent telling us how all this works It may well be that everyone will see the decline in income as temporary and hence the saving rate will collapse but expenditures will not Nominal GDP will stand up except for the effects of liquidity constraints, of which there have to be some But there is no doubt that until we get a sense of that, we will not be quite sure where it will come out  There is also the distinct possibility--although hopefully at this stage it is a very small probability--that we will run into a situation in which the outlook is for materially less budget deficit reduction If the outlook for substantial deficit reduction does not look as likely as it does now, markets are going to react very adversely We will get a significant rise in long-term rates because very clearly there is sizable deficit reduction embodied in the long- term rate structure If that were to happen, the stock market would come down very dramatically Therefore, it is possible that this fiscal outlook can create negative real effects on the economy if the budget deficit reduction is too much or if it is too little It is very difficult to know what the probability distribution looks like  The one thing that is clear is that the budget process is now moving forward to some form of crunch It just is not conceivable at this stage, at least as I see it, that there can be a resolution before October 1st I find it highly unlikely that continuing resolutions will simply be adopted as they have in the past Some variations of continuing resolutions and debt limit extensions may occur, but they are surely not going to apply universally That means that there will be some impact of an order of magnitude and a nature that I don't think we can get a sense of at this particular stage We  -36-    8/22/95  can judge that better after Labor Day as we begin to see whether in fact there are going to be filibusters on the appropriations bills in the Senate If we don't get appropriations bills, we can be certain that we will not get majority votes for continuing resolutions Therefore, there will be no budget and no legal authority to spend In the Budget Act that was passed around five years ago, Congress narrowed very significantly the ability of the President to define threats to life and property as reasons to invoke expenditures to protect them  So, we have emerging an extraordinary set of events that belies the tranquility of the Greenbook forecast It is not terribly clear precisely how the fourth quarter is going to come out The one thing I am absolutely certain of is that it is not going to look like the Greenbook forecast However, I would not know which numbers have a higher probability of being realized because I think that the Greenbook forecast may be the maximum likelihood estimate But then who knows what the distribution looks like on each side of that forecast?  I conclude from all of this that we don't know how the budget debate will be resolved We will have another shot at it at our next FOMC meeting, which fortuitously occurs just before October 1st I think we will know a good deal more about how things are evolving at that stage As a consequence and in the context of our discussion in July, I agree with Don Kohn that the real federal funds rate is a good starting point to get a sense of where we are Other things equal, that rate is probably somewhat higher than we are likely to want it to be somewhere down the track or over the longer run, with "down the track" being on the other side of the fiscal train wreck, to keep this analogy going In the immediate period ahead, it strikes me that the general outlook is extraordinarily benevolent and one that I view at the moment as pointing to no change in policy That is, "B" and symmetrical seems to me the most sensible approach until the next meeting By the next meeting, I suspect that we are going to have to make a number of contingent decisions I will be very surprised if we do not have several telephone conference calls in the month of October as this budget situation evolves because there will have to be coordination between the Treasury and ourselves to ascertain what is going on and to take measures that, to whatever extent possible, will mitigate the secondary consequences of this fiscal process that will loom ever larger as we move into the fourth quarter Tom   Governor Lindsey   Vice Chairman   Governor Kelley   President Minehan    8/22/95   President Boehne   President Forrestal   President Parry   President Melzer   President Stern   President Broaddus   President Jordan   Governor Phillips   Governor Yellen   President Moskow   Governor Blinder   Have I run out of people? We'll have lunch earlier than usual! [Laughter]  SPEAKER(?) It's those sharks!   Why don't you read the relevant language?   Call the roll   Would somebody like to move approval of the minutes?   Without objection Mr Fisher, please   Questions for Peter?   Governor Phillips   President Jordan   Any other questions? If not, would somebody like to move ratification of the domestic Desk operations?  SPEAKER(?) So move  SPEAKER(?) Second   The next item on the agenda is Senator Connie Mack's bill, the Economic Growth and Price Stability Act of 1995 When I reported to the Senate Banking Committee last week, I was not asked very specifically whether I supported the bill as such I repeated the statements I had made previously, namely that I thought the primary purpose of monetary policy was long-term price stability, and I didn't get queried much beyond that However, this bill has a very large sponsorship Indeed, the last report I heard indicated that virtually all the members on the Republican side of the Senate Banking and on the Joint Economic committees were co-sponsors of the bill So, it strikes me that we will be asked to testify on this bill at some point or another Despite the strain of the current legislative calendar, it is likely that Senator Mack will be successful in squeezing in a hearing on his bill at some point, and it would be quite useful to get at least preliminary views from the members of this Committee on how we should respond to that bill I will be testifying as the representative of this Committee and of the Board, and I will try to fend off wherever possible any requests on their part for my personal views It strikes me that even if my views coincide in all respects with what this Committee might be saying, the Mack bill involves a potential change in the nature of what this Committee is doing and it is the Committee that should be speaking in that regard, not the Chairman A lot of the provisions of this bill essentially would sanction what we have have been doing in any event, but there are aspects of the bill that are different So, I think it is important that all of you, to whatever extent you have been able to focus on the provisions of the bill, at least give your preliminary views The transcript that we will have of our discussion will be helpful in formulating official testimony in response to a request for us to appear and give our views So, if anyone would like to comment --President Parry   President Broaddus   Governor Yellen   President Melzer   President Boehne   Governor Blinder   President Stern   Governor Kelley   President Hoenig   President Minehan   President Forrestal   President Moskow   President Jordan   Governor Blinder and then Don Winn   President McTeer   Vice Chairman McDonough   Governor Phillips   Governor Lindsey   Okay Don Winn, did you want to say anything further on this that you haven't communicated already?   I don't think you will unless it looks as though it is a bill that has legs   It is getting quite late [Laughter] Why don't we adjourn this meeting? If you want to have an informal discussion later today on these issues after Don Winn brings us up to date on overall legislative developments, we can do that I think this has been a very useful presentation by all of you It clearly suggests to me the sort of language we can put together for the hearing should such a hearing take place Obviously, the draft testimony will be circulated to you in advance Finally, let me just say that our next meeting is Wednesday, November 15th It promises to be an exciting meeting not because of what we will do but because of what other people will do at that time   Without objection Shall we move on? Let's go to Messrs Prell and Truman   Questions for either gentleman?   President Jordan   You might have the staff recalculate the average age of the capital stock as a potential technology variable just to try to capture this sort of thing I don't know what the result will look like I suspect it won't work, like most other things! In any event, the anecdotal evidence that is emerging at this stage does suggest that there is an insecurity issue and that it indeed has had a structural effect as President Jordan points out That has to be the case if you consider that the workforce interfaces with the capital stock to produce goods and services If the capital stock is turning over increasingly rapidly, meaning that the capital stock itself feels more insecure, [Laughter] it is reasonable to presume that the people who work with that insecure capital stock have to feel somewhat insecure about their jobs The issue is how to measure it In doing so, we have to be careful to put the job insecurity concept in its proper context It is to a certain extent a level-adjustment issue because one can imagine what a normalized wage level might be under the standard Phillips curve or other wage equation model excluding the insecurity issue What one would get is an upward trend If we add in an insecurity variable, and insecurity at its maximum, the level would be uniformly lower One must presume that as we move from the normal level down to the other level, there comes a point even at maximum insecurity where the wage level becomes a relevant concept, and if we are looking at the rate of change, then the insecurity has to have a diminishing effect Job insecurity has been around for a long time at this stage, and it almost surely has had the effect of moving the level down from normal We may soon be running into resistance to downsizing At that point we will be back on the same growth rate pattern even though the level may be appreciably lower This issue may be relevant in judging the price level, but after the one-time adjustment, it ceases to become an issue with respect to inflation as best I can see Anyway, I'll take another look at that  I just got the results on the average age of the capital stock, which I think may be used as a proxy for technology insecurity, and we will see if we even get the right sign We know it has the right trend; it's just a question of whether it picks up anything in addition   That would be even more extreme   I'm just stipulating that they remain just as insecure  -6-    9/26/95   It is a decaying factor on the wage rate change President Stern   You would think there would be enough derivative hedges to secure the position   Yes   Is there any evidence of a motive?   Why did he start in the first place? What was his motive originally? Was it personal?   Is there any evidence in the way it was structured that he would be able to draw funds for his own account?   Why do we assume that this was not the obvious motive, and why are we looking beyond that?   Supposing that were a motive, and obviously we don't know, and say hypothetically that he had succeeded and replenished all the relevant funds and the like, would there be any supervisory mechanism to detect that?   I would conclude that we have no evidence that there may not have been other significant successful    9/26/95  endeavors by people throughout history that were never uncovered My own judgment is that there is a limit to what the most assiduous bank examiner can do in a situation where somebody engages in a practice in which he trades for his own account, wins, replenishes, and we never hear of him   Exactly, and I think that is all the more reason why we have to be very assiduous in our evaluation of internal auditing processes and of apparent internal conflicts of interest built into the system Unless we can do that, I don't know what we can do Even with that, somebody is always clever enough to figure a way around it It's a constant ploy   That's nice   Governor Blinder   We know one person whose job security is-- Has he been fired?   No   No, if I feel insecure, I'm not going to leave   That's correct   That was a long time ago   That shouldn't affect the level of the dollar in the long run   You have the accumulation of those dollars to begin with   Is there concern that the dramatic shift in funds that has been going on in recent weeks could erode German political support for the EMU to a point where it would be difficult, if not impossible, to implement the EMU on schedule? I am referring to the shift from deutschemarks by German investors into Swiss francs that has been showing up, I gather, in falling sales by German life insurance companies We are getting moves out of Luxembourg accounts into Swiss franc accounts in Switzerland I guess two-thirds of the people surveyed are against eliminating the deutschemark in Germany   He took a position as I read it that didn't say what he said; or if he said it, he didn't mean it; and if he meant it, he shouldn't have   President Moskow   Further questions?   Okay Would somebody like to start our roundtable discussion? President Forrestal   President Parry   President Broaddus   President Boehne   President Hoenig  -17-    9/26/95   President Minehan   President Moskow   President McTeer   Thank you President Melzer  -22-    9/26/95   President Stern   Vice Chairman   President Jordan   Governor Yellen   Governor Lindsey   Governor Kelley   I appreciate your not doing that   Thank you Governor Phillips   Thank you Governor Blinder   He can just xerox last meeting's minutes!   Thank you Shall we have coffee?  [Coffee break]   Mr Kohn   Questions for Don? Yes, President Melzer   There is one other aspect in the interpretation of these data that we have to be careful about While it is true that in a technical sense these accounts are changing, they are not perceived to be changing by the holders of the accounts So, you can not make the argument, which some might make, that what in fact is engendering a change, for example in M1 or some other aggregate, is relevant in terms of the macroeconomic effect That is not the case, or should not be the case, if the holders of these accounts are not aware that anything is going on, which indeed they are not except to a marginal extent So, you can't argue that people are holding certain types of balances voluntarily and acting on those irrespective of how those balances got created There is a significant lack of awareness among the holders of the accounts that reserve balance adjustments are taking place And they don't perceive that their NOW account has gone down or been shifted over to MMDAs and therefore one can't argue that their behavior should be altered   Yes   Further comments? If not, let me xerox my comments from the last meeting because, as Governor Blinder pointed out, a good thing that can happen to somebody who likes to talk about the business outlook is that things go the way that you expected them to go It is not usually that way Let me just point out, however, something that has not been stated--namely, that economic activity, income creation, and the like are still undergoing a suppressing effect from a reduction in inventory investment It is not overly clear in the data, but as you poke around here and there, it is pretty obvious that the pressure to reduce inventory-sales ratios is still out there and that the retrenchment or stabilization of lead times is exacerbating this process It is not sufficient merely to look at final sales, largely because inventory numbers are not passive There is a dynamic element involved in how inventories are managed, and by affecting the level of income they also affect the level of final sales So, we do not yet have a sense of how all this is coming out  There is evidence that the probability of continued weakness is receding This is not inconsistent with the comment made by several of you that the risks are on the down side It's just that the downside risks are not immediate; they arise as we get into 1996 and are the result to a certain extent of the fact that the business cycle is aging To whatever extent the accelerator works in the capital goods markets, one must presume that that will have some slowing effects And while I would have a minor quibble, which I will get to, with Governor Blinder's scenario of the federal funds rate being higher than where the long-term equilibrium should be--a view with which I generally agree and one that I think you have all commented on in the past--I would just caution that we should be a little careful about the use of the various models out there To repeat what I have said in the past to this Committee, those models give forecasts that are marginally laughable if the "add" factors are not judiciously applied Simulations of these models tend to employ a fixed level of "add" factors that become less and less usable as you go out farther, and we have to be careful about presuming that these simulations are any more accurate in capturing what is going on in the economy than "unattended" projections of these same models--unattended meaning that the add factors are just allowed to run by some mechanical process Those results are poor and the conclusions that we would get from simulations must of necessity be of the same nature However, having said that, I think it is correct to argue that we are probably at a real funds rate level that is higher than the long-term equilibrium I think the argument that Governor Blinder makes-- namely, that we get a progressive effect in that as the inflation rate falls the real funds rate rises even though the nominal rates holds stable, is probably an accurate description I just want to make certain that we don't go overboard and assume that the simulations we make are all that useful in this regard  I think this basically leads to the conclusion that it is probably unwise to move today essentially because of the budget debates that are involved I think it would be very difficult for us, no matter how craftily we constructed our rationale for moving, to  -35-    9/26/95  disassociate a move from the train wreck scenario There is, however, one issue about this that disturbs me, which Don Kohn raised We have to be careful not to allow monetary policy to be frozen in place by a process that could go on for months and months Policy should not remain frozen if we determine that the economy is in a state where we have to move I don't know whether that will be before or after November 15, but our next move certainly will be at a time when this Committee is meeting--either here or on a telephone conference-- because the move is probably going to be a sensitive issue So, I would suggest that it be done with the Committee's concurrence  As far as our decision today is concerned, I would conclude that policy should be unchanged and symmetrical In my judgment, it would be wrong to move today, and if we are to take action in the period ahead it should be in the context of considerable discussion about its implications and the decision should be made by the full Committee So, I put on the table "B" symmetrical Vice Chairman   President Minehan   President Moskow   President Forrestal   Governor Lindsey   President Boehne   President Melzer   President Stern   President Hoenig   President Parry   Governor Phillips   President Broaddus   Governor Kelley   President McTeer   President Jordan   Governor Yellen   Governor Blinder   We are reading from the same page as last time   Call the roll   Good morning, everyone Regrettably, this is Bob Forrestal's last outing I would be inclined to give him five or six votes for this meeting, but I don't think that authorization is statutorily available But spiritually we would like to do so We'll be saying more to Bob at lunch, and we look forward to seeing him there In the interim, would somebody like to move approval of the minutes of the meeting on September 26?   Without objection Peter Fisher, you have the floor for a while   Questions for Peter? I guess your report sounded pretty complete as anticipated Why don't you go on?   The Committee will remember that we will be covered either by Mexico or the US Treasury--by February, I believe   So, this is a relatively safe activity unless, of course, you know who or what doesn't pay! [Laughter]  SPEAKER(?) So move   It has been moved Is it seconded?  SPEAKER(?) Second   All in favor say "aye"  SEVERAL "Aye"   The "ayes" have it Peter, continue    11/15/95   Questions for Peter?   Further questions for Peter? If not, is there a motion to renew the swap agreements that mature in December?   Second?  SPEAKER(?) Second   All in favor say "aye"  SEVERAL "Aye"   The "ayes" have it   What is the market saying now, if anything, about a possible spike in the funds rate at year-end?   So, you can't really disassociate our actions from the spike   I assume that to a large extent the Japanese have been a factor in the year-end spike over the years Does that propensity exist in other currencies where the Japanese are heavily involved?   The year-end spike?   That is a year-end, December 31st spike?   Can we infer what the market forces are abstracting from our actions by looking at the potential spike characteristics in other currencies where Japanese banks are operating, like in London?   Okay I don't want to press that; I don't think it's a big deal I am just curious Other questions for Peter? President Minehan   My recollection is that we thought the arrangement was so routine and so inconsequential that it did not enter anybody's mind to raise it And, indeed, the way it came out was so distorted that I got numerous telephone calls as a result of a comment by Ralph Nader on the radio that we were bailing out the Japanese and that his listeners should call the Federal Reserve to complain When I finally talked to Senator D'Amato, who had raised all sorts of questions, he said he wished he had heard that explanation earlier It would have averted the excessive criticism that was voiced The problem existed because there was a mis- communication between us and Jim Leach; he didn't realize that he should not talk about this because that made it sound like a much bigger deal than it was   President Jordan   Peter, it strikes me that these swap line renewals, for which there basically is no longer any financial or economic purpose, have become exchanges of Christmas cards that serve to maintain our relationships with various central banks Even at a 3 percent inflation rate, these lines are gradually becoming de minimis If we wanted to get rid of them, there is a very simple way of doing it We would talk to the Germans and say "look, this makes no sense, let's cancel it" Once we cancel the Bundesbank arrangement, the rest of them will just go away because it will be perceived that if we do that to the Bundesbank then doing that to Norway, for example, will not be considered a withdrawal of Christmas card privileges So, I think it may be appropriate to do something at some time It's just not credible under any reasonable circumstances that these swap lines will be activated It's probably best not to have something on our books that has no operational significance I think we might consider acting on your suggestion of looking at this after the Mexican swap issue is settled It's conceivable that we ought to review this then and decide what we wish to do We may just decide to leave the swap line network alone and let it wither on the vine   Vice Chairman   Are you suggesting some formal or informal agreements--bilateral agreements in a sense?   Governor Blinder   Did those come back after the announcement?  -8-    11/15/95   Any further questions for Peter on this? President Hoenig   In fact, the purpose of our discussion with the Japanese was mainly to dispel any notion of subsidization If it were not for the fact that they are such a large presence in this banking system, there really would not be an issue But if they were to run into trouble, we could be dealing with very large numbers   It happens Further questions for Peter? Train wreck?   I missed three out of three! [Laughter]  SPEAKER(?) Move approval   Is there a second?  SPEAKER(?) Second   Without objection I hope there is nothing to ratify in the next segment!   Never! President Melzer  -9-    11/15/95   President Broaddus   An inadvertent overdraft?   It's illegal for us to grant an overdraft to the Treasury The only condition under which it exists is inadvertence I assume I have that right   Governor Blinder   Vice Chairman   Governor Lindsey   Implicit in your question is that when we conduct our operations, a certain number of securities are offered in the market and we choose to buy or not to buy As a practical matter, all securities are offered in the market at all times There are active prices on all of them Thus, it's not as though there is a limited block of securities out there that would disproportionately include defaulted securities As a practical matter, all securities in the market are offered in indeterminate amounts and that would presumably include all of these defaulted securities I think the critical issue implied in your question is that, if these defaulted securities are being priced at significant discounts and we buy them, we get criticized for buying US Treasuries at a discount If we don't buy them, we get criticized for not buying them at a discount It's an impossible situation But I suspect that should this occur, it's going to be very fuzzy as to what is in the market, at what price, and who is selling what The question we have always had on the table implicitly is not whether or not we should do overnight RPs or something of that nature It is whether we should make direct purchases and inventory the securities in the System portfolio The implication of not doing it is that we would resell them in the market, which raises even more interesting questions It's a question of whether we do a pass on defaulted securities I suspect that has a lot of implications that raise some technical questions, as Peter is suggesting President Minehan   The next meeting is December 19th and for those of you who can make it, we adjourn for lunch to honor our departing colleague  END OF MEETING       Any further questions for Peter on this issue? If not, let's move to Mike Prell and the staff report on the economy   Questions for Mike? President Parry   On the CPI, what do the numbers look like with an additional decimal point?   President Jordan   But they aren't the only ones who care! [Laughter]   Governor Lindsey   Incidentally, is computer software a consumer durable good?   What actually is being sold is a disk or something that is hard  -17-    11/15/95   Governor Blinder   Net?   That has been going up   President Minehan   Governor Blinder raised the question before the meeting as to which week the unemployment rate survey will be taking place Since the 12th is on a Sunday, do they look at the previous week or this week?   Any further questions from anyone? If not, who would like to start the roundtable? President Hoenig  -20-    11/15/95   President Forrestal   President Parry   President Jordan   President Boehne   President Moskow   President Stern   President Minehan   Did he say that or is it our estimate?   President Broaddus   Governor Lindsey   President Melzer   President McTeer   Vice Chairman   Governor Kelley   Governor Phillips   Governor Blinder   In 1987 dollars?   The transcript will be visible five years from now   Governor Yellen  -40-    11/15/95   Thank you very much I hope coffee is there  [Coffee break]  -42-    11/15/95   Mr Kohn   What happens to your Taylor chart if you extend it back before 1987?   How does it look before the 1980s?   John used to work for me in the private sector and maybe he read my mind better than I do Questions for Don?   Further questions for Don? If not, let me start off Frankly, I didn't find the roundtable particularly surprising It had pretty much the mixed flavor of what is going on in the country District by District In retrospect, the strength in the third quarter was not all that surprising considering that the economy was coming off a very weak set of developments after the early weeks of this year As you will recall, we had particularly serious concerns about the adjustments that were going on in inventories that  -44-    11/15/95  we felt could-conceivably tilt the economy into a decline Indeed, there was one meeting which I found somewhat distressing back in July where the general tone of our discussion was that all the risks were on the down side even though virtually everyone was projecting moderate growth One got the impression that if we had a choice of a second opinion on the economy, it clearly would have been down That was a time when, as I recall, we were getting very severe contractions in steel markets, industrial prices were weakening, inventories were backing up in a number of areas of the economy, and it was only as we worked our way through the probabilities that we concluded that we were moving beyond the point of the maximum risk of a recession Under those conditions, I think we would expect to get a "pop" in the economy when the downside pressures begin to ease This occurs in the markets generally, and I think it occurs in the economy I don't think that surge should be viewed as a change in trend, and indeed the more recent indications, as a number of members have noted, are that the economy at this stage can best be described, at least temporarily, in terms of its sogginess The economy is not deteriorating, but it clearly has lost a good deal of the momentum that it had during the summer It is, however, difficult to make very much of that because as best I can see the evidence does suggest that the economy is still undergoing some inventory correction It is still coming off a fairly weak motor vehicles sales pattern A crucial issue at this stage relates to what is going to be happening to Christmas sales in terms of setting the tone, if I may put it that way, for the trend in retail markets We need to remember that sales in November and especially in December have a disproportionate effect on fourth-quarter consumption expenditures Such expenditures in the fourth quarter are not a simple average of seasonally adjusted October, November, and December because the monthly seasonals for those months differ so dramatically Certain items obviously will account for a very substantial part of the quarterly total in a several-week period just before Christmas I don't want to overemphasize that, but I think the point that is implicit in the Greenbook--that there is a likelihood of a significant recovery in November and December--is still on the table Indeed, the early data are at least suggesting that Christmas sales are doing a little better  The major problem that we have so far as policy is concerned is that while the economy seems to be as close to middle ground as one ever sees it, it's not clear which way it is going In that regard, no change today strikes me as the most appropriate response, and I will get to the "train wreck" issue in a minute What I think is unclear at this stage is what we will be wishing to do at the December meeting if this economy continues to be as soft as it is As I indicated previously, I think that at some point we should be looking toward a somewhat lower real funds rate in 1996 Whether we will get there in part in December or wait until later, I don't have any particular notion But I do agree with the Greenbook that, if the economy is coming back and we are getting anywhere near the numbers in the Greenbook forecast, at that level of activity we probably ought to be quite cautious in how we move  There is one important issue with respect to the budget negotiations that I think we have to keep in mind If we lock ourselves into a "no change" position pending what happens in those negotiations, we could find ourselves sitting and doing nothing as the economy is changing and the markets are changing while the Congress  -45-    11/15/95  and the President continue to diddle on this issue We have argued in the past, and I think quite correctly, that it has never been appropriate for the Federal Reserve to "make a deal" with the Congress or the Administration to take some action if a budget is produced and irrespective of whether it is credible or not credible I think we all have agreed, as best I can judge, that the response that we make is to the markets If the markets believe that the budget deal is credible, long-term rates will come down and we will get an abnormality in the term structure of rates if short-term rates remain unchanged So the pressures on us to ease policy would come from the markets and the term structure, not from the budget deal The market is what would induce us to move Conversely, if the economy is softening, or indeed strengthening, the mere fact that the negotiations are under way should not be all that relevant other than what conceivably could happen should be part of our outlook The mere fact of negotiations should not induce us to take action because I think that could turn out to be very unfortunate monetary policy  I would therefore suggest that while it is terribly important to have the members' judgments about what the negotiations are going to produce, I don't think that should be an overriding issue with respect to what we do or what we do not do Incidently, with the outlook as mixed as it is, I would not rule out a surprising acceleration in this expansion There is nothing in this outlook that is undermining the structure of the economy So it would not be surprising, as Governor Kelley indicated, that if no adverse events occur this expansion could suddenly take off Profit margins still seem to be reasonably stable The order pattern and some of the high- tech industries are really quite impressive We do not yet know how long this malaise, if you will excuse the expression, in the industrial area is going to continue In the steel industry, despite the significant declines in steel sheet prices, the order patterns are looking better Fairly recently, US Steel has been reporting a much better outlook So, I think this is a two-sided issue We really are not going to get a good fix on the industrial sector for a while And I am not certain that it matters all that much because the economy does not appear to be threatened at this stage, and the urgency of moving quickly one way or the other is not there I suspect that the latest CPI is probably an aberration We don't know that for sure, but the evidence of restrained unit costs and the existing high profit margins do not suggest a weakening economy This is despite, as the Vice Chairman says, the fact that the expansion is "long in the tooth" and what we ordinarily would expect of an aging expansion This economy does not have the geriatric characteristics that one would expect of an economy that is six or seven months beyond the average length of the post-World War II expansions It doesn't look that way and it doesn't feel that way Nonetheless, I think what we have to be aware of is that if this economy fails to pick up and continues to be soggy into the next meeting, the evidence in favor of a move at that time would probably become more compelling than it is today  At this point, I would recommend that we do nothing and hope that an unchanged policy turns out to be where we can be for quite a while, as the Greenbook assumes I am agnostic, frankly, on whether we should have a symmetric or an asymmetric directive, and I would very much appreciate that those of you who agree with "B" also stipulate where you think the intermeeting symmetry ought to be Those who lean toward a change at some point would, of course, favor  -46-    11/15/95  asymmetry in one direction or the other So, that is my recommendation for this meeting Who would like to comment? President Forrestal   I said "five"   President Hoenig   President Broaddus   President Minehan   Something is going to have to give at some point   What may happen is that we may begin to get a piecemeal deal Instead of a full blown agreement it may come piece-by-piece-by-piece   Governor Blinder   President Boehne   President Parry   President Stern   President Moskow   Governor Kelley   Governor Lindsey   Less than forever is better   President Melzer   Governor Phillips   President McTeer   The loquaciousness of this group is truly remarkable! Vice Chairman   President Jordan   Governor Yellen   As I read it, the modal value of this group's preferences is marginally "B" symmetric That's where I sense it to be and I will propose that sort of directive for a vote   Call the roll   On behalf of all of us, I want to welcome Jack Guynn   Jack is a veteran of the Fed who needs no introduction  To start off, would somebody like to move the minutes for the November 15 meeting?   Without objection We need acceptance of the Report of Examination of the System Open Market Account It has been distributed Any questions? If not, would somebody like to move it?  SEVERAL So move   Without objection I now call on Peter Fisher   Questions? Yes, Larry   Further questions for Peter? Cathy   President Melzer   The answer is "yes"   I think we should first discuss it amongst ourselves here before we decide to involve anyone else The ideal solution to this obviously anachronistic setup is not necessarily to abandon all such arrangements because they are being employed as a means of linking us with other central banks, but to replace them with something that reflects more relevant considerations in the market We would not expand the swap arrangements, but we would do something different to maintain our relationships    12/19/95  internationally and bring this process up to the latter part of the 20th century rather than the middle part   I am not as worried as you are about the independence question, but I certainly agree that what we have serves no economic or financial purpose of which I am aware President Broaddus   Any further questions for either gentleman?   Is there a second?  SEVERAL Second   Without objection Would you like to continue on, Peter?   Questions for Peter?   How many 32nds was that down?   (Consulting a pocket electronic market monitor) The truth is the markets are down 10/32 The cash market for the long bond is at 622 percent   With all the technology we have in this room, I can't have a little old gadget?   Sorry Further questions for Peter?    12/19/95   Is there a second?   The next meeting is January 30-31, 1996, and I now move to adjourn  END OF MEETING  -48-       Without objection Let's move on to the staff reports Mr Prell   Questions? Vice Chairman   If there are no questions--yes, President Moskow   Further questions for Mike? If not, Vice Chairman, do you want to start off?   Governor Lindsey   That includes taxes?   But adjusted gross income includes taxes   It says that on your table I beg your pardon   Let me note just another channel that may or may not be relevant Higher stock market values tend to be associated at a micro level with higher capital investment within a firm That increase in capital investment spills through into disposable income and could have an impact that way So, it is quite conceivable that, despite your very interesting appraisal, there is a channel that bypasses this and effectively impacts disposable personal income through all of these five categories to the extent that that is relevant Obviously implicit in any evaluation of stock market wealth going into consumption, one would have to trace to be sure that the level of capital investment is reflecting the stock market wealth creation   It does I am just saying that if that channel is working vigorously, you could reconcile both these data and the reduced form regression of the wealth effect on consumption   President Boehne  PRESIDENT BOEHNE Thank you, Mr Chairman The basic story in the Philadelphia District is essentially the same Mainly, the region is a laggard compared to the nation The outlook is for more of the same Much of the laggard effect is coming from Pennsylvania; Delaware and New Jersey compare more favorably to the nation On balance, the evidence from recent indicators is that the pace of growth in the District is slower now than it was several months ago Retail sales in particular reflect a cautious attitude on the part of consumers Retailers are still hopeful that the last week before Christmas will deliver them from an otherwise dismal season, but the discounting over this past weekend has been very heavy Employment growth is quite slow in the region, even in industries like manufacturing and construction where activity is expanding Attitudes --business attitudes in particular--are still generally positive about the outlook, but they appear to be somewhat more fluid They could resolidify on the more positive side or they could flow more to the pessimistic side depending on how policy and other developments unfold I have the sense that we are at one of those pivotal periods where people are less certain about where things are going and attitudes can flow either way  Turning to the national economy, most recent economic data suggest that the expansion is decelerating some from earlier months The extent of the deceleration is an open question It may be that the strength of the third quarter borrowed from the fourth quarter and that the underlying strength of the economy remains intact Or, it could mean that the underlying strength is beginning to wane On balance, my judgment is that the downside risk to the economy has risen some since we last met The possibility of more of an inventory overhang is higher now than a month or two ago The strength of exports is more open to question The economies of Canada, the UK, and Germany may be weaker than the forecasts suggest, not to mention Mexico or Japan While we can debate the consumer outlook, my sense is that if we are surprised, we will be surprised because consumption will be weaker rather than stronger Also, the case that US monetary policy may be inadvertently tighter is now more convincing in my judgment than it was several months ago, although that's a subject for later in the meeting  The outlook for inflation remains about as it has been, neither accelerating nor decelerating much during the next year or so Given that the economy is in a mature expansion phase, I think we need to remain alert to signs of accelerating inflation However, price pressures remain remarkably subdued   Thank you President Parry   President Minehan   Doesn't that create a moral hazard? [Laughter]   President Broaddus   President Melzer   President Stern   President Moskow   Thank you President McTeer   President Hoenig   President-elect Guynn  -21-    12/19/95   Governor Kelley   Governor Yellen   Governor Phillips   President Jordan   Governor Blinder   Let's break for coffee  [Coffee break]   Questions for Don?   Vice Chairman McDonough   President Broaddus   President Parry   Governor Lindsey   Governor Blinder   Any further questions for Don? If not, let me start off I will take a little more time than usual because despite the short-term budget turmoil and all sorts of churning in the economy, in concert with Don's endeavor to sketch out longer-term policy issues, I want to raise a broad hypothesis about where the economy is going over the longer term and what the underlying forces are While I have not seen Don's set of boxes before, I am sure you are going to fit me in one box after another as I go through this, but I hope you won't try to do it too readily! [Laughter]  You may recall that earlier this year I raised the issue of the extraordinary impact of accelerating technologies, largely silicon-based technologies, on the turnover of capital stock, the fairly dramatic decline in the average age of the stock, and the creation as a consequence of a high degree of insecurity for those  -35-    12/19/95  individuals in the labor markets who have to deal with continually changing technological apparatus One example that I think brings this development close to home, even though it is an unrealistic example, is how secretaries would feel if the location of the keys on their typewriters were changed every two years We are in effect doing that to the overall workforce  As I indicated in my remarks two or three meetings ago, we are getting as a consequence of this a very significant increase in the sense of job insecurity and indeed the trade-off between job insecurity and wage increases To my mind, this increasingly explains why wage patterns have been as restrained as they have been One extraordinary piece of recent evidence is an unprecedented number of labor contracts with five- or six-year maturities We never had a labor contract of more than three years' duration in the last 30 to 40 years, though I am certain that somebody can come up with an example of some quirk somewhere along the line As far back as I can recall, the maturity distribution of labor contracts in the BLS data was always cut off at three years The underlying technology changes that support this hypothesis really appear only once every century, or 50 years, or something like that as best I can judge, and many of you have been giving various examples that support this hypothesis, Gary Stern obviously being one  I think the accelerated capital turnover and the advancing technology are having, in addition to the labor market effect, a fairly pronounced impact on costs for different reasons Basically, the downsizing of products as a consequence of computer chip technologies has created, as you are all aware, a significant decline in implicit transportation costs We are producing very small products that are cheaper to move They also are cheaper to move across borders, and so we see them spreading around the world More importantly--and this is really a relatively recent phenomenon--is the dramatic effect of telecommunications technology in reducing the cost of communications A while back, The Economist had an article that was called, I think, "The Death of Distance" They were pointing out, as one readily observes, that we are gaining the ability to make telephone calls between Washington and London, for example, at the same cost as between Washington and Baltimore The reason is that increasingly as fiber-optic-related technologies and satellite communications evolve, the cost of adding 200 or 1,000 miles doesn't matter when you are going 22,000 miles up and 22,000 miles down That is why the Internet charges essentially flat fees for all subscribers, and connections can be made anywhere The reason is that distance doesn't change the underlying cost  What this has done is to create a major force for increasing labor specialization because it broadens the scope of what an individual or company can get involved in We are raising the old issues of comparative advantage and the division of labor out of the old Economics I textbooks In effect, as the downsized products have spread and the cost of communications has fallen, the globe has become increasingly smaller In the 1850s, a farm somewhere in the Midwest would have been a self-sufficient, fairly low productivity operation because there was no comparative advantage What we are now seeing is a tremendous move toward the proliferation of outsourcing, not only in the immediate area but ever increasingly around the globe What one would expect to see as this occurs--and indeed it is happening--is the  -36-    12/19/95  combination of rising capital efficiency and falling nominal unit labor costs In fact, that is happening by every measure we can look at  One may readily argue that this process has been going on in one way or another since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, but I think we are now seeing an acceleration of the process largely as a consequence of the type of technological change that is occurring I have been looking at business cycles since the late 1940s and have been aware of the various technological changes; there was just nothing like this earlier This is a new phenomenon, and it raises interesting questions as to whether in fact there is something more profoundly important going on in the longer run We usually dismiss that sort of development on the grounds that its effect on the short run is nominal I have a suspicion that in this period, unlike previous periods, we will find that the long-run, deep-seated forces are not so gradual as to be readily dismissed in any short-term economic evaluation I suspect that the evidence is increasingly emerging that there is something different going on, which we have not looked at for awhile  One would certainly assume that we would see this in the productivity data, but it is difficult to find it there In my judgment there are several reasons, the most important of which is that the data are lousy I think we have not correctly defined how to capture the value added in various industries, as I believe I have pointed out previously Looking at market values, we are not capitalizing various types of activities properly In the past, we looked at capital expenditures only as spending on a blast furnace or a steel rolling mill Now, improvement in the value of a firm is influenced by such factors as how much in-house training they have and what type That creates economic value in the stock-market sense, and we are not measuring it properly  Secondly, I suspect that we also may well be looking at the lag that Professor Paul David of Stanford has been talking about It relates to the question of why computer technology is not creating the productivity that we would expect to observe by looking at individual companies The reason is largely that the global infrastructure has not yet adjusted In a similar manner, we had electric motors coming into use in the late part of the 19th century, but they were put into a system whose infrastructure was built on minimizing costs for steam engines The technology of a steam-engine economy is fundamentally different from that of an electric-motor economy It wasn't until the construction of horizontal types of factory buildings in the 1920s that our manufacturing firms finally were able to take advantage of the synergies implicit in the electric dynamo and achieve fairly dramatic increases in productivity This showed up and correlated fairly directly with trends in unit motor use and secondary uses of electric motors, which I thought Professor David did a remarkably thorough job in evaluating  While the analogies are not exact, there is something extraordinarily obvious as we read through what he is saying and observe what is going on now Firms are putting tremendous efforts into computer technology A lot of it is wasted, as inevitably it must be, and we still have not restructured vast parts of the way we do business to fit a fundamentally new technology It is going to  -37-    12/19/95  take a long while to do that It is unclear exactly how that fits into our policy process But I think it is important to put this point on the table, and I present this as a hypothesis since it is something that we will not be sure is the appropriate assessment of our changing world for probably five to ten years But the point that Don Kohn has been raising and we have just been discussing is very critical to what we are doing  Let me suggest to you what the recent short-term evidence appears to be that is consistent with this hypothesis Ultimately, when we have a hypothesis, the facts either fit it or they don't The wage pattern that I mentioned is clearly consistent with it It also has been mentioned here, I think quite importantly, that breaking the back of the inflationary surge last year and early this year was a lot easier in retrospect than it should have been You may recall that the markets had federal funds rates projected to the moon a year ago The reason they did is not because they were not thoughtful The reason is that previous relationships implicitly called for substantial increases in the federal funds rate to restrain and contain the burgeoning inflationary pressures that we were looking at  As has been mentioned many times, the CPI is currently running under expectations or forecasts My suspicion is--and this is a benevolent outlook in Don's context--that we are going to find that the inflation rate will continue to come in below expectations I think this process is not about to come to an immediate end, although I will suggest in a minute why it is not a permanent state of the world that would allow central banks to pack up and go home I found the charts on long-term inflation expectations in the Greenbook, Part II, really quite startling because they suddenly dip fairly sharply with the emergence of a general awareness that we are in a late stage of a business cycle period that has not created the inflationary problems that previously have occurred in the post-World War II period  The sharp decline in long-term yields has struck me as quite extraordinary I know of no one who forecast that with any degree of confidence Despite the Treasury, we are getting issues of 100-year bonds, and that occurs only infrequently The last time it happened was in 1993 Before that, I think it was the turn of the century That in effect is saying that there are people out there who are willing to take low yields for 100 years The fact that some borrowers are issuing these bonds is terrific Until you get somebody dumb enough to buy them, that is terrific But the point is that they are selling, although they may not sell in the future because of the new tax concerns  Finally, it is very difficult to find typical inflationary forces anywhere in the world If this phenomenon is correct, it has to be worldwide What we are observing is 1 to 2 percent inflation in Europe, and none to speak of in some areas where inflation really should be at a high level What has surprised me most of all very recently is that the CPI inflation rate in Argentina was 17 percent for the last 12 months, and that was not per month Even the outside inflationary processes are being contained Something different is going on I don't deny, as has been argued here, that central banks have been a factor in this I suggest to you that we are probably necessary conditions for this state of affairs to persist But I  -38-    12/19/95  would suspect that if we did not have these technological changes going on, our job and that of our counterparts abroad would have been materially more difficult  I certainly can agree that my hypothesis is the statistical equivalent of a falling NAIRU That's all fine and good, but merely saying that the NAIRU has fallen, which is what we tend to do, is not very helpful That's because whenever we miss the inflation forecast, we say the NAIRU fell We have to understand what it is that is causing this I am always uncomfortable with a national NAIRU number because I always look at local NAIRUs I do not think there is the same slope on inflationary expectations across local areas I am a little dubious of the national number, but I would grant that there is a fairly impressive statistical relationship between inflation and the national NAIRU What I am saying is that if this hypothesis is correct, we are looking at a significantly different set of inflation pressures in the world economy I keep mentioning the word "if" because it is a hypothesis It is one that I have been thinking about for over a year The evidence continues to come in and suggest that there is something going on here If it is true, then clearly we can reach price stability with real interest rates lower than where they are now I do not know where this hypothesis fits in Don's chart, but it is in the most benevolent square   Yes, the positive supply shock square However, before I go too far, let me repeat what I said when I first raised this issue about worker insecurity and wages If at a fixed degree of job insecurity there is an associated rise in real wages, then at a higher level of job insecurity we would get the same trend at a lower level of real wages What I think is happening to us now is that we are going from this higher level of insecurity and tilting down into a lower level The transition period, by definition, temporarily creates a much slower rate of change, but ultimately we get back to a new level with a rising trend The same thing occurs when we look at capital efficiency or this type of hypothesis It is a transitional issue, and it is not one that puts us in a permanent state of noninflation What we do not know is where the fulcrum of this process is, whether it is out there six months or six years The Paul David argument would say that it is out there six years I don't feel that confident about it, but clearly this article, which incidentally was written in 1989, has turned out to be extraordinarily prescient as to what has occurred  Getting down to the mundane question of where that leaves us for policy today, as a number of you have maintained, falling inflation expectations have increased the real funds rate since July Indeed, there is a question as to whether in fact the rate is higher now in real terms than it was when the nominal rate was at 6 percent It is a close call as to whether it is higher, but it is not something that one readily rules out I know there is a sense of strength implicit in the Greenbook I have difficulty with it To me, the economy has more of a feel of driving with the parking brake partially engaged One gets the sense that the economy is not breaking out as I thought it might last summer That suggests to me that the upside potential in this economy is limited I come to the conclusion, which    12/19/95  should not come as a surprise, that we rightfully should be moving the funds rate lower  What are the risks? I am not worried about product price inflation if for no other reason than I think that the longer term is helpful But I am a little concerned that the behavior of inventories has not been as benevolent as I would have expected I agree with Mike Prell; I do not think that one can readily see real overhangs except in motor vehicles But we are not down to the slimmed pace that I felt we might have reached by now, and it is making me a little uncomfortable So, I am not concerned about moving lower in the context of worrying about reigniting product inflationary forces I think the probability of that is very low and frankly 25 basis points is not in that regard a big deal The real danger is that we are at the edge of a bond and stock bubble Yesterday's market clearly helped, but it is not going to last very long The sharp runup in stock prices is very heavily determined by the climb in long-term bond prices, but not fully There has been some not insignificant decline in real equity premiums, and even though we are still well above the dangerous levels of October 1987 prior to the stock market crash, we are in the lower ranges so to speak It would not take terribly much to drive us through That is the reason why, if we are perceived to be easing policy, it is conceivable that we could foster further problems in that regard Fortunately, I think we may be close to at least some temporary peak in stock prices if for no other reason than that markets do not go straight up indefinitely, and the Dow Jones Industrial average has been going literally straight up  I have no problem with moving down now knowing that, if the economy picks up, we have a quite significant amount of time to move back up again and to tighten to whatever extent we think might be required I think nonetheless that we have to be a little careful about being too aggressive I would be uncomfortable with 50 basis points unless I knew for certain that the hypothesis that I have laid out here today were really true In fact, if somebody guaranteed it to me, I think we could safely go down 100 basis points  I would go 25 basis points now with no change in the discount rate It is conceivable that we may have to go lower I do not think that we have to make that judgment, and indeed it is not a judgment that I think it is appropriate for us to make at this time The reason that moving down more than 25 basis points would be a big deal is that we would then raise the discount rate question I think that requires a great deal more confidence that inflation is contained I would go symmetrical if we move down 25 basis points I would recommend that the action be accompanied by a statement that emphasized that the reason for the action would largely be the behavior of inflation For example if we were to do it, I would recommend that the operative paragraph of our press statement say something like "Inflation has been somewhat more favorable than anticipated since the last easing of monetary policy in July, and this result along with an associated moderation in inflation expectations warrants a modest easing in monetary conditions"  I would eschew two issues in the press release One, I would not say anything that has to do with the economy because I do not think the economy is what is relevant here I may not feel as strongly positive about the economic outlook as the Greenbook, but  -40-    12/19/95  there is no real evidence here of cumulative deterioration I think this is basically a long-term inflation adjustment process in which we are trying to set the real funds rate at the point where we can move toward price stability in a coherent way Secondly, I would not like to see the word "budget" mentioned in the release because there has been much too much said about our basically rewarding good budget actions and penalizing bad budget actions We are not in that business nor can we nor should we be in such a business Nonstatement of any budget considerations will, I think, speak more loudly than anything we could say In any event, I have run out of things to discuss, and that is my recommendation at the moment I call on President Minehan   Vice Chairman   Governor Blinder   Anything on symmetry?   President Melzer   President Broaddus   Governor Lindsey   President Stern   President Moskow   President Parry   Governor Phillips   Governor Kelley   Governor Yellen   President McTeer   President Hoenig   President-elect Guynn   President Jordan   President Boehne   Thank you There is a consensus for a 25 basis point decline in the funds rate and a symmetric directive   Call the roll   Good morning, everybody Some of us are slightly blurry-eyed, which is understandable I appreciate your coming somewhat earlier Would somebody like to move the minutes of the January 30-31 meeting?  SPEAKER(?) Move approval   Without objection Mr Fisher   Questions for Peter? If not, would somebody like to move to ratify his transactions since the last meeting?   The next meeting is on May 21 We took out an hour's worth of insurance this morning [Laughter] It turned out that we did not need it I don't know whether you consider that too high or too low a price [Laughter]   Thank you all for trying to confine your remarks to a shorter time frame than usual We probably will be going up to the Hill in about an hour and we'll see what happens there In the interim, we have lunch scheduled at 1130 Joe Coyne is going to announce at 1130, 1145, or something like that we have nothing to announce Obviously, until then our decision is not public information  END OF MEETING  -28-       Without objection, thank you Mr Prell   With respect to your last remark, has the decline in cattle prices been, as best you can judge, essentially a reaction to the increased feed costs that have crushed margins or is there a broader cattle supply cycle involved here? Do we know the answer to that?   No, I am referring to the fact that cattle prices have been falling in the face of rapidly rising corn and soybean meal costs, for example, and ranch margins have been coming down quite appreciably The question I am trying to get at is whether the weakness in cattle prices is the result of premature unloading of herds, which in the past has often been the determining factor in such price declines   So a pickup in meat prices, should it occur, is still quite some time away?   Do you have any mad cows in your District?   President Parry   President Jordan   It is a simultaneously determined system   It means that somebody's "add factor" changed very substantially   But they did There were significant changes in nominal GDP   Any further questions?   Any further questions? If not, would somebody like to start the roundtable? President Parry   Thank you President Broaddus   President Boehne   President Hoenig    3/26/96   President McTeer   President Minehan   President Moskow  -10-    3/26/96   President Guynn   President Stern   President Melzer   Vice Chairman   Governor Kelley   Governor Yellen   Governor Phillips   President Jordan   Governor Lindsey   Thank you Coffee should be out there Would someone take a quick look and see whether it is there?   Corporate planning is less than adequate [Laughter] Don Kohn   Thank you Why don't we break for coffee?  [Coffee break]   Let me get started In a period like this, it may be a good idea to review history to see how we got to where we are At the moment, the economy might be described by an electrocardiogram that does not say the economy is dead but indicates it is functioning in a way that suggests something is going to move-- as a number of you, including Governors Kelley and Lindsey, have stated The one thing that is reasonably certain is that the outlook depicted by the electrocardiogram in the Greenbook is very unlikely to prevail The key questions are In which direction is the economy going and how is it going to get there? A critical element in this outlook is the interplay of asset values, specifically bond and stock values, and inventory changes What is really quite extraordinary about this period is that despite what we continue to envisage as an increasingly service-related economy and one where business firms are increasingly getting control over their inventories, inventory investment has been the most volatile element and the greatest determinant of economic change in the last two or three years  In the early part of the 1990s, as firms finally were technologically capable of moving toward just-in-time inventory management, inventory-sales ratios moved down precipitously You may recall that in the latter part of 1993 one of the reasons we began to get a little concerned about the upturn and potential strength of the economic recovery was that inventory-sales ratios were getting to a point that seemed to be close to bottom Obviously, the arithmetic of a change from a declining inventory-sales ratio to a flat ratio is a "pop" in inventory investment Indeed, it "popped" more than I believe we had expected, creating a significant surge in economic activity throughout 1994 Presumably through the normal multiplier mechanisms, the pickup in inventory investment induced enough income and PCE to create fairly strong economic growth A big pickup in profit margins was superimposed on that, which in turn fostered growth  -22-    3/26/96  in the capital goods markets until we ran into the wall in early 1995 when voluntary inventory accumulation temporarily turned involuntary Final demand slowed appreciably, and you may recall that in June, or maybe slightly earlier, we were terribly concerned about whether the economy was on the edge of a recession The economy worked its way through that, but inventory investment continued to fall throughout 1995 as business firms endeavored to restore some degree of normality  In the early months of 1996, were it not for the weather problems that dominated a substantial part of our economy, estimated at as much as one-third, plus the government shutdowns, we probably would have begun to see some economic strength after the retardation in economic growth that the inventory adjustment engendered all through 1995 The experience of California, where weather was not much of a problem, suggests that quite possibly the turn occurred at the beginning of the year rather than in February as shows up in a lot of our data At the moment, we can look back and ask ourselves why the economy held up, or as Ed Boehne put it, was so resilient through all of this period I think the answer is largely that we had a very substantial increase in stock and bond market prices There has clearly been a wealth effect here As in previous periods, it was quite likely that the turn in inventory investment could have tilted the economy into a recession, considering that the expansion is more than five years "long in the tooth" so to speak I think the equity and bond markets were especially helpful in creating a degree of resilience that has carried the expansion into 1996  The economy is likely to be stronger rather than weaker in the period immediately ahead if for no other reason than that it will be getting some stimulus from the GM strike The strike in retrospect may turn out to be somewhat fortuitous in that the bulk of excess motor vehicle inventories was held by General Motors While I don't know the configuration of the inventory decline in terms of particular models, because invariably such declines are not uniform nor are they the same as a voluntary decline, clearly there has been some signifi- cant pressure on the economy that will be reversed as we move into April and May The comments around this table suggest that the members regard the risks to the economy as being as close to balance as one has seen for quite a while In looking back at the performance of the economy in this period, I must say it was the most probable result that we could have anticipated, but attaining that outcome was fraught with potential uncertainties  I disagree with Tom Melzer's characterization of what taking out monetary policy insurance means As I see it, taking out insur- ance means that we are adjusting policy on the basis of a risk to the forecast that has a low probability of occurring In fact, that is the basis for all insurance We take out fire insurance because we forecast that there is some small probability of fire I don't think we take out monetary policy insurance when we think that the economic trend has changed fundamentally A fundamental change in our forecast calls for a policy response in the appropriate direction, whereas I think an insurance takeout is done largely on the basis of a forecast of something that we do not expect to occur The fact that it did not happen in this case, or at least it has not happened yet, is a desirable outcome I would be very much disturbed if it were the other way around You can look at insurance any way you want I like to take out insurance I have a lot of personal insurance I have  -23-    3/26/96  never collected on any of it, and I must say that I am delighted [Laughter] And I hope that that is exactly what we will say later with respect to what we have been doing   Let's not get into insurance policies! [Laughter] More generally, to confront the problems that we face, we have to ask ourselves what can change Two issues have surfaced in the discussion around this table that, I think, are quite to the point One is whether we are going to be looking at increased labor militancy The answer is that increased militancy is more likely than not, if for no other reason than that we cannot expect the current situation to continue As I indicated maybe 6 or 9 months ago when I hypothesized that job insecurity was an explanation for why wage inflation has been subdued, there is a limit to this process at which point it begins to go back to normal It may well be that political issues that have been raised during the presidential primary campaign plus the General Motors' strike are the first signs that the limit has been reached It is too early to say, and I don't think we have any definitive data to suggest, that the wage-job security tradeoff has changed, but I believe we are getting the first indications that it may  The second and more disturbing issue is the question of the stock market The market is probably high by any objective measure that we can find We need a lot of different assumptions to argue that it will stay there It is being driven largely by long-term interest rates, but there is more to it than that Earnings are still coming in above expectations This is the Wall Street evaluation It's what a series of analysts expect earnings to be company-by- company Those numbers have been coming in better than expected for quite a while, although the margin is now changing very materially There is increasing evidence that profit margins, after showing some significant strength, are finally beginning to soften somewhat, as Mike Prell indicated with his markup ratio analysis This obviously has significant implications for the capital goods markets at some point and far more impact with respect to the question of what stock prices are going to do  What I find particularly bothersome is that history suggests more often than not that stock prices remain high for a protracted period of time when they should not; stock prices may just be waiting for us to move rates up before they go down We probably are going to find ourselves in that position one way or another at some point But I do think we have to be aware of the fact that this may be unlike 1987 when the stock market decline essentially took out virtually all of the overheat, if I may put it that way, in the economy, increased the saving rate about a full percentage point, and barely affected economic growth In a sense, it went through fat and never quite hit muscle There is very little fat left in the economic system at this stage If we get a very significant contraction in stock prices, I think it will have a quite measurable wealth effect Therefore, it is very difficult to look into the future and merely presume that 1996 and 1997 will produce a flat electrocardiogram It is probably the best forecast and the most likely outlook simply because it is difficult to figure out where the extremes are But one thing that we  -24    3/26/96  can forecast is that we probably are going to be surprised by more rather than less volatility in the economy I do not know in which direction the economy will be going, though ultimately it will go down It will go down basically because if we seriously believe, as I think every one of us has said around this table, that the business cycle is not dead, recession is going to look us in the eye at some point We do not know when, but I think one of the most extraordinarily difficult periods for monetary policy lies somewhere ahead  For the moment, listening to the consensus on the economic outlook and the balance of risks, I would subscribe, and I hope the rest of you will also, to doing nothing today This is what the market largely expects because they are looking at the same data that we are Thank you   An obvious symmetry Vice Chairman   President Parry   President Melzer   President Broaddus   President Boehne   President Minehan   President McTeer   President Stern   Governor Lindsey   President Moskow   President Jordan   Governor Phillips   Governor Yellen   Governor Kelley   President Guynn   President Hoenig   Would you read the symmetric directive?   Would you call the roll?   Good morning, everyone First, I would like to acknowledge the fact that this is the first meeting for First Vice President LeGrand Rives of the St Louis Bank, Senior Vice President Robert Eisenbeis of the Atlanta Bank, and Pauline Chen of the New York Desk I would like to welcome all of you and request that the rest of us approve the minutes of the March 26 meeting   Without objection Peter Fisher   Questions for Peter? If not, would somebody like to move ratification of the Domestic Desk operations?   We will now return to Don Kohn's query Do you just want to give a short summary so people can respond to it?   Can I just amend that slightly? I think you also would want the 1997 forecast on the same basis   What I am trying to get at is that I don't think we want a 1998 number unless it reflects a desired outcome achieved through an appropriate policy If you have a 1998 number that is the result of your individual policy, it also would be useful to have a forecast of 1996, 1997, 1998 on the same basis That would highlight the difference between the way we normally have been doing these projections and what your policy would produce   They are assumptions of what the members think monetary policy will be, not what they would like it to be   How would you differentiate between the current projection and the new one?   That's clear enough   President Jordan   I think the storm is really moving in Maybe it would be wise for us to continue this meeting after lunch We will still be in the meeting until we finish this agenda item Let us take a temporary break so that everyone can get lunch Then, when everyone is back, we will continue our discussion  [Lunch break]   President Melzer   Vice Chairman   Are you suggesting 1996 and 1997 and 2000?   What I am trying to say is that if you are looking for an extended period what you want to do is to eliminate part of the projection   So it could be 1996, 1997, 1999 if you wanted to do it that way   I don't know how you get from your last forecast to your ultimate goal, but it's left a blank because that is where the most difficult transition questions are, and at this point it would obscure the ultimate goal to fill in that blank   I did? [Laughter] President Hoenig   Governor Lindsey   Governor Yellen  -44-    5/21/96   Governor Kelley   President Moskow   President Stern   President Parry   Would anyone else like to add to this discussion?   President Minehan  -46-    5/21/96   Governor Phillips   President Parry   President Boehne   Does anyone have anything to add? President McTeer   That was the definitive end-of-meeting remark! I'll remind you that our next meeting is on July 2 and 3 and if events require, we will meet sooner by telephone communication Hopefully, at some point we will have a broader telecommunications capability, but at the moment we are limited to telephone communications   Does anybody have a problem with 100 pm? [Secretary's note No member indicated a scheduling conflict]   Let's now end this meeting  END OF MEETING  -48-       Without objection I will call on Messrs Prell and Truman at what has to be the earliest possible time that this has occurred   You always throw a monkey wrench into the works!   Questions for either gentleman?   What is the timeframe that you assume exists between the increase in grain prices and its effects on poultry, hog, and cattle prices? I will assume that it is in that order of lead times   Can't you tell from the futures prices?   Don't they tell you what average lead times are or can be assumed to be?   That is what I was going to say--that you can make an assumption   Governor Lindsey  Mr LINDSEY Mike, my first question is, do we have any evidence yet on how households have financed higher gasoline prices? The increases per month amount to about $10 per car or $20 per household Is that coming out of savings or out of other consumption?   President Moskow   Isn't that inflationary effect related only to feed grain prices? The amount of wheat that is used for feed grains is very small, and as we know breakfast cereal prices went down as the price of wheat went up   Except for its impact on the export markets, wheat has essentially become disassociated from the rest of the economy, whereas corn is a major input into the food chain-- actually, corn, soybeans, and soybean meal Wheat used to be a key factor twenty or thirty years ago, but it isn't any more   It's probably good for the farm incomes of our wheat growers when they produce a crop, but it isn't good for manufacturers of combines! President Stern   President Moskow, I'm sorry, I interrupted you Did you have a follow-up?   President Minehan   I think we should emphasize what you said, Mike, only if the relationship between the unemployment rate and the potential rate of operations of the economy as a whole were very tight The data show that that is not the case That's because the measurement problems that we have in all these statistics are fairly large and even if we had an exact or very tight relationship the data    5/21/96  are going to be wrong So, we have to try to average through the fog, and I think the latter is a little more dense than it used to be   Governor Lindsey   What it may suggest is that manufacturers appear to keep their books internally consistent on the income and the product sides When we look at services, however, what we see are very considerable anomalies a fairly small increase in productivity and reasonably slow nominal output growth, but a significant increase in profitability and therefore implicitly an appreciable rise in margins The notion that has evolved here is that, somehow or other, either significant nominal GDP is missing from the nonmanufacturing area or, because of the productivity data, price levels are exaggerated, as indeed they almost surely are One sees, for example, that over a protracted period the price of medical services in the CPI has gone up much faster than average hourly earnings and I suspect, though I haven't seen the data, much faster than the ECI for medical services This suggests that real income has fallen dramatically in that area I shouldn't say that; it's not real income which suggests that; it's the relationship between productivity and price or some wage-price that does not seem to be squaring at all There seems to be a major anomaly in the structure of the GDP which for the first time may be on the income side Perhaps with additional    5/21/96  data five years from now we will have a more accurate appraisal of what has been going on Ted just nodded this way! [Laughter]   I can measure his approval rating in the arc of his nod! [Laughter] Any further questions?   If you had said that at the beginning, I would not have filibustered as much as I did Who would like to start the Committee's discussion? President Parry   President Moskow   President McTeer   President Minehan   President Guynn   President Hoenig   President Boehne   President Broaddus   Isn't that more the result of a shift away from the expectation that they are going lower?   If you look at the actual pattern of forward rates, going from overnight out to a couple of years, what happens is that if the long-term rate moves the way you said, the other rates move back up According to the analysis in the Bluebook, it is difficult to determine whether the term structure at this stage is reflecting anything more than liquidity demand So, isn't what is involved fundamentally an upward shift in the yield curve as distinct from a shift up in yields?   I agree with that I am just saying that it is very difficult to differentiate the extent of the rise from what we think we know about the liquidity premium It is probably right that it is slightly more than the latter, but the major shift has to be coming up from the bottom   That is an interesting hypothesis, but I think you would have a tough time debating it   That is definite but that conclusion can arise independently of the yield curve! Let me say, parenthetically, that Don Kohn said to me the other day that these meetings were getting duller and duller and I was worried that he might fall asleep, so I tried to liven things up a bit [Laughter]   President Melzer   President Stern   Governor Phillips   Governor Kelley   Governor Yellen   Thank you Vice Chairman   It might have stirred up a storm! President Jordan   It is already May 21!   Governor Lindsey   Coffee is available Shall we break?  [Coffee break]   Mr Kohn   Is the question whether we respond to that forecast horizon issue now or at a later time?   Why don't we do that? Why don't we complete the near-term policy discussion and then come back to that issue and conceivably continue to discuss it during the lunch period if that turns out to be necessary   Any questions for Don? Clear as always I think this is indeed a watershed period, as Governor Kelley mentioned As I listened to the members' comments relating the current situation to the Greenbook forecast and the staff briefings, I came to a few conclusions that I hope characterize the substance of what we have been discussing My impression is that if I fully believed the outlook in the Greenbook and indeed expected it to materialize as projected, I would feel that we ought to be tightening policy sooner rather than later The basic reason is that I find the federal funds rate assumption in the Greenbook inconsistent with the staff outlook So, the key question that I envisage is essentially whether the internal construction of the forecast as postulated by the Greenbook is consistent with the world that I believe is evolving and to which we must adjust  Let me say, first, that I think the Greenbook is projecting relatively modest growth in real economic activity and that the risks to that projection are probably on the up side I say that because the staff is projecting a fairly dramatic slowing in the growth of final demand, and one can scarcely conclude that the projected inventory investment is other than subdued We have seen rather telling instances in the past when business firms have liquidated inventories to the point of some tightness As they endeavored to restore some inventory balances, lead times immediately began to stretch out on deliveries and desired safety stocks started to expand The result has been a fairly substantial acceleration in inventory investment that has fed back to the income side and created an  -28-    5/21/96  economic growth rate that is substantially greater than that in the Greenbook forecast Implicit in this Greenbook forecast of real GDP is a degree--I could say a new form--of inventory response in the economy that certainly is much more subdued than that experienced in 1994 In a certain sense, it is also a good deal more subdued than one would anticipate on the basis of historic cyclical patterns over much of the post World War II period and far more clearly before then  The crucial issue at this stage is the evaluation of the real side of the economy The real side is being bolstered, as best anyone can judge at this stage, by the wealth effect Not that many months ago, everyone was sitting around, here and elsewhere, and wondering what elements in the GDP were going to strengthen and sustain the recovery We could not find it in residential construction We could not find it in capital investment The consumer was dead The government had gone out of business And clearly the export side was not doing anything We are now sitting here and wondering what is going to moderate this expansion The change has occurred in only a few months and no one can tell me that the world changes that rapidly What is happening, and one sees it best by looking at the S&P 500 which has been going straight up in the charts, is probably the result of a wealth effect That effect is lagged sometimes; it is indeterminate It is very difficult to judge, but one gets the sense that this is where some of the effect is probably stemming from Obviously, in the capital goods area we are getting some evidence of lower capital costs We are getting related evidence of increased margins And it's hard to buy that anything other than the wealth effect is driving the consumer  That gets us down to the question of how long all this will go on The stock market as best I can judge is high; it's not that there is a bubble in there; I am not sure we would know a bubble if we saw it, at least in advance But one surely can't argue that the underpinnings of the level of stock prices are all extremely positive It's hard to believe that if any series of adverse developments were to occur, the market would not come down rather substantially and reverse the wealth effect That probably would damp economic activity quite substantially But at this stage I don't think we can make a reasonable judgment because we don't know, frankly, how the inventory situation is going to evolve We don't know how the accelerator issue that Governor Yellen has raised is going to affect the capital goods markets At this stage the physical side of the economy is as close to balance as one can imagine Yet, to quote Mike Prell, "the smoking gun" is missing We are seeing a very pronounced set of pressures that are superimposed on the pricing structure Every time I get out in the business sector I get reports, as a number of you also have indicated you were getting, that no one can raise prices; at least that is the way our business contacts put it And, indeed, if we look at the basic structure of industrial prices, the PPI, and the CPI, we just do not find any significant evidence of cumulative pressures We have seen very little in the data that measure capacity strain We have seen very little in the way of increased delays in deliveries since that very significant measure of pressures came down Overtime is not building What we are seeing is a significant increase in the rate of capacity expansion of close to 4 percent at an annual rate as previous major investment projects are brought on line and push up capacity  -29-    5/21/96  The key to this outlook, as I see it, is not an evaluation of the physical side of the economy that appears in the Greenbook because I suspect that starting at midyear economic growth may well be on the low side of recent experience The crucial question is the linkage to inflation At this stage it is very difficult to take the existing structure of the NAIRUs, capacity limits, and the usual potential analysis that we do and square it in any measurable way with what we sense from anecdotal reports I am not saying that one cannot go out and find pressures on entry-level and skilled wages, because we are getting wage increases of 3 percent If we were not getting any of those pieces of anecdotal evidence, the number would be zero There are wage increases going on and what we are not sure about is the outlook for unit labor costs It's not clear to what extent we are getting the usual, conventional pressures  I go back to the issue that I raised about a year ago, namely that we seem to have created a level of job insecurity that has overwhelmed the pressures to increase wages As I made the argument back then, the state of technology is creating a degree or sense of job obsolescence and fear that apparently--I use the word "apparently" because we really don't know and won't know until we look at this in retrospect--has induced a tremendous shift away from increased wages and toward more job security To be sure, the extraordinarily small number of strikes in 1995, a half-century low, is not going to be repeated in 1996, especially if workers at General Motors go back on strike Even so, we are still seeing a very subdued pattern of union labor contract settlements, granted that unions are an increasingly smaller part of the private-sector workforce We have not yet seen the "smoking gun" I think it is important for us to see some of this evidence before we can be sure that the translation from real growth into inflation is following the historical patterns as closely as is implicit in the Greenbook The Greenbook may well be right and, indeed, to argue that it is not is potentially dangerous We can lull ourselves into thinking that nirvana is here Inflation has died; it has been buried; we don't need to worry about it; and we can go on our merry way That is a recipe for disaster Nonetheless, something different is happening that we do not fully understand, and I think it's important for us to make certain that we not see the "smoking gun" The trouble, unfortunately, is that in monetary policy the "smoking gun" means "we already shot the guy" and essentially that inflation is still running But there is something not happening out there We are not getting the usual pricing pressures; we do not see firms able to move prices up at these rates of operation and at these unemployment rates Something is going on that we do not yet fully understand  How one translates that into policy requires us to recognize an important factor, which Ed Boehne mentioned--namely that, unlike 1993 when our policy was very consciously stimulative to try to undo the credit crunch, real funds rates are not all that low at this stage It is not easy to determine what price expectation variables we should apply to overnight rates, but of the 75 basis point decline in the nominal funds rate that we have engineered, I suspect that less than half of it represents a decline in the real funds rate Indeed, depending on which measures we use, it can be significantly less than that It is true, as Don mentioned, that the real funds rate is in the lower part of the range for the period 1979 to date, but we obviously are well above the average rate over a much longer period of  -30-    5/21/96  time Were that not the case, I think we would probably have to make some very key decisions very soon and do so before we have the evidence on how this watershed issue is turning out I must say that I agree with Ed Boehne that the existing rate structure is reasonably high--probably somewhere near average, maybe slightly restrictive, maybe slightly easy; I don't think anyone really knows We can afford to wait and indeed we should wait for a short while We probably will have to make a judgment by July It is conceivable that if the inventory accumulation moves faster than the Greenbook presupposes, we would have to move sooner But my general view at this stage, and I raise it as a recommendation, is alternative "B," that is, to do nothing at this stage I would prefer a symmetric directive, but that is a debatable issue and one can have differing views on this Vice Chairman   President Melzer   President Parry   President Broaddus   President Hoenig   President Minehan   President Stern   Symmetric or asymmetric?   President Jordan   President Boehne   I would like to concur with what several of you said regarding a telephone consultation If events in the intermeeting period differ significantly from what we now expect, then certainly we ought to be talking on the telephone to see what, if anything, we want to do then Governor Kelley   President McTeer   Governor Yellen   Governor Phillips   Governor Lindsey   President Moskow   President Guynn   Thank you You were the last speaker The consensus of voting members is clearly "B," symmetric, and our secretary will read the appropriate directive   Call the roll   The first item on the agenda is approval of the minutes of the July 2-3 meeting Would somebody like to move them?   Without objection Peter Fisher, you are on   Peter, I think we have all been aware of a tendency that seems to go against our theoretical preconceptions I am referring to occasions when we have seen a significant rise in long-term interest rates, which one would presume would have a firming effect on the dollar Yet, what obviously was happening on some days was that heavy sales of dollar-denominated securities were made in part against purchases of foreign currencies, and the dollar weakened as a result Have you been able to segregate those episodes in which the rise in US interest rates dominated what happened to the dollar in the foreign exchange market or alternatively the sale of securities denominated in US dollars to purchase other currencies was the dominant force in determining the exchange rate for the dollar?   What is required here is that sales of securities denominated in US dollars occur against purchases of foreign currencies The mere sale of US securities does not in and of itself have any impact on the dollar Is there any additional evidence related to those episodes that could conceivably give us some insight into which way the pressures on the dollar would emerge or do we face a hopeless task if we try to disentangle those market episodes?   You will look nevertheless [Laughter]   Could we at least look at the Desk's records to identify these episodes and see what proportion were associated with a weakened dollar and what proportion with a strengthened dollar?   That might be helpful just to see what the trends are   On the famous Fridays once a month, we get a lot of evidence of spikes in both directions, and that might be a useful laboratory to see what happens   You are really confirming what Peter Fisher said Jerry   Any further questions for Peter? If not, would somebody like to move to ratify the operations of the Domestic Desk?   Without objection You may remember that at our last meeting, Bill McDonough and I were sent on a mission to the BIS to discuss the issue of swap arrangements  I thought I would bring the Committee up to date on our discussions and suggest where I think this leaves us in terms of moving forward on the range of issues we discussed at our last meeting I assume that Bill will want to make some remarks of his own shortly  Based on these conversations, it is my view that we should set aside the issue of the discontinuation of the swap network for the moment We should return to this matter when a better opportunity presents itself, such as when the European Central Bank is established and we have to decide what to do with our swap lines with the participating national central banks whose currency will soon be the euro On the current timetable, a decision on stage three of EMU would be taken no later than the spring of 1998 If it were positive,    8/20/96  the European Central Bank would come into existence soon thereafter, although it would not start operating until January 1999 Thus, we would return to this issue in the spring or summer of 1998  On the matter of authorizing the Desk to do reverse RPs with foreign central banks, our discussion last month revealed that there are a number of aspects of this issue that the Committee would like to see addressed in the context of a concrete proposal Those aspects include (1) the principles that should guide the Desk in using such authority; (2) procedures that would be followed in activating the authority; and (3) whether there should be a pre-established list of countries with which the Desk would stand ready to operate My suggestion is that the staff should develop a concrete proposal, perhaps with some options or alternatives, that would address these issues and others that were raised in our discussion at the FOMC meeting in July My expectation is that the Committee would be able to consider the proposal at our September meeting or at the latest in November Bill, would you like to add anything to this?   We have to be careful not to allow what are essentially financial anachronisms to continue to embody themselves in our financial system Were these swap arrangements a potentially dangerous or malignant problem, one could trade off the concerns of against other considerations But that does not seem to be the problem So long as we pledge ourselves to review these arrangements and hopefully to dismantle them in an appropriate timeframe, we probably will have done about as much on this question as I think we can at this time   There are, however, foreign policy considerations involved here   Which I think the staff will address Governor Lindsey   I think we will revisit this issue during the spring of 1998 At that point, we may conclude that the EMU is active, alive, and the ECB is about to happen Because so many of our swap lines are with those EMU countries, we will have a window to reshuffle all our central bank financing arrangements If it does not happen that way, we will have to address this issue anyway, and I would suspect we may just decide to drop the whole swap line network at that time   That may be, but the ones that will be in will provide an opportunity for us to readdress the issue We can use that as the vehicle   It is conceivable that you may be right I doubt it myself, but I think our conversations with    8/20/96   Not now It may well be that when we review that again in the  spring of 1998, if that is our plan, we will at that point conclude that we face such a mess that we will bite our tongue, so to speak, and say nothing about the issue My guess at this stage is that the probabilities of the swap network disappearing by mid-1998 are well in excess of 50 percent If I have my way--I have a vote, you have a vote--it will be gone But there is obviously more here than merely the question of financial arrangements Indeed, the financial arrangements would no longer be relevant if the issue inadvertently turned into a diplomatic hassle Yes, President Jordan   I think the NAFTA arrangements are essentially independent of this issue, and because they involve a different issue we will evaluate them completely separately from the other swap lines   I certainly do not want to take a vote on this question But if you are asking me personally, I agree with you   President Broaddus   It is conceivable that something may happen The EMU may break down Events may differ from what we expect We all know the types of changes that can occur in the international financial system, both planned and otherwise, and circumstances could alter that system All I am saying is that this issue will be back on our agenda no later than the spring of 1998 Any further comments on this issue? If not, let us move on to Mike Prell   So be it We adjourn for lunch  END OF MEETING  -46-       It had been the conventional wisdom in the business community that a strike tends to be inflationary in the sense that it creates an artificial degree of pent-up demand That demand gets unleashed when the strike terminates and potentially induces some acceleration of economic activity that would not have occurred without the strike Are you aware of any systematic analysis of that hypothesis?   What is the earliest date that a strike can occur?   President Minehan   That would depend on how the strike came out, whether, for example, it was a significant management victory   Well, I wonder That is not so clear to me There have been significant strikes in the past where evident union defeats had a very damping effect on labor unions For example, the flight controllers' strike, which was quashed, did more to suppress union power than almost anything else in the 20th century   President Jordan   President Parry   President Moskow   President Stern   Are there any further questions for Mike? If not, would somebody like to start the Committee discussion? President Hoenig   President Broaddus   President Moskow   President Parry   President Minehan   President Boehne   President Guynn   President McTeer   President Melzer   President Stern   Do you have any idea what the order of magnitude might be?   These involve 15 or 16 percent interest rates?   It sounds like a decisively sound business practice! Vice Chairman   President Jordan   Governor Kelley   Governor Meyer   Governor Phillips  -30-    8/20/96   Governor Lindsey   Governor Yellen  GOVERNOR YELLEN I had naively hoped that with the long intermeeting interval and so many key data releases that the fog of uncertainty hovering above the forecast might lift by the time of this meeting Unfortunately, as many of you noted, the body of incoming data has provided only modest illumination with respect to the two fundamental issues that cloud the outlook Those are, as many of you have indicated, whether aggregate demand is poised to slow toward trend and whether core inflation is in the process of accelerating My answers to these questions really are identical to those of Governor Meyer  On the first issue, I agree with him and many of you and with the analysis of the Greenbook It seems to me that most labor market and demand-side indicators along with the Beigebook and other anecdotal reports do offer tentative evidence pointing to a slowdown in demand growth beginning this quarter But, unfortunately, the extent and timing of the moderation in demand remain highly uncertain and significant risks remain I would enumerate two With inventory- sales ratios at relatively low levels, a surge of inventory investment with attendant multiplier-accelerator feedbacks seems to me to be a definite upside risk Another risk is from the stock market Present market valuations appear to be based on earnings expectations that are highly optimistic Market participants could easily be disappointed, particularly if productivity performance is disappointing and wage pressures intensify, thereby setting the stage for a very significant correction  With respect to the inflation outlook, my opinion is little changed from last time Labor markets clearly remain tight, but unemployment has not decisively broken out of its recent range And,  -33-    8/20/96  as Governor Meyer emphasized, broad measures of price inflation are still declining If one smoothes through the noise, it seems to me that the trend toward a more rapid pace of wage and salary growth is quite firmly established At the same time, growth in benefit costs remains well contained, at least thus far, and I also found the Vice Chairman's comments about the prospects here a hopeful sign The bottom line is that we have a very mild acceleration in the pace of nominal compensation growth, which is of course what matters to unit labor costs In spite of this uptick, though, nominal compensation growth still remains well below the pace that historical econometric relations would be predicting, and the uptick may thus simply reflect a rebound toward a more normal level So, assuming that productivity growth recovers somewhat toward its past trend of roughly 1 percent-- and I agree that is a significant assumption--or that profit margins erode somewhat, I think that the present pace of compensation growth should be consistent with stable inflation rates in broad measures of product prices  Now, suppose someone, and that someone is not I, firmly adheres to the view that the economy is currently operating at NAIRU and not below it Can one point to anything in the recent pattern of wage and price behavior that would provide strong evidence against that view? Here I would agree with Governor Meyer; I think the answer is no On the other hand, historical evidence strongly suggests that NAIRU is higher than 54 percent, so it would be both dangerous and foolish to discount the possibility that the modest uptick in compensation that we are now seeing is the beginning of a process that, if left unchecked, will lead to gradually accelerating inflation I think the minimum wage increase does compound the risks When I reviewed the transcript of our last meeting, I found myself in strong agreement with the way Governor Kelley summarized the situation and, of course, with what he said today Last time, he noted that "it is very correct to be suspicious of the notion that this time things have changed because assuming that is a classic trap and frequently a loser's cry" I completely agree He then went on to reason, as he did today, that there are actually very strong indications that things have indeed changed I also agree [Laughter] In other words, I am "conflicted" I consider the Greenbook inflation forecast pessimistic simply because it assigns virtually no weight to the possibility that things have changed   Governor Rivlin, top that   Thank you Do we have coffee? Shall we go into recess?  [Coffee break]   Mr Kohn   Questions for Don? If not, let me see if I can summarize and review where we are I think we are in general agreement that there is some evidence, at least at the margin, of a slowing in the expansion from the frenetic pace of earlier in the spring Homebuilding is beginning to soften, but I think the softening is modest at best at this moment Certainly, the permits  -35-    8/20/96  and backlog data that came out with the starts figures for July suggest that further significant erosion in starts does not appear likely in August Motor vehicle sales clearly were lower in July, as was pointed out by Mike Moskow and in the Greenbook A very significant part of the decline in July was the result of the unilateral action on the part of General Motors to curtail very significantly its fleet sales General Motors has been concerned since the strike earlier this year that its inventory structure was inadequate to supply both its fleet sales markets and its retail markets For obvious reasons, it chose to support its retail markets Nonetheless, motor vehicle sales this summer clearly are a tad softer; and a not insignificant weakening in used car prices, especially the ratio of used car prices to new car prices, is suggestive of a softening market So, I think a judgment that light motor vehicle sales will be coming back in August, seasonally adjusted, is the correct view, but it clearly is not one that implies a surge  As a consequence of the weakness in sales and especially in fleet sales, inventories of motor vehicles were built up at a fairly significant pace in July There also is evidence of some buildup of inventories in the non-motor vehicle, nonfarm area One can pick up some evidence of this in anecdotal and state-level data and also from models using C&I loans and commercial paper to address the question of inventory investment The evidence is still very marginal and most of the inventory data that we have for the third quarter clearly relates to motor vehicles, but I think there is no reason to disbelieve the projection of a significant uptick in inventory investment that shows up in the Greenbook for the third quarter One potential explanation of the low initial claims and insured unemployment figures may well be that we are getting some production for inventories in the third quarter We are not, however, seeing any of the elements that indicate a rush to build because we are not getting the usual signs of delivery tightness, stretching out of lead times, and shortages of various goods that tend to be associated with that phenomenon Those are the types of problems that would induce a significant increase in safety stocks and bring on the kind of accelerated inventory investment that creates the major problems we have seen in the past What seems to be involved here is not an increase in safety stocks, but an inadvertent drawing down of inventories to levels that are excessively lean at any existing safety stock level Therefore, I think stocks are being built up at this stage, and that could suggest a somewhat higher GDP than one would normally expect Indeed, it is probably one of the reasons why there has been an upward revision in the Greenbook's third-quarter GDP estimate  Consistent with a basic slowing of the expansion, though without any evidence of weakness or cumulative erosion, is the fact that domestic operating profit margins finally appear to be flattening But the data do, nonetheless, suggest that those margins remain high If you were to believe the individual "bottom-up" earnings forecasts of the securities markets, you would find that difficult to believe However, I think there is some merit to Governor Yellen's suggestion that earnings forecasts are very likely to be discouraging because all the people who do the buildup from individual estimates are getting higher domestic operating profit earnings than those who are doing it from the top down  -36-    8/20/96  I think the reason for this is that we are getting mixed evidence with respect to productivity gains This is crucial because if we disaggregate the total GDP data and separate manufacturing from all other sectors, we end up with the very interesting issue that we were discussing at the break In the non-industrial area of the GDP, we are simultaneously getting a very significant increase in unit labor costs--in the 4 percent area--and a very dramatic rise in operating profit margins I suggest to you that while those are reconcilable arithmetically, and indeed the data will reconcile, we do not get the sense that everything will be coming out exactly the way that the markets presume We are getting anecdotal reports of productivity improvements in the manufacturing and industrial area even when we move a lot of the temporary worker hours from the services area into the manufacturing area, which is where they should be So, manufacturing productivity is strong; it squares with the anecdotal information Profit margins are rising in manufacturing but less so than in nonmanufacturing Something has to change in this data system, and I am frankly curious to see how it ultimately will come out at the end of the day  The flattening of profit margins on the presumption that that is indeed happening is consistent with the expectation that the expansion in the capital goods market will gradually slow down Yet, there is no doubt in my view that it is premature to assume that the economy is backing off its unsustainable rate of expansion Product markets do not exhibit much pressure; that is, we are not getting any pronounced upside pressure in industrial commodity prices, lead times are dull, and inventory shortages do not appear to exist Nonetheless, there exists a tautness in labor markets that has been there all year long, and I think, as has been discussed at length around this table, the crucial inflation question that we confront is on the labor side Our difficulties lie with the issue of tight labor markets leading to increased wage pressures not offset by productivity improvements The issue that the Vice Chairman raised with respect to benefits is one that I, too, hear out on the hustings That is, while everyone acknowledges that the sharp deceleration in the cost of health insurance benefits largely reflects the dramatic shift from fee-for-service to managed care, it is apparently not correct to presume that the end of the adjustment will occur when we reach the point where 98 percent of workers are in managed care There has been dramatic pressure from the business community to move from fee-for- service to managed care When that is completed, they are going to go straight at the managed-care providers the way the Vice Chairman suggests Whether they are successful or not remains to be seen, as Governor Phillips quite appropriately suggests, but I do not think the automatic elimination of further containment of benefit costs is necessarily an obvious forecast  Nonetheless, with the US economy operating at high levels and very little evidence of cumulative weakness in recent data, the risks are and remain unquestionably on the high side It would not take much to induce strong final demand that would require an accelerated inventory buildup coming from safety stock concerns This is the type of development that occurred in 1994 but is not as yet showing any signs of emerging Consumer confidence unquestionably is high, and the balance sheets of households, with the obvious exception of the debt problems in some of the middle-to-lower income households, are in very good shape  -37-    8/20/96  While there appears little upside margin, alternatively it would not take much softening to reduce pressure on markets and even labor markets with a lag As I indicated in my Humphrey-Hawkins testimony, I believe we are at a key juncture where small changes in macro demand can tilt the economy in wholly different directions with different outlooks Current forecast error ranges easily encompass either scenario The economy has eased since the Humphrey-Hawkins testimony but only marginally, and it would not take much to put us back in a tightening situation Certainly, the declines in initial claims and unemployment insurance are not encouraging in this regard, though that may be, as I indicated earlier, a reflection of temporarily higher production in order to replenish perceived depleted inventory levels I would suggest that is more likely the case if indeed it is showing up in the aggregate numbers rather than any evident upsurge in final demand Of course, while it is true at least in the retail area that we are getting somewhat better chain store numbers for August, the sales figures for the week ended August 17th that came out this morning tilt down again The chain store numbers do appear to be modestly better seasonally adjusted for August than for July, but it does not appear to me to be a big deal, and the improvement does not fully reverse the weaknesses that were apparent in both June and July retail sales data  As far as policy is concerned, if the economy is in the process of growing at an unsustainable pace or moving in that direction, raising the federal funds rate only 25 basis points is not going to help much at this stage Fifty to seventy-five basis points would more likely be required Although the real funds rate is only a shade off its peak for this cycle, a much larger increase should not be necessary if indeed we have moved toward an unsustainable pace of economic growth Had we been in a firming mode this year, it would seem prudent to me to tack on an additional 25 basis points at this meeting, as we did under not dissimilar circumstances in early 1995 But any upward move at this point implies a reversal of trend, which the markets will quickly price in, reflecting our increased credibility They believe we have insights that they do not have; and my suspicion is that is a dubious proposition to say the least The one scenario that I would very much like to avoid is our reversal of the trend and moving the funds rate upward just as the economy is in the process of measurably slowing down As I indicated in July, our policy stance is not sufficiently out of line currently to require that we move quickly I had expected that conditions by now would dictate the reversal of trend, but as a consequence of evidence suggesting some slowing in the economy, the case has become less compelling than I thought it would be I believe that we can prudently hold off for a while to assess developments to make a determination of whether or not the economy is moving at an accelerated pace or gradually beginning to ratchet down Nonetheless, if we do choose alternative B, which is the one I would like to propose, I trust we will continue our asymmetric bias   Governor Lindsey   President Boehne  -38-    8/20/96  PRESIDENT BOEHNE I support your proposal   President Broaddus  PRESIDENT BROADDUS Mr Chairman, as I said earlier today, my main focus has been on the second of the two questions we have been looking at The possibility clearly laid out in the staff forecast is that the trend inflation rate is set to increase even if there is some further slowing in the growth of demand Given this situation, I still favor some tightening of monetary policy I think there is already ample evidence that the level of economic activity warrants what I would describe as a moderate mid-course correction to reverse at least part of the easing that was undertaken last winter I must say that I was impressed by Don Kohn's comments about inertia and the potential cost of waiting to take this action I recognize that the financial markets are not looking for any tightening action today and that such an action would be a surprise But it seems to me that such an action could be quite beneficial to the atmosphere of the markets in the weeks ahead The markets have been, it seems to me, exceptionally edgy over the last intermeeting period They know there is an inflationary risk, and they are not sure how or when we are going to deal with it, especially given the fact that we have not acted to date The situation and the atmosphere are almost reminiscent of the early part of 1994, after we made our initial move, when the markets were still waiting for the other shoe to drop Only this time they are waiting for the first shoe to drop A 50 basis point move today would essentially drop both shoes You suggested in essence in your comments that the markets would likely conclude that such a move would be all or nearly all that would be required if in fact the expansion continues to decelerate So a 50 basis point move would be what I would favor today Beyond any longer-term settling effect it might have on the markets, a relatively decisive action like this would put everybody on notice that we firmly intend to keep our commitment to hold the line on inflation It would be a very clear signal for anyone who needs it Finally, while I still think a 50 basis point move is the better move, in this case a quarter of a loaf is better than none So if 1/2 point is not acceptable, I would recommend that we consider doing 1/4 point Thank you   President Stern   President Parry   Vice Chairman   President Jordan   President Minehan   You are correct   The last time I spoke to him, he said that [Laughter]   President Guynn   President Hoenig   Governor Kelley   Governor Rivlin   President Melzer   President McTeer   Governor Phillips   Governor Yellen   Governor Meyer   President Moskow   Would you, Mr Secretary, read "B" asymmetric   Call the roll   Thank you The next meeting is Tuesday, September 24th   Would somebody like to move approval of the minutes? Bob, I know the San Francisco District is three hours behind us, but I think you are going to have to move their approval   Without objection, the minutes are approved Peter Fisher   Thank you Questions for Peter? Governor Lindsey   The real question is the outlook for the EMU If one thinks the EMU is going to fail, one would expect the deutsche mark to rally very sharply If one expects the EMU to hold together, for whatever reason--all the countries may be running 5 percent deficits but they may still decide to come together--that means the deutsche mark is going to be put into a structure that will inhibit its strength, which is what the EMU will do So, what is really involved is a practical judgment about the prospects for the EMU, not whether it is good or bad, I don't think the market is going to be judging whether it is good or bad They may in fact view it as phoney as a four dollar bill--an American four dollar bill [Laughter]    9/24/96   Vice Chairman   It is, but if you take an asset sale that is one-half percent of GDP and consider that appropriate, the fudging potential involved in the stability pact is quite considerable So, a lot of future relationships are at stake I agree that these last two events imply that EMU is going to happen The question is about some of the crucial issues that the Germans specifically are very concerned about, especially a fudged or temporary 3 percent Maastrict followed by erosion The Germans have made very strong statements on this issue, and the question is whether the agreements are in fact going to back up those words I would say that the evidence, as Governor Lindsey suggests, does raise some questions   They are cutting down the sharp edges of the adjustment costs Governor Rivlin   Budget accounting basically  RIVLIN Yes We have worried about this for a while, but they have not   Even with our fairly specific unified budget principles, there is an awful lot of fudging that goes on in the process   Any further questions?   We call it an asset sale [Laughter]   Any further questions? If not, would someone like to move for a vote to approve the domestic operations?   We will now go on to the next item on the agenda   Yes   I had not looked at the clock but that is a very valid question!   I will take it not as a suggestion but as a mandated response to somebody who knows We will adjourn for lunch, but we will still be in the meeting when we return  [Lunch break]   Peter Fisher has laid out what seems to be a reasonable proposal on the issue of our foreign currency investments He is requesting that we replace the current 12-month maturity constraint on the investment of System foreign currency holdings with an 18-month duration constraint Before you hold forth on your positions on this issue, are there questions on his memorandum that you want to direct to Peter? President Boehne   President Jordan   Governor Lindsey   President Hoenig   President Melzer   Governor Meyer   Any further questions for Peter?   Let's first have the Deputy Secretary read what we will be voting on   Would you like to move it?   Is there a second?  SPEAKER(?) Second   All in favor say "aye"  SEVERAL Aye   No? The "ayes" have it The next item, which is the final item on the agenda, is a request from Peter Fisher for the members' views on the liquidity management and maturity structure of the System's domestic portfolio Does anyone have any questions to ask Peter before we move to the specific views of the members? Governor Meyer   Any further questions? What Peter needs to have from the members is some reaction to his memorandum so that he can move forward   In the past, we have discussed the possibility of having an agreement with the Treasury to swap maturities with them in the event of a need on our part to liquefy a significant amount of our portfolio I have forgotten what the answer was Does anyone recall what it was?   Let me start from scratch If we have a maturity structure problem that would prevent us from selling a desired amount of securities at specific times, that would make us lean toward a much more liquid portfolio But what is there to prevent us from making an agreement with the Treasury to have them swap two-day bills, or something like that, for our coupons?   Exactly I am only raising the issue of the difficulty of selling coupon issues in the market and as a consequence either affecting the price or affecting our earnings If on the other hand we made a straight swap with the Treasury, that presumably would not be an issue   What we would effectively have done is to require them to refinance fairly quickly But depending on the maturity of the bills, even if we made it a 20-day maturity, that would not really affect our ability to sell the bills, but it could make it easier for the Treasury to choose an appropriate time frame to refinance If 20 days is not good, 45 days is not going to make much difference for us either   There is no doubt that the Treasury's reaction to this would be 110 percent negative before they heard the end of the sentence That does not make it the right answer   We do not care about the earnings aspect and we should not because it is merely a bookkeeping transfer between ourselves and the Treasury I do not know if there is a problem here There would be a big problem if the net issues of Treasury debt to the public were disproportionately in the form of short-term bills because that would make budget policy very closely affected by interest rate policy But it has nothing to do with us on the other side   If you move the debt to short term, it is the outstanding debt, not the budget deficit, that determines the impact of--   Versus doing what?   Vice Chairman   Why don't you talk to them over there and see whether they slam the phone down before you can get a couple of words in They are more than disinclined to listen to anything that complicates their task because they think they are over their  -51-    9/24/96  heads with work If you impose any more work on them, you are not a friend Any further comments? President Melzer   Those are real earnings!   If we went to bills only, the earnings of the System would be highly correlated with the federal funds rate Would it be assumed that as earnings go up we are going to use those funds to go out on the town or something like that?   Governor Phillips   Any other comments? President Minehan   Liquidity through repos, or the ease with which one can arrange them, decreases in a crisis atmosphere It is precisely then that we may really need a liquid portfolio There is never a question about, say, 12-day bills, whereas finding counter- parties may be difficult when we want to do repos during a crisis Everyone is then running for cover  -53-    9/24/96   Further comments or questions? Peter, do you think you have enough to move forward?   Very good The next meeting is scheduled for Wednesday, November 13 We have now concluded this meeting  END OF MEETING  -54-       Thank you Without objection Mr Prell   Any questions? President Parry   Any further questions? If not, would somebody like to start the roundtable? President McTeer   President Jordan   President Broaddus   Mr Guynn   President Minehan   President Moskow   Thank you very much President Parry   President Hoenig   President Boehne   President Melzer   President Stern   Vice Chairman   Governor Phillips   Governor Meyer  -18-    9/24/96   Governor Yellen   Governor Rivlin   Governor Kelley   Finally, Governor Lindsey   On that note, we all can go for coffee  [Coffee break]   Mr Kohn   Questions for Don? If not, let me get started If we cut through the somewhat foggy data for the third quarter, I think that there are two important hard numbers that emerge One is that no matter how we look at the numbers, it is very difficult to get around the fact that hourly wages and salaries are accelerating We have no third-quarter data on fringe benefit costs, but as I indicated in the August meeting in support of the views of the Vice Chairman, I think that health cost increases are still on the way down and still basically holding down overall compensation costs Wage pressures are unquestionably the result of the tightness in the labor markets that we have all seen, and that tightness by every indication has increased rather than decreased in recent months It is conceivable that there are seasonal factor adjustment problems in the unemployment rate, and I do not doubt that that is the case There is also a sampling variability issue, which is not to be dismissed very readily, in the household sample figure But the initial claims and more specifically the insured unemployment numbers are not inconsistent with some tightening in labor markets in the last two or three months  The second very important hard number may be somewhat less hard than usual and is one that Governor Phillips pointed to, namely that profit margins seem to be holding up in the third quarter In any event, the evidence that they may be declining is not very persuasive This means that the rise or acceleration in compensation has to show up as it has historically either in increasing prices or increasing productivity growth I am talking about the third quarter, which is just about history at this stage The performance on the price side, I think, is very impressive You cannot find price increases of any significance in the core CPI, which went up 06 percent and not 1 percent in August, if you want to look at some numbers to disbelieve, and I must say that I do not entirely believe them Data relating to underlying inflation in the pipeline, as I believe Governor Meyer pointed out, show nothing The pickup that we are getting in the Chicago Purchasing Managers' Survey, as far as I can see, is in oil product prices, which show up across the board in those surveys, and we are seeing them elsewhere I do not take the price data in the purchasing managers' surveys as very useful, largely because we have far better data for the actual commodities that are being purchased The purchasing managers' data, I am almost certain, are coincident with the rise in oil product prices and futures  The difficulty that one has with all of this is whether prices will remain generally stable I must say that I do not expect the September CPI to be as benign because it will include the 10 percent excise tax for airlines, and it is likely that the 1-1/2 percent decline in apparel prices for August will be largely reversed Those two factors in and of themselves can very readily turn the CPI around I must admit that I would be quite surprised if we did not get a significant uptick in the core CPI in the September numbers  -26-    9/24/96  The question we are dealing with is whether the price/profit- margin/wage pattern implies accelerated productivity While it is difficult to make a judgment about whether the productivity numbers are improving, it is not difficult to make a judgment that the rate of increase in productivity is a lot higher than is shown by the conventional numbers At the August meeting, I raised a question about the internal inconsistency between the manufacturing data and the changes in total nonfarm business productivity Since that meeting, we have done a fairly extensive amount of statistical evaluation and have made some very interesting findings The first is that if we disaggregate productivity in the nonfarm business sector into corporate and noncorporate, the corporate data are generally not bad, though one must make a judgment with respect to how one price- deflates the gross corporate product Nonetheless, the figures that are derived are far more consistent with the anecdotal data that we see on a day-by-day basis in the press and that we hear when we talk to anybody in the corporate sector, namely that productivity growth is a lot stronger than the 1 percent or less that we have seen in the nonfarm business product data In fact, the number for the last four quarters is 26 percent at an annual rate; since 1980, it is 16 to 17 percent, well above the nonfarm business product numbers Indeed, when we separate out both the nominal and the real noncorporate nonfarm data, we find something quite startling in those data, namely that measured productivity growth in the noncorporate sector is negative and has had a negative trend since 1980 The reason for this obviously is the price factors that BEA uses When we disaggregate the Gross Product Originating data to two-digit SIC industry detail for those industries that tend to be in the noncorporate sector, namely services, we get full confirmation Taking the new GPO by industry data through 1994 just published by Commerce and applying hours data, we get productivity for total services, which is a fourth of gross business product, declining 14 percent per annum since 1990, health services declining at a rate of 27 percent for 1990 to 1994, legal services at a rate of 16 percent--that is a more credible number [Laughter]--and social services, which are a large sector, declining at an annual rate of 37 percent for 1990 to 1994  This tells us that a large chunk of the productivity data in the nonfarm business product area makes no sense and is giving us a distorted view of the underlying productivity growth rate in the economy as a whole and a distinctly distorted view of underlying real costs If we look at the data on the corporate sector, even presuming that the inflation rates in that sector are misestimated, we still get some very persuasive productivity numbers For those who have been brought up believing that productivity rose quite substantially from 1960 through 1973 and then took a swoon, these data show that when we use income-based statistics to disaggregate the nonfarm business product data, which show a decline from a 3 percent annual rate in the 1960s to 11 percent now, virtually all of that decline in productivity growth shows up in the nonfarm, noncorporate area Productivity in that sector rose at a 5 percent annual rate from 1960 through 1973 and has been negative on average since then The annual rise in productivity in the corporate sector went from 22 percent during the pre-1973 period to 17 percent since then In other words, the tremendous contraction in productivity, which all of our data show, is partially phoney  -27-    9/24/96  The result of all of this is that if we look at the underlying cost structure and adjust for the bias in service prices, which is obviously the source of this problem, we get an increase in real gross product for the noncorporate sector, an increase in productivity, and the numbers all make sense, assuming that the overall price index comes out lower than implied by the published data If we look at the current structure of costs, hourly compensation for the corporate sector and probably for the whole economy is going up 3-1/2 percent per annum If output per hour for the overall economy is going up 1-1/2 percent, which seems a lot more likely than the reported numbers, unit labor costs would be rising 2 percent Multiplying unit labor costs by 7 percent, the general proportion of labor costs in total costs, results in a contribution to total costs of 14 percent from the rise in the compensation of employees Other costs are going down Indirect business taxes per unit of output are moving lower as are net interest costs In the most recent period, these declines average about 1/2 percent, so growth in underlying total unit costs is somewhere in the area of 1 percent This explains why profit margins are large and holding, and it explains why price pressures are nowhere near as high as we would ordinarily expect them to be at this stage of the business cycle in the context of laggard productivity growth  The question that one must ask in all of this is how to explain the extraordinary behavior of prices when wage increases are very clearly accelerating The answer is that we can explain it only if productivity is indeed rising a lot faster than our statistics indicate If we look at the total cost structure, I grant that at this stage it is virtually impossible to make a judgment as to whether productivity growth is accelerating, but it is not difficult to make a judgment that underlying unit costs are rising at a very marginal rate The evidence that we see of declining unit labor costs in manufacturing is a little dubious because the hours in the personnel services area that are used in manufacturing are not adjusted in those data But even with those adjustments, manufacturing, which is a big chunk of the corporate sector and indeed probably far more representative of what is going on in the real world than some of the service areas in the noncorporate sector, is showing a cost structure even more benign than the total for all corporations  If this analysis is in fact correct, it is important for us to take a look at what it implies about the current performance of the economy and the underlying inflationary forces While the probability is still better than 50/50 that we will not get through this period without the very strong pressure on wages overcoming the productivity advances and engendering a much higher rate of expansion in total unit costs, I think the probabilities are falling Indeed, there is a not inconceivable probability that we could get through this period into the early months of next year without moving policy The reasons are as follows  One, as Governor Meyer said and as I implied in the August meeting, the inventory data appear to be moving around We know that the July change in constant dollars is at almost a $50 billion annual rate The August figure is substantially less We know that from the numbers for motor vehicles, but we are also picking it up in some other indications for August inventories One stems from a method for estimating inventories on the basis of industrial production that is  -28-    9/24/96  not too bad a predictor of inventories before they are published Another comes from a model based on C&I loans and some judgment with respect to how commercial paper issuance relates to the financing of inventories That also shows a somewhat lower rate of August inventory accumulation but a higher rate in September The problem here is not that we are getting an excessive buildup of inventories Even with a fairly substantial expansion of inventories--and the rate of inventory investment is now up significantly from where it was in the second quarter--we would need a long period of this type of inventory investment to get an inventory overhang It is not that I suspect that inventory-sales ratios are still not very high even at the end of September The issue is that the level of output is being driven by higher inventory investment As a number of you have mentioned, that takes some of the pressure off the fourth quarter and the first quarter of next year The issue is not whether inventory accumulation is voluntary or involuntary; it is just that it is there If it is there, it affects the arithmetic of the growth in GDP  Secondly, while the August retail sales figures may be dubious, I do not think the revisions going back into June and July are They show a significant slowing, which as best we can judge is also occurring in September Mike Moskow points out that motor vehicle sales for the first half of this month are at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 151 million We get the same number here and that is a significant decline from the August level Part of that may well be fleet sales, but it strikes me in looking at the distribution between fleet and retail sales, which is roughly a PCE/producers durable equipment split, that part of the motor vehicle number is clearly in the retail sales area We also received a set of weekly chain-store sales data this morning If the data are to be believed, the September seasonally adjusted numbers are well under the August numbers Now, I am a little suspicious of the way those numbers run, largely because they have not been that reliable in the past But they give some indication that, at this stage, we are not getting a pickup in consumer expenditures despite the fact that the consumer confidence numbers are quite strong The Conference Board number circulated this morning was down just a small fraction; the Michigan Survey looks strong; the ABC numbers look strong; and capital gains and the wealth effect are strong Yet, with all of that in the background, where are the sales? Now, one can readily argue that the dip in sales is only temporary and sales will come back, and that is a credible forecast It also might be that consumer credit, which has been growing less rapidly and getting increasingly tight, is finally beginning to affect the consumer data I think it is important to differentiate between current reporting and forecasting Current reports, as best I see the numbers, are not yet showing the pickup that is implied in the Greenbook It may very well occur We know from the past that these numbers fluctuate a great deal But for the moment, it is one thing to forecast and it is another to report  Nonetheless, for a number of reasons that were discussed earlier, I continue to believe that the probability of our having to move, though declining, is still above 50 percent The first and most important reason is clearly that the labor markets are getting increasingly tight It may be that we will have the good fortune to find that some of the recent wage data are an aberration, but again that is a forecast The information that we have today suggests that these markets are very tight, and I am not aware of any evidence of a  -29-    9/24/96  letup The orders patterns at capital goods establishments are quite robust The so-called adjusted real orders figures that we calculate to try to get a short-term forecast of industrial production are quite firm I do not know of any evidence that says that industrial production is easing The reason production is this strong is the buildup in inventories That is where the impetus essentially is coming from  Housing starts, home sales, and the like are higher than we would have expected at this stage We have to be a little careful in our assessment, however As Mike Prell pointed out, a good part of the increase in starts in August reflects a sharp rundown of the permits backlog This suggests that the permits come first, the starts come second, and there have been indications that permits are weakening, although not as much as I would have expected I think this is partly because, if we disaggregate home sales, it is becoming apparent that home sales financed by adjustable rate mortgages are becoming a more prominent element in the housing market Clearly, as interest rates rise, adjustable rate home financing goes up While cash sales still account for a small part of the total, they do not seem to be doing much So, the fixed-rate mortgage is not as potent a force in reducing home sales as it used to be in periods when mortgage rates were rising  I mentioned previously that consumer confidence is very high The survey data are showing no signs of deterioration The stock market, needless to say, is going on its merry way It strikes me that we have to be very much aware of certain key data as they come out in the weeks ahead I think the data relating to the whole insured unemployment system, which show as I said no signs of simmering down, are crucial to our assessment We have to be aware of the possibility, as I mentioned at the July and August meetings, that if we begin to see signs of some pressures on the product side of the economy, in intermediate goods prices, and evidence of tightening delivery schedules--the usual types of developments that suggest that the economy is beginning to run not only into labor market tightness but production facility tightness--we can probably expect that inventory investment in safety stocks is going to rise and rise significantly At this point, even though the current rate of inventory investment is a lot higher than it was in the first half of the year, it does not imply any pronounced increase in inventory-sales ratios In the past, we have seen such an increase If that begins to show up, it will be indicating a very strong economic boom superimposed on the expansion that we already have At the moment, no evidence in any of the data that we look at suggests that If we start to see profit margins erode, it will tell us that productivity gains, which have been supporting profit margins, are probably easing and that price pressures are probably going to start to show through That to me would be a very important signal that the inflationary dangers are increasing unacceptably rapidly  I recognize that there is a stock market bubble problem at this point, and I agree with Governor Lindsey that this is a problem that we should keep an eye on We have very great difficulty in monetary policy when we confront stock market bubbles That is because, to the extent that we are successful in keeping product price inflation down, history tells us that price-earnings ratios under those conditions go through the roof What is really needed to keep  -30-    9/24/96  stock market bubbles from occurring is a lot of product price inflation, which historically has tended to undercut stock markets almost everywhere There is a clear tradeoff If monetary policy succeeds in one, it fails in the other Now, unless we have the capability of playing in between and managing to know exactly when to push a little here and to pull a little there, it is not obvious to me that there is a simple set of monetary policy solutions that deflate the bubble We do have the possibility of raising major concerns by increasing margin requirements I guarantee that if you want to get rid of the bubble, whatever it is, that will do it My concern is that I am not sure what else it will do But there are other ways that one can contemplate  This leads, as far as I am concerned, to very much the same policy discussion that we had in August If there are indeed accelerating inflationary pressures, 25 basis points "ain't going to do it" A 25 basis point change used to be a mere indistinguishable tick in interest rate charts to which no one ever paid much attention Despite the possibility that the markets may assume, if we were to move 25 basis points, that that would be it, I do not believe it Nobody is going to believe that 25 basis points will accomplish anything The minimum adjustment needed to have any effect is 50 to 75 basis points We could have moved 25 basis points in August, as I indicated then, if previous policy had been on a tightening path But a move then, and I must say now, would be a reversal in trend and would imply in my judgment that it eventually would have to total at least 50 basis points, probably more, and I am sure that the latter would be priced into the markets fairly quickly This expectation of further action unfortunately requires us in my view to be more cautious than we would like to be if we were dealing with a wholly symmetrical approach to monetary policy  I would like, if we can possibly do it and as I indicated in August, to avoid our moving up just as the rate of increase in GDP starts to come down We are only a week away from the fourth quarter I do not know about the rest of you, but my recollection is that whenever we are at the peak of intense demand pressures, we never are able to identify the peak at that point in time It is only in retrospect that we identify it So, we have to be careful about distinguishing between history and forecasts My general impression is that the probability of a peak at this stage, as I said, is less than 50/50 but growing and that we may not need to move prior to the end of this year We may not need to move as we get into 1997 if the economy starts to look as it did in 1995 That is not an inconceivable development as we look at the data that we have at this stage There is no evidence that the economy is about to slip into recession But there is at least a not unreasonable possibility that the pressures on labor markets as well as on the economy generally could ease enough to reduce the current set of pressures  Having said all that, I fully acknowledge that we have a very tight labor market situation at this stage I think identifying the current situation as an inflationary zone, as some have argued, is a proper judgment at this point But it is a zone, not a breakthrough, and I would therefore conclude and hope, as I did last time, that we can stay at "B," no change, but also if we make that decision that we can retain an asymmetric directive pending our examination of the data as they evolve in the weeks ahead  -31-    9/24/96   You have a question?   Because we have a separate set of numbers for double checking the household numbers While the household numbers as you well know do not conform to the payroll numbers month by month, it really is quite extraordinary how close those two wholly independent sets of employment data come out over time It requires some major changes in assumptions with respect to the distribution of employment between corporate and noncorporate to undercut the conclusions that these data seem to produce The conclusions may be affected at the margin, but if you looked at these data and asked "what if," you would have to make bizarre assumptions about the distribution of corporate and noncorporate hours to make this problem disappear Vice Chairman   President Parry   President McTeer   President Moskow   We will do so President Jordan   President Broaddus   President Boehne   President Minehan   President Melzer   Governor Rivlin   Governor Kelley  -35-    9/24/96   President Hoenig   Governor Phillips   President Guynn   Governor Meyer   Governor Lindsey   President Stern   Governor Yellen   Thank you Would you read "B" asymmetric?   Call the roll   Good morning, everyone The first item of business is to welcome John Moore, who as you know is First Vice President of the San Francisco Bank and is attending his first meeting It means that Peter Fisher has to be on his best behavior!   But before he exhibits that good behavior, I would like somebody to move approval of the minutes for the meeting of September 24   Without objection Now, Mr Fisher   Questions for Peter on either subject?   If you had not run the Desk as well as you did, we would not have had a choice up here If there are no questions on either subject, would somebody like to move the renewal of the reciprocal currency arrangements, which expire during December, and ratification of the domestic transactions? We will vote separately on each of them Peter, how do you want to define the motion on renewing the swap lines?   Is there a second?   All in favor of the authority to renew the swap lines say "aye"  SEVERAL Aye   Any opposed?    11/13/96   Hearing none, they are approved The second motion--   All in favor say "aye"  SEVERAL Aye   Opposed? The Secretary will note that both motions passed unanimously Would you like to move to our domestic discussion? [Laughter] Wait a second! Have we ratified the domestic market transactions?  SEVERAL Yes, we did   Oh, that was the second vote!   Thank you all I would just remind you that the next meeting is on December 17 We adjourn for lunch  END OF MEETING  -38-       No, the trouble is jet lag, and even though Peter and I were on the same plane, his jet lag is different from mine [Laughter] Slowing things down, we move to Mike Prell   Mike, granted all the problems with the data, there seems to be a gradual uptrend in the last two or three years in the measured personal saving rate in the context of a very rapid rise in household wealth If we were to take the published personal saving rate and adjust it for the econometric evidence of the impact of changes in household wealth on that statistic, is there any question as to whether we would be looking at a secular updrift?   Is there any correlation between the saving rate and the statistical discrepancy?   I would assume that Commerce would be doing that sort of analysis in looking for the causes of the statistical discrepancy and presumably making adjustments where they could   President Parry   There is also the CPI-product price   President Moskow   President Minehan   Governor Phillips   Any further questions for Mike?   Any further questions? If not, who would like to start the Committee's discussion?   President Moskow   President Minehan   President Broaddus   President Boehne   President Guynn  -11-    11/13/96   President McTeer   Did they think you were worth the minimum wage? [Laughter]   President Stern   President Hoenig   President Melzer   Vice Chairman   President Jordan   Governor Meyer   Governor Rivlin   Governor Yellen   Thank you Governor Lindsey   Thank you Governor Phillips   Governor Kelley   We will adjourn for coffee, whether it is there or not [Laughter]  [Coffee break]   Mr Lindsey   Thank you very much Any questions for David?   Any further questions for David? If not, let me get started As far as I can see, the outlook is very little changed from what it was at the time of the last meeting The outlook may have shifted toward slightly slower growth, but only at the margin and within the expected range of statistical error  The data are difficult to read, but labor markets unquestionably are still quite tight My suspicion is that our measures of labor costs may be biased downward in the third quarter This is my impression for reasons other than those that have been raised around the table  First, I don't think we have enough data to verify this hypothesis on a national level, but it clearly shows up at a micro level in the sense that, when we have a very tight labor market, some of the wage increases take the form of promotions Consequently, we get a grade updrift that does not show up fully in the wage structure, which is essentially what the ECI represents Compensation data do suggest that some of the grade drift may be in addition to the real drift toward truly higher skilled workers  There is also a question about the average hourly earnings for October, which as we know came in at zero But I think the staff has also demonstrated quite credibly that the industry-by-industry correlation between average hourly earnings and average hours is significant This implies that there is an overtime component in these data There was a significant decline in average weekly hours in October, and adjusting for that would raise the October average hourly earnings number by something like 2 percent That is not a big change, but I think the data are giving us a more benign look at the wage structure than probably exists  There also is the issue on the other side as to whether the acceleration in entry-level jobs suggested by anecdotal reports is being offset by an increase in the number of people leaving the labor force, largely through retirement I am not sure whether the wage rates of retirees are rising, but because the wage rates of these older workers are higher than average, the ratio does not have to rise The rate of retirements just has to be high enough to overcome the general aging of the remainder of the workforce to allow us  -29-    11/13/96  readily to reconcile higher entry-level wages with a still sluggish structure of wages overall  Another issue is the variable pay question that was raised earlier by Gary Stern The surveys are beginning to show that for a proportion of the workforce, which is still relatively small, wages are significantly related to profitability or other company results This means that the issue applies to a much broader group than sales workers It is an important issue because to the extent that we have big wage increases as a consequence of, or tied to, profitability, such increases are not necessarily inflationary That is true because as costs go up in relation to prices, profit margins are squeezed and those wages automatically start to adjust down So, while it may be true that the wages of commission sales workers have been slipping relative to the average, which is the reason why the numbers for non- sales workers have gone up somewhat more, that may be partially offset by the higher wages of the increasing proportion of workers who have their salaries tied more closely to profitability  What I see as the bottom line of all this is that the wage structure is extraordinarily dynamic and not easy to read The only thing we know for sure--or more precisely for which our information is fairly accurate--is total wages and salaries, and probably average hourly wages and salaries as well if one is prepared to argue that the data on hours worked are not all that bad But any effort to isolate in that structure such things as misplaced merit increases or compa ratios and that kind of thing, all of which are important to an understanding of where the wage increases are stemming from, is really difficult Therefore, I think we have to be quite careful We also have to be careful about our productivity data, not only for the reasons that I have been mentioning in previous meetings relative to the bias in price indexes and the like, but also because there are significant changes in the quality of the hours worked that we do not adjust for Our deficient understanding of the true structure of costs, benefits, and the like should create a degree of humbleness on our part that we have not yet achieved [Laughter] I merely suggest that we have to work harder  The evidence that there is a significant shortfall in measured wages from the predictions of our wage-NAIRU econometric relationships is pretty clear It is also clear from the reports all of you are getting that wage increases, no matter how we measure them, are falling short of those estimated from our equations They are falling short in a way that largely mirrors the rise in operating profit margins It is difficult to get an exact relationship, but it is rather obvious that we can explain a very significant part of this wage/price inflation nexus by a clear downshift in the tradeoff between wage gains and job security or some other factor for which job security stands as a proxy This, as we have discussed over the last two years, is clearly a transitory phenomenon Nonetheless, the evidence suggests that the third-quarter operating profit margins are holding up They may be revised down when we have more complete data for the quarter, but they clearly will not be down by very much, and they surely will not be down by anywhere near what is implied by holding the statistical discrepancy of the GDP accounts constant  The importance of all of this is that if we are still seeing evidence that the broader indexes of price inflation are easing, the  -30-    11/13/96  rate of inflation is falling or at worst stabilizing, and profit margins are holding up, then the productivity/wage relationship suggests that whatever is happening is not happening very fast And, as I argued at the last meeting, irrespective of how badly we under- estimate what productivity may or may not be doing, it is still the case that if wages begin to accelerate relative to whatever the growth of productivity may be, then we will begin to see wage/price pressures, which we very strongly wish to avoid Nonetheless, I think we have been very fortunate in that there is no credible evidence that such a process is in train  If we reduce the size of the add-factors in our various equations that relate wage change to unemployment or any measure of labor tightness, we will get an acceleration of inflation; that is what the algebra requires But we do not know that we have turned the corner As far as I can see, it is not self-evident that we have add- factors that have stabilized and are closing They are not If we wanted to become real deflationists, we could argue that we are halfway through the process and we have not seen anything yet I do not believe that myself, but it is not outside the purview of our evaluation The Greenbook requires a certain add-factor forecast that presupposes the current transitional phase is in the process of coming to an end I think the process is coming to an end, but I do not wish to bet the ranch that that is in fact the case So, however one evaluates this, it is clear that whatever is occurring is not occurring rapidly  When we look at the inflationary pressures that are currently built into the economy as a result of the tight level of labor utilization, the question is really one of whether the economy will ease off before a process of inflationary pressures emerges or whether there has been some longer-term change in the structure that, as some people in the business community argue, has essentially killed the inflation expectations bugaboo I think there is no evidence of such a change There is, however, some question as to whether in fact this expansion can slow sufficiently to take pressures off the labor market, ease everything up, and make the issue of inflationary pressures moot It is much too early to say that that will happen My own judgment is that the evidence is very mixed and highly unlikely to be in that direction in the short run  It is nonetheless the case that less final demand is being generated now by a net increase in the stock of motor vehicles or the stock of plant and equipment That is the saturation argument One should remember that the net increase in property accounts plus the net increase in the stock of consumer durables--that is, after depreciation--is the private capital account component of GDP We can compare it with GDP to get a judgment as to the extent that the element of saturation is adding to or subtracting from GDP It is the issue that I raised when I said there were two types of inventories the stock of capital and business inventories The growth in the stock of capital moderated in the third quarter, as best we can judge, putting downward pressure on GDP and on final demand  I think the regular inventory data are interesting, especially in the context of their being historically low by any measure But the level of inventories is not relevant in the short run for the GDP forecast It is the rate of change that is relevant,  -31-    11/13/96  and a change clearly can occur at any level irrespective of where the inventory-sales ratios may be While I think there is some reasonable argument to be made that a goodly part of the inventory accumulation we are seeing is voluntary--in the sense that all the surveys we monitor do not point to particular problems--we do have to account for the fact that the underlying prices of commodities and materials have taken a big turn to the south Steel scrap prices have fallen off a ledge I think the reason in part is competition from imports It may also be increased capacity As I am sure Messrs Jordan and Moskow are both picking up in order books into the first quarter of next year are coming in below expectations If that continues, it may reflect some weakening in the consumption of domestic steel or it may be that imports are really becoming an issue that is going to be something for the steel industry to be concerned about In addition, aluminum prices are under significant downward pressure They obviously are more subject to international pressures than steel prices in the United States, certainly more so than steel scrap prices Copper is weak All the industrial prices are getting soft These are not the types of numbers we usually see when there is a big voluntary inventory surge So, the inventory issue is by no means clear  I think all of you have argued quite correctly that the retail market--and personal consumption expenditures more broadly--is the key to the outlook for economic activity I did have somebody on the Board's staff look at the historical relationships and try to re- work the consumer credit data to put them back into gross extensions minus repayments, equalling the change in consumer credit, as we in fact used to do We have some unpublished information that probably gives us a leg up on it It shows, as you might well imagine, a very sharp decline in gross extensions When we get, as hopefully we will shortly, the ratios of gross extensions to retail sales for certain groups, we will have a better view as to whether there is anything to the argument that particular groups are being liquidity constrained I am not saying this information will tell us a great deal, but it may add something to our understanding of this puzzling third quarter We have been through a lot of periods in which consumer expenditures have slowed and then picked up again Unless the business cycle is dead, however, there will be a point at which that pickup will not occur The question is when, and perhaps these consumer credit numbers will tell us something in this regard I have been concerned about the level of consumer debt, as you know, since the beginning of the year I have taken over from Governor Lindsey, who has thrown me a lateral, and I am running with it for a while anyway I gave him the worry about the stock market [Laughter] This division of labor is probably worthwhile  It is too soon to tell what is happening to Christmas sales, but remember that we do not get much of the fourth-quarter personal consumption expenditures from the October data The real action is in November and December, and the monthly seasonals are not one-third, one-third, one-third They clearly are biased significantly toward the November data, which we do not have  I think one of the more interesting unanswered questions gets down to the housing industry As Mike Prell pointed out, it is weakening but there are two fascinating trends One is home sales, which as you know have gone straight up The other is single-family  -32-    11/13/96  permits net of cancellations, which are essentially single-family housing starts plus the change in the permits backlog, and that number has gone straight down It is at its lowest level in more than a year If we look at a chart, the sales figures go up like that and the net permits figures go down, with the starts in the middle If we reconcile them statistically, what we find is that not only does the permits backlog drop very sharply but so does the inventory of new homes The changes in those two inventories essentially account for the different trends in sales and permits This raises an interesting issue Have the homebuilders decided that the markets are weakening, which is what is reflected in their reports to the National Association of Homebuilders, and are they therefore trying to reduce their advance commitments and inventories by pushing the excess supply out into the market? That would not be inconsistent with the relatively soft prices of new home sales Or is the demand for new homes really much stronger than they have committed to and consumers are pulling out what the builders have been putting into the pipeline much faster than they expected so that they will be forced very shortly to pick up their permits activity and their starts activity? My guess is that the odds are still in the direction of the first scenario But unless October home sales are down, which I think is very likely, we have a very interesting dilemma about what is going on in this market And since this is such a big cyclical component in the current, immediate context, it along with personal consumption expenditures will be a key player in determining where this economy is going  For the moment, I would say from a policy point of view that these developments leave us just about where we have been recently I think it would be premature to pull back on the asymmetry As long as the labor markets remain as tight as they are, inflation can turn up on a dime Were we to go back to symmetry and then suddenly have to tighten, I think that would put us in an awkward position So I think we ought to stay where we are, at least through the December meeting I would recommend "B" asymmetric Vice Chairman   President Parry   President Broaddus   President Jordan   Governor Rivlin   President Boehne   President Melzer   President Minehan   President Guynn  -35-    11/13/96   President Moskow   President Stern   President Hoenig   President McTeer   Governor Kelley   Governor Phillips   Governor Yellen   Governor Lindsey   Finally, Governor Meyer   Thank you Would you read the directive which encompasses that?   Call the roll   Good morning, everyone This is Tom Davis's last meeting He has been coming to these meetings for 20 years, and I suspect that by now he knows what they are all about, and just as he finally gets it, he has to leave I think he has made an extraordinary niche in the System, and if there is ever a plaque in Jackson Hole, his name will be on it One thing that you can say about the Jackson Hole symposium, which of course Tom struggled mightily to help bring into existence, is that we all put the symposium on our calendar each year and then adjust everything else Tom, we certainly are going to miss you [Applause]   If it means the end of Jackson Hole, Tom is coming back no matter where he is! [Laughter]  Shall we start off? Would somebody like to move approval of the minutes for the meeting of November 13?   Why don't you do that The problem here is that minutes are supposed to interpret what the FOMC members said, even when they are wrong So, you can't argue that the minutes are wrong when they record what was said; you can only argue that they are wrong when the Secretariat inappropriately summarized what individual members said   Does the statement refer to what you said or to what one of your colleagues said?   I presume, as President Moskow says, that this is a solvable problem and not something that we have to    12/17/96  discuss here at length Let us get it done Without objection, we will give you all of our proxies   Peter Fisher   You mentioned that the dollar is holding up remarkably well considering the degree of downward pressure on dollar-denominated asset markets A while ago, we discussed whether in fact one could ferret out the apparent intermediate- to longer-term effect on the dollar from rising dollar interest rates, the presumption being that as US interest rates rise, other things equal, the dollar will rise The experience you are noting and the experience that we have discussed previously is that in periods of significant worldwide sales of dollar-denominated assets and rising US interest rates, our exchange rate falls or tends to We presumably were going to be looking at whether there is any systematic analysis we can do to differentiate those contradictory phenomena Have you made any progress on that?   The presumption, of course, is that if a significant part of dollar asset sales occurs on foreign accounts and the proceeds are exchanged into other currencies that would explain the decline in the dollar Obviously, sales of dollar-denominated assets in which there is no exchange into foreign currencies by definition do not have that effect In this regard, I take it that you do not have any information on sales of dollar-denominated securities or purchases by foreign accounts that is usable on a sufficiently short-term basis You only have it on a quarterly basis, not a monthly basis   You talk like an economist! [Laughter]   President Melzer   President Guynn   President Broaddus   President Minehan   He is creating unemployment! [Laughter]   If there are no other questions, would somebody like to move to ratify the Desk's domestic operations?   The next meeting is February 4 and 5, which is a Humphrey-Hawkins meeting  END OF MEETING  -40-       Without objection Let us now go on to Messrs Prell and Truman   Mike, what is the change in the December industrial production index that is implicit in your fourth-quarter average?   The weekly data, for what they are worth, are suggesting that it is flat to down   So, I gather they will affect the quarter by only 1 or 2 percent   The total percentage change from the third to the fourth quarters if you are only affecting the December index   President Parry   Who would like to start the roundtable? President Hoenig   President Parry   President Moskow   Mike, our reports from somewhat softer than what you are reporting They have solid orders through January, softening in February, and there is no indication of firming into the second quarter Did you check with them as well?   Their cold-rolled sheet demand coming from autos is pretty good, but their pipe demand is poor As I recall, they had not yet filled their first-quarter order books The mini-mills, I suspect, are doing a good deal better, so your sample may have been more in that direction   That is true President Minehan   President Guynn  PRESIDENT GUYNN Thank you, Mr Chairman Reports that we get from around the Atlanta District indicate that growth has moderated somewhat since the summer, and the slowdown seems to be continuing into the fourth quarter The signs of that slowdown are most apparent in residential construction and homes sales, but they also show up in consumer and commercial loan demand Manufacturing activity remains subdued, but businesses are optimistic about the near-term outlook We are seeing for the first time some speculative office building in Atlanta and in some cities in Florida, but such building is not at a level that is worrisome at the moment A particularly robust tourist season is helping the economy throughout Florida and in Nashville, but the gaming industry, which has become a big business in the South, is going through some restructuring and some shakeout and is doing particularly poorly in the city of New Orleans  Job creation in our District, which we have reported meeting after meeting as stronger than the national average, now lags behind the nation as a whole Labor markets remain tight in many areas As is the case nationwide, these labor shortages have yet to manifest themselves in significant wage pressures Finally, retailers in the District report that they have gotten off to a strong holiday season in November I am reluctant to make any predictions based on that limited information, but they are still cautiously optimistic about the month of December  The financial crisis in the city of Miami is creating quite a stir, with considerable negative publicity Our reading is that the situation, while serious, does not involve a large amount of dollars since the city of Miami is a relatively small and poor core of a much larger and healthier metropolitan Dade County area Interestingly, one of our Atlanta Bank directors has been named by the Governor of the State of Florida as one of the five oversight committee members  At the national level, the economy does appear to be showing some signs of slowing For me, the major uncertainties continue to be whether labor shortages will eventually begin to be reflected in inflationary wage pressures, whether consumer demand will slow, and what will happen with government expenditures So far, there is no indication that labor shortages have been severe enough to cause rising wage inflation We have talked a great deal in the past about the influence of job uncertainty on workers, and the threat or actual influence of competition, both domestic and foreign, that still seem to be keeping wage pressures in check Our forecast suggests that consumer spending will be maintained despite a decline in the growth of personal income In line with the assessment in the Greenbook, we do not feel that current consumer spending has been buoyed significantly by the run-up in stock market prices Finally, a point that Bob Parry made, it is likely that government demand will remain moderate in the near future Federal spending has been on a downward track and the recent announcement by the President that  -16-    12/17/96  obtaining a balanced budget would be a top priority would suggest that this trend will continue Similarly, while states may feel the need to initiate many expensive infrastructure projects, major uncertainties concerning welfare and other federal programs that may get pushed down to the states for funding will probably act to damp state spending in the near term  All things considered, I expect economic growth to slow somewhat in the period immediately ahead, perhaps to a rate of around 2 percent, and to pick up somewhat later in 1997 and into 1998 Inflation and unemployment are likely to hold at the levels that we have been seeing recently Thank you, Mr Chairman   President McTeer   President Broaddus   President Boehne   President Stern   President Melzer   Vice Chairman   Governor Rivlin   President Jordan   Governor Kelley   Governor Phillips  -25-    12/17/96   Governor Meyer   Governor Lindsey   I will make another speech [Laughter]   Governor Yellen  -30-    12/17/96   Thank you all We can go to coffee now  [Coffee break]   Mr Kohn   Questions for Don? I guess you overwhelmed everybody   The Vice Chairman is suggesting applause but don't [Laughter]  If there are no questions, let me get started on policy and the directive As many of you have mentioned, no really significant changes have occurred since the last meeting The numbers go up and down, all sorts of adjustments take place, and one can easily get mesmerized by small changes, but the evidence suggests that there just has not been much change in the economy since our last meeting I believe it is correct to say that the expansion is moving along at a reasonably good pace; its underpinnings are fairly solid There is no credible evidence of cumulative deterioration Goldilocks may not be the type of story that Governor Lindsey feels appropriate for his children, but the principle of Goldilocks probably will live on for at least a short period of time, though my fear is that her locks are going to get clipped at some point reasonably soon  Personal consumption expenditures appear to be running at a moderate pace The Christmas data are always very difficult to read I would suggest to Governor Yellen that her survey has a problem in that there are five fewer shopping days than usual before Christmas--   --so there are more cars per square minute [laughter] than we normally would expect Nonetheless, as Mike Prell points out, the weekly seasonally adjusted data on chain store sales do show some significant strength I presume that our X-ll seasonal adjustment program is not mesmerized by the shorter selling season phenomenon  I thought that, to date, the slightly disappointing December motor vehicle sales number was perhaps just as important as the somewhat firmer Christmas season sales in the usual GAF goods categories Given shortfalls in the last month or two in motor vehicle sales owing to the strike, one would have expected these data to start coming back this month But, to date, the surveys that Mike Moskow has made and that we are making ourselves do not show any significant improvement in motor vehicle sales It is conceivable, since we are only halfway through the month, that we could get a lot  -32-    12/17/96  of action over the rest of the month in both regular Christmas buying and motor vehicle sales I would say that for the moment it is not self-evident that we will have very strong growth in personal consumption expenditures in the fourth quarter, but clearly growth will be markedly above the pace in the third quarter I think consumer spending in that quarter was artificially reduced, in part by Department of Commerce adjustments for the hurricane and that sort of thing  One interesting aspect of consumer markets can be seen from a disaggregation we have made of consumer credit into gross extensions, repayments, and net change, the latter being our published number This statistical construction has much the same form as was used a number of years ago in publishing installment credit extensions and repayments What it shows is a very significant increase in the last year or two in the ratio of nonautomotive gross extensions to nonautomotive retail sales That was the case until the last couple of observations, for October and November, when all of a sudden it looked as though consumer credit had hit a ceiling After rising like this, it went flat This is consistent with the general notion that consumers as a group may be running up against some credit limit  To test this hypothesis, I asked the staff to try to use our Survey of Consumer Finances, which we conduct every three years, in conjunction with the data on income quintiles and the flow-of-funds aggregates to estimate the different types of household assets by income groups Those statistics were employed to make judgments as to how the household balance sheet would look on a disaggregated basis as we moved well into 1996 Granted that there is a lot of weakness in all of these data, there is a certain robustness to the result because we do have, in addition to income, controlling aggregates of consumer credit and stock market wealth including equity mutual funds Even though a lot of statistical manipulations are involved, the robustness of the results is really quite remarkable when we have very strong trends The numbers that we endeavor to adjust in a matrix with controlled rows and columns and nonnegative components are constrained by algebra The matrix algebra severely limits how much leeway we have in the various cells, provided they are all nonnegative or zero, which they are  The end result of all of this confirms the fact that consumers at the lower end of the income distribution indeed have more significant consumer debts than equity assets, which are the two big surging items that have been moving household balance sheets of late This is consistent with the notion of some constraint on consumer spending, although the detail that we have and the limited breakdown of only five quintiles are not in and of themselves all that conclu- sive All one can say is that there are not enough assets, specifi- cally equity assets, on the balance sheets of those with constraining consumer debt to overwhelm the debt argument That is, the data suggest that there is a fairly large number of individual households that have a lot of consumer debt and very little equity assets or indeed much of anything else This, in a sense, confirms the fact that there is some debt limit against which we are running, although one can argue it is not all that much of a constraint It is a constraint against an acceleration in spending but clearly not one that suggests a pulling back It may well be part of the explanation as to why the wealth effect on consumer spending seems to be falling  -33-    12/17/96  somewhat short of econometric estimates that we obtain from the aggregate data when we try to filter out the impact of changes in the value of equity market holdings on personal consumption expenditures I hope to be able to get something more out of this data system, but it is hard to know because a lot of guesswork is going into our equations, and we are not quite sure whether what we are getting out is the guesswork we put in! [Laughter]  On the residential building issue, a quick appraisal of the sharp rise in starts reported this morning suggests that it is going to be partly retraced in December The reason is that the best short- term forecasting system that I have seen on housing starts is one that tries to track the pace of net permits through to the starts figures November data show, as indeed I think we have seen in the past, that the level of net permits, meaning permits adjusted to the level of starts less cancellations, is significantly below the current level of starts whereas they were above in October One of the ways of looking at the November figure is in terms of the pipeline effect, which is in fact the question that Jerry Jordan was raising There is some evidence that what is in the pipeline at this stage is well under the level of single-family starts My guess is that we will get some retrenchment Indeed, whenever the permits backlog declines, the probability of a retrenchment in starts the next month is a good deal better than 50/50 Having said that, all the other evidence, including that sharp rise in mortgage loan applications for the week ended December 6 shown in the mortgage bankers' weekly release, has been rather startling I do not know whether I should believe the seasonal, but if one looks at the data, it goes like this and then there is a spike Usually that means that something is happening even though it may be exaggerated in the data So, I think there is good evidence that while December starts may be down, the residential real estate market is probably in the process of stabilizing  The inventory data, as a number of you have mentioned, are really quite benign, and it is hard to find any significant changes in inventory investment in either direction The October figures in constant dollars were running at the pace of the third quarter There is no reason to believe that anything of great significance is going to occur The only point that may be worth making is that there were somewhat more imported inventories implicit in the third-quarter data than is normal, so it may be that the size of the adjustment if we go to a slower inventory investment level will be somewhat less The one caveat there is that theoretically one should see those imported inventories reflected on the import side of the GDP accounts As hard as Ted Truman's people have worked on finding it, it is not there, which I would guess is a statistical discrepancy rather than reality But no matter how one cuts it, there does not seem to be anything of importance in the inventory data  Wages do appear to be accelerating very modestly, but let me caution you on the 8 percent increase in the November figure for average hourly earnings The fixed-weight numbers are lower; the fixed-weight plus adjustment for the overtime number that we calculate brings the increase down to about 4 percent from 8 percent Nonetheless, even with all of these adjustments, we are still getting a mild degree of acceleration, which has not ceased As a consequence of that, I have also asked the staff to work a little more on getting a better sense numerically of this tradeoff question between job  -34-    12/17/96  security and wage gains At my suggestion, they put together a very interesting model that provides clear evidence that the trend of job leavers has been very flat in the context of a falling unemployment rate At least historically, that is not the way labor markets are supposed to function The staff has very cleverly been able to extract the average duration of unemployment for job leavers consistent with that overall statistic One would presume, and indeed the data do show, that the number of job leavers is a function of the average period of unemployment--that is, a proxy for the cost of becoming unemployed The longer the duration is, the greater the possibility that becoming unemployed is going to be very costly to a worker, and hence the worker will be increasingly disinclined to leave These data do in fact, with one caveat, suggest that a goodly part of the shortfall in the ability of our regular wage equation to project what actually has been happening is correlated with this statistic The caveat is that, as you all know, we had a discontinuity in the household series as of January 1994, and the job leaver series has gone a little off kilter I am not sure it means all that much, but until we ascertain that the discontinuity is not creating a lot of this correlation with the residuals from our Phillips wage equations, it would not be that convincing to use this type of model as a numerical measure of the job insecurity/wage gain tradeoff  I might add that the type of residuals that we are talking about, if translated into a system in which everything is exactly on track but where the NAIRU is the residual unknown variable, would imply a NAIRU well under 5 percent to bring all this together So, we are getting a gradual increase in labor costs in a data system that is explaining a phenomenon known in principle to be transitional The only issue is when the transition period will end and we will get a normal reacceleration of wages at lower unemployment levels than they have been historically but where the rate of change in wages and its effect on prices revert to historical patterns  Remember that this wage shortfall also mirrors the opening up of operating profits What one must assume about all of this is that we are getting such a benign price pattern in this environment because these very large operating margins are creating a rate of return on equity that is higher than normal This is another way of saying that, if any competitor tries to move prices up in that environment, the profit margins of other competitors are such as to enable them to compete at a lower price and still be above their hurdle rate of return on equity We do not have to bring into the equation all sorts of noneconomic forces to explain these price phenomena It is the old basic rate of return on capital that is keeping the cap on the price level What is keeping the return on capital up is the subnormal rate of wage increases When one element goes, the whole thing starts to unravel There is no evidence at this stage that that is occurring, but it is going to happen at some point When it happens, we are going to find that we are back on the old track  I guess the key question is the same issue that we raised last time Will the economy soften sufficiently quickly to take the pressure off the wage structure before the transition occurs? I would say at this stage that there is as yet no evidence to suggest any such softening Order patterns still look reasonably solid; the levels of consumer confidence are beyond belief at this stage; there are very  -35-    12/17/96  few imbalances of the kind that usually have led to problems historically; profit margins apparently have flattened out, but they surely have not turned down As a consequence, we are still faced with pressures in the labor market such that, if the latter ever reverts to a normal pattern, a whole new set of inflationary forces will be created Therefore, while I think we can stay at "B" for a while as we assess whether diminished demand pressures in the economy will reduce pressures in the labor markets before this transitional process is over, I believe we confront a far greater likelihood that the next move will be up rather than down So, I would hope that we can stay asymmetric today and still remain at "B" Vice Chairman   I accept your definition of asymmetry Governor Rivlin   President Parry   President Moskow   President Broaddus   President Minehan   President Hoenig   President Guynn   President Boehne   President Melzer   Governor Kelley   Governor Phillips   President Stern  -38-    12/17/96   President McTeer   Governor Yellen   President Jordan   Governor Lindsey   Finally, Governor Meyer   Thank you The consensus appears to be "B" asymmetric Would you read the directive that would accomplish that?   Call the roll   Good morning, everyone Is Mike Prell coming?   Would someone like to approve the minutes of the  February 4-5 meeting?  SPEAKER(?) So move   Without objection Mr Fisher, you are on   Before I ask a question, I have a hypothesis It is  conceivable that the 1982 report on System holdings of individual securities slipped between  the drawer and the bottom of somebody's desk and that created a precedent [Laughter]  Therefore, the data were not published in 1982 and it was presumed that they should not be  thereafter I say that only half tongue in cheek  Questions for Peter? Starting with his second request, is there any objection to  including the detailed portfolio information in the annual report? If not, we will assume that  it is acceptable, and we need a vote on domestic operations   Without objection We also need a vote on the  intermeeting leeway   It has been moved Is there a second?   Let me see if it creates grammatical monstrosities to  reverse the sequence in the last sentence  Let me remind everybody that we are going to lunch to say our best departing  words to Janet Yellen, and a lot of people will be there who do not have access to what we  have done The announcement will not be released until 215 pm Please be particularly  careful in observing this central bank confidence It may or may not be crucial, but it would  be awful to find that somebody picked up something and it got out prior to the 215 pm  release to the press Also, as Joe Coyne will tell you, we have a rule about not commenting  about what we have done during the next week I merely emphasize that  We have no further business except to note that our next meeting is on May 20  See you all at lunch Lunch is at 100 pm?   There is a second Without objection Thank you  all Let's move on with record speed to Mr Prell   Questions for Mike?   President Minehan   President Parry   Any further questions for Mike? If not, who would  like to start the roundtable? President Broaddus   There is a wide range of opinions in the way our  society is looking at this inflation phenomenon I don't remember it ever being so broad I  am not talking about the uninformed; I am talking about people who are participating in the  system President Jordan   President Hoenig   President Parry   President Moskow    3/25/97   President Minehan   I used to write COBOL Maybe I could go into  business Perhaps I should make a few telephone calls! [Laughter]    3/25/97   Vice Chair   Mr Guynn   We will increase Federal Reserve earnings!   President Boehne   President Stem   Governor Rivlin   Okay, let's do it! [Laughter]   President Melzer   President McTeer   Governor Meyer   Governor Kelley   Is that the result of the floods?   I am glad you restrained yourself from referring to  the notion of excess liquidity [Laughter]   Governor Phillips, I think you better talk now    3/25/97   I assume that the Beigebook did pass through the  group around this table before it got out to the public I would suggest that you all go back  and read it It really is quite interesting to see the difference between what is in that  document and what was said around this table today Shall we go to coffee?  [Coffee break]   Mr Kohn   Questions for Don? If not, let me start off It is  quite evident that we have come to a point, as we suggested we might at the last meeting,  where as Don put it--how did you put it?   We have to "deliver" Let me, however, review the  various aspects of what is going on and try to put them into a policy context, which I think  we need to fashion fairly carefully Let me start with something that has not been discussed  very much around the table this morning The proposition that inflation has stopped falling is  not readily provable That may seem to be a rather ridiculous statement, but if we look at the  data, what we see is that the rate of inflation, no matter how we look at it, has been edging  lower with some bumps here and there Even if we add back the BLS adjustments, that  conclusion is not changed significantly; it certainly is not changed with respect to the GDP  chain-weighted index and the like The reason is very clearly that productivity is badly  underestimated and indeed may actually be accelerating If we start with the proposition that  price levels are moving up very modestly, that domestic operating profit margins are stable  or maybe slightly improved, and that consolidated nonlabor costs in the nonfinancial    3/25/97  corporate sector are going nowhere, we necessarily end up with the conclusion that on a  consolidated basis unit labor costs in the nonfinancial corporate sector, as I mentioned at the  last meeting, are not moving very much, if at all Since we know what compensation per  hour is doing, it necessarily follows that productivity has to be rising almost as much as the  compensation numbers Indeed, all the anecdotal stories that we hear tend to confirm that  This suggests, as Mike Prell pointed out, that we may finally be getting the productivity gains  that many have anticipated from the synergies created by the rapidly developing computer  technology information structure The gains surely seem to be showing up in a lot of areas,  and it is very difficult to understand the profitability numbers we are looking at without some  reference to significant improvements in productivity The reported per share profit figures, I  should add, are stronger than domestic operating earnings despite the fact that the dollar has  been firming That's because the earnings of foreign affiliates, which are a significant  portion of both the S&P 500 index and the NIPA data, have been rising rather strongly and  indeed have been an increasing share of total profits over the last couple of years So, we  have to discount the reported profits at least slightly But even after doing that, we still get a  sense that the rate of increase in operating profits of domestic firms probably implies  modestly accelerating productivity  The reason why manufacturers in particular and business people more generally  have the view that inflation is dead and the economy is in a new era is that that is the way it  feels to them In other words, if we examine individual company accounts, we find that  business firms are offsetting their cost increases fairly aggressively and quite successfully  They are not able to raise prices Pricing power is gone, and the reason it is gone, as we have  discussed previously, is that competitors have sufficiently high rates of return to enable them    3/25/97  to undercut price increases and go for market share, should some firm try to raise its prices  This also implies that a degree of slack still exists in the system that all these business people  can see You can speak to any of the most sophisticated corporate managers, and you will  get exactly the same story The answer, of course, is that as sophisticated and farseeing as  they may be, their time frame is too short for the purposes of monetary policy Indeed, as we  might put it in a macro sense, there are certain realities that are consistent with perceptions of  the individual companies but inconsistent with the macro data  First of all, it is pretty clear at this stage that the tightness in labor markets is  increasing Initial claims for insured unemployment continue at a very low level, showing no  signs of turning up Insured unemployment data have moved off the previous track and have  gone down Help-wanted advertising, which admittedly is not the world's most reliable  statistic, has suddenly perked up in recent months in a way that we have not seen for a  number of years Most importantly, as a number of you have pointed out, labor force  participation now seems to be rising after being stagnant And if we look at the internal  structure of the workforce, we see that employers are hiring marginal workers The first sign  of some labor market pressure is that new workers are recruited from outside the labor force  The problem is that there is no way to increase the working age population, which means  that we can expand our labor resources only up to a point We then run out of qualified  people to hire The numbers in this regard look quite impressive We also are seeing that  average weekly hours are moving up, and in a sense we are running out of space to expand,  at least in terms of labor market resources The reason I emphasize this is that it is far  simpler to evaluate capacity use in the labor market than capacity use of other producer  resources, and since either labor or capital utilization limits can restrain economic growth, we    3/25/97  need not argue that both constraints are in place All we need is for one to be exerting a  constraining effect and labor supply clearly is  It is very difficult to see the emergence of resource constraints in the nonlabor  structure The reason, of course, is that advancing technology has created a degree of  flexibility that we never had before Not only can business firms now produce customized  products in small batches through computerized and rationalized production techniques that  they did not have previously, but they can also add features or take them away--do whatever  they want--in a way they never had the flexibility to do before This means that the concept  of capacity is far more flexible than ever The only way that we can detect obvious  difficulties or pressures is by watching such things as lead times on deliveries, overtime  hours, or other measures of tightness that are symptoms of the difficulty of using the existing  state of technology to adapt capacity and facilities to unanticipated developments One way  business firms have accomplished all of that is by moving to a quite remarkable just-in-time  inventory system They have tightened the production system to a point where, as part of its  flexibility, they have the capability of essentially not having inventories other than work in  process Indeed, part of the improvement in productivity has resulted from squeezing down  the way businesses use resources As a consequence, inventories measured in terms of days'  supply at factory value are now at very low levels  The reason I raise the issue of factory value is that when we are looking at a  demand system, the markup of inventories in the distribution channels is not a truly relevant  consideration We are interested in the number of shoes in the distribution channel if we are  calculating production; we are not interested in the constant dollar value of those inventories  because that will change depending on where they are in the production and distribution    3/25/97  process While I may exaggerate when I say that the markup for the inventories is not all that  important, it nonetheless is not as valuable in measuring the tightness of supply and demand  as the factory value numbers For purposes of measuring GDP, the markup obviously  increases value added, which is why we calculate it, but it does not give us information about  the supply of shoes It just tells us what the value added has been in the distribution process  One problem with just-in-time inventory systems is that resource use is very  tight Consequently, if anything abnormal emerges, there is a marked rise in delivery lead  times or bottlenecks All of a sudden people who think just-in-time inventory management  is terrific find that they now need to add some safety stocks What happens is that the  inventory pattern then begins to turn around even though days' supply may not go up very  much  In the current situation, since inventory-sales ratios at factory value have been  coming down in general, inventory investment could go up quite abruptly As a consequence  of such a development, there is a very clear underlying tightness in the current inventory  situation that is creating significantly more risk on the upside than we had earlier, certainly  more than in the summer of 1996 when inventories had backed up and there was a degree of  slack in the system That slack has essentially been pulled out of the system at this stage  It is very hard to believe that personal consumption expenditures are not  significantly affected by the wealth effect Leaving aside the econometrics, I think that  whenever we get as huge an increase in financial market wealth as we have gotten, people at  some point begin to believe that it is permanent They start thinking that it is not going to  disappear right away and that they are now in a sense richer That attitude begins to have an  impact on consumption expenditures Indeed, if we look at the decline in risk premiums    3/25/97  and/or the cost of capital, what that means essentially is that we are progressively discounting  the future less If we examine the normal processes by which time-dependent investments  are made, as the risk premiums and the discount factors fall, we see that production is  brought up front from the future Capital assets are produced today on the basis of expected  returns much further in the future than was true in the previous periods As the risk  premiums fall, the time preference moves into the future and picks up additional current  demand I think we are seeing that in consumption expenditures and in home sales  Let me just add parenthetically that awhile back I discussed the discrepancy  between the level of home sales and the levels of housing starts and permits What we were  observing was that the level of starts was being supported by declines in permit backlogs and  the level of permits was being held down by sales drawn out of housing inventories I am  talking about single-family homes We now are seeing for the first time at least some pickup  in the permit backlogs This indicates that sales of single-family homes out of existing  stocks finally are beginning to induce builders to take out more permits for new home  construction While I certainly grant that the February data were an aberration, they do tend  to suggest that housing activity may not be moderating  Certainly, plant and equipment expenditures are crucially related to this time  preference issue and are undoubtedly being affected by the evidently continuing rise in the  prices of commercial real estate and the quite pronounced decline in vacancies, especially in  suburban areas We are beginning to see some upward movement in commercial rents  Having said all of that, we are not at this stage moving into what I would describe  as an overheated boom We are short of that For example, it is certainly the case that  homebuilding is at a relatively high level, but it is not accelerating Motor vehicle sales, I    3/25/97  think, are a little softer than Mike Moskow was suggesting Our reading of the same people  he spoke to a week ago comes out with a slightly smaller number Chain store sales have  tended to flatten out In other words, this economy is not running away to a degree that  would suggest we have to hold everything in place What we have at this stage is a situation  that is clearly evolving over time In fact, as I said at the beginning of my comments, we still  do not have concrete evidence to suggest that the inflation rate has stopped going down In  this situation, we can allow ourselves a fairly considerable amount of time to act Therefore,  I do not think that there is any particular urgency to move in a very aggressive way I do  think we have to move, but I don't think that we have to be concerned about being behind the  curve in any measurable way  Certainly, there are some principles that clearly need to be kept in mind here One  is that recent experience tends to reinforce our view that low inflation is very positive to  economic growth, to employment, to stability, to all the good things we talk about with  respect to the economy Therefore, it is crucial to keep inflation low The argument that we  can wait until we see signs of inflation before taking action fails to take account of how  important this low inflation environment apparently has been in enhancing the recent  performance of the economy It strikes me that whatever we do, we need above all to make  certain that we keep inflation low, risk premiums low, and the cost of capital low We  recognize that that can create unusual problems within balance sheets and the like, and  members have expressed some concerns regarding those problems of late Nonetheless, if  we are talking about long-term equilibrium, high market values are better than low market  values What we are trying to avoid is bubbles that break, volatility, and the like, but we are    3/25/97  not opposed to the implications of low inflation, which include relatively low risk premiums  and fairly strong economic activity  I conclude that what we clearly need at this stage is finally to move off the dime I  think that 25 basis points is enough for now; indeed, I will argue against 50 basis points in a  minute It is conceivable that economic growth may slow, and it is possible to interpret the  data we have seen as suggesting that backlogs, new orders, and sales are beginning to turn  sluggish outside the high-tech area As far as the high-tech sector is concerned, we have seen  a very strong acceleration over the last two or three years that is numerically unsustainable  because if that rate of growth were to continue, the high-tech area would soon account for  120 percent of GDP! That clearly is not going to happen I think the stock market is telling  us that the growth projections implicit in some of those earnings forecasts for high-tech  industries are unrealistic, and there is some evidence that this sector is beginning to flatten  out One of the reasons why I suspect that Microsoft is not moving terribly fast in coming  out with a Windows 97 is the fact that they are getting some resistance to all these  technological changes There is a physical incapability of putting in one software revision  after the other, and this reaction could very well be in the process of occurring  I would not rule out as a significant probability, perhaps not a high probability,  that the current economic expansion is on the verge of some slowing If that does happen, 25  basis points is not going to be a major inhibiting factor, but 50 basis points, which the market  is not expecting, could be very jolting indeed  I want to recall a conversation we had when we last decided to move up the federal  funds rate after a long period of no change That was in February 1994 We had a lengthy  discussion as to whether we would move 50 basis points or 25 basis points We did 25 basis    3/25/97  points and the market almost fell apart, but not because they did not expect us to move As  you all know, I had been out there in the immediately preceding weeks in effect waving a red  flag saying we were about to do something We did it and somebody asked, "Why didn't you  tell us?"  At this stage, the market is expecting 25 basis points It has discounted such a  move, frankly, but it has done so in a positive way, not a negative way The stock markets  are up this morning; the bond market is up I think that if we were to move 50 basis points  today after a long period of doing nothing, though being vigilant if you like, we suddenly  would shock the market into thinking that we must feel that we are behind the curve We are  not behind the curve, and we have a lot of time to take various actions as we perceive the  need to take them  I think the odds are better than 50/50 that the move we are considering will not be  our last tightening move We are very likely to have to move again, though I see a low  probability of a very considerable near-term acceleration that would raise inflationary  pressures and require us to move before our May meeting, which you will remember is two  months away I think we would have to have a telephone conference to consider such a  move partly because the views regarding the risks of rising inflation among our constituents,  especially the business community, deviate so far from where we are that it is very important  for us not only to move appropriately but also to make certain that people understand why we  are doing it You may recall that there was a fairly broad consensus at our last meeting that  we ought to condition the markets in the Humphrey-Hawkins testimony to the likelihood that  we were finally going to move I think that was a desirable thing for us to do I would say  that the stage is set for us to take action, and I would argue that we should do only 25 basis    3/25/97  points I must say that it definitely would be better to do 25 basis points than to do nothing  I believe a failure to act would be a major mistake, given what we see out there in the  economy  I would prefer symmetry at this stage if for no other reason than our having been  asymmetric for so long I am worried about devaluing the currency so to speak I do not think  that symmetry or asymmetry will affect our actions one way or the other, and I must tell you  that I do not feel strongly about my preference If we were to move further before the next  meeting, we would do so with a preceding telephone conference, so as a practical matter the  symmetry or asymmetry doesn't mean anything in this situation It does, however, establish  a presumption that we probably would move again in May The issue is basically whether  we want to convey that notion in advance, because having asymmetry and then not moving  again is something that I think we ought not to get involved with In sum, my view on the  symmetry/asymmetry issue is more a mechanical than a policy matter Governor Rivlin   Governor Meyer    3/25/97   Vice Chair   President Hoenig   President Broaddus   President Parry   President Moskow   President Minehan   President Boehne   President Stem   President Guynn   Governor Phillips    3/25/97   President Melzer   Governor Kelley   President Jordan   We have acceptance of 25 basis points and--I'm  sorry President McTeer   Ditto what?   I knew I was missing an important voice   There is a marginal consensus toward symmetry as  the first choice Therefore, I will ask your vote on 25 basis points with symmetry   Given the possibility that we would do this, I  already have a draft of what we may want to announce I will read the whole draft  announcement  "The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to tighten money market  conditions slightly, expecting the federal funds rate to rise about 1/4 percentage point to  around 5-1/2 percent  This action was taken in light of persisting strength in demand, which has  progressively increased the risk of inflationary imbalances developing that would eventually  undermine the long expansion  In these circumstances, the slight firming of monetary conditions is viewed as a  prudent step that affords greater assurance of continuing the current low inflation  environment for the rest of this year and next and prolonging the economic expansion The  experience of the last several years has reinforced the conviction that low inflation is  essential to realizing the economy's fullest growth potential  No change was made in the Federal Reserve discount rate, which remains at 5  percent"  Is that acceptable to everybody? I would put it out in the name of the Committee  because this is such an important document I hope you do not mind in this context   Sure   Let me think about whether the grammar holds    3/25/97   You favor reversing the order in that sentence?   That is the reason the previous sentence says in part  "and prolonging the economic expansion" It was meant to capture that thought   Would somebody like to move approval of the  minutes?   Without objection Mr Fisher   The dollar/yen decline from May 5 through this  morning is as sharp as I recall a major exchange rate ever moving Is my memory faulty or is  this a quite extraordinary shift?   Do we have any evidence that the Bank of Japan  was selling US Treasuries in this period?   In other words, you are not picking up evidence of  official intervention in the data or other sources of information, and as far as you can see, the  currency price change is strictly the result of private market forces   Since we know the particular days when the dollar  was under real tension, and I presume that we at least had the benefit of some judgment from  market sources, if not officially, as to when a lot of the intervention and related movements  of funds was occurring, can we trace such intervention to the actual days in which the dollar  was particularly weak against the yen?   It doesn't necessarily have to happen immediately   What happens is that portfolio adjustments start to  cascade--   And it takes a few days at least for that to work its  way through A lot of it is essentially automatic because individuals have no particular desire  to sell dollar holdings, but they end up with a maldistribution to which they have to adjust,  and that is what has been happening Governor Rivlin   Do we have sufficient regional data to help us  locate as we go along where an excess Treasury balance is coming from?    5/20/97   We have daily information on some regional  characteristics of the tax receipts, and we know from the statistics of income where there are  big capital-gains taxpayers and what may change Has anyone been able to infer anything  from the regional pattern?   Big Blue could do it [Laughter]   President Parry    5/20/97   Mr Hoenig   Any further questions for Peter? Would somebody  like to move approval of the Desk's operations?   Thank you, is there a second?  SPEAKER(?) Second   Our next meeting is July 1 and 2 Let's go to lunch  END OF MEETING       Without objection Let us move on to the economic  report, Mr Prell   Questions for Mike?   Can I answer that? I think there are two factors  that, taken together, are consistent with your framework One involves inventories If we  have a buildup in inventories that is incapable of being sustained at the same rate, we do not  have to have a change in the actual interest rate versus the natural rate for the growth process  to turn down What we have here is an adjustment process that is not affected by the  differential between the actual and the natural rate Secondly, there is a serious question here  about seasonal adjustments If growth in nominal demand was significantly higher,  seasonally adjusted, in the first quarter because the weather was warmer than usual, and such  growth was unusually low in the second quarter, you would not be looking for an explanation  in the real world I suspect that the combination of both of those factors is enough to explain    5/20/97  the full shift in the nominal GDP I do not know that for a fact, but it is certainly going in the  right direction   Okay, any further questions for Mike? If not,  would somebody like to start the Committee discussion? Mr President   Just remember that we cannot take a position on  political issues [Laughter]   President Parry from the Republic of California  [Laughter]   President Jordan   President Broaddus   President Boehne   President Hoenig   President Guynn   President Moskow   President Stern   President Minehan   President Melzer   Vice Chairman   Governor Rivlin   Governor Phillips   Governor Kelley   Governor Meyer   Thank you all I think we can go for coffee  [Coffee break]   Shall we resume? Mr Kohn   Questions for Don? If not, let me start off I think  the probability that we are in a very unusual era is rising A number of developments point  in that direction, and they raise some very fundamental questions about how to view this  economy and how to implement policy At the risk of being a little more definitive than    5/20/97  indeed I think is appropriate, let me sketch out what I believe may well be happening, put  that scenario on the table as a hypothesis, and then try to see what its shortcomings may be  First, we have some very significant and unexpected evidence that profit margins  are still rising at this late stage of the business cycle expansion The preliminary earnings  reports suggest that the domestic operating profits of nonfinancial corporations showed a  fairly significant rise in margins for the first quarter When we add in the dramatic rise in  foreign affiliate earnings, which have increased despite the rise in the dollar, we find a quite  impressive increase in total profits That is, if we start with the firms in the S&P 500, whose  domestic earnings are rising faster than those of smaller firms, add in the smaller companies,  and allow for the nonpublic corporations that also appear in the national income accounts  data, we see that total domestic operating margins are moving higher  This has a very interesting implication for what is going on because if we  disaggregate the data for nonfinancial corporations, it turns out that the estimated rate of  increase in total unit costs from the first quarter of 1996 to the first quarter of 1997 is close to  zero This total, which combines unit labor and unit nonlabor costs, has been moving lower  in recent years; that is, the rate of increase in underlying total unit costs has been slowing  The number for the first quarter of 1997, which is a rough estimate at this point but one that  is based on accounting relationships, is the best that we have seen in a while If we believe  that the price data are reasonably accurate, meaning that the bias is not changing very much,  and if we believe the profits estimates are about right--the latter are based on independent  earnings reports--then, by arithmetic, total unit costs could not have changed much If we  subtract nonlabor unit costs, which are comprised essentially of capital consumption  allowances and net interest per unit and which combined have been falling for quite a while--    5/20/97  you may recall that we discussed this a couple of meetings ago--the residual, unit labor costs,  can be seen to have increased at a rate of about 1 percent in the past year, and that rate of  increase, too, has been falling  Any reasonable set of numbers for average hourly compensation, which has been  rising in this period, permits us to derive productivity numbers that are accelerating  significantly--up roughly 3 percent from the first quarter of 1996 to the first quarter of 1997  Now, one should remember that this productivity estimate does not cover the full economy  When we try to reconcile this estimate with the published nonfarm business sector  productivity data that we usually deal with in our models, we run into that large anomaly of a  long-term decline in productivity for the noncorporate business sector This decline makes  no sense It seems to me that all the anecdotal evidence that comes to our attention is  consistent with the data we are getting in the nonfinancial corporate area Those are the data  that everyone sees The rest is an unfortunate fabrication that I think is distorting what we  are looking at and that distorts our policy view, with potentially significant consequences  It may well be that the rise we have seen in nonfarm business output per hour,  which is the official series, may to a large extent be explainable through econometric analysis  by the increase in the rate of growth in the economy But I have more difficulty with the  sharp acceleration in nonfinancial corporate productivity There is an inflection point in  those data that shows up very clearly in the last couple of years The question is, why? What  does it mean? Is it a statistical aberration or just a shot out of the blue? Here we have  another unexplained set of data that I must say have been bedeviling me for quite a while  This may suggest the explanation If we look at the high-tech investment area or  more generally the high-tech portion of gross domestic product, whether in nominal or real    5/20/97  terms, we get a gradual increase through the 1980s and early 1990s- But starting in 1993,  such investment tilts up sharply and progressively, and its rate of growth has not turned down  since then The question is, why? One must assume that people make investments because  they perceive prospects for increasing profitability Indeed, the presumption is that each  company has looked at its opportunities for profitable capital expansion and decided that  such investment was a good idea We have seen a fairly dramatic increase of capital  investment in the high-tech area, less growth in the non-high-tech area, and in-between  increases in the intermediate types of investment  This raises the very interesting question reminiscent of the 1989 hypothesis of Paul  David of Stanford, which I discussed at some length in previous meetings He argued that  the reason why the huge amount of computer investment prior to 1989 did not show up in  productivity was not that it was inefficient investment but that, as in the development of the  electric motor at the turn of the century, certain synergisms need to build their way into the  system before productivity gains can emerge from a major new technological insight You  may recall that, in what I found to be a very persuasive paper, Professor David looked at the  1920s and the pattern preceding it and developed a view with respect to the gradual buildup  of synergies after the introduction of the electric motor The latter initially displaced the  steam engine that had largely driven transmission belts utilizing the advantage of gravity in  tall buildings The electric motor could not do much to increase productivity in that  environment But as soon as the tall buildings were replaced by flatter ones the synergies  began to take hold and productivity picked up very substantially in the 1920s Professor  David's view was that today's high-tech change represents a comparable situation    5/20/97  Indeed, if in retrospect this hypothesis is correct, what has happened is that the  synergies finally came together in recent years mainly as the software industry in this country  expanded extensively and, as you all have observed, computer technology cumulatively  enhanced our production capabilities We presumably are seeing a rise in the potential rates  of return on marginal investments in a system in which the synergies are coming together If  that is not happening, it is very difficult to explain the protracted, very extensive expansion in  high-tech capital investment The question is whether those making the high-tech  investments were right Did rising rates of return actually materialize? The productivity data  that we are looking at here suggest "maybe" One would expect the rate of return on capital  investment to rise in real terms as productivity increases  If the inflection in the rate of growth at this late stage in the business cycle is in  fact real--and it certainly appears less and less to be statistical noise as it continues quarter by  quarter--then the issue essentially is why it is happening at a time when the unemployment  rate is so low, when employers are of necessity drawing in marginal workers, even if we  want to argue that they are not doing so extensively The answer has to be that we are getting  some long-term improvement in productivity performance cyclically adjusted and after any  other adjustment one may wish to make This would imply in the context of very tight labor  markets that we are also getting a significant shift from labor to capital resources Indeed,  that would have to be the case It does not have to be measured physical capital because it  can be intellectual capital such as managerial changes, structural changes, and a variety of  other changes that we do not include in our tangible capital stock But the question really is  whether we are indeed getting this long-term productivity increase I will come to the issue    5/20/97  that I think Al Broaddus correctly raised in this connection, namely, the implication that has  for the real long-term rate of interest  In any event, the pickup in productivity helps to explain why inflation remains so  well contained at this stage in the expansion despite the increasingly tight labor markets and  other developments that, on the basis of our historical models, would have produced  significant inflation It also may partially explain why nominal and real GDP are as strong as  they are We need to remember that output does not stem only from the demand side; it also  comes from the supply side The containment of inflation also is consistent with the general  notion, which we have discussed before, that it is very difficult for business firms to raise  prices in this environment The reason is that there is enough product slack in the economy  to restrain firms that endeavor to raise their prices because they fear the loss of market share  to competitors who may decide not to adjust their prices higher  We have what increasingly strikes me not so much as noise in the data but as  growing evidence that something quite fundamental is happening The important question is  where it goes from here It is too soon to be sure of any magnitudes I suspect that the 3  percent growth in productivity that I mentioned may well have occurred in the nonfinancial  corporate area over the last year; incidentally, that improvement has been supported by a  much stronger rate of growth in manufacturing, a significant component of that industry  grouping If those productivity estimates are correct and the productivity gain is coming  from high rates of return on the capital investment side, then the latter is not about to slow  down much, particularly at the moment  This analysis basically argues that prices are in check for a while It does not say,  however, that we have cured inflation or that capacity is unlimited in some way or another    5/20/97  It does suggest, I think, that we ought to be careful about how we evaluate what we are  doing While it is certainly the case, as Al Broaddus pointed out and others have implied,  that we do get a higher real rate of interest or, as Don Kohn correctly said, a higher marginal  product, there is a tradeoff In other words, we get both lower inflation and higher real rates  Rephrasing what Al said, at constant nominal federal funds rates, we get a higher real  long-term rate and a lower inflation trajectory  The question arises as to what is the appropriate policy in this situation It strikes  me that there are risks on all sides because this hypothesis, which I would stress is only a  hypothesis and by no means a certainty, involves some probability of being wrong My own  guess at this stage is that, even given this hypothesis, the rate of economic growth in the  Greenbook may be too low I think that the second-quarter number is phony for the same  reasons that people are suggesting the first-quarter number is phony I believe that there is a  deeper underlying strength in the expansion, as Gary Stem suggested, and I agree with him  that it is very hard to avoid the conclusion that the wealth effect has not spilled over in  certain respects It does not take very much in the way of a change in core productivity  growth to alter radically the inflation outlook as presented in the Greenbook If we consider  that employment costs account for 2/3 of total price, then a 1/2 percentage point change in  productivity growth, presuming it affects the total system irrespective of how we may look at  the noncorporate sector, means a difference of 3/10 point in long-term inflation rates The  improvement in productivity could very well be more than 1/2 percentage point; I do not  have a clue  All I am telling you is that the numbers do not strike me as evidence that the  old-fashioned model is working I am not aware of any evidence suggesting that domestic    5/20/97  operating margins are declining in the second quarter I think the gains in foreign affiliate  earnings are probably coming to a halt, in part because of the lagged effects of the dollar's  strength But I hear nothing that suggests reduced growth in domestic operating earnings If  virtually all of the inflation is coming from rising profit margins and the increase in total unit  costs has been near zero for the last year, it just is not credible to assert that policy is behind  the curve Indeed, I would suspect that the real funds rate, as appropriately measured  depending on how one looks at it, is probably not terribly far from where we want it to be I  believe the fact that we are getting stronger growth at the current federal funds rate than we  would have expected is a supply side as well as a demand side phenomenon, perhaps more  supply than demand I am not convinced that the inventory effect may not cause us some  difficulty It is hard to believe that the inventory growth rate will simmer down and stay  down The inventory risks are clearly on the upside  Let me summarize quickly; I have been going on longer than I intended The  bottom line as I see it is that as I balance the demand side pressures and the supply side  offsets, I suspect that we are going to have to tighten policy somewhere along the line My  guess is that we will need another 25 basis points, more likely more, by the end of the year I  would be concerned, however, about moving today A move would give us too steep a  trajectory for the endpoint of the interest rate pattern Two things might happen, neither of  which would be terribly helpful One would be a market presumption that a big increase in  rates is needed, something that I do not think we are in the process of implementing  Alternatively, and worse in a certain sense, would be the conclusion that the rate increases  are all over, thereby removing the uncertainty that occurs when the Federal Reserve's    5/20/97  Damocles Sword overhangs the economy That is not something that I would look upon with  great tranquility  I recommend that we not move today If we do not, I think the probability that we  will have to move and should move in July is better than 50/50 and, alternatively, the  probability of a move by August is very high I would add that the odds of a further move in  the fall are better than 50/50 I think it is appropriate in this situation to weigh what seems to  be a very important and fundamental shift that appears to be occurring coupled against the  unquestioned notion that the amount of slack in the economy is not substantial In that  context, I think we ought to be looking at a potential trajectory for interest rates that is modest  but definitely up We need to continue to create an element of uncertainty about what we are  going to do in order to damp what undoubtedly are some elements of speculation, especially  in the commercial real estate area  To conclude, I would recommend at this stage that we not move today but that we  adopt an asymmetric directive I think that with all of the things I have been saying about  structural change, the risks unquestionably remain on the upside and are likely to be in that  direction for quite a period of time Vice Chairman   Governor Rivlin   Governor Meyer   President Jordan   President Hoenig   President Broaddus   President Parry   President Minehan    5/20/97   President Stem   President Boehne   Governor Kelley   President Melzer   Governor Phillips   President Guynn   President Moskow   President McTeer   Would you read the directive that would encompass  "B" asymmetric?   Call the roll   I would like to welcome three newcomers to these  proceedings--Jane Little from Boston, George Kahn from Kansas City, and Steve Cecchetti from  New York This is their first meeting and as I have indicated previously to individuals who have  come and gone, they will not learn very much economics but large amounts of chaos theory! I  think that was a welcome, but I'm not quite sure [Laughter]  We need the approval of the minutes for the July 1-2 meeting   Without objection I turn the next item over to the Vice  Chair   Would someone like to second that nomination?  SPEAKER(?) Second   Without objection Let us move on to Mr Fisher Peter   It is not a question of "reminding!" What are they?  [Laughter] Let me put it this way I have never heard that term except as used by you in this room   Now, stop! [Laughter] The arithmetic is easy, but why  don't you use English? This is market jargon whose use is restricted to a very few acres  surrounding your office in New York   Why didn't you say so?   How serious is the most recent pressure on the Hong  Kong dollar?   Is that true of the other Southeast Asian currencies as  well? Are they going to let their currencies float?   President Minehan    8/19/97   With respect to the baht?   Ted, why don't you take a minute and review that   Any further questions? President Melzer   Is there going to be a forward market in those securities?   I recently heard discussions concerning possible futures  contracts   "Forward" is a more generic term   We could always hedge our position [Laughter]   As a footnote? [Laughter]   There is an anomaly in the central bank buying inflation-  indexed bonds for its portfolio Any further questions for Peter? I'm going to need a motion to  ratify the actions of the Domestic Desk   The next meeting as you all know is the 3 0 th of  September There are no topics for the luncheon today because Bob McTeer has a 215 pm flight  [Laughter]  END OF MEETING       Without objection Thank you very much Mike Prell,  you are on   The information that I heard on the radio this morning on  the UPS agreement may or may not be correct, but it suggested wage increases of 5 or 6 percent  Since the firms that compete with UPS are, to my understanding, all non-union, is there a  possibility that the wage cost change could result in a competitive situation for UPS that would  significantly erode its very large market share of this industry and in a sense undercut what appears  to be, at least on the immediate surface, a victory for the union? Is there any evidence that supports  or refutes that proposition?   I heard $4 an hour over 5 years on an $11 base   I think it applies to the average wage   It is interesting that the head of the Teamsters Union was  acknowledging that there would be job losses The implication was that UPS will convert 20,000  part-time jobs into 10,000 full-time jobs   This is a labor intensive activity is it not?  SPEAKER(?) At least at the distribution centers   This could turn out to be a quite counterproductive labor  contract for the Teamsters if a lot of events go in the wrong direction They could end up with a  significant loss of total jobs not only as the result of the conversion from part-time to full-time  work, but also through a significant loss of market share because of the continuity agreements  secured by UPS competitors and because of the effects of higher wages on UPS pricing So, after  the significant glow that the union is putting on the settlement, things could turn in the other  direction and be most unhelpful for the union as far as I can see   One would assume that to be the result unless there  emerges a perception that works against the union organizers and reduces their ability to unionize  more companies It is in part a question of timing as far I am able to tell President Parry   President Stern   President Moskow   President Minehan   We do estimate a synthetic split in inventories between  domestic and imports My recollection, and I may be wrong on this, is that the inventory  accumulation that occurred in the second quarter was predominantly in domestically produced  goods   I don't think it was a trend; I think it was a second-quarter  development I will check on this and report on it when I get the information   There is, of course, a lot of noise in the data when we  move from the trade account to inventories   Further questions for Mike? If not, who would like to  start the Committee discussion?   President Minehan   You have to label yourself before you go on   Peter has set up a little box for each of us   President Moskow   President Parry   President Hoenig   President Guynn   President Broaddus   President Stem   President Boehne   President Melzer   Vice Chair   Governor Kelley   Governor Rivlin   Governor Meyer   Governor Phillips   To round us out, President Jordan   I think this is an opportune time to break for coffee  [Coffee break]   Mr Kohn    8/19/97   Let's see if we can make some progress on this I have  the general impression that there is a consensus around the Boehne alternative for the first sentence  I will assume that is the case unless somebody wishes to raise an objection here [Pause] Not  hearing one, I will assume that we will make that change, which really has carried us much further  than anyone would have anticipated! [Laughter]  SPEAKER(?) Should we stop?   I think we have to focus on whether we should leave the  second sentence alone, apart from the minor adjustment that Don Kohn has mentioned, or try to go  further   The major problem I always have had with this directive  has been in the first sentence I find all the proposed variations of the second sentence to be  circumlocutions in one way or another The difficulty is that we are trying to reflect differing  opinions as to how we should view the question of asymmetry That is an issue we never have  been able to resolve among ourselves There are differences in this Committee and very legitimate  differences Yet, I think we all find a value in maintaining the notion of symmetry and asymmetry,  though for somewhat different reasons There has never been any consensus, as I read the views of  this Committee, to eliminate that concept So, my inclination at this stage, given my suspicion of  what would happen if we tried to resolve something that we have failed to do in the past for good  reasons--    8/19/97   That is a very thoughtful way of putting it [Laughter]   After going through a lot of the possible variations with  Don Kohn, it strikes me that we are not going to succeed in resolving this issue at this stage, and it  probably is not worth the effort of the Committee to try to force something that would make a  number of us feel uncomfortable I am inclined to put on the table as a potential resolution of this  to make just the minor change that Don Kohn has suggested   I'm just opening the issue up for questions Don, in that  context would you read the operational paragraph of the directive with those changes?   That wording is not satisfactory to everybody, but it is  everybody's second choice, if I may put it that way I would be inclined to go with that, but I  would like to hear the Committee's views Governor Phillips    8/19/97   It gives you the asymmetry in effect   The two methods together have been used when we  wanted to express a strong degree of asymmetry   Yes   It wasn't supposed to be! [Laughter]   Governor Kelley   I am delighted to be corrected In a hidden sense it is  mine, too President Broaddus   That is a fundamental change The words have been  fudged in such a manner as to avoid stating that I think you are quite right on the issue of giving  prominence to the funds rate, and I think we all recognize that were we able to find financial  aggregates that reflect the state of the money markets and that we could employ to gain leverage in  the system, we would find that preferable to targeting the funds rate The latter has all the problems  that we have discussed over the years Having gone in the direction of announcing changes in the  federal funds rate after our meetings, all we are doing is moving that explicitly into the directive If  at some point we are able to shift away from the funds rate, then the directive will get changed and  our public statement will get changed   Why don't you make a motion?   Can we make you an honorary one? [Laughter]    8/19/97   Technically, it is true if we are taking a vote of the  Committee as presently constituted But as a practical matter, the vote has to include everybody  around the table because we are making changes that will involve all of us So, the "votes" of those  who are temporarily nonmembers should be taken into account   You could do so   Would you read the Boehne motion, just to make sure we  know what it says?   And go on   Okay Let's recognize that this is not a vote on the  directive; this is a vote on the structure of the directive    8/19/97   Let's have a show of hands rather than an official vote  This is in favor of it All opposed? It carries unanimously I congratulate Donald Kohn for a  Solomonesque--   Well, I merely followed you two gentlemen   I thank everybody [Laughter] Are there any questions  on the first part of Don Kohn's presentation relating to monetary policy?   The term "inflation compensation" is really a word of art  because what is being projected here is not true inflation expectations, including the risk premium,  but a forecast of the CPI as published And that may or may not be exactly equal to inflation  expectations But shouldn't the word "expectations" be in this sentence--"a slight reduction in  "expected" long-term inflation compensation"?   It is based on their forecast of the CPI   Further questions for Don? If not, let me start I will be a  good deal briefer than I have been of late To be sure, as Governor Kelley indicated, not all that  much has changed in the period since the last meeting, but there are a few fundamentals that I think  require a bit of evaluation  The most recent period is interesting because it reinforces the notion that we still may be  experiencing disinflation That is, it is very clear in looking at the price indexes--whether we are  using the CPI, the PPI, or the various NIPA data on prices--that the inflation rate over these last six  months has been coming in lower than in 1996 or at the least has been unchanged This is really  quite relevant, especially since the data on domestic operating profit margins still seem to be edging    8/19/97  higher Taken together, these two factors clearly imply that consolidated unit costs for the  nonfinancial corporate sector are moving up only very modestly Indeed, our latest estimate for the  four quarters ended in the second quarter of 1997 is that consolidated unit costs have gone up just  4 percent Since net interest payments per unit continue to fall, the increase in unit labor costs  remains rather modest though obviously higher than the rise in total unit costs Unit labor costs are  up about 12 percent over the four quarters, but higher productivity growth is factored into that  Indeed, the productivity increase for the nonfinancial corporate sector looks something like 2-1/4  percent, with average hourly compensation moving up close to 3-1/2 percent  The significance of all this is that we have continued to get this sort of data for quite a  while Indeed, I used almost the same set of numbers several months ago with the sole exception of  productivity, which seems to be accelerating for nonfinancial corporations The obverse of this is  that the decline in noncorporate business productivity, as residually estimated, seems also to have  accelerated in the most recent period That explains why, when we bring the corporate and  noncorporate sectors together, we get this modest increase in total nonfarm productivity The  problem with that number is that it cannot explain the rise in profit margins, whether we include  only nonfinancial corporate margins or the broader margins where we add in the appropriate part of  noncorporate earnings or noncorporate profitability Of course, the problem in this context is our  inability to price services appropriately; they have a substantial overlap with the noncorporate  sector  The question is, which data do we believe are the most accurate? The profit figures have  to be reasonably accurate in the sense that they come out the same way no matter how we calculate  them The price data doubtless have biases in them, but there is no evidence that the bias is  changing significantly Clearly, if prices are going up very modestly and profit margins are    8/19/97  increasing, we are forced algebraically to conclude that consolidated unit costs are going nowhere  If that is in fact the case, it is inconsistent with the nonfarm productivity data, and we have to  choose which data we believe are best describing the current state of the economy I suspect that  we ought to be able to find out, hopefully within a year or two, whether this issue is ultimately  resolved by the closing of the statistical discrepancy or by some extraordinary discovery of new  data that create a more reasonable set of real noncorporate gross product  Despite the absence of indications that inflation may be accelerating, signs are beginning  to emerge that suggest we may finally be running out the string The major sign relates to  compensation per hour whose relatively subdued behavior I have attributed largely to job  insecurity, a view that is subject to some controversy I recognize that the econometric analyses are  of dubious value on this issue, and I am sometimes inclined to suggest that instead of trying to find  out what people believe by using detailed and indirect econometric analysis, we might try  something terribly novel We might ask them When people are asked whether they fear that they  are going to lose their jobs, and the same question is asked of basically the same sample year after  year, we find that the proportion of people responding in the affirmative doubles from the recession  period of 1991 to the mid-1990s, leading one to conclude that people mean what they say But  survey respondents are now saying that they are not as nervous as they were earlier; that is, the  survey results are beginning to tilt in the direction of less concern as tight labor markets have  persisted for a now protracted period of time Indeed, one statistical estimate that had been  significantly subdued throughout this period--namely, the measure of the number of people who  voluntarily leave their jobs to seek other employment--is finally showing some signs of moving up  the way it did in past periods So, the notion that the insecurity issue is beginning to wane is  getting some statistical verification    8/19/97  Leaving aside the NAIRU and other issues involved in evaluating unemployment and  labor force participation, we still have the problem of determining how many people are left in the  noninstitutional population who want to work That number is diminishing at a very rapid pace  The number of people who say they want a job but are not currently seeking one, which by  definition puts them out of the labor force, has gone down 1-1/2 million, as I recall, in the last three  years This implies a fairly dramatic squeeze on the potential labor supply in the sense that an  annual increase of 2 percent on average in both payroll and household employment in recent years  is matched against growth in the working-age population that is half that rate We do not have to  go through a Phillips curve analysis, nor any other analysis, to conclude that when we run out of a  product--in this case labor--its price goes up At some point something has to give The process  still appears to be at a very early stage, and it is moving slowly It may well be that the real  significance of the UPS strike is that we are beginning to see a reversal of what had been a dramatic  development The air traffic controllers' confrontation with President Reagan set in motion a  fundamental change in policy for this country more than 15 years ago It is conceivable that we  will look back at the UPS strike and say that it too signaled a significant change I don't know  whether that is true or whether that impression may change when we look at the data after all the  publicity spins stop in the next 48 to 72 hours and we begin to learn what actually happened But it  is clear that something is going on in that area  The important question that we have to ask ourselves is whether the fairly significant  pickup in effective demand in the last six weeks or so will moderate before the pressures on wages  begin to work their way through to prices As Mike Prell pointed out, the crucial element in the  near-term outlook for economic activity is the inventory situation Certain conclusions probably  are not unreasonable The first is that we do not need any liquidation of inventories for the    8/19/97  economic expansion to slow; all we need is slowing in the rate of increase It is quite conceivable  that we can have, as we have had over the last six months, a very dramatic increase in inventories  that is wholly voluntary, wholly the result of inventory-sales ratios having gotten too low and  bottoming out Obviously, if we have an inventory-sales ratio that declines and then flattens out,  inventory investment surges at that particular point But there is also a concern that we can still  have very low inventory-sales ratios even after the big surge This, indeed, may result in a view  that there is no inventory overhang in any meaningful sense However, as I said, the rate of  increase in inventories merely has to moderate to slow the economy, meaning that the rate of  inventory investment falls  I think the inventory investment forecast in the Greenbook has an important element of  credibility because at this stage neither the new orders data nor any anecdotal reports suggest  serious inventory level problems But the numbers do seriously suggest that the inventory  investment level is excessive To get a sense of whether there is something illusory in the  Greenbook forecast, I have converted the inventory investment numbers to factory value, as distinct  from chain-weighted deflated book value If the physical quantity of goods does not change but  merely moves from the factory level to the retail level, the constant dollar value of the inventories  rises The reason is that as goods move from one sector of the distribution channel to the next,  value is added and income is created For national income accounting purposes, it is indeed the  book value where held, properly deflated, that is relevant to the income and product account  calculations But to measure whether inventories are excessive or not, we don't care where the  units are held in the distribution stream Whether automobiles are in inventories at the dealer level,  at the factory level, or somewhere in the pipeline is of no significance to the level of assemblies but  it is to GDP    8/19/97  In any event, stripping out the markups in the distribution process, the factory value data  for inventory investment for the first half of 1997 are very significantly above the peak levels of  1994 and early 1995, whereas that is not true for the deflated NIPA total book value data I don't  know whether you can see this chart from where you are sitting, but the black bars are what the  official NIPA data show, and they are at about the same level as they were in 1994 However, if  you look only at factory value, it is up close to the NIPA data in the first half of 1997, but it was  much lower in 1994 because a substantial part of those earlier data reflected markups and not  increased numbers of units  Secondly, Cathy Minehan raised the issue as to whether, in fact, the inventories were  produced by domestic firms or were imported With the caveat that the data themselves are very  dubious, the staff here has tried to associate imports with various types of inventories in order to  estimate separate domestic and foreign-originated inventories Overall, the levels have tended to  run about one-fourth imported, three-fourths domestically produced Through April and May, the  proportion of inventory investment that was imported was about one-fifth--or less than normal In  that sense, we are not getting any evidence, at least in these data, suggesting that all the inventory  buildup is coming from imports, which, if it were the case, would mean that the impact of their  adjustment would be on foreign producers and not on domestic production The NIPA inventory  investment data appear to derive disproportionately from domestic production Hence, the impact  of the slowdown in inventory growth on the GDP shown in the Greenbook is credible  If we find instead that final demand is significantly higher and that we get further strong  inventory accumulation from either a wealth effect or factors that are related to inventory  investment, we will not get a slowdown in the growth of GDP In that case, we will face some  serious policy questions My judgment is, as we have discussed before, that we will have no choice    8/19/97  but to tighten because if we do not, the risks will be too high, no matter whether one is in box A, B,  C, or D of Peter Fisher's little structure So, I think we need to recognize at this stage that there  may be factors that could cause inflation to pick up  Let me add something parenthetically that was hinted at but not put on the table A very  big part of the consumer price index is related to property values You will recall that about 19  percent of the CPI is imputed owners' equivalent rent Rents are tied to property values Rent as a  ratio to the market value of single-family homes has been falling for quite a long period of time  And the little pop that we saw in the last CPI may be an indication that this ratio is stabilizing or  moving back to a somewhat higher path, which suggests that the services CPI may look a little  stronger in the near future than we have seen of late We are going to have to make a judgment as  to whether we should look at property-value-related prices somewhat differently from prices that  are related in effect to income flows I have raised this issue before, but we never really have  confronted it because the issue has never come up with respect to a question of monetary policy I  would not be surprised if what we encounter is a CPI that looks a lot stronger but one where the rise  in inflation will be very narrowly concentrated in these property-value-priced areas Commodity  prices could be going down, other prices could be going down, and these prices could be going up  What should we be looking at? That may well prove to be an interesting question  In summary, my general view has not basically changed As I see it, the real federal  funds rate, as Don Kohn pointed out, is sufficiently high that we need not be concerned that  monetary policy is out of sync at this point or that it is far off from where we will want it to be in  any event And with disinflation probably still going on, there is very little reason to move today,  as has been the case for a number of meetings Nonetheless, as many of you have argued, and I  think quite correctly, the risks are on the upside and there also is little reason to discard the    8/19/97  asymmetric directive toward tightening Nothing out there of which I am aware suggests that the  underlying pressures are very different from what they have been for quite a long period of time  President Boehne   Governor Rivlin   President Parry   President Broaddus   President Minehan   President McTeer   Governor Kelley   President Stem   President Hoenig   President Guynn   President Jordan    8/19/97   Governor Meyer   Governor Phillips   Has anybody been left out?   I think it is going to be difficult The reason is that the  longer we are in a period where the economy remains exceptionally tight and price inflation  continues to go down, the more difficult it will be for us to make a credible case for a policy  tightening move, indeed around this table let alone how we explain it to everybody else   Remember that the nonresidential real estate sector shows  up in the CPI for hotels, lodging, and--    8/19/97   That is the question that I raised in a speech just before  the sentence in which I expressed concern about how we will know when we encounter irrational  exuberance   We have not been able to address that issue because I  don't think we know how to handle a problem where we have one instrument and conflicting goals  What do we do? What should the Japanese have done when confronted with a very benign product  price environment and rapidly escalating asset prices?   That was the context of that speech, and the state of my  knowledge, at least, has not gone beyond that I do not know what to do   Temporarily President Moskow   Certainly Does anybody else want to say anything?  Okay, would you read the directive again [Laughter]    8/19/97   Call the roll   Good morning, everyone Would somebody like to move  approval of the minutes for the August 19 meeting?   Without objection Peter Fisher   Questions for Peter?   Peter, the numbers look quite good in terms of confirming  your hypothesis about the rate objectives of the Bundesbank and the Bank of Italy I had always  thought that the Bank of Italy, specifically the Italian government, would have been far more  interested in having their rates converge with the German rates at the bottom of the maturity curve  because, as you know, their budget is financed through short-term instruments and lower short-term  rates would do wonders for their fiscal position Nonetheless, I suspect that the implication of the  German action, which is essentially saying that they will not resist Italy's joining the EMU, may be  the real driving force here Have you spoken to anybody at the Bank of Italy to get a sense of  whether in fact they were focusing more on German acquiescence in Italy's EMU entrance or  whether they were in a sense somewhat disturbed by the fact that the Germans seemed to be  pushing their rates up?   Yes Any other questions for Peter? If not, would  someone like to move to ratify the domestic operations?   The next meeting is on Wednesday, November 12  END OF MEETING       Without objection We turn now to Mike Prell   Questions for Mike?   President Moskow   President Parry    9/30/97   President Jordan   President Guynn   Mike, the data of the last couple of months clearly have  been far stronger, especially in the manufacturing area, yet commodity prices have eased Are we  being put in a position where, for forecast and model purposes, we are using wages and prices as  exogenous variables?   Let me take a step back If you were to take the type of  macro environment we are looking at and you were trying to make up for a shortfall from your  earlier expectations, the numbers in such a forecast would, I suspect, be far stronger than the ones  that you have So, in that regard the add factors are very dominant elements in the forecast The  question that I am asking is whether these factors have become so large in recent forecasts that they  are in effect giving us an exogenous forecast of prices   If you are making the assumption that your model's  historical structure and its coefficients are essentially correct and you are letting bygones be  bygones, you will get a specific numerical forecast which follows from those two assumptions   I gather that is true with the manufacturing unemployment  rate as well?   President Minehan   President McTeer   It is called a high-tech shaggy dog story Who would like  to start off the Committee discussion? President Broaddus   Don't you dare do that! [Laughter]   President Parry   President Moskow   What worries me is that we may well need an actual turn  in the inflation rate to get a sense of what this process is all about because we are still guessing If    9/30/97  we go back six months, even though we were then seeing falling inflation, the presumption that it  would continue to fall over the ensuing six months would probably have been considered almost  inconceivable Until we get a sense that this unusual behavior is coming to an end, I don't think we  are going to understand fully what is happening   President McTeer   I did not quite get the difference between the 33,000 and  300,000 What is the 33,000 again?   In Texas?   Okay   President Minehan   President Jordan    9/30/97   President Hoenig   President Boehne   President Melzer    9/30/97   President Stem    9/30/97   President Guynn   Vice Chairman   Governor Rivlin   Governor Meyer   Governor Phillips   Governor Kelley   On that, we will go for coffee  [Coffee break]   Mr Kohn   Thank you Questions for Don?   Are there any other questions for Don? [Pause] If not,  then let me get started  I think the incoming indicators are pointing more clearly to underlying trends in this  economy, although they are scarcely adding to our understanding of these trends Let me start with  what I think is the most interesting event of recent weeks, the extraordinary acceleration in capital  investment A big increase in capital investment this late in the business cycle is really quite  startling If we focus on the orders pattern, we see it suddenly take off You will recall that this  expansion in capital investment started to accelerate in 1993 after a very sluggish period and has  progressed at a fairly pronounced rate This suggests that anticipated rates of return on investments  have risen More precisely, prospective internal rates of return must be rising or else we cannot    9/30/97  explain why so many firms are undertaking large investment programs Part of the explanation is  unquestionably the desire to expand capacity That is especially the case in the high-tech area  where there has been very substantial investment, a not insignificant part of which has been for  capacity expansion But there also is very little doubt that the plant managers who propose these  new investments anticipate very significant improvements in the efficiency of their operations, and  that ultimately leads to increased productivity They look at it as cost reduction, but on a  consolidated basis it obviously nets out to a significant drop in the ratio of hours to output, the  inverse of productivity  We have several indications that the prospective productivity improvements may be  materializing First, the earnings figures still seem to be rising It is too early to get a good fix on  the third quarter--obviously no reports for the quarter have come out--but security analysts'  estimates do show what appears to be a seasonally adjusted rise in the earnings of S&P 500  companies for the third quarter Second, there also is a quite surprising acceleration in  manufacturing productivity in the data through August, and it is now running at an annual rate  somewhere around 7-1/2 percent To be sure, the August figure is a little suspect because, as you  may recall, the initial estimate of industrial production is based in part on hours worked coupled  with a presumed productivity number But that is not the case for July Apparently, there was a  quite significant and surprisingly strong rise in electric power use, and all other indicators suggest  that July IP was quite strong So, manufacturing productivity appears to be rising at an annual rate  of about 7-1/2 percent for the third quarter  Third, although we have little available data, the evidence we do have for various types  of facilities is consistent with a general pattern of improved efficiency and flexibility I have  mentioned before that with the ratio of unfilled orders to shipments declining in the capital goods    9/30/97  area, specifically excluding aircraft, we are getting a pronounced and inexorable decline in the lead  times on the deliveries of capital equipment In a sense, this is consistent with the product cycle in  a variety of other areas There is no doubt that we are seeing a fairly marked decline in lead  patterns and an increase in the ability of companies to meet unanticipated demand rather quickly  through new facilities, whereas they could not do that before in any readily observable sense We  get confirmation of this phenomenon if we compare the vendor performance numbers of the NAPM  with the capacity utilization data, either for primary processing or for total manufacturing What  we see is progressively lower vendor performance numbers at successive peaks in activity This  means that the bottlenecks and shortages are falling relative to any constant operating rate This is,  in effect, consistent with the declining lead times At the end of the day, one would presume that  we could keep squeezing and squeezing and, as indeed the new era people like to say, capacity  would no longer be a restraint If we literally stayed with the facilities that are coming on stream,  there is a strange degree of verifiability of that We can see that there are very few constraints, very  few shortages For example, the list of shortages we get from NAPM now has one or two items,  whereas we used to get 15 or 20 Something different is happening in the facilities area This has  led a large number of executives, mainly in the corporate area which is where the forefront of the  new era issue is arising, to conclude that technology is continuously enabling facilities to be less  and less a constraint on activity Indeed, when we include the globalization factor, it looks as  though inflation is dead, the world has changed, and the central bank ought to get out of business  one way or the other  The major element that is missing in that argument is biology! Biology is what one  looks at when we are trying to find the lead time, not on facilities, but on people I know of no  evidence suggesting that that factor has been altered in any significant manner As a consequence,    9/30/97  leaving aside the question of the unemployment rate, the NAIRU or whatever, we have a  fundamental disequilibrium in the labor market best characterized by the fact that employment is  rising by 2 million each year and the population of people of working age who wish to work,  including immigration, is going up 1 million annually The 1 million difference between those two  statistics over the last three or four years may be broken down into a net flow of 600,000  individuals per year who moved from unemployment to employment and another net flow of  400,000 people per year who moved from "not in the labor force but say they want a job" to being  employed Remember, the definition of unemployment requires that a person be making an active  effort to secure a job in the previous five weeks The consequence of saying "I would like a job,  but I have not been looking" is that it throws that person out of the labor force  The group of people outside the labor force who say they want a job has contributed  almost as much as the decline in unemployment to that difference between employment increases  and the growth of the population of people who wish to work This group of people is now at the  lowest proportion to the working age population since 1970 I cite the year 1970 solely because the  chart I got from the staff goes back only that far There have been some very dramatic declines in  their number since 1996 as employers have drawn very heavily from that group We do not need to  consider the NAIRU and the unemployment rate because, while they obviously are more  sophisticated approaches to this issue, we do not have to get terribly sophisticated All we have to  do is to observe where the unemployed people are, and there clearly are fewer and fewer of them  Since early 1996, we have seen a rise in average hours worked That is another way of  suggesting that the pressures that we are seeing in this taut labor market are inducing employers to  squeeze the available supply of workers If the supply were really there, we would not be getting  this type of pressure on the average workweek I think this pressure has been the equivalent of    9/30/97  about 500,000 additional workers at an annual rate, so that the comparison would really be 2-1/2  million versus 1 million  I have argued before that we have not seen an acceleration in wages because of the job  insecurity phenomenon We have seen significant evidence of that phenomenon in the last five  years The latest evidence that has come to my attention is data on the quite dramatic increase in  the number of people aged 25 to 34 who are going back to college and the huge increase in the  amount of on-the-job training There is an awareness that one can no longer count on getting  lifelong job skills just by getting a college degree or even a high school degree What we are  looking at is still, as far as I can judge, a fear of job skill obsolescence and a significant shift toward  job security in lieu of wage gains  I have maintained in raising this issue over the years that there is a limit as to how far  this job insecurity effect can go We are beginning to see some signs that that limit has been  reached Earlier polls indicated that from 1991 to 1995 job insecurity or fear of job layoffs had  risen very significantly despite the tightening of the labor market, but the responses in these polls  have now shaded off in the other direction The proportion of people in the labor force who  decided voluntarily to leave their job to seek another, which had been exceptionally low for quite a  long period of time, has now popped up, suggesting less job insecurity So, the data that tended to  argue for job insecurity are beginning to shift a little They have not reversed sharply, but they are  beginning to be shaded  The question that we are running up against is that all of this is plausible, but in effect we  still have negligible inflation in the system It may very well be that productivity increases are  creating enough in the way of absorption of hourly labor costs to prevent rising prices Indeed,  there is no evidence to suggest that there is any pipeline inflation or any other type of inflation    9/30/97  The fundamental disequilibrium, and I don't see how we can get around it, is the fact that  the rate of increase in overall demand is creating a demand for employment that cannot be satisfied  indefinitely The trouble is that we don't know where that pressure point is located, but it has to  exist I think, as Mike Kelley said, there have to be limits Larry Meyer also said that in a speech  the other day We do not know exactly where the limits are at this point, but the longer we stay on  this course, the more this disequilibrium continues to spread It is conceivable that productivity  could accelerate to the point that labor requirements fall without a change in overall domestic  demand There is no evidence of which I am aware to suggest that outcome because employment  still seems to be growing at a fairly good clip It is conceivable that we may suddenly find  employment growth starting to fall short of its current trend while output growth is maintained,  which would suggest that productivity is accelerating, but at the moment there is no evidence of  that in the data  Although it is conceivable that we may get bailed out by a sudden discontinuous  acceleration in productivity growth, that is something that has not occurred in the past to my  knowledge There is no doubt, however, that a lot of the synergies of the new technologies are  emerging That development is producing very large investment opportunities The joining of  lasers and fiber optics has created huge demands for telecommunications investment The  continuous breakthroughs in the computer area in conjunction with the new communications  systems created and are now fostering the extraordinary expansion in the Internet So, one can  argue that it is possible that we could get enough acceleration in productivity to close the gap  between labor supply and labor demand However, the gap looks so large to me that I will suggest  that arithmetically we would need a full percentage point acceleration in productivity increases to  close the gap Is it possible? Yes Is it likely? I do not think we can depend on that    9/30/97  With respect to policy, my view is that we are getting repeated reprieves because the  price level is not changing much I do not think we should move today, but I do think the  probability that we will be forced to move at the next meeting has gone up quite considerably I  don't know how high that probability is, and I do not know what we would do if we ended up with  a CPI of zero in the next report We will be getting the ECI between now and the next meeting,  and it could show an increase of 1 percent I doubt it, but who knows? In any event, I think we are  getting close to a policy move It is important, for all the reasons that a lot of you have stated, to be  in front of the curve We are not arguing that the probability of rising inflation has increased, but  the possibility that we may be wrong is rising You do not need an above 50 percent probability of  being wrong to take out insurance I don't know what the data are going to look like in the next  four or five weeks, but my guess at this stage is that there is easily a 50/50 chance that we will  decide to move in November because the presumption that we can wait until just before Christmas  to move is not going to be something about which a lot of us are going to be enthusiastic In any  event, I am putting on the table a "B" directive with continued asymmetry Vice Chair   Governor Rivlin   I am saying there is a 50/50 probability; what are you  saying?   No, it depends on a fixed population   And fixed immigration   Sure    9/30/97   The Bombay example involves services   The Bombay example relates basically to the use of  computer software It involves very few people   President Parry   President Hoenig   President Boehne   President Moskow   I thought I was doing that in the July Humphrey-Hawkins  testimony It turned out that instead of the bond market falling by up to a point or so, as I thought it  would after that testimony, it went in the other direction The market's response depends on what it  wants to hear One of the things I have learned is that sending a message is very difficult unless it  is absolutely unequivocal because people hear what they want to hear It is a tricky matter   Yes, I think the March message worked well President  Guynn   President Melzer   President Stem   Governor Meyer    9/30/97   President Broaddus   President Minehan   President Jordan   Governor Kelley   Governor Phillips   President McTeer   That explains why we have not moved since March  Okay, let's have a vote on "B" asymmetric after you have read the directive   Call the roll   I would like to welcome Governors Ferguson and  Gramlich to their first meeting and offer a preliminary farewell to President Melzer We will do  the farewell more officially at the next meeting   Why don't we get started I request that someone move  to approve the minutes   Without objection Peter Fisher   250 basis points?   I must say that your endeavor to inform the primary  dealers of your likes or dislikes is creating a franchise value for them whether you like it or not  I think the presumption that they are primary dealers and you are in fact making that an issue  makes it quite impossible to maintain simultaneously that there is no franchise value in their  being primary dealers   You mentioned that the yuan was not an attackable  currency, which I have always assumed to be the case largely because it is an essentially illiquid,  controlled, and blocked currency Can you conceive of any scenario whereby there could be an    11/12/97 11  international attack on that currency? I presume that would require a free market and some  ability to move funds, and I am not sure how that can be done in the yuan   I have been out of contact What happened in the  financial markets in Brazil and Argentina yesterday?   Was it the same in Argentina?   President Minehan   Governor Rivlin   Did they sniff at that?   President Broaddus   President Melzer   President Stem   President Parry   Any other questions? Would somebody like to move to  ratify domestic Desk transactions since the last meeting?   Without objection Would somebody like to move to  give Peter Fisher some additional intermeeting leeway?   Without objection Peter, would you move on to the  next item on the swap line renewals?   Servants?   Any further comment? Is there a second to President  McDonough's motion?  SPEAKER(?) Second   All in favor say "Aye"  SEVERAL Aye   Opposed?   Thank you very much Our next meeting is on  December 16th We will now adjourn for lunch  END OF MEETING       Let's move on to the staff economic reports with  Messrs Prell and Truman   What has been happening in the last couple of years to  the statistical discrepancy in the world current account balance?   Is it still $100 billion?   I noticed in the most recent labor force data that the  participation rate declined We usually would expect it to rise in the context of a sharp increase  in economic growth I gather from the underlying data that there has been a significant increase    11/12/97 27  in school enrollments One would presume that is occurring because of the need to upgrade  skills and because parents can afford to let their children stay in school So, the number of  people not in the labor force but in school has been rising very rapidly This has exactly the  opposite effect on the participation rate from what a strong economy would ordinarily impart  When you projected the participation rate to get an unemployment rate of about 4-1/2 percent,  did you have any explicit assumptions regarding school enrollment or any other not-in-the-  labor-force elements?   What is the effect on the productivity numbers of the  upward BLS revision of payroll employment from the annual survey?    11/12/97   Isn't the BLS revision something like 500,000 workers?   It will affect the historical data, the 1996 numbers, but  are you suggesting that it will have little effect on the outlook?   Is there a tendency for that to happen when BEA does  its annual revisions?   It certainly would make BEA look harder   President Hoenig   President Moskow   President Parry   Governor Rivlin   President Guynn   President Minehan   President Broaddus   President McTeer   Any further questions for our colleagues? If not,  would somebody like to start the Committee discussion?   President Parry   President Jordan   President Broaddus   President Moskow   President Minehan    11/12/97 58   President McTeer   Try us   President Guynn   Indeed they are, and I think that is one of the reasons  we are running so late Let's take a very short coffee break at this stage I mean short because  we really are tight on time    11/12/97 69  [Coffee break]   President Stem, you have the podium but don't hold  onto it any longer than necessary! [Laughter]   President Melzer   President Boehne    11/12/97   Governor Meyer   Vice Chairman   Governor Rivlin   I "guess" that is all right! [Laughter]   Governor Phillips   Governor Kelley   Governor Ferguson   Governor Gramlich    11/12/97   Let's move forward with Don Kohn   Thank you Questions for Don? If not, let me move  forward  Something unusual is going on in our numbers system that I think has a bearing on  issues I have raised in FOMC meetings over the last two or three years The important and  striking statistic relates to the issue that Governor Rivlin raised, namely that the staff is  projecting a slowing in productivity growth in its Greenbook forecast That slowing in and of  itself is the major force that is engendering an increase in inflation I think it is important to ask  ourselves what evidence we have one way or the other on this issue  First of all, if we disaggregate the staff's forecast of labor productivity into capital  deepening, changes in labor quality, and total factor productivity, we will find that total factor  productivity--the usual residual that all of us have been taught to interpret as an embodiment of  technological gain--appears to have risen in 1997 Indeed, if the synergies that we have been  observing in different segments of the capital goods markets continue to materialize, we could  very readily expect that residual to grow even more rapidly in the years ahead But even if total    11/12/97 91  factor productivity stabilizes, then the labor productivity numbers that are in the Greenbook, as  best I can judge, are probably much too low Just using the internal data that are not exactly built  into the Greenbook forecast but are incorporated in the Board staff's evaluation of productivity  associated with capital deepening, the residual actually goes down significantly in 1998 and  1999 And if one were merely to assume that total factor productivity remains at the 1997 level,  then instead of getting productivity increases of 16 percent in 1997, 12 percent in 1998, and 09  percent in 1999, productivity would rise from 16 percent in 1997 to 20 percent in 1998 and 23  percent in 1999  I do not know what the actual productivity data will turn out to be I don't think the  staff can predict this; I don't think we can; I don't think anybody on the outside can But it is  very important to recognize, as Governor Rivlin has indicated, that a significant part of the  pressures implicit in the price forecast, to which we are responding, rests on an evaluation of  what that residual will be I would suggest that if we look at the data on the current underlying  cost structure, it is clear that the evidence, if anything, has been indicative of very constrained  cost pressures You may recall that earlier this year when we were looking at the quite  remarkable and persistent rise of profit margins, we also were looking, given that prices were not  increasing very much, at very slow rates of increase in total unit costs, about two-thirds of which  are unit labor costs Those data have not changed at all Unit labor cost increases for  nonfinancial corporations are roughly estimated by the staff to have been approximately 02  percent in the third quarter The unit labor cost increases for nonfinancial corporations are at an  annual rate of something less than 1 percent While we do not as yet have any firm data on  nonfarm productivity, though we will get a preliminary estimate shortly for the third quarter, the    11/12/97 92  staff estimate is a rate of increase of approximately 3 percent following a rise almost that large in  the second quarter Compared with the nearly 4 percent advance expected for the third-quarter  productivity of nonfinancial corporations, that implies what we previously knew, namely, that  noncorporate productivity is very badly underestimated Indeed, the actual productivity  numbers for nonfarm businesses are doubtless much larger than the increases being reported  Needless to say, all of this is important because it suggests that we may in fact finally  be getting some acceleration of productivity in the statistics after observing, as I had indicated in  earlier meetings, a very significant pickup in plant and equipment expenditures This can be  looked at in two ways one, as an indication of very significant increases in prospective earnings  starting in 1993 when the acceleration in investment spending began; and two, as evidence--after  the continued strong growth and indeed further acceleration of such investments in recent  months--that after a number of years we may finally be getting sufficiently higher profit rates  from new facilities to suggest that the previously prospective increases in earnings have indeed  begun to materialize Those prospective increases were based on evaluations by plant managers  of various new technologies that have become available and the ability of those technologies to  increase factory floor productivity and its equivalent in the nonmanufacturing area  So, we are looking at an acceleration of investment in capital goods, which  presumably are being purchased because the required rate of return is there And as some of you  have mentioned, part of that acceleration probably stems from an endeavor to replace labor,  whose availability is diminishing rapidly I think this type of productivity increase is real in the  sense that it is not inconsistent with the anecdotal reports Indeed, it's the earlier data that were    11/12/97 93  inconsistent The statistics we are seeing now seem to square readily with what we observe is  going on in most companies  Of course, this is important because we can have an increase in compensation per  hour, which indeed I suspect the numbers are showing, without unit labor costs moving up to a  point where they are pressing on profit margins or affecting the price level I know we had a  significant increase in average hourly earnings in October, but a good part of that was the result  of overtime and of mix shifts, which I gather brings the published 05 percent monthly figure  down to 03 percent on an adjusted basis And we probably are still picking up some spillover  from the rise in the minimum wage So while I believe there has been some acceleration in  compensation per hour, certainly in the ECI and especially in wages and salaries, I still see it as  rather modest and unit labor costs being held in check to a significant extent by what appears to  be accelerating growth in productivity  At the last meeting, I looked at what was a very poor trend in labor availability, and I  suggested that by this meeting there would be a 50/50 probability that we would have to move  The argument I was making then, before we had a reasonable fix on the third-quarter  productivity numbers, was that we were running out of available labor at a particularly rapid  pace Not only was unemployment falling, but the number of people not in the labor force who  wanted jobs was declining quite appreciably The October labor market figures, which were just  released, made that far worse The decline in the number of people in the labor force who  wanted to work but did not have a job was quite pronounced in October and the "not in the labor  force" group who wanted a job also dropped quite appreciably, seasonally adjusted In effect,  we are confronted with an extremely tight labor market, one that will inevitably continue to lead    11/12/97 94  to movement on the wage side But it is unclear at this stage which is moving faster,  productivity or wage acceleration At the moment, I do not think we can tell  I'm not sure, even without the Asian financial turbulence, that I would have argued for  a rate increase at this meeting largely because the developments that are emerging are of such an  interesting, if not important, magnitude that it will take one or two more months of CPI and other  price measures to see what is going on Also, not insignificantly, we are waiting for a decline in  profit margins, which I must say we have been projecting now quarter by quarter, Greenbook by  Greenbook going back seemingly to the 19th century! [Laughter] I suspect that is not literally  true, but I think it is a very important issue because, as I have said earlier, the first sign that we  will see is that profit margins will begin to be squeezed If that happens, we are going to get a  nice, fat contraction in the stock market I am not sure how this process is playing out, but in any  event to quote Governor Kelley, "We do not have to 'wrassle' with it at this point" You didn't  put it quite that way; I'm paraphrasing!   Okay, wrestle   In any event, as I judge our discussion, we are not going  to have a serious problem in reaching a decision on whether we move today As nearly all of  you have indicated in one way or another, moving today given the Asian situation would invite  extraordinary financial disruption Whatever we believe we may have to do in December or  later, I think it is quite appropriate for us to stand pat today But I still think that with the    11/12/97 95  asymmetry of pressures in the labor markets, we have no real choice about maintaining an  asymmetric directive toward tightening As I read what all of you have been saying to a greater  or lesser extent, that seems to be where most of you stand Vice Chair   Governor Meyer   In manufacturing?   President Minehan    11/12/97   President Hoenig   President Broaddus   President Boehne   Governor Kelley   Governor Rivlin   President Parry   President Stern   President Moskow    11/12/97 101   President McTeer   President Melzer   Governor Gramlich   President Jordan   President Guynn   Governor Phillips   Governor Ferguson    11/12/97   Let me ask the Secretary to read a "B" asymmetric  directive for purposes of voting   Call the roll, please   I would first like to welcome our temporary new  Bank representative, LeGrande Rives   Also, sadly, this is Charlie Siegman's last meeting after  several generations of watching the ups and downs of these proceedings We are going to miss  you, Charlie   When all of a sudden we begin to see a hole in the staff  analysis, we will infer its cause [Laughter] Would somebody like to move approval of the  minutes of the November 12 meeting?   Without objection, they are approved Mr Fisher, you  have the floor   The Southeast Asian exchange rate patterns imply, as  you say, that a lot of market participants are overshooting the fundamentals in a certain sense It  is difficult to avoid that sort of conclusion We cannot get a 40 or 50 percent decline in an  exchange rate in a short period of time under any realistic assumptions concerning what has  changed Stock prices can do that They reflect net long positions, and if everyone decides to  pull out, stock prices will go to zero But exchange rates are zero-sum games; one person's rise  is another person's decline So, this exchange rate decrease looks extraordinarily large You  raised a question when you stated that the balance of foreign currency positions is still  effectively long in local currencies and short in dollars or perhaps yen One would assume that  forward positions in the currency, if they exist, would be able to pick this up I have never seen  9-month or 1-year forwards on baht/dollars Do they exist?   But the question is whether they give us at least a  partial answer If we are getting extreme disequilibrium, the deep forward positions ought to be    12/16/97 6  closer to minus 10 or minus 15 as distinct from minus 40 And if we cannot infer it from these  other positions, we could in principle handle the credit risk in this situation--I haven't thought  this through--by focusing on the spot rate adjusted for covered interest rate differentials to give  us an idea of the forward position I wonder whether we know anything about the more distant  horizon in order to answer the question about overshooting, so to speak, in the adjustment of  balances If indeed those balances are precisely what you say, namely, that they are comprised  of long positions in the local currency and short positions in dollars, that imbalance would give  us a very significant premium on the forward position vis-a-vis the spot It would be very  interesting to test that if the information is at all available   I'm thinking of 2-year forwards, for example   Before the Southeast Asian markets collapsed, we used  to talk about the ability of the Koreans to fund long-term debt more readily than short-term,    12/16/97 7  which goes against everyone's view of the way the world works Was that true then or was it  just an illusion?   If it was true, it would be an indication that there is a  premium in a longer forward exchange rate This is a crucial question because the adjustment is  either going to implode down to minus 80 percent or it is going to run into downside resistance   It will be fascinating to watch what happens It's like  the tide coming in for the first time in 20 years, and we find all the junk on the shore that we  didn't know existed This is partly what is going on in the financial system   If this thing turns, it can turn on a dime The trouble is,  it cannot turn on a baht [Laughter] President Parry, bail me out!  SPEAKER(?) Neither won!   Anyone else? Would somebody like to move to ratify  the Domestic Desk operations?   Thank you Our next meeting is--   February 3rd and 4th The lunch to bid farewell to our  colleague from St Louis is scheduled to begin in about three minutes  END OF MEETING       Thank you Without objection, they are approved  This is a very short agenda Messrs Prell and Truman please   Thank you Questions for either gentleman?    12/16/97   President Moskow   President Parry   Any further questions for these two gentlemen? If not,  do you want to start the go-around?   President Parry   President Moskow    12/16/97   President Broaddus   President Boehne   President Guynn   President McTeer   President Minehan   President Stem   President Hoenig   Governor Rivlin   Governor Phillips    12/16/97   Governor Ferguson   Governor Meyer   Governor Kelley   President Jordan   Governor Gramlich   President McTeer, you wanted to add a few points   Better to do it now   I think the IMF has pulled back a good deal from some  of its previous statements In addition, there has been a lot of talk suggesting that implicit in the  IMF agreement with Korea is a 3 percent growth limit Such a limit does not exist There is a  series of recommendations with respect to policy, which essentially rest on the issue of  disbanding the dirigiste-type of activities, the command economies that the Vice Chair was  talking about, and a series of other types of deregulatory, market-opening type initiatives from  which the IMF forecasts that the growth would be 3 percent But there is no directive on the  issue of growth  The interest rate issue is also noteworthy I think there is a recognition that when we  have a degree of instability in exchange rates, which suggests very rapid changes in expectations,  small increases in the annual rate of interest are going to be overwhelmed by changes in  exchange rates You will recall that in 1992 the Swedes tried to curb a run on their exchange rate  by raising their overnight interest rate to 500 percent They discovered that when they divided  that rate by 365, the daily interest rate was small relative to the fluctuations they were  experiencing in their exchange rates I believe that lesson is understood by the IMF at this stage    12/16/97 62  The issue really is not about raising interest rates for the purpose of affecting the exchange rate  It is essentially a balancing of market forces and an effort to keep the money supply from  growing too fast and potentially engendering undermining inflationary pressures  So, I do question the IMF and their tendency to use language relating to this Southeast  Asian set of actions that sounds very similar to that used to describe actions taken to counter the  inflationary, government-debt type of problems in Latin America to which that language was  applicable Fortunately, when we look at the details of what the IMF is doing in Southeast Asia,  it turns out to be significantly less that kind of issue The IMF is dealing with a different regime  from that associated with the problems in Latin America   First Vice President Rives, do you want to add anything  to our discussions?   Then, let us break for coffee  [Coffee break]   Mr Kohn   Thank you Questions for Don? If not, let me warn of  our talking about the "worst" case or "worst" around-the-world scenario because everyone here  can contemplate a case, which is far more negative than the so-called "worst" case   Oh, "worse" case Sorry about that There is a "worst"  case, but I don't even want to contemplate it  There is not terribly much I can add with the exception of one area that I think has not  been fully addressed in our deliberations today We are looking at a November CPI increase of  01 percent In prior months, the changes in the CPI and the PPI clearly exhibited a receding  trend in the rate of inflation, no matter how these measures are affected by technical adjustments  In fact, we have been observing that trend for quite a long period of time in the context of still  rising profit margins, as best we can judge the latter from the most recent data  A distinctive feature of the Greenbook forecasts in the last two or three years, which it  has shared with other forecasts, has been the projection that profit margins would begin to fall  immediately from the base period of the forecasts This is important because arithmetically, as  we all know, if prices are not changing and profit margins are rising, unit costs are going    12/16/97 67  nowhere As we saw in the third-quarter profit data for nonfinancial corporations, that was  indeed the case We do not have such data for the fourth quarter as yet, but the presumption that  unit cost increases are low and productivity is accelerating seems rather difficult to support  considering the size of the increase in the hours input, adjusted or otherwise for hours of  self-employed workers, in the available data for the fourth quarter It will be difficult to get a  significant increase in productivity in the fourth quarter with the data we already have seen for  October and November unless the December hours numbers truly collapse Indeed, some  softening is implicit in the Greenbook because there appears to be a very substantial aberration in  the 400,000 plus increase in the payroll employment number for November In particular, the  seasonal adjustments are dubious, not to mention the hours figures, as was explained in Part II of  the Greenbook  Leaving aside the measurement problems, there is no way of getting around the fact  that, on average, productivity has been accelerating over the past several quarters We can argue  at great length about how businesses are managing their operations Obviously, if the  technological capabilities are not there, the potential real rates of return on facilities are not  achievable I don't care how assiduously businesses try to contain costs If they don't have the  necessary underlying infrastructure, they will not be able to do so But they have succeeded in  doing so, and the reason, as we have discussed on numerous occasions in the past, is that the  opportunities to improve profits clearly have been expanding I don't know what the real gains  in underlying productivity will turn out to be in the fourth quarter I don't know what they will  be in the first, second, third, and fourth quarters of next year I do know that the current  Greenbook does the same thing it did last time, namely, it takes the growth of so-called total    12/16/97 68  factor productivity--the residual in the decomposition of labor productivity growth--and turns it  significantly negative The staff forecast of a pickup in capital deepening implies a full  percentage point slowing in output per hour between 1997 and 1998 from what it would be if  total factor productivity growth were held at its 1997 pace and another quarter percentage point  slowing for 1999 I don't think any of us knows what that number can or should be All I can  tell you is that we keep getting reams of ever lower CPI readings that seem outrageous in the  context of clearly accelerating wages and an ever-tighter labor market in which employers are  running out of people they can hire Yet, prices are just locked in Indeed, as Don Kohn pointed  out, if we look at the underlying price structure, we see falling prices The Journal of Commerce  industrial price index, which every deflationist and every bear uses to make this case, does  indeed show prices going down significantly That is noteworthy because this is not a  particularly biased commodity price index It may well be the best among comparable indexes  Something very different is happening I think the only way we can explain it is from  the output per hour side Unfortunately, that is where our data are weakest The behavior of  inflation suggests to me that potential output is a lot higher than we tend to assume Leaving  aside the mismeasurement of prices, the notion that we are on the brink of a major acceleration  of inflationary pressures is correct arithmetically if we assume a stable rate of growth in  productivity It is not correct if we leave open the potential for an acceleration in productivity  The price data are telling us that the hypothesis that productivity is accelerating cannot be  dismissed unless the profit figures we are looking at are all wrong I am merely indicating that  there is something quite unusual going on here, and we have been aware of this for a  considerable period of time As I have argued many times in the past and despite the latest set of    12/16/97 69  employment data, employment cannot increase indefinitely at the rate it has been increasing  Leaving the Phillips curve aside, leaving NAIRUs aside, leaving everything aside, I do not know  how one can put negative people in an equation and then run it out At some point, something  has to give We cannot increase productivity merely by an act of will There are upside limits,  so that if effective demand continues to grow as it has, there is no question that inflationary  pressures have to emerge To paraphrase St Augustine, yes, but not yet   I didn't want to say the first part of that! [Laughter]  There is something going on here that we have not observed in decades, and maybe decades is  too short an interval I was startled by this morning's CPI report We cannot keep getting such  numbers and continue to say that inflation is about to rise As we keep projecting a higher rate of  inflation, it keeps going down, and there has to be an admission at some point that something  different is affecting prices The growing recognition of that is the reason why markets are  reacting as they are to incoming economic information That is why the big November surge of  400,000 in payroll employment had only a very slight market impact I don't think the surge  affected policy expectations and economic forecasts The markets are responding to something  that they perceive as important We don't know fully what it is; we do not have any data; and  we probably will not for a while  As I said last time, I do not deny that the Asian problem is a crucial issue with respect  to policy But I think it is a mistake to say that we should be moving at this stage, absent the  Asian difficulties That is at least a debatable issue I probably would come out in favor of  moving if for no other reason than that this economy has been undergoing a powerful surge and    12/16/97 70  we could not do much to harm it by moving rates up 25 basis points It is very hard to make the  case that we have tight money when the housing market is behaving as well as it is, including the  starts figures, granted the seasonal factors, that came out this morning So, we have experienced  unusual developments, which get compounded by the Asian situation The Asian problem is a  fascinating one for macroeconomic evaluation because, as those of you who have been involved  in building models know, there is virtually no way that we can infer a very large impact on the  American economy from the Asian developments in light of our fairly limited trade connections  We cannot get a very large number using the existing model structure because the latter in effect  has coefficients that essentially reflect the level of confidence that has existed over the period for  which we are fitting the model We have to bring in a confidence-deterioration factor as an  exogenous variable to get a different result It is very difficult to infer it in any material sense  In theory, we can get virtually any impact we want if we remember that what we mean  by psychology is the degree to which people withdraw or reach out In effect, it is a time  preference type of issue When people get frightened, they disengage or pull back from  whatever they are doing If they are involved in markets and are net long, then disengaging  means that prices go down If they are net short, prices go up In most markets, participants are  net long There are very few historical periods like the Northern Pacific panic early in this  century when everyone decided that there were more shorts than there were stocks outstanding  That led to a panic and everybody ran for cover; they disengaged If people disengage enough,  the payments system begins to freeze up, intermediation is curtailed, and all forms of lending  contract There is no downside in any model that is structured to pick this up, but a huge    12/16/97 71  implosion can nonetheless occur I don't think any econometric model would have picked up the  1929-1932 debacle without a major exogenous evaluation of how human beings behave  There is something going on out there, and I ask myself where its impact is being felt  Can it be on consumer confidence in the United States? I would say, hardly There is no  evidence of it; that would require a far greater disturbance We are just beginning to see reports  on the Asian crisis on the front pages of our newspapers It is still not in our mindset; it is not  significantly affecting attitudes Is bank lending pulling back here? I do not see any evidence of  that whatever A significant pullback cannot be based on the notion that there are a lot of losses  on loans to Southeast Asia, because our financial institutions have not lent that much to  borrowers in that part of the world Even if they lost 90 percent of those loans, it would not be a  big deal  The only place a material effect can occur is in the combination of asset prices and  capital investments For example, one can envisage a significant change in the equity premium  in the American stock market The calculations that people are currently making have the equity  premium at the low end of normal ranges with very significant further increases in earnings  embodied in the relationship At any realistic earnings forecast, stock prices will be substantially  overvalued It is conceivable that we could get a significant implosion here I believe the odds  are small but not zero What that essentially does is to create a high level of uncertainty, as the  Vice Chair was mentioning It gives us the much wider ranges of uncertainty that Governor  Rivlin referred to A lot of us were gradually becoming concerned about the range of  possibilities, not the probabilities but the tails of the various types of distributions, which very  clearly seem to be getting more extended    12/16/97  It is useful to think in terms of the Vice Chair's analogy about the meadow on the right  and the ditch on the left Some of the market changes in Asia have been overdone If financial  conditions there stabilize, the economies in that region could very easily recover, putting us back  in much the same place that we were in the sense that our economy would still be experiencing  quite strong demand There would be some lessening of export demand because it is very  unlikely, given the trauma they have experienced, that the Asian economies will suddenly return  to 8, 9, or 10 percent rates of economic growth If they achieve 2, 3, or 4 percent rates for a  while, that is not going to be a bad outcome They have been subjected to a tremendous shock,  and economies do not recover from that sort of shock readily It is going to take a while for them  to recover But that is not the critical issue The issue is whether their economic performance  will be severely negative or whether these countries just will not be the Asian tigers that they  once were  As I indicated before, the IMF is facing a different type of model in its efforts to  address the Asian situation It is not clear that the problems are going to be resolved readily I  do not think the issue here is one of propping up a number of institutions I believe there is a  fundamental flaw in the Asian economic model that is only becoming apparent now as their  technologies move closer to the cutting edge of technologies in the world and they begin to run  into problems because government-directed investment cannot work in highly sophisticated  economies I do not think they believe that They have had an extraordinary run for three  decades You cannot tell a Korean cabinet minister that what they have been doing is wrong  you can do a lot of things to get them to say things that sound more    12/16/97 73  forthcoming; but you do not change a people's view of how the world works in a matter of two  or three weeks  If there is a big flood of IMF money into Asia, I think we will find that they are going  to continue doing whatever they did before They are going to behave the way they think they  ought to, which is what got them into trouble Injecting a lot of IMF money would just prolong  the problem situation, but I don't believe that is going to happen I think that there has been a  considerable increase of realism in the IMF I do not anticipate a crisis, but I do not expect a  quick recovery The problem is going to be with us for a good while, and I think it is going to  have generally negative effects, the extent of which I do not have any way to evaluate  I have gone on longer than I expected Where I come out on policy is that I continue  to believe that we will have to move rates up at some point I see that as the most probable next  move This assumes that the Asian problem will diminish and that the tremendous underlying  thrust that we have in our economy eventually will run into limits stemming from productivity  constraints But if we focus on the very short run, it strikes me that the probability of our having  to move in the next month or two is exceptionally low, given the price numbers we have been  looking at The only move that we might make in this period, if we move at all, might be to  lower rates as a consequence of some substantial asset deflation, a prospect that has a low  probability  Accordingly, I would be marginally in favor of alternative B symmetric this time On  the basis of the price indexes for the last couple of months, that probably is the right policy until  we see some evidence, not necessarily of consumer prices, but at least of commodity prices or  the prices of intermediate goods starting to move or some evidence of declines in profit margins    12/16/97 74  All of these developments will precede an acceleration of the CPI, but we are seeing none of  that, and it is going to take several months for anything like that to emerge I think the market, in  looking at central bank policy, probably is saying that the Fed will not move until we see some  pressure on prices It is not sufficient evidence to argue that the economy is running hot, that the  labor markets are very tight, and that there is evidence that wages are accelerating That is  necessary evidence, but it certainly is not sufficient for a policy move unless one argues that  productivity is not accelerating, that profit margins are not expanding, and that the total unit  costs structure is beginning to exert greater pressure on prices that we are able to observe As far  as I can see, none of that is occurring So, I would argue for "B" symmetric Other members  may feel that we should remain asymmetric I could live with that without any difficulty Vice  Chair   President Minehan   President Parry    12/16/97   President Broaddus   President Hoenig   Governor Phillips   President Boehne   President Moskow   President Guynn   President Stern   Governor Rivlin    12/16/97 81   Governor Ferguson   President Jordan   Governor Kelley   Governor Meyer   President McTeer   Governor Gramlich   First Vice President Rives, do you want to add anything  to this discussion?   There seems to be a very substantial majority for "B"  and a modest majority for symmetry Would you read the directive in that context?   Would you call the roll on that directive?   Welcome, everybody I especially want to welcome  back an old colleague, Bill Poole I did not realize that the last time he sat in this room was 25  years ago   It has taken 25 years to move from there to here?  [Laughter]   Well, that's the pleasant news The less pleasant news  is that both Joe Coyne and Larry Promisel, who have been fixtures in this room and around here  for a very long time, probably are attending their last meeting  The agenda is fairly routine today, as you well know, and I would like to start off by  requesting approval of the minutes for the meeting of February 3-4, 1998   Without objection You all have received a Report of  Examination of the System Open Market Account Are there any questions on that? If not,  would somebody like to move acceptance?   Without objection Peter Fisher, please   Give him an "A" [Laughter]   The difference between the New York Bank and the  Board with respect to Treasury receipts is huge in the sense that it does not appear from the  pattern on the chart that this is merely a displacement of revenues from one period to another  New York's 1998 fiscal year surplus is significantly higher than the Board's What number do  you have?   Is the Treasury surplus for the fiscal year over $50  billion at this point in your forecast?   Can we go back briefly to Japan? I think we are all  puzzled by the presumption of the Japanese authorities that they can somehow have an effective  program to change the stock market and announce it It is questionable enough to believe that  the government can substantially alter the level of the stock market It is worse to believe that it  can announce its intention to do so and presume that the readings that are going to occur as a  consequence are going to be taken seriously by anybody Most questionable of all was the  announcement yesterday by the postal and life insurance system that they had completed their  transfers to purchase stocks for the period through March 31 You said they do not have a  policy Having any plausible policy is better than none If this is the way they conduct their  financing operations, why is there not far more significant negative reaction within Japan to this  type of operation, which seems so inefficacious?   One of the purposes of their stock market operations  was to create Basel-weighted capital adequacy ratios for the March 31 statement date If I am a  counterparty funding some of these Japanese banks, I am not going to look at those numbers  What possible use are they to me in judging the safety and soundness of Japanese institutions if  they are produced as if somebody had lit a match under the thermometer?   What has been the latest premium in the London market  on yen deposits for Japanese banks?   But it is still positive?   The premium has to be a reflection of doubts about the  sovereign credit   They have always had the opinion that since they  would never let a bank fail, the Basel ratios were irrelevant   The fact that they agreed to the Basel ratios has always  implied a very unusual admixture On the one hand, every Japanese commercial bank is backed  by Japan's sovereign credit, and on the other hand, they have met their Basel ratios This creates  confusion It has to be terribly confusing to a lot of our colleagues in Japan who are wondering  where all this is going Other questions for Peter?   Further questions for Peter? If not, would somebody  like to move to ratify the actions of the Desk?   Our next meeting is May 19th We adjourn for lunch  END OF MEETING       Without objection Let us move on to Mike Prell and  Larry Promisel   Larry, I noticed that in the last couple of days we have  had a particularly strong trade-weighted dollar How much is the dollar above expectations in  the final Greenbook forecast, which I assume was put together a week to ten days ago?   That is the G-10 weighted average?   The recent appreciation is still noise as far as the  Greenbook forecast is concerned?   Supposing the fiscal year surplus number comes in  closer to the New York Bank's estimate than ours That would seem to be outside the noise  range in terms of the implications for fiscal drag What kind of response would you have if we  accepted their numbers for receipts? What happens?    3/31/98   Do you have any rule of thumb regarding the effect of  changes in crude oil prices on the core CPI--some notion of the feed-through?   It is quite substantial in other words   President Moskow   President Jordan   Can we stipulate that measured productivity is distinct  from true productivity?   Any further questions for the gentlemen?   Further questions? If not, would someone like to start  the roundtable? President Jordan   President Parry   President Moskow   President Boehne    3/31/98   President Guynn   President Hoenig   President Minehan   President McTeer    3/31/98   President Broaddus   President Stem   Are you going to answer that question?   Why don't we take a break because if we go through  the rest of the speakers, we will have our coffee break after lunch! Let's allocate 10 minutes  [Coffee break]   Governor Rivlin   Governor Meyer   Governor Gramlich   Governor Ferguson   Vice Chair   Governor Kelley   Governor Phillips    3/31/98   Thank you very much I will now call on Don Kohn   Questions for Don? If not, let me get started  It is quite evident, as Governor Rivlin said, that the performance of this economy is  about the best that we can possibly imagine I suspect that I have been watching the economy  longer than anyone around this table, so I can confirm that statement in terms of personal  observation over an extended period The economy's performance is absolutely unusual It  seems to be caught in the grip of a virtuous wealth-effect cycle That is, the extraordinary  domestic demand that we are observing is almost surely a spillover from the unbelievable  uptrend in the ratio of wealth to disposable income that we have experienced over the past  several years As we know, the wealth effect has a lagged and cumulative effect that begins to  flatten out only after there occurs a significant and evident slowing of wealth creation There is  no evidence of the latter I think the Dow is up about 1,000 points so far this year  Clearly, the situation is difficult to get into context because if we take the level of, say,  the S&P 500 and decompose it into the riskless rate of interest, the projected rate of growth in    3/31/98  earnings, and, as a residual calculation, the equity premium, we end up with an equity premium  that is at the lower end of the historical range of experience even if we accept the Street's  estimates of quite extraordinary growth in earnings While it is not as low as it was in the  summer of 1987, it is quite low relative to any recent period and it has been moving down at a  fairly dramatic pace That in and of itself doesn't tell us terribly much until we look at the  implications of the earnings expectations that are implicit in that structure If we convert the  earnings expectations for the S&P 500 into operating profits in the NIPA accounts, then profit  margins, which have been rising considerably for quite a period of time, continue to rise  indefinitely; they eventually break through to all time highs and still continue to rise Everything  we know about the way the system functions implies that that is an utterly unrealistic  expectation  The question, however, is how far the rise in stock market prices can go We know  from history that markets can be perceived as overvalued for an exceptionally long period of  time It is quite conceivable, as the Vice Chair says, that the extraordinary flows into equity  mutual funds can sustain this market phenomenon for a while But countering that is something  that was not very evident the last time we met, namely, that operating earnings are beginning to  come up short of forecasts, and indeed their growth rate clearly has begun to decline in the past  several months These are not the numbers that are showing up so far in the earnings per share  of the S&P 500 companies because that index provides a biased estimate of total earnings The  S&P 500, by the nature of its selection criteria, picks up those companies that are growing most  rapidly and whose earnings generally have been quite impressive Nonetheless, there is no doubt  that the earnings growth numbers are slowing down    3/31/98  That means that for the first time in evaluating the unit cost structure of nonfinancial  corporations, we are not looking at the phenomenon that I have referred to many times at these  meetings of a very low inflation rate and stable or rising operating profit margins, the direct  implication of which is that growth of unit costs is negligible We are still seeing very low  inflation The estimates through the first quarter are about as low as we have seen for quite a  while, oil obviously being a relevant factor here But even apart from oil prices, we do not yet  see any meaningful acceleration of inflation The evidence of pricing power on the part of  business is still lacking There is no anecdotal evidence of which I am aware--and I have not  heard any in the discussion here--that suggests a change in the suppression of pricing power  Indeed, in the Beigebook summary, I have forgotten the exact phrase, but it was noted that  pressures on product prices were "eerily calm" That in fact is characteristic of what is going on  at this stage We have very little evidence of inflation, but we are beginning to see pressures  emerge in the cost structure, and that obviously is one of the reasons why profit margins are  beginning to slip  Even though we continue to get declining unit nonlabor costs, we are beginning to see  some acceleration, still not large, in unit labor costs In the nonfinancial corporate sector, we are  seeing an increase in hourly compensation at a rate of roughly 4 percent That rate is not  accelerating at this stage, and I suspect one of the reasons is that firms are using every novel way  they can devise to keep compensation costs down Obvious also are their efforts to improve  productivity  The productivity numbers are very rough estimates because we are measuring a whole  set of product outputs from one set of data and a whole set of labor inputs from a different set  That they come out even remotely measuring actual labor productivity is open to question in my    3/31/98  view Nonetheless, we do see some slowdown in the published data, although output per hour  estimated through the first quarter of 1998 for nonfinancial corporate business still shows a 23  percent increase from four quarters earlier That is down only modestly from a year ago but  down significantly from the surge that we saw in the middle of last year, which surely was an  aberration As you will recall, BLS estimates that output per hour increased at a 63 percent  annual rate in the third quarter of 1997 It just is not possible for productivity to increase that  fast I think the four-quarter average is more meaningful Productivity gains in these data appear  to be sufficiently strong to keep increases in unit labor costs down to an annual rate of about 1-1/2  percent for nonfinancial corporations  Basically, we are observing a very substantial wealth effect but one that has not yet  spilled over to a significant extent into the product area, creating shortages of goods and services  As you know, there are none The National Association of Purchasing Managers' survey  indicates what I think is a record lull in reported shortages of materials There is no evidence of  tightness in facilities There is exceptional tightness in labor markets, obviously, and if anything,  they are getting tighter We have a phenomenon that I don't think we have seen in the post  World War II period This economic performance is really different I don't know how one  would determine what it is, but there is some "X" factor, a missing variable in our basic models,  that has to be there to explain why even with these exceptionally tight labor markets, we are only  getting an increase in compensation per hour of slightly more than 4 percent and, more  importantly, why pricing power is not evident in this situation  Nonetheless, there is very little evidence to suggest that monetary policy is tight We  cannot explain why the underlying demands in the interest-sensitive areas of the economy are as  strong as they are, and I will even acknowledge that maybe the weather has had some effect on    3/31/98  both housing and some sectors of the retail markets that are displaying more strength than one  would expect, at least on a historical basis, given the level of short-term interest rates  All in all, we have an economic performance that is essentially unsustainable It is  unsustainable in two contexts One, the stock market as far as I can see cannot sustain its current  strength The aggregative virtuous cycle that is embodied in it cannot keep going without  ultimately running off the track There is no credible model of which I am aware that embodies  all of this In my judgment, echoing a good deal of what has been said around this table, unless  either profit margins decline or some other developments break the back of this stock market  surge in the very short run and take much of the strength out of the forces that dominate this  expansion, we will have more inflation Even so, the adjustment cannot happen very rapidly  even though the economy could begin to go in a different direction One alternative scenario is  that the fallout from the Asian situation, which as far as the Greenbook is concerned is about to  exert a significant effect on our economy, actually will do so It is generally correct to say that  the economies of Southeast Asia are very weak The Japanese government estimates that  industrial production will be significantly negative in February and March The first quarter is  very clearly much weaker than the fourth I think that, if anything, the Japanese economy is in a  fairly pronounced recession at this stage That is also the case in Thailand and Korea where  production has fallen very dramatically The weakness associated with Asian developments has  not yet reached these shores fully, but there have been some pricing repercussions and orders  clearly have been affected But it is by no means clear that even at its full force, as a number of  you including Bill Poole have indicated, the Asian effect will be enough to undercut this  expansion to an extent that drives it off track    3/31/98  Therefore, in a sense responding to Cathy Minehan's question of when we will start to  move, I believe that we are running out of time I think that unless this system starts to  self-correct fairly shortly, we will have no choice but to move In the process, we could very  well crack the stock market We could affect a lot of things because this benevolent virtuous  cycle probably has also created an increasing vulnerability in the sense that yield spreads have  fallen to unbelievable numbers, the slack attitude of lending officers has become a potential  concern, and the risks that people normally are worried about have tended to be ignored All this  means that if we have a sharp adjustment, it will occur at a time when the vulnerability of the  economic system is far greater than is the case when we have a great deal of uncertainty There  is too little uncertainty in this system Human nature has not changed and when it reasserts  itself, things are going to look a lot different  To translate all of this into policy, I think we ought to be moving back to asymmetry at  this stage because developments since the last meeting have changed economic conditions  enough to justify that I do not think it is appropriate to move at this stage Were we to do so, I  believe we would create too large a shock to the system, which it would not be able to absorb  quickly More importantly, I don't think there is that much urgency What we are observing can  go on for a quite significant period of time While I agree with those who say that product price  inflation ultimately has to accelerate and something has to give at some point if the growth of  effective domestic demand continues at the current pace, that is not necessarily going to happen  very quickly That's because the productivity numbers are reasonably strong and the absence of  pricing power is still very much a factor in holding down inflation It is by no means evident if  we look, for example, at the chain-weighted GDP deflator or the domestic purchases deflator,  that prices are in any sense accelerating Indeed, the first-quarter estimate is the lowest we have    3/31/98  seen in this cyclical expansion Part of the explanation obviously is oil, though I don't know  what that part is But as we discussed before, we just cannot take oil out of our inflation  measures and make believe it does not exist; it is too big a factor in an economy As I see it, the  overall inflation rate has shown no evidence of accelerating at this stage To be sure, the core  CPI did show an uptick, but a good part of that is tobacco, which is no longer an open market  product While airline fares did go up and they are an open market product, we are not yet  getting the inflation pressure So, I think that we have to be, as the Vice Chair said, on a new  alert because if this expansion does not slow down, we will have to start to move I think the  clock is starting to tick, and my guess is that unless the evidence of an Asian slowdown is fairly  pronounced and/or the stock market goes in the other direction, we will be singing a different  tune the next time we meet  So, I would recommend and put "B" asymmetric on the table for consideration I feel  uncomfortable about switching back to asymmetry after having moved to symmetry so recently,  but I think the real world has changed Vice Chair   President Parry   That is an interesting question I would appreciate  hearing other comments on that Vice Chair, do you have a comment?   That would be my inclination The reason I would feel  uncomfortable with a short press statement is that we could not leave it at that The question  would remain as to why we did it If it appears that economic developments are beginning to  move us toward a policy change, I think we will have a lot more to explain I might add,  incidentally, that we cannot be perceived as moving to thwart the stock market That may be  implicit in our analysis of what the economy is doing, but a move to curb the buildup in stock  market wealth is a very difficult issue to put on the table We have to be very careful about that    3/31/98  The argument is that the wealth effect is driving domestic demand, which in turn is driving the  product markets, but it cannot be other than that, if I may put it that way   President Boehne   President Broaddus   Wouldn't it be better to start doing that when it does  not matter?    3/31/98   If we are to establish a precedent, it seems best to do so  when it does not create problems   President Jordan   I think that already has been done   After having listened to your earlier comment, I think  wise heads around here made a change   President Hoenig   Governor Meyer   You mean the whole directive?   President Poole    3/31/98   I think we ought to put it on the agenda for the next  meeting That issue has not come up in that form until very recently, and I think it is worthwhile  discussing it   President Stern   President Moskow   Governor Ferguson    3/31/98   President Guynn    3/31/98   Governor Kelley   Governor Rivlin   Governor Phillips    3/31/98   President McTeer   President Minehan   That could be part of the discussion that we will have at  the next meeting because it is part of the same issue   Governor Gramlich    3/31/98   Okay I think we have a broad consensus around "B"  asymmetric, so would you read the directive    3/31/98   That would be accurate   Call the roll   That is the conventional rhetoric   We have been butchering the English language in this  directive for years, but let's not change it just yet Why don't you bring that up at a later  meeting? [Laughter]   Would somebody like to move approval of the minutes  for the meeting of March 31?   Without objection This incidentally is the last meeting  of our esteemed Governor Phillips   I'm sure it occurred to you, Susan, that you don't have  to read them anymore! In any case, we will miss you As you know, there is an official farewell  luncheon at the time of the next meeting We will withhold all our kind remarks at this point  because we do not want to influence your vote this morning, one way or another   I think all of you are aware that Lynn Fox is trying to  step into Joe Coyne's shoes, a task she is struggling with successfully, I hope We welcome you to  your first meeting  Peter Fisher, would you take over please?   Questions for Peter?   President Hoenig   Vice Chairman   President Minehan   Do they take in collateral on this paper?   So, it is collateralized   As Ted says, it is government paper Let me ask you  this because it is an interesting issue Can you conceive of a problem emerging in that respect?   It is getting scarier and scarier At least, I am getting  more scared   Further questions?   Is there a second?   I think that is a fairly sensible idea There is no point  in rushing it, and there is absolutely no urgency that we resolve this issue quickly Can we put it on  the calendar for the June 30-July 1 meeting?   Our next meeting is on June 30-July 1  END OF MEETING       Without objection Mr Prell   Questions for Mike? President Parry   President Moskow   President Minehan   Mike, can we get the University of Michigan to insert a  single additional question for just one month? Before people are asked what they expect price  inflation to be over the next year, they would be asked what they thought inflation was in the  previous year I will bet that the results would be startling   If we asked a number of people what the inflation rate  was in the last year, I cannot believe that most would come within 5 percentage points This  Michigan Survey, as best I can judge, is asking straight questions of people without any bias Even  so, I would be terribly curious to see whether the responses come close to what the actual inflation  rate was I think that information is needed before you can safely say, as you said just a moment  ago, that they are still expecting an inflation rate higher than the actual rate It depends on which  direction they are going It is not irrelevant what they think the previous year's rate was   It surely would    5/19/98   Maybe they ought to ask my question after they ask all  the other questions!   Doesn't the Conference Board truncate some of these  means?   It would be very interesting to know whether that  works   President Poole    5/19/98   Crude oil and oil product inventories have moved up  quite significantly   That is evidence of some backing up in inventories  because the accumulation is not what they intended   So, from the look of things, oil inventories are higher  than intended The oil companies obviously would have preferred a lower level of liftings around  the world, especially the amount that has flowed into the United States, which they obviously are  trying to cut Oil stocks are not an irrelevant statistic among the numbers we are looking at   I think the answer, and that is what the Greenbook  suggests, is that there's very little evidence that it is involuntary   In that regard, the only really interesting statistic that  we have is the response to a question we asked the purchasing managers, namely whether in their  judgment the inventories of manufacturers' customers were too high, about right, or too low    5/19/98  While the latest published number is up slightly, it is still well within any meaningful range There  is no indication that inventories are building up involuntarily Since virtually all goods are  manufactured goods, one would presume that purchasing managers would provide a very good  assessment of the inventory situation, and their responses do not show any particular problem I  gather that the data from the National Federation of Independent Businesses (NFIB) show much the  same thing   That is usually an indication of history though   The truth of the matter is that inventory backups are  perceived only when final demand begins to slow I think we almost never find anecdotal  inventory concerns when markets are moving as fast as they are currently    5/19/98   Part of the latter is corporate debt repayments   It is the only one that we have showing an acceleration  in the second quarter   In other words, merely reducing the rates without any  indication of whether there is a problem or not will arithmetically reduce the level of output   President Jordan   President McTeer has been trying to get in He has  probably forgotten his question! [Laughter]    5/19/98   Any further questions for Mike? Go ahead   Further questions for Mike? If not, who would like to  start the roundtable? President Boehne   President Broaddus   President Parry   President Moskow   President Minehan   President McTeer   President Guynn   President Stem   Governor Phillips   President Jordan   More dollars than cents! [Laughter]    5/19/98   President Hoenig   Governor Gramlich   Vice Chair   Governor Ferguson   Governor Rivlin   Governor Kelley    5/19/98   Governor Meyer   President Poole   I assume we have coffee out there even though it may  be a little cold [Laughter]  [Coffee break]   Unless there is any objection, consider it done Now,  back to monetary policy Mr Kohn   Thank you That was an excellent and balanced  presentation of the problems that we confront Questions for Don? If not, I will start  It is apparent that our discussion has been one of the more interesting roundtables that  we have had for a while in our effort to assess the underlying crosscurrents in the economy and the  policy tradeoffs I will cover the same subject matter and review it point by point  First, I agree with a number of you who view the Asian crisis and the international  financial system as involving crucial issues I must say that I am a lot more pessimistic about Japan    5/19/98  than is implicit in the Greenbook analysis In my view, that huge economy is under significant  downward strain, which unless it stabilizes will spill over into the United States in ways that I do  not think we can fully anticipate at this point Fortunately the size of the Indonesia economy is not  of sufficient magnitude to have a major impact on its neighbors or the United States Nonetheless,  it is enough to be a serious issue  The  Indonesian markets, as you know, are exceptionally weak and effectively shut down  A very significant but not widely discussed problem is the Korean labor situation  Korea has a big economy It is a lot larger than Indonesia's though obviously not nearly the size of  Japan's It has improved quite significantly; you will recall that they had virtually no usable central  bank reserves, and now they have built them up to almost $30 billion In that regard, if it were not  for the current labor unrest and the political problems, I believe Korea clearly would be a  stabilizing force in Asia But as best I can judge, the Korean economy has started to turn in a  negative direction, and I don't think we can forecast the magnitude of the potential decline  The second issue that we have discussed is the US stock market Its performance, as  we are all aware, has been crucial in this virtuous cycle The rise in stock prices has had a variety  of positive results, including the stimulation of increased effective demand that in turn has led to  larger federal government revenues that first lowered the budget deficit and more recently produced  a surplus The market is still exerting a positive effect on the economy, although stock prices have  changed little on balance since the last FOMC meeting    5/19/98  I have been giving a lot of thought to the question of whether we are experiencing a  stock market bubble, and if we are, what we should do about it If the market were to fall 40 or 50  percent, I would be willing to stipulate that there had been a bubble! Now, if we invert that, we  have to be able to say before the fact that we define a bubble by being willing to forecast that the  market is going down, say, 50 percent That is a tough forecast to make We all have our capital  asset models--more or less sophisticated time discount structures in which we evaluate what is  going on in the market--but in truth we have to take account of the fact that we have an  international market with millions of people who make decisions for a wide range of reasons It is  very difficult to forecast the market when we are dealing with a huge number of money market  professionals who know as much about what is going on with individual stocks as anybody These  people currently are buying individual stocks at prices that create a Dow Jones industrial average of  over 9,000 It is not that they are buying the market per se In the circumstances, it is very difficult  for us to judge whether the market is overvalued and is about to go down One can readily say that  the equity premium that one derives from a capital asset model is showing such and such and is a  low number historically, that expected earnings are going up at an exceptionally high rate, and that  this does not make sense because it implies that profit margins will increase indefinitely One can  make all those statements, as I do, and conclude that the stock market is significantly overvalued,  which I do But I ask myself, do I really know significantly more than the money managers who  effectively determine the prices of these individual stocks? I must say that I, too, feel a degree of  humility about my present ability to make such a forecast  The more interesting question is whether, even if we were to decide we had a bubble  and we wanted to let the air out of it, we would be able to do it I am not sure of the answer We  have observed, in fact, that letting the air out of the bubble, if it exists, could well be    5/19/98  counterproductive I cannot be sure but I suspect that the fact that the economy did not begin to  unwind after the more than 20 percent stock market crash in October 1987 probably served to  create an upside potential in the Dow of a couple thousand additional points As you will recall, as  soon as things began to stabilize, investors concluded that if this was the worst that could happen,  they should get back into the market We have had three or four similar episodes, though not of the  1987 magnitude, that have reinforced the view that the upside potential of this market has risen  So, we have to be very wary of the notion that a small 25 or 50 basis point move could permanently  unwind this bubble Unquestionably, it will do so for a short period of time, but it may then merely  set the stage for a further rise that may in fact be highly destabilizing I have no doubt that if it  were really our desire to unwind a stock market bubble, we could do it I have no doubt that a 200  or 300 basis point rise in the funds rate would do it overnight I'm not sure that there is a point in  between, a saddle point, where we could hit the market, defuse it, stabilize it, and nothing else  would happen There may be such a point I don't know how we would ever find it I am certain  that if it were the policy objective, we would fail  After thinking a great deal about this and wondering how we should integrate this  issue into our evaluations, I have in effect come out where Bob McTeer has The question,  essentially, is whether we have any great insight into how to handle asset values as a part of  monetary policy In principle, we have to recognize that asset values have an effect, so we have to  consider their impact and we certainly do so in terms of the wealth effect But how we can alter the  pattern of market valuations, as distinct from its effects on consumption and other sectors of the  economy, is somewhat beyond me I have concluded that in the broader sense we have to stay with  our fundamental central bank goal, namely, to stabilize product price levels To the extent that the  financial markets affect the factors that influence product price levels, I think monetary policy    5/19/98  action is appropriate But I believe the notion of merely hitting the market itself is an illusion It  may be something that we could discuss at great length as a chapter of a textbook, but I doubt very  much that we know how to implement it from a policy point of view  The third and crucial issue that has come up today relates to wages and productivity  I agree that the ECI has changed at a far more modest pace than one would have expected on the  basis of past Phillips curve calculations But compensation per hour figures are running somewhat  higher and in fact tend to negate the conclusion one draws from the ECI So, there is an interesting  question as to which set of data is more appropriate There is no question in my mind that the ECI,  properly measured, does reflect the wage structure I suspect, however, that in periods like the  present when there are extreme shortages of certain skills in the workforce, a lot of the increases in  labor compensation are not showing up in higher wages for a given job but rather in promotions  and the like because that is the way business firms can avoid certain internal problems The overall  effect cannot be large, but it has to be of some size So, I would be somewhat less sanguine than I  might otherwise be about how good the ECI numbers look, though there is no way of getting  around the fact that the wage pattern has been somewhat subdued  The more interesting data that are beginning to emerge are those that provide  increasing evidence that the underlying trend of productivity is moving up One can disregard the  noncorporate sector, which I think abnormally constrains the number we use for total nonfarm  productivity, and look at the area for which data are clearer--that is, the nonfinancial corporate  sector There is, of course, a statistical discrepancy between the output data from the spending side,  even if we make adjustments for the noncorporate area, and the data from the income side The  advantage of looking at productivity from the income side, as the BLS formerly did, is that the  income side is internally consistent with the price numbers The reconciliation from productivity to    5/19/98  prices, if we are dealing with output measured from the spending side, requires us to make some  judgment about how to handle the increasing statistical discrepancy, whereas dealing with the  income side eliminates that need I'm not saying that one approach is superior to the other as a  pure measure of productivity, but I wanted to point out that the income side approach is an easier  way to get through to the price relationships  Having said that, the published productivity data for nonfinancial corporations have  shown some modest decline over the last three years from a 3 percent rate over the four quarters  ended in the first quarter of 1996 to 27 percent for the four quarters ended in the first quarter this  year However, when the hours data are adjusted for the length of the pay period problem, the  comparison reverses significantly Instead of going down from 30 to 27 percent over the last two  years, productivity growth goes up from 27 to 32 percent, 32 percent being the staff's estimate of  the rate over the four quarters ended in the first quarter of this year The first quarter by itself has  an estimated 34 percent annual rate of increase and the estimated increase in manufacturing for the  month of April is 8 percent So, I find it very difficult to set aside the evidence that these data are  indeed accelerating  The staff put together a set of data that in essence cyclically adjusts these numbers to  observe how productivity growth in the nonfinancial corporate sector would have looked at a fixed  operating rate, ie neutralizing the business cycle While, of course, the growth in productivity is  somewhat slower, it is only marginally slower The pronounced acceleration in the trend starting in  early 1995 is unaffected  You may recall the argument I made a year or so ago that an explanation is required  for the sharp increase in capital investment, especially in high-tech areas, that started in 1993 and  has persisted since then One explanation, in fact a necessary explanation, is that plant managers    5/19/98  who were involved in planning capital investments anticipated that a significant increase in the  prospective real rates of return on facilities could be achieved as a result of emerging new  technologies If that had been a mistake on their part, one would have expected capital investment  to run up for a year or two and then start down again when the lower-than-anticipated rates of  return actually showed up Instead, if anything the whole process has accelerated If one were to  calculate the real rates of return that are implicit in the sharp rise in investment, I think one would  find that the actual real rates of return have gone up, but I have not done the calculation yet I  know that real profits have risen and therefore the actual incremental profit has gone up, but I am  not sure whether it has gone up more than the denominator, the capital investment to which it  applies  It is clear that a very significant acceleration in productivity has occurred compared  with the previous trend A goodly part, perhaps most of it though not all, is attributable to a pickup  in the rate of capital deepening That is because there clearly have been improvements in the  quality of labor, and because the residual, which we call total factor productivity, has gone up as  well While we are getting very significant advances in capital spending and total factor  productivity that suggest an increase in real rates of return, what we are trying to explain is why  labor productivity is rising Labor productivity very clearly has accelerated, and it has done so  because of its interaction with the sharp rise in capital investment that has occurred So, it strikes  me that that set of data is internally consistent with the presumption that we have had a marked and  discontinuous pickup in productivity growth that started in 1995  There is another set of observations that also was quite important in our around-the-  table discussion of the economic outlook Bill Poole referred to the issue that a number of you  have raised in the past with regard to the very striking statements that businessmen are making    5/19/98  When asked why the big increases in their wages or other costs have not been reflected in their  profits, they respond that they offset those increases by raising productivity That implies that  productivity is a free good in the sense that if a business needs a bit more of it, it sprinkles a little  on its income statement and it can do so at will This makes no sense because it is not conceivable  that productivity is available at will unless there is some significant increase in the backlog of  unexploited productivity-related capital investments If that situation exists, then when a business  says that it will work to get costs down, there would be available on-the-shelf types of equipment,  research, managerial alterations, and the like that could significantly increase productivity or offset  costs It is the cost offset that most businesses look at But on a consolidated basis, two-thirds of  their costs are labor and the latter therefore have an important effect on the productivity data I  don't think we know for sure at this point how long this process will persist  We do know and can readily observe that there has been a very dramatic increase in  underlying demand in the economy What is also fascinating is how easy it is to bring on new  supply The reason for that is obviously in part the fact that the lead times for deliveries of  equipment have fallen so materially that when demand picks up, it is readily met by increases in  production We are looking at a huge increase in demand in the manufacturing sector, but one that  has readily been met by increases in supply with no evident shortages and no slowing in lead times  on deliveries All of this is consistent with what a number of you have called the supply side  elements in the economy I have no doubt that we have very strong demand underlying this  expansion I think the Greenbook is probably right in its forecast that this demand will decelerate,  but I also share the concerns that a number of you have raised that it may be sustained for an  extended period because it is very hard to detect any slowing at this point    5/19/98  Labor markets are tightening, as many of you have argued I thought that the  comment about not being able to find recruiters was especially significant [Laughter] We are  running out of new workers Part of that problem is being resolved by substituting capital for  people, but that obviously cannot go on indefinitely At some point there will be a reversal of the  very sluggish pattern of wages, which I have attributed to a possible desire for increased job  security stemming from the fear of job skill obsolescence associated with the introduction of  technology That appears to have caused a shift in emphasis from wage increases to job security as  evidenced in union contracts But union contracts are becoming a smaller and smaller part of the  market As a consequence, I don't think we can know for certain whether, and how much, job  security concerns are still damping wage increases  If we were dealing with an economy in which the productivity data were not showing  significant signs of acceleration or if we knew with some degree of conviction that the productivity  gains were temporary, that the international financial system was not in as fragile a state as it is,  including the Asian problem and its effects on Russia, Brazil, Mexico, and similar countries, then I  think we probably would have moved the funds rate higher a meeting or two ago In any event, it is  very difficult to get around the notion that what is going on strictly in the domestic economy is  something that could very readily run off the rails as various developments that have contributed to  the virtuous cycle that the economy clearly is experiencing start to unwind I personally have been  somewhat reluctant to support tightening because I think that the cost structure, even with the  acceleration in wages, is still moving up in the nonfinancial corporate sector at less than a 1 percent  annual rate That rise essentially picks up increases in unit labor costs of a little over 1 percent, unit  nonlabor costs that are declining markedly, and a modest decline in profit We can describe the    5/19/98  underlying cost structure as still quite benign I do think, however, that it has been showing some  slight uptilt in the last couple of quarters though the uptilt really is quite minor  There is a question of the cost of waiting to see how all of this will turn out  Obviously, if the international system stabilizes, or in fact gets worse, that factor is going to be  removed from our calculations one way or the other I don't know what is going to happen to the  stock market I must say that I would not be surprised to see it weaken significantly, but I would  not want to bet the ranch on that at this stage I do think that the crucial decision we have to make  and have been making for a while is the recognition that the longer we wait, if our analysis of this  process is wrong, the more we will have to do to stabilize the economic system I believe that is a  given The issue is whether the cost is so large as to induce us to act very soon Jerry Jordan thinks  that a substantial adjustment will be needed if we do not act promptly I cannot say that I know he  is wrong I suspect that, in line with what Don Kohn was saying, the currently low level of  inflation probably gives us a little more of an opportunity to wait--I say "probably" without a high  degree of certainty In other words, taking the most striking statistic, a GDP deflator of under 1  percent at an annual rate for the first quarter gives us a little leeway on the upside We can afford  to be wrong; we can afford to wait; and we can afford to pay a modest price to avoid taking the risk  of acting prematurely, which I think is what would be involved if we took action today and maybe  even at the next meeting I am fairly certain that if we were to move in the near term, certainly  today, the impact on Asia and the international financial structure would be surprisingly large I am  not sure that would be true at the next meeting, but it might However, if this expansion does not  moderate, I don't think we can wait indefinitely At some point we will have to say there is a  danger It is conceivable a move could create significant international financial turmoil, which    5/19/98  would redound onto the US economy as well, but the alternative could very readily be perceived  as worse  After that rather long discourse, I conclude that I would like to stay where we are at  this stage I think that not moving today is quite important especially because of Asia, but I believe  that maintaining asymmetry toward tightening is essential as well because I think the evidence  points in that direction Vice Chair   President Poole   President Minehan    5/19/98 94   President Broaddus   President Boehne   Governor Rivlin   Governor Kelley   President Stern   Governor Gramlich   President Parry   President Hoenig   President Guynn   Governor Meyer   President Moskow   President McTeer   Governor Phillips   President Jordan   Governor Ferguson   The preponderance is for "B" asymmetric  Could you read the operational paragraph?   Call the roll on that recommendation   Ijust read on the Dow Jones tape that this meeting was going to begin at 900 am as scheduled It is now 85825 am Does anybody object to moving up this schedule?   Without objection   Who would like to move the minutes of our previous meeting?   Without objection Peter Fisher, would you start us off?   The black market ruble is selling at 9 and the fix was around  7 What are the mechanics that allow that to happen, and secondly, which of the two rates filters into  the price inflation structure? In other words, which rate affects import pricing?   That is the wrong answer! [Laughter]   Is there a measure of volume in the black market?   Some black markets are blacker than others   President Minehan   President Jordan   What about the differential between tradable goods  prices in Japan and the average general price level, which is really a crucial difference there  relative to the rest of the world? What do the markets think about that resolution?   In other words, how do the traders view a continuing  weakening in the yen and Japan's ever increasing trade surplus?   I appreciate that, Vice Chair [Laughter] President  Hoenig   How do you read the rise in risk spreads in the last three  or four months--junk bonds vis-a-vis Treasuries, BAA's versus single A's, that sort of spread?  They are not huge by any means, but they sure are consistently higher   That is also a deflationary indicator   Any further questions for Peter? If not, would somebody  move approval of the Desk's operations?   The next meeting will be on September 29 We will  adjourn for lunch, at which time two topics will be discussed  END OF MEETING       Thank you Without objection We now turn to Messrs  Prell and Truman   With regard to the year 2000 problem, I noticed that the  Greenbook forecast does not have any acceleration in nonfarm inventory investment for the fourth  quarter of 1999 I have no doubt that as we move toward an unknown Y2K phenomenon,  just-in-time inventories will get a little disrupted and concerns are going to arise that will create    8/18/98  some inclination to put a few extra goods on the shelves, so to speak Has anyone thought about  that as a potential cyclical event? My question is whether the numbers that are involved are so  small that they are not even remotely of an order of magnitude to show up in forecasts such as  these   Let me put it this way The one forecast that I will make  unequivocally--with almost the same amount of fervor as Governor Kelley displayed in his forecast  of currency inventories--is the media's response to this From their perspective this is the  equivalent of an asteroid hitting the earth at 1201 am on January 1, 2000 The one thing we can    8/18/98  be certain about is the extent to which this Y2K issue will be unbelievable grist for the media  Two days before the start of the year 2000, that is all that is going to be in the newspapers Two  months before, there will be enough of it to really attract people's attention because there is no way  that anyone can guarantee that the event has a zero probability of being disruptive So, it will get  everybody's attention and it is going to affect business behavior People make decisions in the  context of relative degrees of certainty, and this will be a major uncertainty without historic  precedents No one has a clue about what will happen under these conditions   What happens is that business firms that fail to meet the  demand of their customers lose market share Customers are going to build inventories, and the  only question is to what extent If company A does not supply a product, company B will This is  going to be a very interesting forecasting exercise You did say that you're going to extend your  forecast to include the year 2000 in the Greenbook for the next meeting?   President Parry   Payments that are directly related to labor recruitment  and paid to outside agencies in one form or another obviously are not included in measures of  compensation per hour But am I correct in assuming that such payments are of an order of  magnitude that suggests we should be adjusting compensation per hour to include them as costs  in our models that interrelate market tightness with wage change?   I meant compensation   Shouldn't the value added of personal service or help  service groups like Manpower all be directly related to this?    8/18/98   That is true   In that sense, there is an argument for including internal  costs of employment administration in those data as well   President Minehan   President Jordan   Any further questions? If not, who would like to start?  President McTeer   I did! [Laughter] President Moskow   President Parry   President Hoenig   President Stern   President Guynn    8/18/98   President Minehan   President Boehne   Vice Chair   President Jordan   President Poole   Governor Gramlich   First Vice President Varvel   Governor Rivlin   Governor Ferguson   Governor Meyer    8/18/98   Governor Kelley   Thank you Shall we break for coffee?    8/18/98  [Coffee break]   Mr Kohn   Thank you Questions for Don? If not, let me proceed I  do not have very much to add to what has been discussed around the table this morning I am in  the group that sees no evidence yet that economic and financial conditions are stabilizing in Asia  Indeed, many of you have noted that conditions there continue to deteriorate  One of the problems that concern me about stabilization in Asia and perhaps other areas  of the world is that the flexibility required for adjustments is inhibited to a very substantial extent  by worker unrest I am speaking mainly about Korea, but other areas are affected as well More  generally, the political problems around the world clearly restrict the ability of governments to    8/18/98  make the adjustments that we would consider necessary in these types of crises Russia is the  classic case It is clearly the case throughout Asia as well, even in Korea where one would  assume that President Kim has fairly strong support In fact,  Japan remains the most difficult area and the greatest concern I don't have much to  add to what has been said, but it is obvious that the situation in Japan is deteriorating There is no  evidence of stabilization The notion that the Japanese economy will bottom out in the early  months of next year is a very interesting thought for which I find the evidence quite lacking, to say  the least I think deflationary pressures are rising around the world That fact is very difficult to  avoid recognizing There are fewer and fewer areas that are not touched by deflationary  developments Even Canada, which seemed to be such a bulwark, is obviously in some difficulty  with respect to its exchange rate that in turn is a function of commodity price pressures from Asia  as well as oil price declines Europe is doing well, but it is not self-evident to me that there is any  acceleration there Very fortunately for the introduction of the single currency, Europe is in a  situation in which the ERM has turned out to be a vehicle that is going to ease them into the euro  without any obvious adverse difficulty, and this is not something I would have forecast two years  ago But it is hard to argue that Europe is exhibiting the considerable economic strength that is  still obvious in the United States  One of the problems I have currently with our statistical system is that I am having  great difficulty figuring out what is going on in certain very crucial areas The most perplexing is  turning out to be in the labor statistics area We are seeing a widening divergence in the    8/18/98  employment data as measured by the payroll and the household surveys I don't know the extent  to which the problem is a short-term phenomenon, but the numbers are really interesting The  best way to describe them to you is by citing the fact that over the past year payroll employment  has gone up by 3 million while household employment adjusted to payroll survey concepts--that  is, by taking account of agricultural workers, the self-employed, unpaid family workers, unpaid  absences, multiple job holders, and a few other minor categories--has gone up only 1 million  Hence, the statistical discrepancy has widened by almost 2 million The same pattern exists to an  even greater extent in the past six months In this period, payroll employment has risen 12  million and the adjusted household figure has declined 600,000--a difference of 36 million at an  annual rate A small part of the larger discrepancy apparently relates to underestimates of illegal  immigration, which bias down the population data and, therefore, the household data There are  some other small technical issues in both the payroll and the household data whose resolution  would tend to reduce that discrepancy, but only marginally  We have been accustomed to looking with some skepticism at the monthly changes in  the household data because of the characteristics of a limited 60,000 household sample But for  six-month changes, the standard error of the estimates falls quite dramatically, and it is very  difficult to dismiss these household data for sampling variation reasons As a consequence, we  are looking at an extraordinarily difficult problem You may recall that up until the last six or  nine months, the evidence had indicated that both payroll and household employment were  growing at a 2 percent annual rate whereas the working age population including immigration was  going up only 1 percent Over the past year, the adjusted household data have now also risen 1  percent and the unadjusted household data have gone up somewhat more than 1 percent but  decidedly less than 2 percent    8/18/98  The serious question that we have at this stage is how significant the tightening in the  labor market has been over the last six months and the last year Certainly over the last six  months, the number of unemployed people plus those who are not in the labor force but want a  job has not changed To be sure, that number has stabilized at a level that still implies a very tight  labor market, but one that is not tightening further This story, as you are well aware, is quite  different from the one we get by merely looking at the payroll data, which still show a relatively  strong month-by-month growth pattern Something is different here We do not know what it is  It unfortunately turns out to be in a very crucial area for the analysis of what is going on in the  labor market  As some of you have indicated, we are not even quite sure what the inflation rate is  Until 1995, the inflation rate, if we wished to measure consumer price inflation, was evidently  fairly close to the core CPI and core PCE rates, which did not diverge greatly Since then, even  without the methodological adjustments affecting the CPI core, the gap in the two rates of  inflation has opened up We are now dealing, for example, with a 12-month change in the PCE  core deflator that in June was about a full percentage point less than the CPI core So, at a crucial  nexus in our efforts to make judgments about the inflation process, our data have deserted us, if I  may put it that way We are in a position where it is very difficult to feel comfortable about what  is happening  To make matters worse, when we look at the productivity data, it clearly makes a big  difference whether we measure output on the basis of the product side of the national accounts or  on the income side in light of the continued widening of the statistical discrepancy The  discrepancy reflects itself quite measurably in the analysis of unit costs and prices When we look  at productivity measured from the income side--which we used to do in the BLS data and we are    8/18/98  effectively required to do in the nonfinancial corporate data--we see that productivity growth  continues to be quite strong and total unit cost increases are still quite subdued However, as the  expansion slows, the labor markets appear to be sufficiently tight so that individual employers are  quite reluctant to lay people off As a consequence, increases in measured productivity slow  down of necessity This is another way of saying that the unemployment rate is a lagging  indicator  In any event, we are at a point where a critical evaluation is required for us to  understand the inflation process I still think that most of the evidence, irrespective of the data we  are looking at, clearly shows that inflation is low, labor markets are tight, and compensation per  hour is accelerating The productivity data, as measured on both the product and the income  sides, are reflected in muted increases in unit labor costs that coupled with the decline in unit  non-labor costs result in a still benign inflation process But our evaluation would be a lot more  convincing if we had a set of data that were internally consistent and did not leave us with very  large, yawning gaps in significant places in the statistics  Despite all these data problems, however, I believe that conditions have not changed  enough to suggest that we alter our evaluations of the policy choices, for example those that Don  Kohn laid out for us to consider In my view, the bottom line at this stage is that the anecdotal  data and either version of the other data that I discussed clearly suggest that "B", meaning "no  change" in the rate structure, is the appropriate position at this stage But I must say that this does  leave open the question that many of you have raised of whether we ought to shift from our  asymmetric stance back to symmetry Don Kohn has outlined the arguments pro and con I must  say that I do not have a strong view one way or the other I sense, but I cannot be certain, that the    8/18/98  Committee is moving from asymmetry back to symmetry It would be useful if each member  made explicit in the go-around where he or she stands with respect to that issue Vice Chair   Governor Rivlin   Governor Meyer   President Minehan   President McTeer   Governor Ferguson   Governor Gramlich   Except on the highway?    8/18/98   President Stem   President Parry   Yes Don has that scheduled As you know, we were  contemplating doing it today We just could not get the material together in time   President Hoenig   President Poole    8/18/98   Governor Kelley   President Jordan    8/18/98   I learned it from John von Neumann!   President Boehne   President Moskow    8/18/98   President Guynn   First Vice President Varvel   There seems to be a fairly large concentration of  preferences around "B" symmetric Would you read the appropriate directive?    8/18/98   Call the roll   We are getting under way a bit early, but I am sure we  will use the time productively Would somebody like to move approval of the minutes? I want  to call your attention to the addition of a reference in the minutes to our recent telephone  conference I trust all of you have looked at it and that there is no objection to the way it is  worded   Without objection  The second item on the agenda involves a continuation of discussions we've had on  the issue of disclosure In its memorandum, the staff winnowed down our earlier considerations,  and the options now seem fairly straightforward There is no urgency to implement any of them,  and I think we should continue our discussions until we can reach a consensus of some sort  This is not strictly a matter for a Committee vote Whatever we do, including nothing, it is  important that it reflect a consensus as differentiated from a majority vote I don't think a change  in our procedures should be made by a majority vote because once such a change is made it is  very difficult to backtrack As a result, any change should be something with which everyone  feels reasonably comfortable Having said that, would somebody like to respond to the  memorandum, which sets out the issues in a way that does not seem to require a staff briefing?  President Hoenig   I gather by implication that we have concluded in our  previous discussions that variations in wording to describe differing degrees of tilt have not  served us very well As you know, in the past we have had hard tilts, medium tilts, tilted tilts,  biased tilts, and who knows what else!   President Guynn   Tom, did you also say you favored releasing the tilt  immediately?   As a central bank, we should at least recognize that M2  and M3 exist, no matter what we do with them [Laughter]   President Minehan   President Parry   President McTeer   Governor Rivlin   Governor Meyer   President Broaddus   President Boehne   President Stern   Governor Ferguson   President Poole   Governor Gramlich   Vice Chair   President Moskow   President Jordan   Governor Kelley   One of the things that strikes me about this discussion,  and I must admit that I am on both sides of this issue, is that I switch back and forth to different  sides at different times The reason is that we are being pressed on something that we consider  to be of value to the market, namely that more information is better than less There also is an  ethical issue here, one relating to the integrity of this institution, that clearly is an important issue  that we need to address Both of those considerations suggest that more is better, although we  must remember that we are not going all the way in providing information If we went to the  fullest extent in that direction, then Henry Gonzalez's approach of live transmission of this  meeting obviously would be the most ethical and most directly available source of information to  the market, but it also would be the most useless So, let us be careful about how we weigh the  various alternatives    9/29/98  The one thing that struck me, which has not surfaced in our discussion today, is that  our experience of the last several years has not been the same as our experience over a much  longer time frame That is, the nature of our deliberations and the way we conduct monetary  policy are quite different when the economy is under extreme stress, when the unemployment  rate is rising, when there is a cacophony of outside comments about the need to lower interest  rates-- the sort of commentary we seldom get when the economy is strong So, we have to be a  little cautious about proceeding further without availing ourselves of the lessons of past  experience with regard to how things may play out in a period, say, when the economy is getting  away from us on the downside and we are looking at a fairly dramatic decline in demand, rising  unemployment, and a lot of political stirring I think it would be important for us to work  through a number of alternative scenarios in that context If we do that, I think we're going to  find that this issue is a lot more problematical than it may currently appear I think we ought to  do that What our discussion did clarify, unless I misheard, was a general willingness to abandon  quaint Americanism--  SEVERAL Americana   There does seem to be a fairly broad consensus about  the desirability of better and simpler language However, we have not yet come together on  some of the other issues; if a vote were taken on those issues, I think there would be a majority in  favor of doing something now, but there is still a significant minority on the other side With  regard to the wording of the directive, this is the first time that I have sensed the existence of  general agreement though there remain some small differences I would recommend that we put  together language that reflects, as best we can judge, the consensus of this group and revisit this    9/29/98  matter at a later meeting We can then make a change, and I think we will be ready to do so in  part because we have wrestled with this issue for a long period of time  There are two quite different disclosure issues One is that of giving changes in the tilt  the same status as changes in the funds rate with respect to when they are announced The  second, which as I see it may be viewed as independent of the first, is when to publish the  minutes I have a certain sympathy for the views of the Vice Chair on the latter I often have  wondered what we would gain by releasing the minutes a week earlier than the current schedule  if the information on the tilt was already out I grant that if the tilt is not announced shortly after  the meeting, then moving up the publication of the minutes clearly has the effect of releasing the  tilt at that point But if the tilt is already published, then the acceleration of the minutes strikes  me as something that probably has more potential for mischief than not Remember that the  minutes provide a discussion of the various forces and nuances and the like, and if we were to  decide to publish them one week earlier, then why not two or three weeks earlier? There has  been general agreement within the Committee that the contingency discussions contained in the  minutes should be published only after those contingencies no longer have relevance So, I do  think that the issues of whether we publish the tilt at the point of decisionmaking and when we  release the minutes are separable They are not necessarily tied  Unless I hear an objection, what I would like to do is to have Don Kohn construct a  specific, formal proposal based on today's discussion of the various wording options and Tom  Hoenig's amendment I believe we can come to an agreement at our next meeting on that issue  However, I do think we should continue our discussion relating to more prompt disclosures to  see if we can narrow our differences further We have narrowed them to some extent In that  regard, I would like to suggest that the staff review how, as they see it, changes in our practices  would play out in periods other than when we make decisions only at meetings and are getting    9/29/98  very little outside criticism We have been in such a period for quite a while In fact, it is almost  unprecedented because we tend to be the favorite scapegoats of a significant number of people  who live inside the Beltway The fact that we have not been the subject of heavy criticism for a  prolonged period is quite unusual and may limit our ability to anticipate what we could face in  the down phase of a business cycle if we change our disclosure practices I think it is essential  for us to make certain that if we decide to move toward earlier release--a decision that as I said  earlier would effectively be irreversible--we will have thought through how things would play  out and what the implications are Unless there is an objection, I will close the discussion on this  issue at this point Hearing none, let us go on to Peter Fisher   This is the UK bank rate versus sterling?   What maturity?   But in sterling?    9/29/98   Some did!   Peter, I think we are all aware that a major trauma in  world financial markets occurred when the Russian devaluation and debt moratorium were  announced Since the size of the Russian economy is de minimis relative to the rest of the world,  something fundamentally different was going on  There are two, not necessarily competing, views as to what occurred The first is that  there was a general sense that the Asian contagion around the world was moving into remission,  2 / A copy of this memorandum, dated September 28, 1998 and entitled "Update on the Federal Reserve Swap Network," has been placed in the Committee's files    9/29/98  though that was seen as a gradual process That improvement was perhaps best evidenced by the  behavior of the stripped Brady spreads, which were fairly stable for a while The realization that  contagion was still alive and well unwound a whole set of views and expectations that went back  a long way, and that shock clearly is capable of explaining the behavior of the financial markets  The second hypothesis relates to the presumption that in all likelihood there would be  a G-7 bailout of Russia, and the implication was that if Russia was bailed out, everybody would  be bailed out The evident failure of that to occur raised the question of whether bailouts are  back on the shelf, and the associated market disruption reflected an abrupt reassessment of risks,  which is captured in the very rapid changes that you mentioned Of those two hypotheses, where  do you tend to lean or would you consider them not necessarily to be mutually exclusive but part  of the explanation for what occurred?   Also, the asset values are essentially a psychological  evaluation of expected future earnings If expectations change in the direction of weaker  earnings, wealth declines It is not a zero sum game   Financial intermediaries can create money; they also  can "uncreate" money   That is called sovereignty   President Minehan   I think it's important to understand the degree of  grossing up of the nation's balance sheet That is, a fully consolidated balance sheet of the  United States would on the asset side have our gold stock and our net physical property accounts  plus net claims against foreigners; on the claims side all we have is equity Grossing up by  including intermediation is a zero sum game What is not a zero sum is the real assets If we  have inventories of copper on the asset side of the consolidated balance sheet and the price of  copper falls, then equity on the right hand side falls That is not a zero sum game; there has been  a real loss The same is true if we evaluate the physical assets in terms of their market value,    9/29/98  essentially the discounted present value of expected future earnings of those physical facilities  That number can change and that will change the equity side That is not a zero sum game But  all the grossing up by debt intermediation, which is a huge part of total assets and liabilities, is a  zero sum game The only thing that is not is the market losses But one person's market loss is  another person's market gain and that just washes out of the whole system   We had some $15 trillion in equities issued in the  United States, the market value as of say last June, and we have lost $3 or $4 trillion of that  value That is not a zero sum game It has to appear somewhere as somebody's losses It may  be a reduction in pension fund values or a loss by a bank that has made a loan to somebody who  owns those assets It is going to show up somewhere, and we will not have a clue where that is  until we start to see third-quarter results But I will tell you that it is going to start showing up in  places we do not anticipate, and the sense of nonzero sums is going to become very obvious   Yes, there are a lot of winners   President Parry   There is an implicit forecast in that arbitrage of the  BLS's CPI over a long-term period The question is whether we should treat that implicit CPI  forecast as a true reflection of the view of the inflation risk in the marketplace, assuming that the  CPI is measuring inflation accurately It is not a supply/demand issue If I seriously believe that  the CPI will average, say, 3 percent over the next 10 years, it would be like shooting fish in a  barrel to go buy that particular security with a 10-year maturity because it has an implicit  inflation risk of well under 2 percent What are we to make of that?   Peter, it is not a trade! You buy it, and you put it away   I was about to say that is a good case This is the  extreme form of that   Anybody else? Does anybody have any questions or  comments on the memorandum on the swap network? If not, would somebody like to move  approval of Peter's domestic operations?   Our next meeting will be on Tuesday, November 17  We will now go into a short recess for lunch When we resume our meeting, Bill McDonough  will report on what has been going on with Long-Term Capital Management  [Recess]   I have the draft of a press release, which I will ask Don  Kohn to read    9/29/98   Vice Chair, do you wish to comment?   Bill, did those in the room think that their own firms  would benefit from an agreement, or were they looking solely at the macroeconomic effects of  being good citizens?   Could you go back and tell us what you know about the  position of our bank examiners regarding the practices, which I think you described as less than  optimal, that were followed by the institutional lenders to LTCP?   When we conduct our examinations, I know that we  check to see whether bank policies are being implemented, but how did we do that with respect  to, say, Morgan and LTCM? Did we actually evaluate the loan portfolio that represented  Morgan's claims against LTCM/P to see whether, in fact, Morgan abided by the principles that  you just outlined?   Where we are most vulnerable is with regard to the  adequacy of our examinations  We rarely come up against a situation where we say this is awful, the institution is falling    9/29/98  apart, and we did not spot the deterioration For example, when we looked into the Japanese  operation in New York in which the embezzlement occurred--  SEVERAL Daiwa   Daiwa, yes What Daiwa exposed is how complex  these situations are and how few troops we have to look into them  if we had to meet the standards that people think exist, we would have five  times as many examiners We would examine them  to death, and they would not have any breathing room  What we need at this stage is some sense of whether we are examining very  specifically what actually happened in the LTCM situation When I was in the private sector, I  remember looking at the details of particular loans that were shown to bank directors I was on  the loan committee of one of these major banking institutions, and we actually went through the  loan portfolio major client by major client The bank's senior loan officers would provide a  basic review They would take the loan portfolio and point to the vulnerabilities and strengths of  the borrowers and give their evaluations of the risks that were involved The review was quite  thorough I knew that I was getting a bit of a snow job--the type of thing where mistakes never  are made and everything is perfect But even adjusting for that, the examination was at a level  that would not have allowed this LTCP problem to happen But it did happen and a number of  extraordinarily effective counterparties were involved The question is why it happened in this    9/29/98  case Is it just that the lenders were dazzled by the people at LTCM and did not take a close  look?   Whose? LTCM's?   Somebody mentioned to me that Bankers Trust had an  August balance sheet for LTCM Is that true?   It is one thing for one bank to have failed to appreciate  what was happening to LTCP, but this list of institutions is just mind boggling   What type of collateral would ordinarily be required on  this type of loan?   Involving US Treasuries?   There are not a lot of triple Bs outstanding   Let me go back Can you explain to me how, if  everybody is 100 percent collateralized--not 110 but 100 percent--we can end up with these huge  losses for lenders?   But, are we looking at losses in the value of the  collateral or is collateral being withdrawn? If I am a bank lender and I lend $200 million to a    9/29/98  hedge fund, ordinarily I would be over-collateralized I would hold more than $200 million in,  say, US Treasury bills   I am talking about my position as a bank lending to  LTCM   That is a 100 percent collateralized mark-to-market  position   Now, in order for me as a bank to lose in this situation,  I either have to find that the collateral I have is not legally available under certain circumstances  or its market value has declined Which was it in this case?   So, the collateral lost value and LTCP did not have the  resources to make up for the loss   Let's leave the derivatives out   There are two ways of coming at this There are certain  transactions between counterparties in derivatives where net positions are fully collateralized or  up to X percent and in some cases there is no collateral at all Straight lending usually is fully  collateralized I don't know what bankers are going to write off on these losses, but what I'm  trying to get at is where the losses to the banks are coming from Are we looking at  uncollateralized derivative positions that went against LTCP and in favor of a bank, which  theoretically has a net position of $20 million but discovers that it really has a $20 million credit  problem? In other words, where are the losses coming from as best we can see?   That is a different issue As far as bookkeeping is  concerned, banks do not book those anticipatory losses unless some real commitments are  involved What I am trying to focus on is where the losses are coming from   What I think we are going to need for our testimony on  Thursday is a general summary of what we do as examiners, how often we do it, and why banks  with a huge amount of experience in lending got caught in this kind of thing We need an  answer The answer is not that it should not have happened Part of banking involves losing  money Banks never make a loan that they do not expect to be repaid In that sense, every loss  is an error The issue is to define the error   If we indicate what we are doing to find the answers,  that is fine This to me is where the issue of the responsiveness of the Federal Reserve is going  to be   All I care about is that we produce accurate testimony   Have we developed a series of questions for the  testimony that we are asking ourselves? I think that would be very useful In other words, in the  testimony we should identify the questions to which we do not yet know the answer   It has to be a full report on what we know and do not  know    9/29/98   Did they participate through an American affiliate or  directly from Switzerland?   I would like to ask one quick factual question of our  legal counsel Virgil, you raised an issue with respect to whether in fact a particular group of  new investors in LTCM were investing in violation of the 5 percent equity cap What have you  concluded, if anything, on that question?   So, it is in compliance with the Bank Holding Company  Act?   Ah! That explains it!   Governor Gramlich   What technically happens in that kind of model is that  if we are resting on the last five years of experience during which the structure of the markets is  essentially stable, that is, there were no severe contractions or even expansions, the covariances  that we are going to pick up out of that five years are correct covariances for that population and  that environment What we were dealing with in the Russian situation, if we look at the data,  was something that clearly was not a simple, steady state In that environment, the coefficients  in an econometric model either collapse to zero or to one If we took the covariance matrix that  would be implicit in that environment, it would give wholly different risk parameters than we  would get in a system in which we are taking five years of special experience and saying the  losses were never more than "x" on a daily basis So what? That begs the question of what will  happen in the future   Yes, exactly    9/29/98   That is the whole point These are very special cases  In fact, as some of my colleagues know, my favorite speech is one where I discuss separating the  risks that confront the monetary authority from the risks that the commercial banks have to face  I have always argued that the commercial banks are responsible for 9995 percent of the risks  with their own capital The rest are these 50-year events, which the central bank will handle  The trouble is that this is what this event clearly was   That was very wise Al Broaddus   It is not something a committee can do    9/29/98   That is Larry Meyer's committee, I presume   Unless you get up and run, you will find that you are  mistaken [Laughter] In all seriousness, does anybody have any quick additional issues to raise?  SPEAKER(?) Let's run quickly!   The meeting is adjourned Thank you all very much  END OF MEETING       Thank you, without objection We now move on to  Ted Truman and Dave Stockton   Thank you Questions from my colleagues?   President Stem   Any further questions?   Further questions from anyone? Who would like to  start the roundtable? President Moskow   President Parry   President Minehan   President McTeer   President Boehne   President Guynn   President Stern   Why don't we take a break at this point President Jordan  will have the floor when we come back  [Coffee break]   President Jordan   President Hoenig   Is the 40 percent for the Tenth District or nationwide?   Vice Chair   President Broaddus   Governor Ferguson   Governor Gramlich    9/29/98   Governor Rivlin   President Poole   Thank you Governor Kelley   Finally, Governor Meyer   Thank you very much Let's now move on to Don  Kohn   Questions for Don? If not, let me proceed  A number of you have argued, quite persuasively in my view, that there are only  limited hard data that suggest any loss of momentum in the current expansion I can find only  two statistics that point to some weakening, although I am sure there are more One is a  significant drop in the production of steel ingots in the last two weeks   Well, I hesitated to mention it because it is such a small  item Second, the latest data indicate a fairly dramatic decline in construction awards for  nonresidential building Beyond that, we do not find significant weakening in equipment orders  Retail sales are not terrific, but obviously they are not doing too badly Motor vehicles, which  are a crucial factor, are softening a little but hardly enough to take note Actually, the ratio of  used car prices to new car prices, which has not been a bad short-term indicator, has turned up a  little Homebuilding may be off a bit, but it is still quite elevated by any objective measure So,  as we look across the board, it is very hard to find any indicators of significant softening To be  sure, the labor market is exceptionally tight, although we have had a modest increase in insured  unemployment It popped up with the GM strike and did not reverse fully after the strike was  settled I might add that the low level of initial claims relative to insured unemployment  probably reflects declines in both hires and layoffs in relation to the number of employed  workers That is showing up, incidentally, in the household data as well A more relevant  indication of a weakening labor market would be an upturn in the level of insured  unemployment That level has risen a little but scarcely enough to argue that we are seeing a  significant development  The crucial development, which has been mentioned numerous times around this  table, is that we are observing an important shift in attitudes toward risk The reason is that one  can generalize and explain the business cycle, perhaps in an overly simplistic way, as reflecting  shifting views toward risk When there is a general sense of declining risk, there is a tendency to  reach out into the future That is another way of saying that the cyclically sensitive areas of the  economy--capital investment, construction, consumer durables--all accelerate as the result of  efforts to invest in the future The downside of the cycle occurs when there is a widespread  perception of rising risks    9/29/98  We would certainly expect to see a change in psychology before any significant  erosion in the real variables of the economy became apparent Such a change in psychology  clearly is what we are observing The opening up of risk spreads is a very significant indication  of increased risk aversion As we know, that means in effect that commitments are being pulled  back We see in the balance sheet data that are now emerging and that Governor Ferguson was  referencing a fairly pronounced weakening of cash flows in the business sector coupled with an  ever-increasing difficulty of raising capital externally  If we have a contraction in both internal and external sources of funds, the question  then arises as to how the momentum will be maintained in the capital goods markets, a sector of  the economy that has been an important factor in the significant expansion of economic activity  in recent years So, what we should be looking for, and indeed what is implicit in the Greenbook  forecast, is a process by which the combination of increased risk aversion in the market,  reflecting changed attitudes toward the future, and the effects of higher perceived risks on the  balance sheets of business firms all point in a single direction That is, they suggest a decline in  capital investment From the perspective of the way our models operate, the reason would be  that the cost of capital has gone up In terms of what actually is happening in the real world, the  reason is basically that people are pulling back, and those who are not pulling back are finding it  difficult to finance their activities either internally or externally  I was mentioning in a short conversation during our coffee break that I suspect that if  we had September capital appropriations data for corporations, we would see a fairly significant  decline That would be the first hard evidence in the forward data We do not see any general  weakness in the order books thus far We do in steel where imports have caused steel industry  orders to collapse, but that is a specialized industry effect and we do not yet have indications of    9/29/98  any overall contraction in orders for equipment But if we are at all correct in evaluating how the  system is functioning, that should be on the fairly near-term horizon  I believe that the stock market decline has had a very profound effect, and indeed one  can argue that a goodly part of the increased risk aversion is itself a consequence of the collapse  in stock market values As best I can judge, that collapse is not all that much a result of a  contraction in earnings expectations, at least on the part of security analysts It clearly is far  more the result of rising discount factors against those earnings in the sense of a rise in equity  premiums, as least as we measure them What that indicates is a foreshortening of forward time  preferences or, looked at another way, an increase in risk aversion So, in one sense  differentiating equity markets and the credit markets is not something that is very meaningful  because both very much reflect the same underlying process of pulling back  As I indicated earlier, the approximately $3 trillion capital loss in the aggregate value  of equities in the United States, most of which are held by US residents, just cannot be  occurring without considerable breakage of crockery somewhere A stock market decline of the  magnitude we have experienced probably was far less significant 20 or 30 years ago than it is  today This is largely because the aggregate size of stock holdings relative to income is so much  higher now and so many more people have equity investments that the effects of stock market  declines on economic choices is almost surely higher Clearly, our exposure to stock market  developments is much greater than it is in Europe  In any event, I think that what we are observing is a development that is occurring at  the fulcrum of a turn, for want of a better expression, in the psychology of anticipatory  evaluations that will be reflected at some point in hard numbers relating to the performance of  the economy itself I think, however, that it is a mistake to expect the latter to happen very  quickly The economy's momentum in 1997 and the first quarter of 1998 and the big surge in    9/29/98  stock market values in the first half of this year are all working their way through the income and  product accounts I would be very surprised to see that momentum disappear in the near term I  do anticipate a significant decline in capital appropriations, new orders, and contract awards  But these take time to work their way into actual purchases of capital goods and spending on  projects that are under way Therefore, a presumption that we are going to see a significant  effect on capital expenditures before 1999 is probably unrealistic  Nonetheless, it would be wrong to say that the change in psychology is all ephemeral  just because we have not seen it in the hard data yet In the forecast process, we have to look at  people's value judgments It is the change in value judgments that alters the real world We  have evidence that those value judgments are changing in a very significant way, and that is no  longer a forecast As a consequence, we are likely to see this process continue and perhaps  accelerate  I thought the evidence of fairly widespread tightening in the senior loan officers  survey was quite startling in terms of its discontinuity with bank lending practices in the previous  survey We picked up indications of that at our meeting with the Federal Advisory Council  several weeks ago, well before the latest loan officers' survey was conducted What was  extraordinary is how depressed that group was None of them was saying that their loans were  declining None of them was saying that their local economies were experiencing a major  contraction But the essential conclusion is that the risks really are perceived as having increased  in a way that I had not seen earlier, and that conclusion is now being solidified in the senior loan  officers' survey, which is far broader and more detailed  What we are seeing in our financial markets is essentially a mirror image of financial  developments abroad, including a remarkable similarity in timing The concurrence between  developments here as measured by domestic yield spreads and the dramatic events abroad as    9/29/98  measured by the weighted Brady stripped spreads indicates that we are not currently observing a  lead/lag phenomenon In effect, the same contagion that has so gripped the rest of the world is  spilling over to our economy We are becoming infected This is evidenced by a widening of  domestic yield spreads  I come out of all of this with a set of conclusions or probabilistic evaluations that  suggest to me that the Greenbook is essentially on the right path But I do think that we have to  be careful to recognize that yield spreads that can become dramatically adverse also can work  their way back toward previous norms We have seen several spikes in the international stripped  Brady data that have involved reversals To be sure, this one is a much more deeply seated one,  and it has spilled over to the United States However, we cannot presume that the process of  deterioration is 100 percent irrevocable That defies history The probability of a substantial  reversal at this stage is, I think, less than 50/50, but it is by no means zero Therefore, those who  have urged a degree of caution in moving the funds rate lower, in keeping with the tentative  decision during our telephone conference last week to move at this meeting, have the best case as  far as I am concerned  Accordingly, I would suggest a reduction of 25 basis points in the federal funds rate  and not 50 basis points I think that there is a better argument for a tilt toward ease in that the  latter has somewhat greater support in terms of the historical experience Nonetheless, it is  conceivable that we may end up viewing this action not as the first in a series of moves but as an  insurance premium, as Governor Kelley pointed out If that outcome is felt to be more likely,  then the argument for symmetry is more compelling I'm not sure the tilt is all that critical at this  stage because I think events are going to drive us far more than our predispositions at this  meeting I would be less inclined to base our future actions on whatever we conclude at this  stage than I would on what I might see in a newspaper, say, two weeks from today that reported    9/29/98  on significant developments over the next couple of weeks So, I don't think that the tilt is going  to matter all that much The reason is that in my view this economy is either going to weaken  further as a consequence of the very significant shift toward greater risk aversion and very large  capital losses in our equity markets or it is going to stabilize Brazil may suddenly look better;  Latin America more generally may look better; we may get a further decline in the Brady yield  spreads, which we have seen in the last few days; junk issues may suddenly look a lot less  uninteresting in the American market In other words, we cannot rule out the possibility that at  some point the economic outlook may look far more like the August Greenbook projections and  what we discussed at the August meeting than it has in the last few weeks My own impression  is that economic conditions are eroding at this point I do not believe we are behind the curve  because I think recent economic developments are to a very large extent what we were  anticipating It is not as though there is a shock element involved  You may remember that in Jackson Hole a number of us got together and expressed  the hope that we would be able to wait until today's meeting to take whatever action was  consistent with developments in our domestic economy We did not want to be seen as rushed  into action by events external to the United States and associated market forces We felt that  having to move earlier than today would clearly be seen as evidence of a central bank that was  scurrying to catch up We have succeeded in staying on schedule, if I may use that term, and  hopefully we will continue to do so  Accordingly, I am putting on the table a proposal to reduce the federal funds rate  immediately by 25 basis points and a recommendation that we move to asymmetry toward ease  I would add that my preference for a tilt in that direction is a lot less strong than what I see as the  desirability of a clear action to move the rate down by 25 basis points Vice Chairman    9/29/98   President Minehan   Governor Rivlin   I'm sorry, but where do you come out given that we  decided not to announce our decision on the tilt today?   Thank you Governor Kelley   Governor Meyer   President Broaddus   President Jordan    9/29/98   President Parry   President Hoenig   President Boehne   President Poole   President Moskow   Governor Ferguson   Governor Gramlich   President Stern   President McTeer   I don't think you need to! [Laughter]   President Guynn   There is unanimity for a 25 basis point reduction and  the smallest of majorities for asymmetry So, will you read the directive accordingly    9/29/98   Call the roll   Before we get started I would just like to reflect on the  fact that it is Bill Dewald's last meeting He is sitting over there seeing that we do the right  thing, a struggle requiring infinite patience among other things He has been the Director of  Research at the St Louis Bank for six years We will miss you, Bill, and hopefully your  replacement will do as good a job as you have done   Yes [Applause] Who would like to move to approve  the minutes of the September 29 meeting?   Without objection As you know, in two or three of our  recent meetings, we have been contemplating ways to improve a number of the procedures that  we use to communicate to the public We seem to have reached a consensus around this table  that the wording in the operational paragraph of the directive requires some revision We have  considered a number of different versions, and at this point I will call on David Lindsey to  introduce today's discussion by describing the state of play at the moment   I never heard anybody talk about risks as "warm and  fuzzy" [Laughter] President Jordan   Vice Chairman   President Broaddus   President Boehne   President Parry   President Stem   Governor Meyer   Governor Rivlin   Governor Ferguson   President Poole   Do you mean that you would refer to it as a staff  forecast as distinct from a Committee statement?   Let's first finish our discussion of the money supply  issue Does anybody else have any views about how to handle that question?   Does anyone have any further insights? I think that  raises a quite unanswerable question, but we do have to resolve it one way or another It is a  problem in the sense that if the contemplated reserve conditions are constantly changing but are  always consistent with some moderation in the growth of M2, it strikes me that we are implying  a good deal more about the extent of our knowledge of how the system is working than evidently  is the case    11/17/98   It turned out that the sentence was wrong, but that  wording was not locked in   I think President Minehan has the right answer   Is everyone in agreement that that is advisable?  SEVERAL Yes   Vice Chair, you have the floor on the other sentence   President Moskow   Would President Broaddus's recommendation resolve  this? One possibility is to combine the sentences to read in part "more likely to warrant [a  further] increase/decrease than [a further] decrease/increase in the federal funds rate in the    11/17/98  intermeeting period" instead of "in coming months" It might be an interesting way of  combining the sentences   Why don't we say "in the intermeeting period and in  coming months?" Would that do it?   It is not power; it is authority Power is irrelevant   President Guynn    11/17/98   Governor Kelley   President Hoenig   This becomes a language question I do concur,  however, with the point that Governor Kelley made that the previous positions taken by this  Committee are void as of the next meeting In that sense, we may continue with a given tilt  indefinitely, but it does require renewal every time we meet We give the Desk authority to  move only during an intermeeting period and without any presumption about further moves  thereafter nor with authority to anyone thereafter I don't know whether the sentence solves the  problem, but Governor Gramlich is going to tell us whether it does   President Minehan   President Jordan   That is a problem I feel very uncomfortable about our  inability to understand fully what the monetary aggregates are telling us I fear that we are  missing something subtle, something we have not yet grasped President Parry   Mike Kelley has given me a note that I think is to the  point, namely that we have made considerable progress today We are not quite there, but I think  we are now down to Option 2 We are down to a couple of variations of the tilt sentence We  are down to options on how we should handle the M2-M3 sentence Since we are only five  weeks away from another meeting and we have been dithering on this for so long, delaying a  decision for one more meeting is not going to be all that significant I believe that at this stage  we should be able to refine the wording We are quite close We could, if we wanted to, spend  more time on this right now, but it is not worth it Let's get another draft and have another round  of discussions We may at this point have the equivalent of a notation vote in favor of a change   I see that as a separate issue I do think that we can and  should put it on the agenda, but we don't have to decide both questions the same way   I acknowledge that! Let us put that issue on the table  again Hopefully, we will get this wording issue resolved at the next meeting and perhaps make  considerable progress, even come to a conclusion, on the release issue President Poole   We finally got through! Peter Fisher   I have observed that we are continuously getting a glut  of yen and a disinclination to hold them, but the oversupply does not seem to be spilling over  into the foreign exchange markets in any significant way It is a fact that the total size of the  Bank of Japan's balance sheet is greatly expanded, and there are very large amounts of yen out  there that somebody has to hold Why doesn't that have an impact on the exchange rate?   This was a yen-carry reversal?   You just expressed that in terms of a double negative!   Any other questions for Peter? If not, President Jordan   You also should point out that you are hemmed in by  the constraint that you have to hold a certain amount of securities on your balance sheet in order    11/17/98  to implement the directives that the Committee gives you Although I guess you could buy  furniture!   Governor Rivlin   Let's go back to the TIPS issue for a moment You are  operating under authority that has been given to you The ability to choose the classes of assets  in which you invest is also implicit in those regulations   The point that I am raising is that you have the  authority to buy TIPS, unless the Committee decides to rescind it Am I correct?   The reason I raise the issue is that if there is a very  strong predilection that it is a bad idea, it is better that you know it beforehand   Now is the time to speak up if anyone has a strong  objection Silence presupposes acquiescence   President Poole   Governor Kelley   President Hoenig   President Broaddus   Vice Chairman   Let me just say that the ability of these securities to  give a useful view of long-term market inflation expectations is being significantly impaired by    11/17/98  what is undoubtedly a very large and variable illiquidity premium in these markets Anyone  looking at the difference between nominal and TIP yields on 30-year bonds and interpreting it as  a forecast of inflation expectations would find it very difficult to explain how the difference got  down to 12 percent Surely, no one would argue that the published BLS index is going to  average 12 percent over the next 30 years The difference between a realistic expectation of the  yield spread, which clearly should be more than 2 percent and probably is closer to 3 percent or  perhaps even more, and the current spread is indeed reflecting an illiquidity effect that  unfortunately has been changing quite dramatically over the period So, I think the presumption  that the difference in yields for those two securities is very useful as an inflation indicator is  dubious at this point But I do think the issue is important, because one of the reasons for selling  indexed securities is eventually to achieve a useful inflation indicator Reaching that goal comes  down to the question of how to get adequate supply and on-the-run characteristics that either will  remove the illiquidity premium or stabilize it in a form that would make the yields on indexed  securities useful I don't know where that comes out with respect to the issue that Peter Fisher is  raising, but I think it is important to recognize that the indexed-securities market has a long way  to go before it will become very useful to us Governor Gramlich   If you can figure out where I stand, let me know!  [Laughter]   President Poole   I agree with that I think the issue should really be how  aggressive the Desk should be in its operations The funds rates that fall out from those  operations are what the market is telling us, and volatility in funds rates is market information  that we can very readily suppress if we wish I like the little boxes in Peter's charts They are  very interesting, but I think there is a question as to what they tell us President Minehan    11/17/98   I think the alternative is to indicate that only those of  superior moral fiber would have access to the window [Laughter]   Good question   Governor Meyer    11/17/98   President Broaddus   You are probably right in the sense that the illiquidity  premium almost surely does not fluctuate with the inflation premium As a gross measure, it  must be useful to some extent At this point, I would suggest that there has been enough  discussion about the TIPS issue, and I think it might be useful for David Lindsey to make a quick  survey of everyone's view on this question and provide his survey results to Peter Fisher to give  him a sense of where the Committee members stand on the issue Then, if Peter feels that he  does not have Committee support, it will be up to him to get on the telephone and try to muster  it I suggest that we try to deal with this informally and hopefully more expeditiously What is  your deadline on making a decision, Peter?    11/17/98   When I made reference to the Committee a little earlier,  I was really referring to all 18 people around this table This is a long-term issue, and on certain  questions that go beyond one year, the views of all of us are important, not just the Committee  members at any point in time Peter Fisher   Would somebody like to move approval?   Without objection   President Broaddus   Yes The presumption that these are truly balanced  bilateral swap lines is clearly false Swap lines are becoming increasingly obsolescent I was  surprised at how successful we were in unwinding the others I thought we might have a shot at  these last two, but it turned out, for the reasons that Peter Fisher mentioned, that we were  mistaken So we still have these two lines, but hopefully the two other parties will feel  sufficiently comfortable at some point to agree to unwind them   Further questions for Peter? Would somebody like to  move approval of the reciprocal currency arrangements with Canada and Mexico?   Without objection Would somebody like to move the  proposed change in the authorization for System repurchase agreements?   Certainly    11/17/98   Is there a second to the repo request?  SPEAKER(?) Second   I put together some words just in case we needed a  press release I tried to suggest that we have gone as far as we are going to go Let me just read  it to you quickly "Although conditions in financial markets have settled down materially since  mid-October, unusual strains remain With the 75 basis point decline in the federal funds rate  since September, financial conditions can reasonably be expected to be consistent with fostering  sustained economic expansion while keeping inflationary pressures subdued" That is Fed  language for symmetric  The next meeting is on December 22 The Federal Reserve Board should retire to my  office and make a decision on the discount rate Afterward, we will go directly to lunch  END OF MEETING       Without objection Let us move on to Mike Prell and  Karen Johnson   Questions for either?   President Minehan   President Parry   President Poole   President Moskow   Further questions? If not, let's break for coffee and  come back in 10 minutes  [Coffee break]   Who would like to start off the Committee's  discussion? President Poole   President Broaddus   President Moskow   President Parry   President McTeer   President Minehan   President Guynn   President Jordan   President Stern   Governor Rivlin   President Boehne   President Hoenig   Vice Chair   Governor Ferguson   Governor Gramlich   Governor Meyer   Governor Kelley   Thank you very much We now can move on to David  Lindsey   Thank you Questions for David? If not, let me get  started This is a more difficult call than that at the last meeting There is very little question  that there has been considerable easing in a number of the areas where we are concerned The  one area where things have eased regrettably more than I would have liked is the stock market  In a certain sense that has created a major question in my judgment as to whether we should  move If the Dow Jones industrial average were 200 to 300 points lower, I think the case for    11/17/98  moving one additional time and then putting policy on indefinite hold would be fairly strong for  a number of the reasons that have already been discussed today, as well as additional ones that I  would like to raise I do not think that inflation has become a problem; if anything, it is the  reverse I do think the concerns about an asset bubble are not without validity, and that is where  I have my greatest concerns about easing  Let me first, however, address the inflation issue The crucial question we have to ask  ourselves is how we should measure inflation If we look at the core CPI, it has clearly  accelerated in the last year or so and at the moment is running in the area of somewhat under a  2-1/2 percent annual rate In contrast, the core PCE has been decelerating fairly dramatically and  depending on whether we are using 3-month, 6-month, or 12-month rolling averages, the  increase is barely more than 1 percent More than half of the difference in these measures of  core inflation reflects the difference in the weights for housing As you know, owners'  equivalent rent is over 20 percent of the CPI and total housing is close to 30 percent, as I recall  In the PCE, they are about half that The difference occurs to a substantial extent as a  consequence of two elements First, the weight in the CPI is based on individuals' views of the  potential rental value of the houses in which they live In the PCE, it is derived from more  detailed macro data Second, the scope of the PCE is much broader in that it covers a much  wider area of consumer expenditures and obviously, other things equal that would lower the  weight for housing in the PCE So even though the actual price changes for housing and owners'  equivalent rent are close in both the PCE and the CPI, the mere difference in the weights and the  fact that housing costs are rising faster than average has created a very dramatic widening in the  spread between CPI core inflation and PCE core inflation, which now is 1-1/2 percentage points    11/17/98  I seriously question whether housing should be a component of any measure of  underlying inflation I don't want to get too involved in this, but I think all the other measures  that we are looking at--the PPI, the intermediate prices, the commodity prices, the data from the  purchasing managers--are all suggesting, in my judgment, that the inflation rate is still falling  To put it another way, the real funds rate is rising  When we look at the unit cost structure for nonfinancial corporations, which I have  discussed on numerous occasions before, we get a similar story Average hourly compensation  for that sector, and that measure is more relevant than the ECI for the analysis of unit costs, has  accelerated somewhat but so has output per hour for nonfinancial corporations The  consequence is that unit labor costs have been rising at a rate of less than 1-1/2 percent in recent  quarters and total unit costs, which include declining unit nonlabor costs, have been increasing at  a shade above 1 percent With corporate prices generally stable, this implies a decline in profit  margins Indeed, the profit margin for the nonfinancial corporate sector has been declining over  the past year  The importance of these data, as best I can judge, is that they suggest underlying  inflationary forces are continuing to recede despite the tightness in labor markets I would point  out that there is very little evidence that those markets are tightening further at this time, but I  also would not want to argue that we are seeing any significant labor market easing The  measure that I have found most useful recently in measuring the degree of labor market  tightness, the sum of those who are unemployed and those who are not in the labor force but  would like a job, fell quite rapidly from 1995 through 1997 but stabilized at the beginning of this  year and since then has moved hardly at all In addition, the diffusion indexes in the payroll    11/17/98  employment series are clearly falling very sharply, suggesting that the recent slowdown has been  widespread across industries  In any event, it is the case that the price pressures and the wage pressures are not  behaving the way they have in the past under comparable circumstances Something different is  going on It is this overall downward pressure, which I think is coming to a great extent from  international forces, that clearly has undercut to a substantial extent the pricing power of  manufacturing industries As you know, these prices have been weakening quite measurably in  recent months  I think the pressure on profit margins is beginning to affect capital investment Many  of the company executives to whom I speak and much of the secondary information that I pick  up from a number of different company sources clearly indicate that there is a scaling back of  capital appropriations It is not very large as yet, but obviously something is very gradually  exerting downward pressure The underlying diminished growth, which I think is fundamentally  being caused by the squeeze on margins, has not yet shown up in the consumer areas, as best I  can judge Consumer markets continue to be strong, and the wealth effect has not yet had a  measurable damping effect Motor vehicle sales, which were sharply higher in October largely  because of incentives, have eased some this month, as Mike Moskow indicated Officials from  the auto companies whom we talked to the other day all suggested that sales are running below  expectations, but I think their expectations are probably quite high Having said all that, I think  the likelihood that consumer spending will continue to grow rapidly is somewhat questionable  We do have a continued high level of housing sales; I see no real evidence that they are  deteriorating, but there also is no evidence of a pickup There has been some backing up of  inventories    11/17/98  There also is the broad and very important question of the financial issues It certainly  is the case that yield spreads and risk aversion, which had been quite substantial through October  and have eased quite measurably in the last several weeks, have stopped easing In fact, there  actually has been some minor upturn, especially on commercial paper, and I have run into the  same issues that Bill McDonough has raised with respect to year-end effects I think we are  beginning to see some potential year-end effects emerging in the banking area To be sure, the  weakening in the availability of funds in the capital markets has spilled over into the commercial  banking sector, and we have seen a very dramatic acceleration of C&I and other lending  generally A number of banks are quite unhappy about having to accommodate this additional  loan demand largely because, as you know, they have backup lines on commercial paper that  were issued and priced on the assumption that the lines would never be used If you speak to  banks, especially the money center banks, it is by no means clear that they are eager to  accommodate the spillover in loan demand from the capital markets As a consequence, I think  the presumption that we are going to see a gradual return to full and fluid capital markets is only  a hope at this stage and a hope that I don't think is about to materialize very quickly  I must say that the risks in the Brazil situation are significant The meeting that  occurred yesterday in New York seemed to suggest that the American banks were going to be  helpful in stabilizing Brazil's funding Having spoken to a number of them fairly recently, I  have the impression that each will participate only if everyone else does At the first sign that  that will not the case, they will back off I judge the risks here at close to 50/50, maybe a little  less I'm a shade less optimistic than Karen Johnson on this, but I grant that conditions have  improved from where they were Three weeks ago, I would have said that the Brazilian situation  was really dangerous Since then it has improved to close to 50/50 in my view, but it strikes me    11/17/98  that maintaining the Brazilian exchange rate is going to be very difficult An exchange rate that  is under pressure from 40 or 30 percent interest rates, capital account deficits, and programs that  are presumably very good on the fiscal side suggests that something is not right I am a little  concerned that we have not yet seen the worst of this  I agree with Mike Kelley on how one evaluates all of this If we move rates down and  we are wrong, it will be very easy to move them back up With the inflation rates where they are  and the real funds rate where it is, the question is more an issue of where the rate should be  rather than whether it should be going up or down As best I can judge, the funds rate that  appears to be appropriate in current circumstances, with all the risks we have talked about, is  closer to 4 percent than it is to 5 percent My judgment at this stage--and I grant you that it is  not a clear-cut call in all respects--is that if we hold steady at this time and things begin to  deteriorate and we then move the funds rate down, we would look as though we are behind the  curve and are reacting to events, and that could create a very unfavorable atmosphere in the  marketplace I see very little risk in moving down another 25 basis points today, provided we  indicate that we are on hold I think the clear thing to do at this point is to move down and go  symmetric, largely because the economy is in fact doing reasonably well The extent of  deterioration is modest I believe we are moving to a slower path of economic growth and a  potentially less inflationary environment, but there could be a far more deleterious outcome  ahead and I agree with many of you that a little insurance at this stage is probably wise The cost  of the insurance is very small, and I suspect it is probably not a bad thing at this stage to take out  the insurance but then to stop at that point, stay on hold, and watch events as they materialize  over the weeks and possibly even months ahead At that point, we would be poised to move    11/17/98  rates lower if necessary, but there is no obvious need in my judgment to be assuming such a  move at this time Vice Chairman   President Broaddus   Governor Ferguson   President Minehan    11/17/98   Governor Meyer   Governor Gramlich   President Boehne   President Moskow   President Parry   Governor Rivlin   President McTeer   President Poole   President Stem   President Jordan   President Guynn   President Hoenig   Governor Kelley   Okay, I think we have a majority for "A" symmetric, 25  basis points   David Lindsey, we are still using the old directive Do  we still want to use the word "moderation"?   Call the roll   A housekeeping item We are releasing the minutes of  the November meeting tomorrow, I believe   They are being released earlier than is our usual  practice partly because of Christmas and partly because of coordination with the other central  banks on the swap issue that we have discussed previously Would somebody like to move the  minutes of the November 17 meeting?   Without objection Peter   Let me go back to the issue that you mentioned with  respect to the incentives of Japanese banks to sell their JGBs The banks are carrying them at  book and they are engendering very large capital losses Those losses are not being charged  against capital, but would be if the JGBs were sold before maturity I didn't quite get the point  that you were making   Is it cost or market or both?   That is the old-fashioned market or cost basis if it's  below market Once they reach cost, it becomes a loss   Why? I can see it on a bond-by-bond basis They may  have a different way of keeping their books We do it bond-by-bond; you are saying they do not    12/22/98   It is poor management if I understand what they are  trying to do, which is to hide their losses   I won't comment on that! On a seemingly related  subject, I noticed that in the bottom graph on page 2 you show the US 10-year swap spread over  Treasuries, which is somewhat more than 80 basis points In Britain it is also about the same  order of magnitude On the continent, as I recall, it is about 30 basis points Does this reflect a  presumption in the market that there is more sovereign backing of commercial bank liabilities on  the continent than either here or in Britain? If that is not the answer, why is there such a  significant difference in spreads?   There has to be an answer because somebody is bidding  30 basis points for one and 80 basis points for another, which suggests that they see a difference  and are doing it for a reason   That is a potential explanation   That goes to the sovereign credit issue   If you have a chance, could you track it down?   The only reason I raise the issue is that it may be telling  us something about the issue of subsidization in the system, which is a useful insight if proven   Any further questions?   Yes   Let me suggest this Why don't the two of you have a  bilateral discussion and if you can add any additional light, report it to the rest of us   Any further questions?   We will now go back to the old issue of disclosure  policy A summary of our past discussions and positions on this issue and a proposed solution  have been written out and I will proceed to read it  The Committee has had two very productive discussions this year on disclosure issues  other than the tilt language, at the June-July meeting and the September meeting However, the  Committee's views seem to have evolved mainly into two disparate positions, both of which  have presented very cogent arguments in their favor One group, a small majority of the 18  governors and presidents, supports (1) releasing the operating paragraph of the directive, which  includes the tilt, immediately after every FOMC meeting; (2) releasing a brief announcement  immediately after those meetings in which either the policy stance or the tilt is changed; and (3)  releasing the minutes of the meeting as soon as feasible after every FOMC meeting, presumably  a couple of weeks earlier than now  Another group, a sizable minority, advocates keeping the status quo in all these  respects That is, the operating paragraph would continue to be released along with the minutes  after the next meeting, and immediate announcements would routinely be made only after policy  changes    12/22/98  Finally, two presidents would drop the tilt entirely from the operating paragraph  My impression is that in general the Committee's views have become held with  increasing conviction and have polarized into these two main groups As Chairman of the  Committee I would strongly urge that on a matter like this one, where any change will be  irrevocable in practice, the FOMC should not adopt a reform based on a narrow favorable vote,  with a sizable minority of the governors and presidents strongly opposed A small shift in the  voting balance toward status quo would not enable us to reverse policy any more than a death  sentence is reversible after being carried out   Instead, I would propose a compromise solution, which  we can try out on an experimental basis at least for the time being That compromise, which I  may say was crafted by Don Kohn in a Solomonesque insight, would be for the Committee to  continue its current practice of releasing the operating paragraph and minutes after the next  meeting but to expand the coverage of its immediate announcements to include those instances  where, even when policy has been kept unchanged, the Committee wants to communicate to the  public a major shift in its views about the balance of risks or the likely direction of future policy  This announcement would be reserved for situations in which the consensus of the Committee  clearly has shifted significantly, though obviously not enough to change policy, and in which  markets would be informed that our thinking has changed in order to avoid seriously misleading  them It would not apply every time the tilt was changed where these changes in the tilt  encompass only small shifts in the center of gravity of Committee thinking or where in the  context of incoming data the markets have already surmised the shift in Committee thinking    12/22/98 79  The announcement itself would not necessarily reference the tilt but instead would concentrate  on the change in the Committee's assessment of economic prospects  For example, under the compromise we presumably would have made an immediate  announcement after two FOMC meetings this year when we did not change policy An  immediate announcement after the late March meeting would have indicated that the Committee  had seen a shift away from a situation in which prospective forces were roughly offsetting to one  in which the risks of greater inflation seemed apparent Such an announcement would have  avoided some confusion over the intermeeting period as market participants attempted to  interpret our remarks, and an unauthorized disclosure of the tilt occurred  An immediate announcement after the August meeting would have conveyed the  Committee's perception of a change in the risks from rising inflation to a more balanced outlook  In the event, as you recall, with your agreement I revealed the shift in a speech at Berkeley  following our Jackson Hole discussion It would have been better communicated, in my  judgment, with a Fed statement As was demonstrated after the last FOMC meeting, an  announcement can be used to convey the message that the Committee has changed its assessment  of risks, including a sense of the tilt, even without the release of the operating paragraph  The compromise, which is suggested by Don Kohn and which I fully support, boils  down to a commitment at times of a major shift in the Committee's sentiment to take advantage  of the current disclosure policy in which the Committee has reserved the right to make an  announcement in the absence of policy changes When the FOMC announced its new disclosure  procedures in February 1995, the statement said in part that it would "announce each change in  the stance of monetary policy, including intermeeting changes, the day they are made When no  change is made at a meeting, the Committee will normally just announce when the meeting    12/22/98 80  ended and that there are no further announcements However, in some infrequent circumstances,  the Committee might decide to issue a statement even when no policy action is taken"  With respect to the implementation of this particular change in policy that is being  recommended, because the recommended compromise represents an implementation of the  Committee's current policy with variations, assuming that an informal consensus of the  Committee agrees with the idea, I do not think that a formal vote today would be needed I  should point out that should you concur with the compromise, it would not foreclose later shifts  in procedures in either direction based on our experience with this approach In fact, I suspect  our experience might help us to reach a consensus  Finally, news of this approach will get out when the minutes of this meeting are  released in early February, and I could discuss it further in my February Humphrey-Hawkins  testimony If so, these procedures would be put in place by the March FOMC meeting  I would be most interested in comments   Yes At the moment, we now discuss our position with  respect to policy in terms of alternatives A, B, or C, and, secondly, with respect to tilt When it  appears appropriate, there would be a third element in the discussion, which would be a  statement the Committee might wish to make And that statement would be cleared and edited  by the Committee    12/22/98   That is correct; that would be my intention President  Parry   Governor Meyer   President Minehan   President Broaddus    12/22/98   I think that will be automatic   President Moskow   Governor Kelley   If that happens, this is a mistake I do not envisage that  as what this compromise is   Governor Rivlin   The war is not over yet! President Hoenig    12/22/98   Governor Ferguson   Vice Chairman   I think he'd prefer the Peace Prize of the month! How  can he improve on that? When you get to the top, you can't go any higher   That would be a good way   President Jordan   President Boehne   Do you want to speak again, Jack?   President McTeer   President Stern   President Poole   Governor Gramlich   Okay, we will adopt that policy It does not require a  vote at this point We can adjourn to lunch The next meeting is February 2 nd and 3 rd  END OF MEETING       Without objection I assume approval of both We now  move on to Karen Johnson and Mike Prell   Karen, am I correct in assuming that the imports into  the United States have been tracking under what our models would have suggested?   So there is no evidence at this stage that the differences  between income elasticities on the export and import side are showing any change from what we  have seen over the years?   President Parry   President Minehan   Is that where all the steel is? [Laughter]   Any further questions for either of our colleagues? If  not, who would like to start our discussion? President Broaddus   President Parry   President Moskow   President Poole   President Minehan   President Boehne   President Guynn   President Stern   President McTeer   President Jordan   That's how they got there in the first place!   A very soft report!   President Hoenig   Vice Chair   Governor Kelley   Governor Gramlich   Governor Ferguson   Governor Rivlin   Governor Meyer   Thank you I think we have ended as close to 1100 as  we have in a very long time I assume coffee is out there   We are on schedule for a change  [Coffee break]   Mr Kohn   Incidentally, Don, when are we scheduling the next  senior loan officer survey?   Other questions for Don? If not, I will start off with  some comments on developments relating to policy I think all of you commented on the    12/22/98 57  continued momentum in the economy Even the labor market data, which appeared to be weak  or at least potentially weak at the time of our November meeting, now seem to have stabilized  While the gap between the household employment figures and the payroll numbers, which has  created a crucial issue in labor market evaluations, has not yet closed, it has narrowed as a  consequence of a very large increase in estimated household employment in the latest survey  You also may recall that the statistical series that includes the number of unemployed plus those  not in the labor force who would like to have a job seemed to have flattened during most of  1998, but it tilted down again in the most recent data So, we see in effect a reversion to what  existed earlier this year, not only with respect to a number of financial variables, as Don Kohn  mentioned, but also with respect to many of the characteristics of the labor market  What has not changed in any material way is the seeming lack of pricing power in the  economy I see virtually nothing that suggests upward pressure on prices despite the ongoing  weakness in profit margins as indicated by available data for the fourth quarter We see in the  latest estimates of S&P 500 earnings per share that the trend finally has turned negative for the  fourth quarter Sales for the S&P 500 firms presumably have not gone down in nominal terms,  but profit margins continue to decline In the manufacturing sector, the data show a continuation  of rather strong productivity gains and further declines in unit labor costs, but they also show a  decline in margins, though mainly as a consequence of downward pressure on prices So, what  we are observing is a remarkable and, in fact, almost surely unforecastable economy that is  expanding at a fairly rapid pace We also see labor markets that, if anything, are growing  marginally tighter, little evidence of wage acceleration, and no evidence of price acceleration I  assume that some of you believe that this can go on for a considerable period of time I cannot    12/22/98 58  believe it, but then again I said that six months ago [Laughter] I guess we should enjoy it while  it lasts  As a number of you have indicated, the risks on both sides have widened To a very  substantial extent in my view, the risks probably reflect the extraordinary behavior of the equity  markets over the last several years The dramatic decline in the saving rate, which arithmetically  is a very big factor in the continued growth of personal consumption expenditures and hence in  final demand, seems to be attributable almost entirely in the last two or three years to capital  gains increases not only in the equity markets but, as I will explain shortly, in housing as well  If we disaggregate the household sector, we end up with a decline of a couple  percentage points in the saving rate as a result of the wealth effect and another percentage point  or so as a consequence of higher capital gains taxes As I recall, the latter currently are running a  little more than $70 billion per year according to our estimates Their rise since 1993 has been  equivalent to 1 percent of the current level of disposable income In other words, the capital  gains tax accounts for a decline of about 1 percentage point in the saving rate Another  percentage point or so can be attributed to significantly flattened requirements for contributions  to defined benefit pension funds because the equity holdings in such funds have appreciated  substantially If these employee contributions had remained about the same as they were in 1993  in relation to income and had gone up with the rise in income, that would have added about 1  percentage point to the saving rate So these factors taken together account for most of the 5  percentage point decline in the saving rate in recent years  Superimposed on all of that is the very difficult problem of estimating the effects on  the saving rate of developments in housing and in the process avoiding potential double  counting There has been a dramatic increase in sales of existing homes Since the prices of    12/22/98 59  homes have been rising substantially with very few periods of stabilization or decline, the  moving average of price increases over the typical holding period for a home, which is about  eight or nine years, has been positive for an appreciable period of time As a consequence,  realized gains associated with the sales of homes have been significant The increase in  mortgage debt that one can attribute to existing home sales may be derived by taking the net  change in mortgage debt on single-family homes and subtracting from it the debt that one would  anticipate if there were no turnover of existing homes--that is, new debt taken out on new home  sales less scheduled amortization on existing mortgage debt The net of those two subtracted  from the total outstanding debt is a reasonably good estimate of the increase in debt on existing  homes That number looks remarkably close to independent estimates of capital gains on the  sale of homes The assumption here is that that money is extracted from the home market, which  of course it is Obviously, part of mortgage debt is in the form of home equity loans, but the  major part occurs as a consequence of the turnover from sales The seller of a home that has  appreciated in value gets back not only the down payment and amortization payments on the  home but the realized capital gain The latter is largely reflected in the higher mortgage debt,  which the buyer takes out on the home relative to what the seller writes down As a  consequence, the aggregate amount of realized capital gains in housing and, in a rough sense, the  amount of net debt on existing homes have been going up commensurately with the dramatic rise  in sales of existing homes  Theoretically, one can say that if the cash received by the seller is unencumbered,  which of course it is, there is no reason why it will not be used to make purchases The  economics literature is consistent with the view that consumer spending and cash flows move  hand in hand More specifically, evidence based on econometric analysis suggests that about    12/22/98 60  half of the funds acquired from windfall cash flows such as realized capital gains are spent So  realized capital gains on homes, even if financed through an increase in mortgage debt, will have  an influence on personal consumption expenditures  The trouble, unfortunately, is that the stock market and existing home sales are not  uncorrelated This makes it difficult to form a judgment as to whether what we think is the stock  equity wealth effect is really in part the housing wealth effect The reason this is important is  that when the stock market declines, if ever, it does not necessarily follow that the same pattern  will occur in existing home sales As a consequence, unless we are able to disaggregate the  wealth effects that are involved--and we are going to do some of that analysis to get a sense of  those effects--the forecast of final domestic demand in the next year or two will be a very  complex undertaking  The conclusion I draw from all of this is that in addition to income, capital gains have  become a very important factor in the overall behavior of final demand Obviously, the important  issue here is how we view the stock market outlook While it is true that we are seeing earnings  expectations fall in the very short run and it is certainly the case that security analysts have  dramatically reduced their earnings expectations for the year 1998, they have not decreased their  earnings expectations for the longer run As a consequence, if their earnings per share numbers  for five years out have not changed materially, the lowering of estimates for the near term  implies higher expected growth rates of five-year earnings This effectively explains how the  stock market can rise with earnings expectations falling The answer is They are not falling; it's  long-term earnings that are relevant for stock prices, not short-term earnings  I don't know how all of this is going to turn out The presumption that stock market  prices can continue to grow 20 percent a year seems absurd, as I think some of you said, but so    12/22/98 61  do a lot of other things The presumption that the market is going to level out is probably the  least unsupportable position and that presumption is consistent with the Greenbook's predicted  impact of the market on personal consumption expenditures There also has to be a non-  negligible probability that the market could go down very substantially I'm not entirely certain  how we would respond to that However, I do know that the presumption we have discussed in  the last year or so that we can effectively manage a bubble is probably based on a lack of  humility As I've said before, a bubble is perceivable only in retrospect  I think uncertainties on the financial side are going to be increasingly difficult for us to  factor into our policy deliberations over the next year The reason is that, as Cathy Minehan said  earlier today, the probabilities have risen quite substantially on both sides What we observe in  today's economy is an extraordinary momentum coming out of the 1993 and more importantly  the 1995 period The very substantial expansion of the asset side of balance sheets obviously is  affecting capital expenditures as well as personal consumption expenditures  If the economy's performance in 1999 essentially replicates the Greenbook outlook,  we will be lucky and fortunate indeed Knowing that this transcript will be read five years from  now, I suspect that comment will be perceived to be very precocious [Laughter]  The bottom line on policy clearly is, as far as I can see--and indeed as most of you  have indicated--that we should stay where we are because, as Mike Kelley said, it is not obvious  in what direction the next policy move should be I think we moved very effectively during the  fall I believe we broke what was a dangerously eroding financial situation In my view, we  now are in the position, having completed that episode, where our policy is back to balance and  we should be looking to both the upside and the downside in judging the potential direction of  our next move Vice Chair    12/22/98   If he had been right-handed, he would have lost eight  [Laughter] President Parry   I should have mentioned that Why don't we conclude  this policy discussion and afterwards go back to the directive wording issue instead of taking that  up now   President Poole   President Jordan    12/22/98   Governor Rivlin   Governor Ferguson   President Guynn   President Boehne   President Moskow   I tried not to convey a view that was other than that  President Stem   Governor Meyer   President Minehan   Governor Gramlich   Can you top that, Tom Hoenig?   President McTeer   Governor Kelley   President Broaddus   Okay Before we move to an official vote, let us now  go back to the issue of the directive language Remember that there are two issues to be  resolved, presumably finally, after our previous discussions One involves the question of the  deletion of the phrase "in coming months," which is the basic distinction between option 2 and  option 3 The other is the possible deletion of the sentence on the growth of the money supply at  the very end of the directive As I understand it, on the basis of our previous discussions, there is    12/22/98 70  strong support for option 3 at this point Some members of the Committee have focused on the  question of deleting the language in the middle of option 3 regarding the months ahead, I believe,  and some have raised a question about deleting the money supply language It would be helpful  if we went around the table fairly quickly to get a statement from each of you on those issues It  may be that if we get a significant modal value on these, we can finally bring this discussion to a  conclusion   I do not, mainly because the members around this table  said it did not And that is the ultimate determination   President Hoenig   Governor Kelley    12/22/98   President Broaddus   Governor Rivlin    12/22/98   President Minehan   Governor Meyer   Governor Gramlich    12/22/98   President Stem   President Moskow   Are you for option 3?   President Parry   Governor Ferguson   President Boehne   Vice Chair   President Poole   So you are taking it out?    12/22/98   President McTeer   President Guynn   President Jordan   That covers all the speakers If you can give the  Secretariat just a minute to assess where the Committee comes out on the wording-- [Laughter]   The vote is unanimous in favor of option 3 There are  small majorities in favor of eliminating the "months ahead" reference and the "money supply"  sentence, but the votes are not overwhelming The three of us who were tabulating the  preferences during the discussion get the same results, so I assume that our count is accurate  Unless I hear an objection, we will use that wording in the current directive Would you read the  new wording with the policy the members have endorsed, namely "B" symmetric   Yes   Call the roll    12/22/98   Good morning, everyone Would someone like   to move approval of the minutes for the February 2-3 meeting?    Without objection We will turn to Peter Fisher    Questions for Peter?    Peter, what has been happening to the bid/asked   spreads of both on-the-run and off-the-run forward Treasuries?    If you are trying to embarrass Peter, you are   succeeding!    Any further questions for Peter?    May 18 is the date of our next meeting We will   now adjourn for lunch   END OF MEETING        Thank you Without objection We will move   now to Mike Prell and Karen Johnson    Questions for either?    President Parry    President Jordan    President Minehan     3/30/99 13    President Poole    Any further questions for our colleagues?  If   not, who would like to start the Committee discussion?  President McTeer    President Minehan    President Hoenig    President Moskow    President Parry    President Guynn    President Broaddus    Vice Chair    President Boehne    President Stern    Governor Ferguson    Governor Meyer    Governor Kelley    Governor Rivlin    President Poole    Governor Gramlich    President Jordan    I think we can break for coffee   [Coffee break]    Don Kohn has the floor    Questions for Don?  If not, let me get started   For quite a while our Greenbook and indeed all models have been projecting slower   economic growth and higher inflation than actually have materialized Looking back, it   is conceivable and perhaps likely that the major explanation for these projection errors is   that the models have missed the extent of the acceleration in productivity By that I mean   that the cyclically adjusted rate of increase in productivity, as now shown in the data, has   been rising appreciably since the mid-1990s The evidence of this in the underlying data   is fairly clear-cut That is, the speed-up of productivity growth can explain to a large   extent both the significant acceleration in GDP from the supply side, as a number of you   have indicated, and the suppression of unit labor costs and total unit costs more generally,   which in turn explains the softness in inflation   The interesting question, however, is how to project that trend of acceleration   in productivity It is clear arithmetically, and indeed it is in the nature of any structural   model with fixed coefficients, that if we continuously underestimate one fundamental   variable that is rising faster than its underlying coefficient would suggest, then once we   stabilize its rate of growth, we engender the type of forecast that we have in the     3/30/99 54   Greenbook, namely, a forecast that implies a slowdown in economic activity or economic   growth and an acceleration in inflation That is algebraically necessary   I think the question on the table is whether we are looking at an aberration or   at the emergence of a new era If we take away the new era alternative and ask ourselves   what the cyclically adjusted productivity growth rate was for a significant part of the pre-  1995 period, it was flat Indeed, one of the more interesting statistics that corroborates   this independently is that terribly flawed number that we often discuss, the expected   long-term growth in earnings per share of the S&P 500 as estimated by security analysts   Such analysts throughout the country predict the individual company earnings that are   aggregated in an averaging process of the I/B/E/S organization As we are all aware,   those forecasts are highly biased on the upside Nevertheless, if we look at the history of   these long-term earnings expectations, from 1983 until late 1994 the data fluctuated in a   very narrow range of about 1 percentage point   If we presume that the bias in those numbers has not changed significantly   over the years--and there is no evidence that it has--we then see a major breakout of this   series in late 1994 Between late 1994 and the current month, the rise is almost 3 full   percentage points What does that mean?  It means basically that the earnings   expectations for individual companies, as evaluated by the security analysts who   obviously are speaking to corporate management and getting an excess dose of optimism,   are changing very dramatically These are long-term earnings expectations of individual   companies that are not unrepresentative of the economy as a whole I will argue that the   noncorporate sector, which is not included, does raise very interesting statistical   problems   In any event, we are looking at something that raises a question as to why the   analysts are changing those estimates Roughly 40 percent of the earnings stem from   foreign affiliates and are foreign directed It just is not credible that the acceleration in   long-term earnings expectations in the last year has been the result of a major increase in   expected long-term earnings of foreign affiliates This underscores the likelihood that   increased earnings are basically domestic     3/30/99 55   Since pricing power is clearly nonexistent, the improved earnings expectations   have to be the result of cost containment of some form or another, which on a   consolidated basis is essentially labor productivity for the economic system We   therefore have a variable missing from our models, if I may put it that way, which is   essentially this change in expected long-term earnings Those of you who have seen the   chart know that there was a dramatic acceleration that started in late 1994 and has   persisted The rise is not a cyclical change; the line just keeps going straight up It   slowed a little during the crisis in the summer of 1998 and previously in the crisis in   1997, but it did not go down; it just flattened out and then it took off again   If we could forecast that variable, it strikes me that we would have a very   important insight into the process But implicit in the Greenbook forecast, and indeed in   everybody else’s forecast, is that this variable will flatten out because a constant   cyclically adjusted long-term growth rate in output per hour is also implicit That has not   occurred in the last four years or so However, this process is incomplete, meaning that it   still has some distance to go You may recall the anecdotal comments at our last meeting   about technological synergies Reportedly, they are occurring at a pace that implies that   rates of return on new capital facilities vis-à-vis the cost of capital still have not crested   Anecdotally, people we speak to in businesses such as computers, software,   telecommunications, and obviously the Internet all say that the backlog of potential   profit-making investments is still rising That is what the security analysts are saying   The latter obviously are not independent observations It is just that the security analysts’   expectation is a far broader sample measuring the same phenomenon   As a consequence of all this, we were all concerned at the last meeting, and I   think rightfully so, that we were experiencing a major acceleration in aggregate demand   And if anything, the acceleration is even greater now The numbers for private domestic   final purchases are truly awesome, as everyone has been observing   Everyone has been concerned about weakness in manufacturing, but I suspect   that manufacturing activity may have turned up Indeed, some of the numbers we use to   estimate industrial production suggest that the manufacturing component of industrial     3/30/99 56   production could very readily be up ½ percentage point in March That is showing up in   the Chicago Purchasing Managers’ report as well as in a lot of anecdotes relating to the   manufacturing sector   There is no evidence of which I am aware of any acceleration in prices I think   the uptick in the Chicago Purchasing Managers’ prices-paid survey reflects the rise in oil   prices Everybody has seen an oil price increase, and the proportion of people who report   that they have seen price increases goes up every time there is an increase in oil prices   But oil prices are not what they used to be in this economy The extent to which energy   affects manufacturing industries has declined dramatically, and the impact of oil on GDP   and inflation has fallen quite markedly   We have to be careful in our assessment of the CPI That measure of prices   can show a big increase, and it has But the CPI is a flawed statistic; it is a statistic that   overweighs housing and overweighs a significant part of personal consumption   expenditures The big difference between the PCE chain-weighted index and the CPI is   largely in the weights That is, if we ask people what they spend money on, which is the   basis of the CPI survey, they remember their housing costs When we match the housing   costs, mortgage payments, and all the big ticket items against known retail sales, we   discern a very significant bias in the weighting system of the CPI that is creating a   considerable divergence from the far superior PCE deflator Nonetheless, in the first two   months of this year the two measures have shown the same thing, virtually zero inflation,   both on the total and on the core That is going to change for the March data as the oil   prices come in significantly higher for the CPI than for the PCE   What is more interesting are the wage data, which I find increasingly difficult   to understand Why are wage increases slowing down in this exceptionally tight labor   market?  To be sure, the fall in inflation is a major factor, but it really does not explain   the extent to which wages have decelerated in this period when the labor markets are so   tight Nonetheless, the combination of a slightly slower rate of increase in compensation   per hour and accelerated productivity has lowered the growth in unit labor costs for the   nonfinancial corporate area to 01 percent over the last four quarters, a significant     3/30/99 57   improvement That is a lower increase in unit labor costs than in the preceding period   As a consequence, the change in value-added prices in the nonfinancial corporate sector-­  that is, the deflator for gross product originating from corporations--is actually negative   and has been negative for a number of quarters   The difficulty that I have in looking at overall business sector productivity is   an issue that we have discussed previously, namely that the measurements we see in the   corporate and the noncorporate areas cannot be reconciled The margins of noncorporate   profits, if I may use the term, are not bad Yet the implicit output per hour number in   total business sector productivity or nonfarm business sector productivity is picking up an   implicit output per hour number in noncorporate business that has been declining, on   balance, for two decades For example, in industries where we have very significant   amounts of noncorporate business--the legal profession, the medical profession, and   business services--measured annual productivity has declined about 2 percent per annum   on average since the late 1970s That is just not credible   So, we have a major measurement error problem in the noncorporate area that   distorts our view of what is happening to productivity As a result, the corporate data-­  especially nonfinancial corporate data--are far more reliable When we look at   manufacturing, the numbers are rising at a very sharp pace, more than for all nonfinancial   corporations I might add that the January-February data for manufacturing show strong   productivity growth, to the extent that we have hard data, and they show unit costs going   down Indeed, if anything, overall margins in the most recent quarters are starting to   open up after being constrained through a good part of last year And the numbers for   farm productivity, for which we have hard data, are rising over 4 percent per year So,   the crucial statistic that is throwing this whole forecast off is the growth rate of   productivity, properly measured When the increase in that number slows, then I think   the new era will be over We will go back to the relationships where the fixed   coefficients, the NAIRU, and all the other factors that are being overridden by this   variable come back into place     3/30/99 58   We have not reached that point yet At the moment, if we want to look at the   evidence both anecdotally and in the security analysts’ forecasts, March is virtually   unchanged from February We may be seeing the beginning of the topping-out process,   but it follows a very sharp acceleration Nonetheless, I think we are confronted with the   fact that labor markets are very taut Initial claims are unbelievable The tightness in   markets is such that, as Cathy Minehan points out, there is evidence that production in   the First District is being restricted by a lack of workers And I dare say that is probably   true in one way or another throughout the whole country We may at some point soon   begin to see the wage acceleration, but we are not yet at the point where inflation is   beginning to move in the pipeline   While I think it is exceptionally likely that the next move the Committee will   be making will be on the upside, I do think--with inflation effectively at zero and with no   evidence yet that the acceleration in productivity has come to an end--that we have time   Indeed, if this acceleration in productivity continues, I believe we are going to start to see   prices falling, although that would not be deflation in the usual sense of things imploding   As a consequence, even though in one sense I feel inclined toward asymmetry toward   tightening because I think that is the likely direction of our next move, I am a little   concerned about adopting an asymmetric directive today   I am assuming that we will choose not to move, which is what I generally   heard in the comments around this table this morning I would be disinclined to move   toward asymmetry if for no other reason than I think, were we to do that, that we would   have to announce it I agree with Mike Kelley; I am getting very queasy about this   Kosovo war I see potential dangers here The antiseptic wars that we have been   experiencing--the Gulf War and the more recent air attacks on Iraq and Serbia--have   given us, I think, a mistaken view of what war is We are moving very quickly toward   using American ground troops in Kosovo The situation is getting scarier and scarier   As Mike Kelley points out, if there were any urgency about moving toward a   firming at this stage, I would say we would have no choice We would just do what we   have to do But considering that we do have some time and flexibility, I would     3/30/99 59   recommend that we stay where we are at this point both with respect to moving interest   rates and with respect to remaining neutral on symmetry Vice Chair    President Poole    President Boehne    President Broaddus    President Parry    President Moskow    President Stern    President Guynn    Governor Gramlich    President Minehan    Governor Ferguson    Governor Meyer    Governor Rivlin    President Jordan    Governor Kelley    President McTeer    President Hoenig    Thank you The majority of the voting   members appears to favor “B” symmetric Could you read the directive, including the   change that has been recommended in the general paragraphs?    Call the roll    Who would like to move to approve the minutes   of the March meeting?    Without objection they are approved Mr Fisher,   you have the floor    Peter, in the event, a low probability event, of   very significant runs on smaller banks for currency withdrawals or deposit transfers, do   those banks have enough collateral to come to the discount window and liquefy the asset   side of their balance sheets to weather that drain?    I know we can do that, but I am wondering what   they have    Suppose a bank holds a note of a long-term friend   of the bank’s president, which is 10 percent of the asset side of the balance sheet Let’s   say everything about the loan looks fine It’s a performing loan and the bank itself is   perfectly comfortable with it; indeed, it is a terrific loan Can we accept that?     5/18/99 7    Now the premise changes and the good friend of   the president of the bank is in evident difficulty, not in servicing the loan but in repaying   it at the end of its term What is the point at which we effectively throw these people into   bankruptcy?    But we are the only lender of last resort    I am concerned about our being in a position   where we are unprepared to make judgments on which banks we effectively will shut   down because we are not going to accept their paper at the discount window and by   definition there is no other lender of last resort     5/18/99 8    Communication is fine But suppose somebody at   the other end of the line says “Hey, I am drowning What are you going to do for me?”    I think that is the judgment we have to make All   I am suggesting is that we try to make it in advance    We can make a judgment as to whether we are   looking at a systemic risk, in which case we can act under certain provisions specified in   the Federal Reserve Act But what do we do if the risk is not obviously systemic but a   very significant problem for, say, Texas or some other area where there is a multitude of   small banks?    President Poole    If we backstop that system, it will be difficult to   unwind it because they are going to want to keep it in place    Vice Chairman     5/18/99 10    Any further questions on open market operations?   If not, who would like to move to ratify the domestic transactions?    Without objection they are approved Mr Fisher,   you wanted to discuss our swap arrangements with Canada and Mexico    Questions for Peter?  If not, would somebody like   to move that?    Is there a second?   SEVERAL Second    Without objection Thank you very much Let’s   turn now to Mr Prell    Mike, in line with the notion you raised about the   inability of maintaining the seasonally adjusted level of housing starts as we move into   the period where the seasonals start to rise, I do recall that the unadjusted April starts   figures were down Were the permits down unadjusted?    Unadjusted starts?    You don’t recall whether the permits, unadjusted,   were down?    We do have that?    Okay, it is not crucial Does anyone remember   whether or not the seasonal for May goes up over the April seasonal?    Really from February to April is the big surge?    Other questions for Mike?  President Moskow    President Parry     5/18/99 17    President Poole    I remember that steel issue My recollection is   that a lot of plant managers knew at the time that they had open hearth furnaces and   rolling facilities which were clearly of an earlier age It would be interesting to know   whether in the Census Bureau data, as distinct from the American Iron and Steel Institute   data, the plant managers were reporting that as true capacity under the Census definition,   which has a cost element in it as I recall That is, the question is not sheer physical   facilities but what can be brought into production at a reasonable marginal cost I would   doubt very much that those steel facilities would have met that definition back then I   guess we would have to argue at this particular stage that individual managers who are   reporting to the Bureau of the Census are aware of whether what they have is obsolescent   or not They can be wrong, but it is their judgment, and I don’t know how we could do   better than that    Sure But I think the point that Mike is making is   that we don’t project capacity independently What is projected is the operating rate We   get capacity by division, and that is essentially--   Then you smooth it out    We have two measures--the ones I assume you are   talking about--which are the lead times on the deliveries of materials and the number of   items in short supply The lead times are stretching out some, especially in steel with the   prospect of a steel strike The number of items in short supply, which are reported on a   reasonably consistent basis by the purchasing managers, has been zero for a long period   of time So the symptoms of capacity restraint are not there and what we see is not   inconsistent with the 80 percent or so capacity utilization rate that we show for industrial   production in manufacturing    Unadjusted?    President Minehan    Do you recommend that we move our February   FOMC meeting back to December?  [Laughter]     5/18/99 22    I think there is a distinction here on which we   cannot put a number, but we can get a judgment The point I was making at Mike   Moskow’s conference earlier this month, and I may have mentioned it at our last FOMC   meeting as well, strikes me increasingly as the really crucial element in making that   differentiation A number of years ago--maybe 5, 8, or 10 years ago--those of us who   were working as business consultants of some kind or another spent a very considerable   amount of time addressing the fact that all key business decisions were made with a   probability distribution around them And in order to protect either the level of   production that the firm needed or the value of the franchise, a company had to introduce   layers of safety stock inventory on the one hand and redundancies of people on the other   And as information technology gradually reduced the variance of error in the decision-  making processes--in a sense knowledge became more and more crucial--the need to   have all of these redundancies gradually dissipated When they are stripped out of the   system, they are permanent structural productivity changes; output per hour is   permanently changed The type of productivity you are discussing is not in a sense real   productivity Well, I guess you could call that productivity, but it certainly is not trend   productivity It is, I would say, a cyclical dynamic And that is the reason why we try to   cyclically adjust the productivity data; we try to get a rate of change with that cyclical   factor removed And the truth of the matter is that I don’t see how we will know which is   which until after the fact    Further questions for Mike?  If not, would   somebody like to start the go-around?  President Broaddus    I don’t know why I even ask for your report!   [Laughter]    You’ve made it impossible for anyone else to   come after you! [Laughter] Who wants to try?  President Moskow    President Parry    President Jordan    President Hoenig    President McTeer    President Poole    President Stern    President Guynn    President Boehne     5/18/99 40    President Minehan    Vice Chairman    Governor Kelley    Governor Gramlich    Governor Ferguson     5/18/99 47    Governor Meyer    Governor Rivlin    Thank you I think coffee awaits!   [Coffee break]    Mr Kohn    Questions for Don?    Further questions for Don?  If not, let me get   started on the policy side   I would like to differentiate between history and forecasts The history at this   particular stage, with only very slight variations that have surfaced anecdotally in the last   two or three weeks, is unequivocally that of a period of declining rates of increase in unit   costs In fact, the numbers for the nonfinancial corporate sector have gone down to zero   change in total unit costs over the four quarters ending in the first quarter of 1999 I   don’t recall a four-quarter number that low in the current expansion The zero change   reflects quite subdued growth in unit labor costs and a decline in the level of unit   nonlabor costs Prices generally are flat, but they have been associated with a rise of   modest dimensions in profit margins, on average, in the past few quarters   In the manufacturing area where we have data through April, we see similar   results in that unit costs remain very subdued Indeed, the monthly numbers on costs are   quite soft and profit margins were rising significantly further in April All the reports on   projected profits that we pick up from security analysts point to an improvement in the   second quarter I don’t mention that as a forecast but as a report of what people are   saying The data indicate that productivity continues to accelerate Indeed, we have very   little evidence as yet that the upsurge in cyclically adjusted productivity has leveled out   The first sign that that is occurring may be reflected in the long-term earnings forecasts of   the security analysts, which as you know have moved up about 2 percentage points The   earnings forecasts and productivity growth rates may differ, but the two are interrelated   Because we are talking about a forecast with no change in labor’s share, an increase in   expected earnings over five years has to show up either in an acceleration in the rate of     5/18/99 56   inflation, in the rate of productivity growth, or in the rate of hours growth The latter is   extremely unlikely, strictly as a matter of demographics   There is very little evidence to date of a pickup in inflation expectations, and   until very recently the notion regarding pricing power in the business sector has been   uniformly that it is zero Theoretically, it is possible that foreign affiliates are increasing   their share of the earnings But given what has happened to oil, that seems doubtful   Therefore, we are led to the conclusion that the earnings expectations are essentially   projections of productivity growth The rate of growth in productivity has been rising   during the past several years In the past two or three months, however, we have seen   some indications that the growth rate might be leveling out That suggests that   companies are no longer telling security analysts that productivity growth is on an ever   rising trend   If we look strictly at the current data, what we end up with are increasing profit   margins and noncredible reductions in the rate of increase in average hourly labor costs   The latter come from the figures on aggregate wages and salaries in the NIPA data   divided by hours or they come from the average hourly earnings in the payroll data; both   show a very dramatic drop in the rate of gain in average hourly labor costs I believe it   was you, Roger, who was raising the issue of the NIPA data; those data are obviously   picking up a larger aggregate hours figure The trouble with the NIPA data is that we are   dividing an uncertain numerator by an uncertain denominator, and the result is   perfection!    The trouble unfortunately is that, as a number of   you have commented, the ECI cost data are probably not picking up a number of the   nontraditional ways of paying people--training costs, stock options, and a few other forms   of compensation But leaving aside the uncertainties that are involved in measuring   wages, the interesting issue is why wages are not rising faster if productivity is doing   what all the evidence suggests it is doing We have a unique anomaly   Nonetheless, granted all of this, we still have erosion in the pool of people   seeking work who do not have jobs To be sure, that number has not gone down as fast   in the last year as it did in preceding years, but it is still going down at a 500,000 annual     5/18/99 57   rate That is a substantial decline The current level is at or below its previous low in the   history of this series, which goes back to 1970 We know that has to have inflationary   consequences at some point even if the acceleration in productivity has damped the   influence of tight labor markets on wage increases   I also find a bit of an anomaly in the anecdotes concerning what is happening   to prices A number of you have referred to anecdotal reports that it is now easier to raise   some prices I suspect that may be right, given the extent of overall vibrancy in this   economy Nonetheless, participants in the Business Council meeting in Williamsburg   said the other day that such pricing behavior absolutely was not occurring and that they   had not seen it for quite a long period of time I don’t know whether that phenomenon is   just starting to be built into the pricing structure   There is some evidence that commodity prices may have tilted up to some   extent after declining earlier and then flattening out Copper and aluminum prices are up   modestly, but they are well beneath their recent highs Steel scrap prices are little   changed It is hard to find anything resembling upward price pressures on non-oil   commodity prices Nonetheless, I can’t get away from the fact that the growth in   aggregate demand still exceeds the rate of increase in productivity and is continuing to   put pressure on the system I find it very difficult to uncover any useful evidence that   suggests the increase in aggregate demand is slowing Obviously, we are absorbing   goods from abroad at an unprecedented pace   This situation could go on for a while, as Governor Kelley has said, but   credulity gets strained more and more the longer it goes on It is hard to avoid the   conclusion that there is an increasing imbalance here that we have to address While I am   not ready to move rates, I do think that those of you who have raised the issue of moving   to a tilt toward restraint have the arguments strongly on your side And if we do go to a   tilt in this particular environment, I can’t see how we can avoid announcing it I think   failing to do so would be exceptionally confusing to the market As far as I can see, we   do not have strong evidence of rising inflation, especially if we move away from what I   consider to be a flawed consumer price index If we look at the implicit PCE deflator, the   numbers don’t look as bad Indeed, the April rise in the PCE deflator is 03 for the core   and 05 for the total The three-month average for the core PCE is a rise at an annual rate     5/18/99 58   of 11 percent This is not evidence that somehow we are far behind the curve, that   inflation pressures are mushrooming, and that we had better move   I see very little to be lost at this stage in going to an announced tilt except   perhaps in using a tool that we might be able to use more effectively later What it does   in my view is to position us to move in light of a lot of small indications in the CPI that   may suggest a rise in inflation I suspect that is the case but I do not know for certain In   other words, even adjusting for the measurement problems in the CPI with regard to the   abnormal weight that it puts on apparel and on owner-occupied rents, there are   indications in the latest numbers that the decline in inflation is coming to a halt There is   very little evidence that I can see that the rate of inflation is still moving down But we   also have seen very few, if any, signs that it is turning up And therefore I think we will   be in a position where we can move if necessary at the next meeting or the meeting after   that and not be caught by what I consider to be a relatively low, but by no means zero,   probability of having to move suddenly We have been in a situation for so long where   we have seen labor markets tighten continuously with nothing happening to prices that   we may lull ourselves into the belief that markets don’t turn quickly They have turned   quickly in the past Such behavior will not show up in our models largely because   models, by having fixed coefficients reflecting average characteristics, cannot produce a   rapid change But markets can And even though I think such an outcome has a low   probability, I believe it finally is time for us to start to position ourselves I am far from   convinced that we will need to act on an asymmetric directive in the near term But not   having such a directive in place and then being forced to act by events that come upon us   fairly quickly, which may mean acting during an intermeeting period, could in my view   create market forces that might ultimately be destabilizing So while I sense that it is   definitely premature to move rates, it is by no means premature to move toward a tilt and   to announce it as well Vice Chair    Governor Rivlin    President Broaddus    President Boehne    President Guynn    President Hoenig    Governor Kelley    Governor Meyer    President Minehan    President Stern    President McTeer    President Poole    President Moskow    President Parry    Governor Ferguson    President Jordan    Governor Gramlich    I think there is a consensus among the voting   members in favor of alternative B asymmetric and an announcement There is a question   about the reference to the “intermeeting period” in the directive I have a preliminary   version of a press statement that we would use if the vote on changing to asymmetry is   affirmative It does talk about “the coming months” as distinct from “the intermeeting   period” Does anybody have strong views as to what we might or might not do about the   language in the directive on the presumption that we go ahead on the asymmetry?  We   have to decide that now because legally we have to vote on a specific directive Don   Kohn, do you have a recommendation as to how we ought to handle this?    Okay, why don’t we just leave the directive as   is, but leave the issue open in the event that we want to go further So, read the directive   as is    Call the roll please    Let me read a proposed statement and get your   reactions to it “While the FOMC did not take action today to alter the stance of   monetary policy, the Committee was concerned about the potential for a buildup of   inflationary imbalances that could undermine the favorable performance of the economy   and therefore adopted a directive that is tilted toward the possibility of a firming in the   stance of monetary policy Trend increases in costs and core prices have generally   remained quite subdued But domestic financial markets have recovered and foreign   economic prospects have improved since the easing of monetary policy last fall Against   the background of already-tight domestic labor markets and ongoing strength in domestic   demand in excess of productivity gains, the Committee recognizes the need to be alert to     5/18/99 70   developments over coming months that might indicate that financial conditions may no   longer be consistent with containing inflation”    Is that acceptable?   SPEAKER (?) Excellent!    We will issue this at 215 pm Our next   meeting is June 29th and 30th and we adjourn for lunch   END OF MEETING        Good morning, everyone Would somebody like to   move approval of the minutes for the June 29-30, 1999 meeting?    Without objection We need to elect Ms Cumming and   Mr Howard as Associate Economists to serve until the election of their successors at the   first meeting of the Committee after December 31, 1999 President McDonough, would you   nominate your colleague?    First of all, would somebody second the motion?   SEVERAL Second    Any discussion?  All in favor say “aye”   SEVERAL Aye    The “ayes” have it Karen Johnson, would you do the   honors for David Howard?  You do know him, I hope!    I assume no discussion is required, at least I trust not   If so, the presumption is that David Howard is elected unanimously   I’d also like to recognize First Vice President Jamie Stewart who is attending his first   meeting We welcome you   Peter Fisher, would you review developments in foreign currency and domestic   financial markets and domestic open market operations?    Questions for Peter?  President Minehan     8/24/99 7    President Hoenig    Further questions for Peter?    I would suggest that somebody had better do so   [Laughter] Without objection, they are approved   Item 4 on the agenda is a very important issue being brought before this Committee It   is one that probably is ripe for discussion and certainly it was not at an earlier stage But by   now I believe we are all beginning to get a sense that, while we cannot pin down the whole   array of Y2K effects, the broadened range of things that could potentially go wrong has   grabbed our concerns I don’t know how the rest of you feel about what is going on, but I’m   feeling an increasing uneasiness about a low probability--and perhaps very low probability-­  development And that is the potential for a very significant adverse event in the financial     8/24/99 9   markets as a consequence of liquidity concerns, currency withdrawals, and uncertainties of a   general nature I think we can all probably assume, as the Greenbook assumes, that things   will essentially work their way out I don’t deny that that is a very, very high probability   But we are the central bank, and what I’m concerned about is that we have a fiat money   system This means in effect that with some limitations--both legal and from our own rules   --we can expand money as much as we choose  What I hope does not happen--and this is   the reason why it is quite relevant for Peter to address these issues at this time--is that we   will find that very low probability event occurring and our ability to address it somehow   hobbled solely by our own rules of operation The issues that Peter will raise and the   authorizations that he will request, with the exception of the authority to do 90-day RPs, are   solely for the purpose of handling potential Y2K problems and, therefore, should be sunset   What we will want to do, of course, is to review how all of this worked out after the year-  end period We can make judgments at that point on whether those authorizations should be   allowed to expire, as I think we all hope at the moment, or whether some should be retained   or even expanded But the essential issue here is one of insurance, with a relatively modest   premium, against a potentially catastrophic, very low probability event With that, Peter,   would you outline your proposals to us?    Let’s do that now    President Parry     8/24/99 13    I assume, incidentally, that that will increase the supply   of Treasury securities available as collateral by a comparable amount    No, I wasn’t referring to the TT&L accounts I’m   saying that if Treasury uses the cash to build up its TT&L accounts or its balances at the   Federal Reserve, it would not be paying off Treasury securities    I’m trying to say that they are supplying a goodly part   of the net new demands as a consequence of that     8/24/99 14    So it’s largely a zero-sum game in this particular   discussion    Well, currency in circulation is still running ahead of   normal, obviously, so there is some early store of value accumulation going on    Yes, by some $300 billion    When the “howl” level goes up, you’ll understand it   very much more quickly!    President Minehan    Further questions for Peter?  Would somebody like to   move the authority?    All in favor say “aye”   SEVERAL Aye    Opposed?  The “ayes” have it    Questions for Peter on this issue?    Is there a second?    The “ayes” have it    I would suggest, since your coughing suggests that   you’re dying, that we have Norm Bernard read the paragraph!    Questions for Peter on that?    Is there a second?    All in favor say “aye”   SEVERAL Aye    The “ayes” have it Let’s move to Item D     8/24/99 19    The point I was making was not solely the technical   problem I was referring even more to the psychological problem    Vice Chair    Not exercised and not even purchased    President Parry    President Broaddus    That’s the reason why it’s essential that most of this   new authority gets sunset President Jordan    President Hoenig    Let me just comment I think there is no question that   there will be adverse consequences We’re going to change certain types of behavior in   ways that are very difficult to anticipate, and presumably some of those changes are going to   be adverse One of the advantages of having this as a temporary program--one would   presume--is that we will see a number of the adverse outcomes and we will not be locked in   to maintaining the program I think the argument that we perceive of this as a temporary   reaction to an idiosyncratic event tends to limit the types of institutional changes that might   occur as a consequence of it    If you think about it, the potential downside risks of not   doing some of these things are just awesome    President Minehan    President Moskow    Governor Gramlich    Well, an obvious question arises here Is there a limit   to the number and volume of options you’ll be willing to sell?    If you price appropriately, you’ll get as large a volume   as you want    The desire to create a very low price may not be the   wisest of all operations    It’s called subsidized insurance That’s what it is   The fact is that they can get it from the private sector but the price they would pay   would embarrass the seller of the insurance The difference is the subsidy    It’s the sovereign credit of the United States It is like   the FDIC; it is precisely the same issue    It would beat the subsidy   MR STERN The subsidy is going to get smaller the further out the chain one goes    Gary, that may well be the type of thing that Tom   Hoenig is concerned about    Once the money is available, it’s impossible to trace it   to individual contracts or relationships So, in effect, it will be hard to see how the subsidy   gets passed on I guess every economist would say that the subsidy stays with the dealer    If you have an auction, basically you have not solved   the problem but you’ve limited it    In fact, the price will tell us something about how the   program is going in the market    I had the impression that you were thinking of setting   the price    Is there a reservation price on Treasury bill auctions?    No?  The question is Why would you want one on   this?    But that reservation price doesn’t help you for that It is   the wrong side of the question; that’s all I’m saying     8/24/99 34    If it turns out that indeed the demand is very low or   they set a very low price, you’d be required to give it to them at a negligible price, and that   may not be desirable Okay Governor Kelley    Further questions for Peter?  Why don’t you read the   Authorization as it is being amended?    Is there a second?    All in favor say “aye”   SEVERAL Aye    The “ayes” have it Thank you very much, Peter    At the termination of this meeting I’m going to ask that   the Board of Governors meet separately to consider the requests of a very large number of   the Reserve Banks to move the discount rate up 25 basis points In the event that the Board   goes along, I would propose to release the following statement with respect to our decisions   The Federal Open Market Committee today voted to raise its  target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 5¼ percent  In a related action, the Board of Governors approved a 25 basis  point increase in the discount rate to 4¾ percent   With financial markets functioning more normally, and with  persistent strength in domestic demand, foreign economies  firming, and labor markets remaining very tight, the degree of  monetary ease required to address the global financial market  turmoil of last fall is no longer consistent with sustained,  noninflationary, economic expansion   Today’s increase in the federal funds rate, together with the  policy action in June and the firming of conditions more  generally in US financial markets over recent months, should  markedly diminish the risk of rising inflation going forward As  a consequence, the directive the Federal Open Market Committee  adopted is symmetrical with regard to the outlook for policy over  the near term   In taking the discount rate action, the Federal Reserve Board  approved requests submitted by the Boards of Directors of the  Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, New York, Philadelphia,  Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St Louis, Kansas City,  and San Francisco The discount rate is the interest rate that is  charged depository institutions when they borrow from their  District Federal Reserve Banks   There is one additional item on the agenda, which addresses the question of the tilt   Bill Poole and a number of other Committee members have raised the question as to   whether the Committee shouldn’t come to an agreement on what the tilt language in the     8/24/99 87   directive really means This has always been an awkward question, but obviously it has   taken on added importance with our announcements Most of us are also at least slightly   uncomfortable with how the new announcement policy has been working out in practice and   wonder if it might not benefit from at least some tinkering I don’t think we can resolve any   of these interrelated issues at this meeting In fact, I would prefer to have considerably more   experience under our collective belts before making any new decisions on these matters   But I do think it is important to get a process under way to review the language of the   directive, its meaning, and what we announce That’s the reason I asked Don Kohn to add   this topic to the agenda at the last minute   What I propose is that Roger Ferguson head a small subcommittee of the FOMC to   examine these issues and come back with some recommendations or at least choices for us   to consider Roger will consult the Presidents and Board members to come up with the   other members of this subcommittee Theirs will be no easy task and it will benefit from   added experience, as I already noted My inclination is to ask Roger and his colleagues to   get back to us in early spring   Is that satisfactory to everybody?  You have all raised the issue in one form or another,   and we have to come to some form of agreement on what to do about it Having said that,   may I request that the Board members adjourn to my office?   END OF MEETING        Mike Prell    Questions for Mike or Karen?    President Parry    President Poole    Further questions for our colleagues?  If not, who would like   to start the Committee roundtable discussion?  President Minehan    Let’s go to President Moskow and then we’ll break   for coffee I see some heads nodding [Laughter]    Let’s recess for coffee   [Coffee break]    President Parry    President Broaddus    President Guynn    President Hoenig    President Boehne    Vice Chair    President Jordan    President McTeer    President Stern    President Poole    Governor Gramlich    Governor Meyer     8/24/99 66    Governor Ferguson    That is an improvement I thought it was an indoor   wedding    Governor Kelley    Let’s move on to Don Kohn    Questions for Don?  If not, let me proceed Following   up on a number of the issues that Peter Fisher raised at the beginning of our meeting, I have   become increasingly concerned, somewhat surprisingly in a sense to myself, about what is   looming out there in the Y2K area My concern centers mainly on the increasing evidence   of potential illiquidity problems, as people in the business community and financial   community keep talking to one another about possible year-end developments Everybody   seems to be focusing on what they should do to protect themselves at year-end in a situation   where the cost of appropriate precautions is not perceived to be all that large relative to the     8/24/99 73   cost of the potential outcomes I think we are addressing the year-end issue, and I don’t   believe there is likely to be a significant problem in the financial area   However, even though I agree with Mike Prell that the declining inventory/sales ratios   do not at this stage seem to have caused a sense of a shortfall, it is just not credible that the   tightness of just-in-time inventory management that businesses have created in this country   can continue, as we move ever closer to the end of the year, without generating some   precautionary buildup of various supplies along various pipelines We’ve seen several   surveys that suggest many people are inclined to take such precautionary measures The   crucial consideration is that we don’t need very much stocking up to create a quite large   increase in seasonally adjusted inventory investment Indeed, my recollection is that a one   percent increase in real business inventories is about $50 billion at an annual rate And an   increase of that order of magnitude from one quarter to the next adds more than 2   percentage points to the GDP growth rate An additional one percent change in inventories   investment is not a big number So even though my perception is that the Greenbook   forecast is probably right, the risk to the forecast is on the upside and very substantially so   The question that arises is how that inventory is going to be financed When I look at   the nature of markets and how the flow of funds may emerge in the year-end period, I can   envision some potentially very worrisome developments I do not perceive that as a   necessary or most likely outcome Indeed, I don’t believe it will happen But I think the   risk is sufficiently large that I would very strongly be in the group that wants to tighten up   on monetary policy today if for no other reason than that we want to go into a period like   that with a somewhat tighter than looser policy stance   As Don Kohn pointed out, we’ve not only had the June funds rate increase but we’ve   also had a very significant increase in the real long-term investment grade yield in recent   months Indeed, as I recall from the charts I looked at yesterday, the BAA real rate is up   just about a full percentage point since the beginning of the year That’s a fairly substantial   amount of tightening that has taken place My own perception is that it is likely to be   adequate for our purposes The reason I think so at this stage is that the outlook for rising   inflation is still a forecast If we look at the detailed data, as a number of you have pointed   out, there is nothing there In fact, the twelve-month change for the core CPI excluding   tobacco--which had that artificial, very sharp rise last December--is well under 2 percent I     8/24/99 74   think it is 17 percent That is a more relevant statistic, if we are going to use the CPI, than   any of the other numbers we’re looking at But as I’ve argued before, I think the CPI is a   flawed measure of inflation The personal consumption expenditure deflators are far more   important and not only because of the weight differences, which are quite important   Indeed, a number of the “component” or “detailed” price indices are far more accurate than   those in the CPI   I think there is a question of which of the various broad-based inflation indexes to use,   but I agree with the Vice Chair in that I believe we have arrived at price stability by any   measure we can employ And the argument that the rate of inflation has stabilized I think is   probably accurate, although it’s difficult to tell in certain respects for reasons I will get to in   a minute The point is that we are at the level we need to be; it is not as though we have   stalled out at some higher level of inflation and, therefore, will require additional effort to   bring inflation down   The concerns that a lot of people around the table have raised with respect to this issue   I think are quite valid The oil price increase has been more than we would have expected,   certainly more than I would have expected And you cannot just subtract energy out of your   price indexes as though there is some core aberration in the way that you can with   agriculture In a certain sense when food was a crucial issue in the CPI and affected wages,   taking food out of the CPI was questionable But taking food out of the CPI now is not   questionable because it clearly is fairly exogenous However, oil is not Oil eventually   works its way into the core price indexes, through transportation costs, petrochemical   feedstocks, heating costs, and a variety of other areas So it is not as though the oil price is   extractable from the overall price index; its impact is just delayed To be sure, oil--and   energy more generally--doesn’t have the weight that it had 20 years ago in the GDP, but it is   still a prominent force and, therefore, I would not diminish its inflationary implications   The intermediate materials of the PPI are largely construction materials, which are   being pressured by a very, very tight housing market The nonresidential markets, as you all   know, are weakening Indeed, some company reports show orders for construction   equipment falling off; and even in the data on residential markets that we get from the   National Association of Homebuilders, a sample of large homebuilders shows a significant   weakening in home sales in July I would be a little careful translating that into starts     8/24/99 75   because, as several here have mentioned, there is a very serious inventory problem of new   homes Demand has to fall a lot before it begins to affect the starts figure significantly   One element that nobody has discussed--I’m not sure how important it is but it could   become so--is owner-equivalent rent As you know, it has been in the CPI at one-tenth of a   percent per month for quite some time Some statistical techniques that we’ve employed,   which endeavor to extract near-term signals from that BLS procedure of using a six-month   moving average, suggest that that figure may move up from 01 to something like 03 in the   August CPI That wouldn’t be very important except that it is one-fifth of the total CPI   But it is a much smaller fraction of the PCE So, while it may have an impact on the CPI if   indeed our statistical procedures are accurate, it will have a very much more subdued effect   on the PCE price index   The bottom line on all of this, however, is really the question of wages and wage costs   and unit labor costs generally We’ve all commented on the ECI and average hourly   earnings I think the ECI may be stronger than is shown in the Greenbook, but it certainly is   still below the rate of change of a year ago The average hourly earnings figure, which in   July was 05 on the basis of data supplied to us by the BLS, suggests that some of that   increase reflected changes in the mix and that the fixed weight structure of wages probably   rose less than that But, fundamentally, the crucial issue is not what is happening to average   hourly compensation I suspect that neither the average hourly earnings measure nor the   ECI is as useful as the aggregative data on employment costs per hour Even though the   latter measure is a dubious statistical calculation, it probably is more representative of   reality because it takes into account all of the secondary sources of labor costs So the   annual rate of increase of a little over 4 percent that we’ve seen in that statistic is probably   the best estimate, in today’s context, of the real rate of wage increase That gets us down to   the question of what is happening to productivity   From the data I look at, I find no evidence yet that the increase in the rate of growth of   productivity has slowed at all To be sure, the official published data for the second quarter,   which showed productivity growth of 13 percent and will be revised to below 1 percent,   would suggest a very significant slowing The problem is that about 2 percentage points of   that number reflects the change in the statistical discrepancy And that published second-  quarter number is not in any way consistent with what we know is going on out in the real     8/24/99 76   world--namely, that while there may be some evidence of firming in prices, there is little   evidence of corporate pricing power I must say that the anecdotal reports I hear from   people to whom I talk--even though they do bring up the point of the lesser discounts-­  suggest no really significant change in pricing power on the part of companies If that is   indeed the case and if operating domestic profit margins rose in the second quarter--we   don’t have official data on that as yet but the evidence points to an increase, judging from all   the individual company reports we see--certain algebraic conclusions follow Algebraically   a stable price level and rising operating profit margins necessitate a decline in the rate of   change in unit costs Since labor costs are 70 percent of unit costs and the indications in the   nonlabor cost area suggest only modest declines, it necessarily follows that the rate of   increase in unit labor costs declined in the second quarter And indeed that is precisely what   shows up on the income side in an evaluation of costs and prices As I’ve indicated   previously, when we look at the nonfarm business sector from the income side, we estimate   that over the last four quarters unit costs rose less than ½ percent Unit labor costs were up   about ¾ percent The growth rate of income, of course, was also significantly stronger than   the growth rate of product-based GDP   I will grant that there are lots of arguments about what that statistical discrepancy is   showing, but leaving that aside, I would say that we don’t even need to look at any of these   data on the product or income side We can infer a decline in unit labor costs wholly   independently of those data And no matter what data we use on average hourly   compensation, whether it’s average hourly earnings, the ECI, or the compensation data, we   still get rising increases in output per hour The figures in the data that we are looking at   from the income side show productivity growth over the four quarters ending in the second   quarter of around 3½ percent I might add that the difference between the 3½ percent and   the 43 percent in compensation per hour is indeed a unit labor cost increase of ¾ percent   The point that I’m trying to make here is that we don’t have any real evidence that   inflation has risen Indeed, we are still looking at declining rates of increase in unit costs   And if profit margins are rising, that basically says that some of the increase in prices or the   lack of decline in prices has to be reflected in widening profit margins So there is still a   gap there In other words, the inflationary pressure is not there Now, I don’t deny that if   we proceed with the product-based GDP numbers and project a stable productivity growth     8/24/99 77   rate, that will produce an acceleration in the CPI growth rate There is no algebraically   conceivable alternative to that But that is begging the question, because unless and until we   see some slowdown in productivity growth, then the argument that inflation is about to bite   us is not credible   I do not deny, as I’ve said previously, that the growth of output per hour is going to   slow down, but I don’t know when There is no evidence of that yet, and there is no   reasonable upper limit in the near term The crucial point here is that we became so used to   a 1 percent increase in productivity growth over a very long period of time--from the ’80s   into the ’90s--that we have looked at the gap between potential and actual as entirely a   demand-side phenomenon Certainly the demographics haven’t changed that much And if   we have stable demographics--say, a little more than 1 percent growth in the working-age   population including immigration--and a 1 percent trend productivity growth rate, then   potential is a little over 2 percent And if that does not change, our evaluation of inflation   can ignore the supply side and look at the demand side, which is what we typically do and   why we argue in terms of an overheating economy But now we have the supply side   moving, and the question of whether the economy is overheating and inflationary pressures   are mounting cannot be strictly an issue of what is happening on the demand side That’s   because if productivity is accelerating, of necessity it has to be balanced in some manner, as   I said last time, by very high expenditures for motor vehicles, housing, construction--big   everything--unless we get a big statistical discrepancy--bigger than the one we’re looking at   now   The truth of the matter is that we have a very strong economy with very marginal   indications of any slowing But the question that is still up in the air is whether, in fact, it is   an overheating economy An important element of that, obviously, is what is going on in   the supply and demand for labor There is no question that the pool of people seeking jobs   is continuing to erode We continue to see shrinkage in the number of those who are   working part-time, so we are seeing ever increasing hours But the rate of decline in the   pool of job-seeking people who haven’t gotten a job has itself been slowing We know the   gap between potential and real output is in the area of less than ½ percent without claiming   any knowledge of what the actual potential is because we don’t need to know that All we   need to know is the difference     8/24/99 78   What I’m suggesting is that we still should be looking for the answer to the question of   “Where is the inflation?” It is not showing up anywhere in the basic price data, at least that   I can tell And the people out in the business world with whom I talk, and it’s a fairly   extensive group, keep complaining about their inability to raise prices I do think that wages   will continue to increase if productivity growth continues to rise But since this would mean   that unit labor costs would be little changed, that won’t be a source of price pressures   In any event, having said all of that, so far as the domestic side is concerned I think the   availability of resources is very tight Inflation is clearly prone to acceleration should the   increase in the growth of productivity slow or even stabilize That hasn’t happened yet as   far as I can tell   Finally, let me say something about the international side, which is an issue a number   of you have raised I think something ominous is going on It’s not the economics; it is the   politics The Vice Chair mentioned that, as did President Jordan The situation in   is deteriorating I don’t mean the economics On the contrary, the economics look   fairly good, especially in But the economics are a lagging indicator Mr   political strength has deteriorated very dramatically As I recall, his approval ratings went   down and he is being largely abandoned by a   number of his strong supporters It is very difficult to know what is going on in    The situation is technically better, but the politics there are just as   bad The long-lasting is obviously coming to an end   at the close of this particular session, because none of the candidates shows any signs of   becoming that type of president So there is a possibility that we could be confronted with a   crisis that ironically could create another period of strength in the dollar as fears of the   international political situation and other concerns emerge The flight to the dollar would   resume I think one of the things we have learned, to our chagrin, is that the hardest thing to   forecast is the American exchange rate I know how much effort Karen Johnson and her   people have put into it, and theirs is the most sophisticated analytical process you will ever   see And I can’t say that the result is all that impressive [Laughter] So if she can’t do it, I   don’t think any of us ought to consider ourselves to be in a position to do it   My bottom line is that I think we have to tighten by 25 basis points I would argue   that we should make that move and stay with symmetry, as I think Don Kohn mentioned If     8/24/99 79   it turns out that we have to move again in October, symmetry does not preclude us from   doing so But we ought to be careful in the wording of our press statement, if we go in that   direction, not to construct an “asymmetric” symmetric directive, which we consciously and   purposefully did the last time and for good reason I would argue that that is probably not   the desirable thing to do at this point I have gone on far longer than I anticipated Who   would like to speak next?  Vice Chairman    President Minehan    President Poole     8/24/99 80    President McTeer    President Boehne    Governor Gramlich    Governor Ferguson    President Stern    President Moskow    President Parry    President Hoenig    Governor Meyer    President Guynn    Governor Kelley     8/24/99 84    President Broaddus    President Jordan    We have a consensus on “C” symmetric, 25 basis   points Would you read the appropriate language?    Call the roll    Would someone like to move approval of the minutes for   the meeting of August 24th?    Without objection, they are approved Mr Fisher    Thank you Questions for Peter?  President Broaddus    President Minehan    Concerning the issue of liquidity, is “flood insurance” the   appropriate language?  [Laughter]    Further questions for Peter?  If not, who would like to move   approval?    Yes, I forgot to mention that The very substantial majority   agreed with President Poole on moving the sentence Are you all familiar with what I’m referring   to?  The only question on the table is not whether we want to do it but if we should do it now or as   part of the Ferguson report I would prefer to wait    Let’s wait and do it then     Okay, we’re done! Let’s go to lunch    END OF MEETING        Without objection they are approved Shall we move to the   staff reports of Mr Prell and Ms Johnson?    Questions? President McTeer    President Parry    President Poole    President Stern    Are there any further questions for either of our colleagues?   If not, would somebody like to start the general discussion? President Broaddus    President Minehan    President Parry    President Guynn    President Boehne    Does that mean the price is coming down?    President Moskow    President Hoenig    President Jordan    President McTeer    President Stern    President Poole    Vice Chair    Governor Ferguson    Governor Gramlich    Governor Kelley    Governor Meyer    I believe coffee is ready Let’s break for coffee   [Coffee break]    Mr Kohn    Questions for Don?  President Jordan    Any further questions for Don?  If not, let me get started   We have a very difficult set of issues to evaluate The reason relates largely to what I see as   growing evidence that the models with which we have been trying to explain how the American   economy functions are becoming increasingly obsolete It is not that the econometric structure of   the models is inappropriate, but certain simple assumptions are made in their structure that are   driving the results we observe and are creating at least the presumption that we are missing   something important   Let me just say very simply--this is really a repetition of what I’ve been saying in the past-­  that we have all been brought up to a greater or lesser extent on the presumption that the supply   side is a very stable force The assumption has been that the working-age population is increasing   at a fairly predictable rate and that trend productivity is growing at a fairly stable one percent   annual rate So, the presumption has been that we could look at the supply side as an independent   variable in the complex interaction of our equations That presumption generally has been not   challenged largely because it has worked But what people around the table have been saying is   that third-quarter growth has rebounded quite substantially And indeed it has So has productivity   growth     10/5/99 47   In my judgment our models fail to account appropriately for the interaction between the   supply side and the demand side largely because historically it has not been necessary for them to   do so A crucial variable in our models is trend productivity growth, and the conventional   procedure in our quarterly forecasts is to specify a constant trend rate of productivity growth Yet,   our official figures indicate that the growth in productivity has been moving up at an annual rate of   around ½ percent each year since early 1997 On top of that, the review of 1995 to 1997 in   retrospect is adding another 03 percentage point to the annual rate of growth in the most recent   years So what we have, in effect, is a set of trend productivity values whose second derivative has   been positive   We have two choices We can either project a continuation of the positive second   derivative for productivity, or we can assume that the second derivative goes to zero and we will   have a flat productivity growth rate   You may say that there are arguments for both And indeed, as I will make a case in a   moment, there are But we have chosen the second automatically As a result, we--as well as   everyone who has the same structural model--have created a necessary outcome because of the   algebra of our models It is algebraically necessary for such models to project a rise in inflation if   they incorporate a constant rate of growth in productivity and we have a very low unemployment   rate, which presumably creates some pressure for wages to increase more rapidly than the trend   productivity rate I will stipulate that that is exactly the situation we are looking at and one that has   always been associated with rising inflation   What is the case for automatically assuming that the second derivative of productivity goes   to zero? Certainly the most recent productivity data--whether we are looking at growth rates   calculated on a four-quarter moving average basis, a two-quarter basis, or any other basis we want   to use--do not confirm that assumption because all those data indicate that the rate of growth in   productivity has been rising Then the question is why this happens When we engage in growth   accounting analysis in an effort to get to the bottom of this, we find, as Governor Ferguson said,   that there has been a very significant increase in capital deepening That means, in effect, that we   are getting very substantial acceleration in the growth of the stock of capital--or, to be more   precise, capital services In addition, we clearly are getting evidence of acceleration in multifactor   productivity, the residual in growth accounting, which is another way of saying that the synergies   of productivity-enhancing investments are coming together and in the process are creating an   acceleration in productivity What this implies, if it is true, is that we should be seeing a fairly     10/5/99 48   marked upswing in profit margins or, another way of looking at it, in the ratio of profits to   compensation or to a variety of other measures that productivity may spill into such as real wages   I have raised the issue before as a hypothesis, and I think the anecdotal evidence as well as   the data are increasingly supportive That is, there appears to be as a consequence of productivity   gains a very marked and at the moment persistent rise in expected rates of return on new plant and   equipment We can get that from a number of different calculations We can get it from one of the   calculations I like to use, which is a rough endeavor to weight changes in productivity and in   capacity--the two major elements toward which capital expenditures are directed We try to infer   using some simplifying assumptions what part of the increase in productivity that we observe plus   the increase in capacity is attributable to a specific year’s capital investment When we do that we   find, not unexpectedly, a very significant acceleration in the rate of return for each recent year’s   capital investment I don’t want to get into the embodied technology problems, which are tricky   here, but the most revealing indication that the rates of return are very high and rising is to observe   the behavior of capital investment It simply is not credible that we could be getting the type of   boom in capital investment that we are observing, and one that is accelerating, if the plant   managers who are in fact initiating these investments have not been getting the returns that they   expected   We also see, as I have mentioned previously, a fairly continuous upward revision on the   part of security analysts of their long-term forecasts for earnings The last observation we have is   for the month of September, and this number is at a record high It is continuing to rise I’m not   saying that these forecasts are any good as far as earnings projections are concerned Indeed,   they’re awful They are biased on the upside, as they are made by people who are getting paid   largely to project rising earnings in order to sell stocks, which is the business of the people who   employ them But the question really is how much the bias has changed over the relatively short   period of time in which there has been this dramatic acceleration of the rate of return in all the   measures, starting in 1995 After talking to a lot of these analysts, the answer as far as I’m   concerned is that corporate executives, from whom they get the information they use for projecting   the earnings of the individual companies, are telling them that they are consistently lowering their   costs And the way they lower their costs is essentially through labor-displacing capital   investment They don’t use the term “labor-displacing;” they use “cost” But as we know, on a   consolidated basis, 70 percent of cost is labor And if we are getting an increasing amount of labor-  displacing investment, by definition we are getting an increase in output per hour If we are getting     10/5/99 49   an increase in output per hour, we also are getting an increase in real income And if we are getting   an increase in real income, we are going to get an increase in personal consumption expenditures   Indeed, if we look at the whole pattern that is involved, there’s a very interesting question   of when structural productivity growth is going to be adequate to offset the growth that is occurring   on the demand side I would argue that we may be asking the wrong question, because it may well   be that it’s the productivity acceleration that is engendering the growth on the demand side, directly   and indirectly--directly obviously through income and indirectly through the increase in capital   asset values  That is, leaving aside the question of price-earnings ratios and whether there is a   bubble, there is no question that a significant part of the increase in the market value of equities and   other assets reflects the fact that productivity has accelerated   If we look at a breakdown of the supply side of the economy, what we end up with is that   the total change in GDP is algebraically equal to structural productivity growth plus the growth in   the labor force or the working age population or some similar measure And leaving aside a   number of minor issues such as average hours and statistical discrepancies--which are not   unimportant--we find that the measure of the difference between the change in GDP and the sum of   labor force growth plus structural productivity growth is effectively some measure of changing   unemployment And declining unemployment is very likely the consequence of the wealth effect,   which is boosting consumption over and above what is normally expected of PCE out of income   Whether in current circumstances it will be possible to offset the increase in demand on the   cost side, I think, is the wrong question to ask That’s because it is by no means evident that the   current expansion is going to slow at all The reason is that if productivity is continuing to   accelerate and we put that into our econometric model, we are not going to get a slowdown in   economic activity We are going to get motor vehicle sales possibly of 20 million at an annual rate   instead of, say, 17 million We are going to get housing starts of, say, 2 million and not 15 million   because gross domestic income and gross domestic product--leaving out the discrepancy, as I have   indicated previously--have to balance   The reason I raise this question is that we are seeing a remarkable acceleration in economic   activity now, which under our old regime where the supply side is relatively stable would lead us to   say that this expansion is getting dramatically out of hand But let us turn the thing around by   supposing that instead of putting a flat productivity growth path into our models we put in a   positive second derivative That would mean that productivity growth would continue to increase   I submit to you that if we do that and it happens, we are not going to get a slowdown in economic     10/5/99 50   activity We will come to the next meeting and say that the markets are going berserk and that   there is a consumer binge in progress Indeed, that is what has to happen The key question we   have to ask ourselves is whether this is an overheated economy Is it unsustainable and do we need   to apply the brakes?  I think the answer at this stage is that we don’t really know for sure   If I were doing a forecast, I could make the case as to why I might put in a non-zero second   derivative for structural productivity--just leave it there, run our projection, and then discuss it Or   I might do precisely the opposite, which is what Mike Prell and his colleagues have done, and keep   the structural productivity growth rate flat and discuss that I will submit to you that neither case is   easy to make and that there is evidence to support both cases, as I think Mike Kelley has indicated   The presumption that, logically and necessarily, the only choice we can make at this stage is to use   the flat productivity growth rate is unverifiable in my view As a consequence, I think it is   important for us to recognize that this is a very unusual period   It is extraordinary to have, as the forecast in the Greenbook, a trend productivity growth   rate that rises from an annual rate of about 1 percent to 23 percent when in effect we already have   nonfarm productivity rising in the last four quarters to a rate of 32 percent If we look at the   growth of GDP from the income side and use the household hours-worked data, which are then   consistent with the unemployment rate, we get a still faster acceleration in productivity The   reason why the unemployment rate has been stable at 42 percent or thereabouts at a time when our   productivity growth numbers have not looked all that significant relative to the rapid growth of   output is that we are measuring productivity with hours from the payroll survey But the payroll   survey numbers have been rising at an average of 50,000 to 70,000 people per month in excess of   the rise in the adjusted household data Average weekly hours look the same, meaning that the   growth in total hours from the payroll survey has been far more in the last two or three years after   being closely parallel to that of the household survey data As a consequence, if we did nothing but   look at the household data--the unemployment rate, the changes in employment, and the hours   data--we would end up with a far more rapid rise in productivity growth   So, I would say that the issue is not whether productivity can grow fast enough to keep pace   with demand growth We are dealing with a simultaneously structured economy in which the very   forces that are driving productivity--primarily technology--are boosting the income side and the   capital assets side, both of which are having an impact on the demand side I think it is essential   for us to recognize that we have this kind of interaction If we don’t, we very well could be looking     10/5/99 51   at a benign expansion on the demand side that is being fostered wholly by increased productivity   and wrongly view it as overheating   I am not saying that the evidence is completely consistent with the argument I have just   made Even with that argument, we still have a significant wealth effect, so that actual demand   growth is in excess of potential supply; but both are rising very rapidly All I can say is that at this   particular stage the number of workers who are seeking jobs is decreasing As that number shrinks,   real compensation per hour obviously will move well ahead of productivity at some point, in which   case inflation will take place So, even under my assumption that the second derivative is positive,   all that does is to prevent unit labor costs from rising for a while But at some point, that process   engenders greater growth in real compensation per hour than in productivity, which itself is   accelerating, and at the end of the day we end up with acceleration in prices The difference   between the two scenarios is that the time frames are dramatically different In one case we are   looking at acceleration in inflation almost immediately as we get into the year 2000, while the other   scenario delays the whole process--perhaps quite significantly Moreover, it may very well be, as I   think a number of us are expecting, that the wealth effect will finally simmer down because of the   existence of a bubble that can’t persist and that the two effects will converge and there will be no   inflationary imbalances   I didn’t mean to get into this long lecture, but after listening to what we’ve been talking   about I have the uncomfortable feeling that we are misreading the economic signals That said, let   me go on quickly to a couple of other issues   Two or three of you mentioned money supply growth As you know, if velocity is constant   the desired money supply growth for zero inflation should basically be the sum of the growth in the   civilian labor force, the growth in productivity, and the extent to which the CPI is biased upward   That comes out very approximately to an annual rate of about 5 percent That rate is not all that far   from where we are, especially after adjusting for Y2K So, looking at policy from the money   supply side, I’m not terribly certain that we are very far off You will recall that the annual ranges   selected are based on a 1 percent productivity growth trend We decided not to put in an allowance   for higher productivity and I think advisedly so But let’s not fool ourselves as to the fact that   normal money supply growth is affected by the rate of growth in productivity   Finally, let me just say that there are a number of things that we can spot to know that the   economic process is running into trouble For example, if we see domestic operating profit   margins begin to flatten out or decline--after adjustment for IVA, I might add--we would know that     10/5/99 52   productivity growth is no longer accelerating and that would be a signal that something is going   wrong That would mean the second derivative is no longer positive, or we are getting down to the   bottom of the employment barrel where real compensation per hour begins to move well ahead of   even accelerating productivity growth We see nothing of that sort at the moment Growth in total   unit costs is still declining Growth in unit labor costs is still declining We have productivity   growth data through the second quarter for the total and through August for manufacturing The   latter is not a forecast; the industrial production and hours data that we already have now show that   productivity is up quite sharply   I submit that we have a very complex set of problems to deal with, and we have to exercise   a bit of humility in looking at the models we are employing to reflect reality, as a number of you   have said Because we have used a zero second derivative for productivity in every forecast, we   have underestimated real economic growth and overestimated inflation A lot of you have   mentioned that I submit that we are doing it again That does not mean it’s the wrong thing to do,   but I do wish to suggest that there is an alternative assumption The difference is whether you   consider the first derivative to be positive and constant or you wish to add a second derivative that   is also positive I am saying that the most recent trend would argue in favor of the second   alternative, which is just an extrapolation of what has been occurring The question is whether that   assumption is valid   I come to the basic conclusion that we really don’t know at this stage We do know, as Jack   Guynn mentioned, that a lot of people in the technology area are saying that we are only at the   beginning of a big productivity growth process That’s probably true, but it doesn’t tell us much   about the outlook for actual productivity growth over the projection period If, for example, as   Lew Gerstner of IBM has suggested, we are a third of the way through the investment in   unexploited technology, we still have two-thirds to go It is quite possible that the one-third has   been moving at a very fast pace and that the two-thirds will move at a much slower pace Under   those conditions productivity growth will fall, even though the level of productivity itself continues   to rise We can’t simply argue that innovation has a long way to go and conclude that productivity   growth will either stay up where it is or go higher in this period That’s a non sequitur It depends   entirely on the time horizon over which that remaining two-thirds of innovation is exploited   Having gone on far longer than I had anticipated, let me just get to what I hope is the   bottom line My own judgment is that having done 50 basis points and having seen a very   significant rise in corporate bond yields--as you know they are up significantly more than     10/5/99 53   Treasuries--I think we ought to wait at this point to see what happens as a consequence of that rise   Nonetheless, if we do vote for “B,” I would prefer not to give a message that we are necessarily   through for the year I think it would be a mistake in the current context to leave the presumption   in the marketplace that the Federal Reserve is quiescent and is not concerned about what may   emerge over the balance of the year Consequently, I would favor asymmetry, and I would have no   difficulty with that if we were still on our old regime where we just voted for asymmetry and   published our decision about six weeks later   In my view we have a secondary set of disclosure problems, which Don Kohn raised, that   are unrelated to the policy decision itself As I see it, we created a very difficult problem when we   started to announce our symmetry/asymmetry decision I wish we had not done it but, frankly, I   don’t know how to get out of it But if we are going to be fully forthcoming in our accountability   to Congress and to the electorate, we are going to do things that in hindsight we probably will wish   we had not done The answer is not to stop doing them We have to live with certain mistakes that   we make because they are irreversible I am not arguing that we should not have tried; I just regret   that we did not succeed   All this leaves us with a very tricky question If we agree to adopt asymmetry, we could   announce our decision in the usual manner That is, we would just announce it My preference,   which is not a big one I must say, would be to try to convey the same message in a press statement   as distinct from indicating very specifically that we are asymmetric In a sense that would amount   to publishing our consensus of where we think we are likely to be after the usual six- or seven-  week intermeeting period I don’t like the implication that we are committed in one direction In   fact, we never did say we were going to publish our asymmetry or symmetry decision after every   meeting All we said was that we would convey information about important changes in our   thinking We can convey that sort of information, probably in a more sensitive manner, in the   language of a press statement Therefore, I would prefer, if we adopt “B” asymmetric, that we   convey the asymmetry in a statement rather than in a direct announcement of its adoption, which   has all sorts of bells and whistles associated with it   There is an alternative, which would involve announcing that we have decided to put the   issue of symmetry and asymmetry aside pending the outcome of the Ferguson subcommittee’s   evaluation and recommendations That essentially would say that we are not going to incorporate   any reference to symmetry in our directives for a while That’s a possibility and members of the   Committee may find that useful Frankly, I find none of the three alternatives ideal The ideal     10/5/99 54   would be for us to have stayed where we were, but we are beyond that now and I don’t think we   have the choice of going back   So, I have two recommendations to put on the table One is my hope that we can at this   stage put our policy on hold for a while With Y2K apparently coming under some control, even   though I am wondering about the inventory data, I don’t see a problem should we decide to move   in November I do think we would have a problem in December, but I believe the November   window is still open If we conclude then, after looking at the substantial amount of data we will   be getting in the interim, that a further advance would be appropriate in November, I see no reason   why we can’t move at that time I don’t think our policy stance is far from where we want it to be   I don’t think we are behind the curve My impression is that the markets have interpreted our   policy moves as preemptive and regard us as credible I don’t think we are on the edge of a major   breakout of inflation I see that as the most non-credible prospect at this point A price erosion on   the upside is definitely possible, but not one that occurs rapidly The more likely thing that may   happen, if something happens abruptly, is in the other direction The stock market could crash and,   as the wealth effect implodes, we actually could end up eventually moving in the other direction   At any rate, I would like to put “B” asymmetric on the table and request some views on   how we should proceed with regard to making our decision public If we choose an asymmetric   directive, our alternatives would seem to be (1) issuing a statement with no reference to   symmetry; (2) explicitly announcing that we went asymmetric; or (3) temporarily removing the   symmetry question from our directive and announcing that we are doing that pending what we will   decide after the Ferguson subcommittee completes its work Vice Chair    Governor Meyer    Governor Ferguson    Third derivative! [Laughter] President Jordan    President Poole    President Boehne    President Broaddus    Governor Gramlich    And announcing or publishing it?    President Moskow    President Parry    President McTeer    Between words or announcing the decision on asymmetry,   which would you choose?  I’m trying to get a sense of where everyone is to formulate a proposal   for the vote You seemed to imply that of the three variations, the least desirable is to publish the   asymmetry A second option would be to have asymmetry and not publish it, just use words to   describe it The first is what you’re opposed to?    I’m not sure there’s a majority for that position at this stage    Touché! President Hoenig    President Stern    Governor Kelley    President Minehan    President Guynn    This has been an interesting discussion I must admit, as I   said earlier, that I would have preferred to go asymmetric and put out a press release but not   announce our decision with regard to the asymmetry But I find the arguments in the other   direction actually quite convincing    I am now inclined to announce the asymmetry The current   members preferred that option by a 5 to 4 margin, but if we include those who are not currently   members of the Committee, there is a very clear majority in favor of announcing the asymmetry   On an issue such as this, which commits the Committee in a broader sense, I believe we should   take into consideration the views of the nonvoting members even if that is not legally required So   what we will vote on at this point is “B” asymmetric with the understanding that we will publish   our decision Would you read the directive language?    Call the roll    We have a draft statement, which I’d like to circulate so   everyone can take a look at it instead of my reading it I can read it but I think it would be helpful   for you to have the text in front of you I’ll wait until it’s distributed [Pause] Does anybody have   any comments?    One of the things that I’d like to ask of the Ferguson working   group is whether it can perhaps expedite its report if possible  You had a long discussion--   If you can report to the Committee at the beginning of the   November meeting, we could fold that into our deliberations I think it would be quite useful if we   could address that particular issue soon because we’ve got to resolve it While looking forward to   March seemed to be desirable because it would give us a lot of time and flexibility, it’s turning out   that we’re struggling with this at each and every meeting So the sooner we can come to a   resolution, I suspect the better    Strangely enough, as a consequence of President   McDonough’s remarks, I put in additional words here to emphasize that the key question is   inflation and its potential for undermining the impressive performance of the economy    Well, what we can do is to say that we need to be especially   alert in the months ahead to potential cost increases that could lead to inflation pressures   SEVERAL I like that    Why don’t we do this “In these circumstances, the Federal   Open Market Committee will need to be especially alert in the months ahead to the potential for   cost increases significantly in excess of productivity in a manner that could contribute to inflation   pressures and undermine the impressive performance of the economy”     10/5/99 71    For everybody’s benefit, I am not of the opinion that writing   a press release by committee is the most productive way of doing it, but this is a crucial one Let   me just reread it to be sure that everyone feels comfortable “The Federal Open Market Committee   decided today to leave its target for the federal funds rate unchanged” That’s very straightforward   “Strengthening productivity growth has been fostering favorable trends in unit costs and   prices, and much recent information suggests that these trends have been sustained Nonetheless,   the growth in demand has continued to outpace that of supply, as evidenced by a decrease in the   pool of available workers willing to take jobs” We’re not saying that’s the cause of it; that’s   merely a measure of it “In these circumstances, the Federal Open Market Committee will need to   be especially alert in the months ahead to the potential for cost increases significantly in excess of   productivity in a manner that could contribute to inflation pressures and undermine the impressive   performance of the economy” Okay?   SPEAKER(?) That’s fine!    “The potential for cost increases” Plural    You want to take out the reference to productivity?    SEVERAL(?) No, no     Okay, fine Sold! Our next meeting is November 16th     Would somebody like to move the minutes for the October   5th meeting?    Without objection Peter Fisher    Would you give us a hypothetical scenario of what   would happen if a very substantial number of these options were exercised on a single day,   triggered obviously by some bank?  How would you arrange to meet that?  What would you do?    And the amounts we are likely to be dealing with are   well within your capacity, as best you can judge?    I assume that in the turmoil of that sort of market   the issue of draining the reserves is not all that immediately urgent    Other questions for Peter?    Other questions for Peter? If not, we need a motion to   approve the domestic transactions    A draft press statement is being distributed so that we   can all look at it   As we agreed last time, it’s very difficult for us to write communiqués in these   meetings Experience with the G-7 and other groups, as I’ve told you before, suggests that if we   take the writing of our statement overly seriously, we’re going to end up with two-thirds of our   meeting spent on that task So, while I’m acutely aware that there are phrases or sentences and   perhaps even some substance that each of you might modify slightly, I would appreciate it if   comments for any changes were limited to only those parts you find really unacceptable [Pause]   Has everyone finished reading the text? Okay, President McTeer    That is the limit of how far it could go [Laughter]    Let me put it this way We’ve said this a number of   times in the past, and this is essentially the language we’ve used So we don’t want to convey   something over and above what I think has been said previously on this issue Governor Meyer    President Poole    President Hoenig    Vice Chair    President Broaddus    President Boehne     11/16/99 58    President Minehan    Governor Kelley    Governor Ferguson    President Moskow    President Stern    Let’s continue to go around I have some suggestions   on how to resolve this issue    First, let me just say that I think the second paragraph is   essential because it’s trying to convey a recognition that on the one hand the economy is showing   at least some signs of slowing but that on the other hand the pool of available workers is being   drawn down And that is the measure of the gap between supply and demand It’s the best   measure we have and that’s what we’re hanging on    Well, an unsustainable trend is contained    Oh no, the market is Market forces--   Well, I’m not worried about any comparison with my   speeches Does anyone else want to comment before I make this great recommendation?  I think   there’s a legitimate question about the third paragraph because it’s a substantive issue  The rest   of the comments, I think, were more analytical The alternative is to go back to something   similar to our August release with some mild editing My suggested language would read as   follows “Today’s increase in the federal funds rate, together with the policy actions in June and   August and the firming of conditions more generally in US financial markets over recent   months, should markedly diminish the risk of inflation going forward As a consequence, the     11/16/99 61   directive the Federal Open Market Committee adopted is symmetrical with regard to the outlook   for policy over the near term”   SEVERAL That’s better    No, it’s the real interest rate issue that I think is   relevant Listening to our discussion, that strikes me as an adequate solution to the problem So   why don’t we do that?    Certainly    I think that’s a reasonable suggestion Okay, why don’t   we substitute that rewording for the third paragraph?  Is that satisfactory to everybody?  Not   really! Let me put it this way By definition it can’t be satisfactory to everybody, but we   shouldn’t care [Laughter]    The Board of Governors is going to take a short recess   and vote on a discount rate change Luncheon is available When we’re finished we’ll come   back into session The FOMC meeting will continue because Roger Ferguson has distributed a   memo on disclosure issues for us to consider We’re obviously not going to complete our   discussion of this topic today, but I think it’s not a bad idea to spend a little time on it   Remember, we’re assuming that we’re not going to make any policy moves in December, so the   resolution of the disclosure issues is really not necessary at this time But it is probably   worthwhile to try to make some progress in resolving them     11/16/99 62   [Lunch recess]    You know what I think would be useful?  You have   seven members on the Working Group?    Since you’ve all thought about this, it might be helpful   to hear from the individual members about the reasons why they came to the views that they did    Or balanced    Bill, I’m not a member of the Working Group and I   wasn’t in on the deliberations, but I have the suspicion that one can figure out how all this   happened None of us likes the words “symmetry” or “asymmetry” so, therefore, people start to   think about what can we do in lieu of it And we end up with symmetry/asymmetry, [laughter]   or in this case, asymmetry/symmetry What this comes down to is merely a choice of words,   which convey the same notion The issue basically is whether we want to have a soft statement,   which is a recognition in my judgment of the fact that we really don’t know what our next move   will be, or whether we feel sufficiently confident to have a forecast of what we are going to do   First of all, the differences between these two alternatives are not that big The only issue I see   here is that if we decide on alternative I, at a later date we can go to II If we decide on   alternative II, we can’t go back    I would be a little concerned about that because in a   crazy way our experience over the last number of years is that we seemingly have understood   what was going on in the economy We may not have understood it as well as we would have     11/16/99 70   liked, but we didn’t make any major blunders in policy We really were never far behind the   curve We really were never in a position where we were forecasting recessions that did not   happen or vice versa But that has not been the experience over the decades And I’m concerned   that we may have the impression that we’re better than we are in fact I think having our finger   off the trigger or a bit removed from the trigger, as Ned put it, is a measure of humility And as   Larry pointed out, the markets will read it anyway I think that’s probably right So I think the   only question is whether we put more burden on them to be certain and less on ourselves I   myself would prefer alternative I, but the arguments Larry made are very formidable arguments,   I think    Does it actually say “in consultation with the Federal   Reserve Bank of New York”?    Does it say the Federal Reserve Bank of New York?    We can’t have that because we vote on that every year    This would be voted on after we decide which Reserve   Bank will execute transactions for the System Open Market Account    We got a lot more done on this than I expected There   are no other items on the agenda except to confirm the date of the next meeting, which is   Tuesday, the 21st of December   END OF MEETING        Without objection, they are approved Let’s move on   to Mike Prell    I just looked and the tape is delayed    This gadget is very slow [Laughter] Let’s turn now   to Karen Johnson    Questions?    Other questions?    President Minehan    Potential is rising largely because of productivity    It is not a labor force phenomenon    Further questions for our colleagues?  I want you to   understand that this is a record low number of questions! The Vice Chair predicts that you will   catch up later Who would like to start the Committee discussion? President Jordan    President Minehan     11/16/99 19    President McTeer    President Parry    President Moskow    President Broaddus    President Hoenig    President Guynn    President Stern    Vice Chair    President Poole    Governor Gramlich    Governor Ferguson    Governor Meyer    I wish to note that our governor is literally a one-  handed economist [Laughter] Governor Kelley    President Boehne    We have just created another record We are on time   for coffee   [Coffee break]    Let’s turn to Don Kohn for his report    Questions for Don?  If not, let me get started Some   very interesting questions are being raised around this table today and around a lot of other tables   where I have participated in discussions during the last month or two What is coming across is   a quite remarkable divergence of opinions For example, those around this table are, as a group,   much more concerned about upside inflationary pressures; and I must say that I’m more   comfortable being here than elsewhere But when you sit around the Business Council table,   they will tell you that their pricing power is nonexistent, that their ability to offset cost increases   has no limit, that their margins are in reasonably good shape, and that there just is no evidence of   the inflationary pressures that a lot of us are talking about The Business Round Table members   gave me the same story The question is why people who are looking at the same elephant are   viewing it in quite dramatically different ways I believe the reason is that there is something   fundamentally important going on in the economy, and how one evaluates it is critical as to how   one comes out in the end with respect to policy   My bottom line for today, frankly, is that the benefits of moving outweigh those of   standing pat However, I think the issue is very complex First, on the side of those who are less   inclined to move, there is growing evidence that interest-sensitive areas of the economy are   beginning to slow, at least at the margin Motor vehicles, which are a very big industry in a lot   of areas around the country, were quite soft in October, and the Chairman of General Motors said   to me that he views the market for motor vehicles as really quite weak The calls that we made     11/16/99 46   to industry contacts concerning November sales indicate very little change from the October   data So, as far as the first half of the month is concerned, there has been no evident rebound I   don’t know whether you’ve picked up the same thing, President Moskow, but that’s what our   sources tell us   The housing market is a little more difficult to assess We all have seen a significant   decline from the peak in starts and in sales The obvious cause is the increase in mortgage rates,   though they have backed off their recent highs This afternoon the National Association of   Homebuilders is going to put out their early November survey of builders; their numbers show   some bounce-back in housing sales currently and over the next six months Conversely, a   private survey of the larger builders that the National Association of Homebuilders has made   available to us shows that sales remained weak in October We know that the official numbers   for September were down sharply--and probably in a certain sense a little noncredibly, since   markets don’t move as sharply as those numbers suggest Nonetheless, I think it is safe to argue   that some general softening is occurring in the interest-sensitive areas of the economy That’s not   saying they could not rebound A rebound has happened before, and I think we have to wait and   see what materializes   On the productivity side, the data if anything continue to be strongly supportive of   increasing rates of productivity gains This morning’s industrial production index for the month   of October, when put into productivity terms and extrapolated for the rest of the quarter,   engenders a quarterly output per hour growth figure of 76 percent at an annual rate Two of the   months for the quarter are forecasts, but the level in October is already high   I think all of you have seen the note distributed by Larry Slifman on the productivity   data updated through the third quarter We do not as yet have all the details because Commerce   has not put together the detailed tables that we need for the full compilation of numbers that we   usually send out Nonetheless, it’s quite interesting that on the product side the official number   for nonfarm business productivity was up 29 percent in the third quarter from the third quarter   of last year That’s obviously a significant acceleration From the income side, reflecting the   sharp widening in the statistical discrepancy over the last year, the number for the increase in   productivity is 42 percent, year-over-year In addition, if we recognize that the conceptually   consistent denominator in the calculation of business productivity should be the work hours   reported in the household survey instead of the establishment survey, the 42 percent number     11/16/99 47   from the income side moves up to 44 percent We need to keep in mind that the household   survey of hours worked is the only one that’s truly internally consistent with the unemployment   rate This distinction is quite important currently because, as I indicated at the last meeting, we   have a difference in excess of 50,000 a month in the changes indicated by the conceptually   identical definitions of household nonfarm business versus payroll employment As a result we   are getting quite different estimates of productivity The official data indicate a 29 percent   increase over the four quarters, but if we use the same conceptual framework with a change in   both the numerator and the denominator, we end up with 44 percent So the choice that   Commerce makes is at the low end of a range whose upper limit is suggestive of far greater   acceleration   It’s really quite interesting to find that the escalation of productivity is far more   pronounced, in terms of its second derivative so to speak, if we use both the income side measure   of output and the household survey measure of hours to make the calculations over the past   several years--indeed, going back into the 1980s Just to give you a case in point, the estimate   using the income side and household hours data for the decade of the 1980s indicates a   productivity growth rate of only 11 percent For the period from the fourth quarter of 1997 to   the third quarter of 1999, the number is 4½ percent, up more than 4 times Cyclically adjusted,   that number is only marginally lower So something profoundly important has happened here   And the question is how that should be interpreted   One thing that is important to interpret is whether accelerating productivity engenders   a stable economic system The answer is, in fact, that it does not, and it’s in this regard that   accelerating productivity exerts upward pressure on real long-term rates The reason is that if we   get accelerating income-side or supply-side growth and the propensity to consume out of the   income engendered from that is unchanged, then arithmetically we end up with demand equal to   supply The unemployment rate does not change The associated inflation pressures are   nonexistent But there is a problem in the fact that if productivity is accelerating and if it is   presumed that the underlying cause of that acceleration will change the long-term outlook for   corporate earnings at any existing fixed discount rate, the expectation of higher earnings will   engender an increase in stock market wealth And of necessity if there is a wealth effect--and   there is some dispute about that between New York Bank and Board staff--we invariably will get     11/16/99 48   a decline in the propensity to save out of income So, we end up with the need to satisfy   aggregate demand in excess of domestic supply   We have been meeting that demand in two ways One is by increasing the share of   imports relative to total demand Because of the increased productivity and its root cause, the   uptrend in technology, we have had a much higher rate of expected earnings on new projects   Over the long run, the rise in expected earnings has been a major factor in facilitating the   widening of our current account deficit in that the latter has been readily financed, as one can tell   by the fact that the dollar hasn’t gone anywhere The net import-export balance, or the current   account if you want to put it that way, has recently been adding close to a full percentage point to   the aggregate supply available to satisfy domestic demand Second, we have seen a continued   decline in the pool of unemployed workers not currently seeking a job but saying they wish to   work Employers have been willing to hire these new workers even though their productivity is   somewhat less than the average The employment of these workers has added another ½   percentage point to GDP growth That source of labor together with higher imports is how the   gap between aggregate demand and aggregate supply has been closed statistically in the last   several years   Clearly, neither of those adjustment processes can continue As a consequence, what   we will be ending up with is demand exceeding supply or its equivalent, investment ex ante   exceeding saving ex ante The pressure to move investment and saving together induces a rise in   real long-term interest rates The rise in long-term interest rates has been quite significant until   very recently Rates on US Treasuries have risen somewhat less than a percentage point since   before the Asian crisis, but the spread on BBB-rated obligations versus Treasuries has widened   And judging from the rise in inflation rate expectations, and at this point I’m using the TIPS to   measure inflation expectations, there has been a very substantial rise in real BBB corporate   yields, which are close to the average yield that most corporations have to pay   I think the process of restraint clearly has begun to work, as the behavior of housing   and motor vehicles suggests The trouble is that the lags are invariably quite long, and we do not   know how much long-term rate tightening is required to bring supply and demand into balance   Since real rates have been rising for so long, the presumption is that the adjustment process has   been fairly well established and the fact that the stock market is unchanged over the last six   months is another indication that the pressure is there     11/16/99 49   The result of all of this is that we have a market that is adjusting to what is essentially   --I don’t know what the word should be--let’s call it an “unbalanced” expansion that is being   engendered by accelerating productivity The reason that this acceleration creates imbalances is   basically because of the wealth effect And to the extent that real long-term rates are rising, the   wealth effect increases are being neutralized or reduced and we are experiencing a slow   adjustment process toward an equilibrium or balance We have never seen anything like that   phenomenon in this century to the best of my knowledge It may have happened in the previous   century with the huge changes in technology that occurred a hundred and more years ago, but   data that would enable us to evaluate what was happening then are virtually nonexistent   The problem that I think we have in setting monetary policy is the relationship that   was raised in a previous meeting by Governor Gramlich, namely the relationship between short-  term real rates and long-term real rates As best I can tell, the gap between them at this point,   especially if we were to move the funds rate up another 25 basis points today, is not all that   large In other words, there is a slight upward tilt in the real yield curve but by no means one   that would suggest an inflationary imbalance that we would infer from a very steep yield curve   We don’t have such a curve at this point So I agree with the Vice Chair I don’t think we are   behind the curve, and I don’t think that the markets are saying that we are And indeed the   implication of the forward markets is that they anticipate only a very modest increase in rates on   our part, and they are looking at very much the same sort of evidence   The bottom line is that we really do not know how this system works It’s clearly   new The old models just are not working And the reasons they are not working are essentially   that we have a rapidly changing structure whose parameters are very difficult to estimate, and,   therefore, we have to depend in part on anecdotal information and in part on some sort of risk   evaluation At this particular stage, if I were convinced that the hourly earnings data we saw in   the last employment report--like that 27 percent rate of increase over the last three months--were   real and if we were in a position to move in December, I would say that we could take a chance   and wait until our December meeting But that 27 percent number as best I can judge is not real   because if we adjust it for mix, it turns out that the figure is not 27 percent; it’s 4 percent Now,   4 percent is not of great consequence when productivity is as strong as it is When we look at   total compensation per hour, the figures are closer to 5 percent, but unit labor costs are not   accelerating; indeed, they are declining     11/16/99 50   I do not think the issue of import prices per se is of huge consequence largely because   we can explain the disinflation wholly in terms of the gross product that originates internally   Import prices do have an effect on domestic prices but it is indirect I’m not saying that there is   no effect there I’m just saying it’s tough to evaluate I’m a little more concerned about the price   of oil Even though it’s clearly in the long-term interest of the major Gulf producers to keep the   price down so as to keep competition from other sources down, we need to remember that they   have very large oil reserves And it’s quite easy to demonstrate that it is not in their long-term   interest to allow the value of those reserves to decline, which is what they would do if there is a   sharp increase in the price of oil in the short run owing to the loss of market share The difficulty   is that the Gulf producers also have very severe fiscal and debt problems  There is always the   inclination for OPEC producers to agree that the price of West Texas Intermediate should decline   to, say, $18 a barrel and to agree that such a decline will happen eventually But isn’t it nice for   now to get $25 a barrel! The revenues are coming in The long run can wait until mañana And   indeed there is a serious potential problem here Even though the importance of oil in the US   economy has gone down quite significantly as the importance of energy more generally has gone   down as a share of the GDP, oil can still have a potentially quite destabilizing effect, especially   on consumer confidence   In conclusion, I think we have a lot of uncertainties at this stage and the bottom line is   that as long as we have a continuing decline in the total number of people who are unemployed,   including those not currently seeking a job, that is telling us that the growth of demand exceeds   the growth of supply That gap between the two has not been closing It has been open at this   level now for a quite significant period of time And while it showed early signs of narrowing   last year, it has reopened In my judgment, as long as we have this gap and we can’t move in   December, it is much too risky for us to stand pat at this time There are possibilities for all sorts   of problems when we move interest rates up, but I think the risks currently are less than usual I   would prefer to see somewhat greater anticipation of a tightening move in the financial markets,   but I don’t think it is all that critical a factor   As a consequence, let me just end by saying that I would like to put on the table a 25   basis point increase today and a symmetric directive The symmetry in this case is almost   automatic in the sense that we effectively are saying that we are not going to move in December   Indeed, short of a very significant set of surprises, it’s just not credible to me that we would risk     11/16/99 51   such commotion so close to the century date change Therefore, I would like your reactions to a   25 basis point move plus a shift to symmetry Vice Chair    President Boehne    President Jordan    President Broaddus     11/16/99 52    President Minehan    President Guynn    President Poole    President Stern    Governor Kelley    President Moskow    President Parry    President Hoenig    Governor Gramlich    Governor Meyer    Governor Ferguson    President McTeer    We have a consensus on 25 basis points and symmetry   Would you read the appropriate directive?    Call the roll please    Good morning, everyone Would somebody like to   move approval of the minutes for the November 16th meeting?    Without objection Peter Fisher, you wanted to   discuss the report of examination, I understand?    Is there any evidence of a surprising rise in standards   of living of key people involved?    Has somebody looked?    Were it an embezzlement, prior to what period would   it have occurred?    It could have been any time prior to that? Is there a   beginning point, other than 1914?    Other questions on this issue? Let us go forward to   your regular report    Questions for Peter?    I’m sorry We have not yet approved the   Examination Report of the System Open Market Account That requires a motion    Without objection President Minehan    Let us move on to consider the directive   language and disclosure policy Governor Ferguson, would you lead us as you have in the   past?     12/21/99 59    We can just break for lunch and continue the   discussion during lunch    Yes, on a matter like this, it’s everybody    I don’t think that’s really necessary The press release   on our vote today was pretty clear It’s unambiguous That issue could surface, but I don’t   think it will    That brings us to the end of our agenda, except for the   pro forma announcement that our next meeting--as I’m sure you’re all acutely aware--is   scheduled for February 1st and 2nd Merry Christmas everybody and hopefully a Happy   New Year!   END OF MEETING        Without objection they are approved Mike Prell and   Karen Johnson    Questions for either of our colleagues? President   Moskow    President Broaddus    The government and household sectors overwhelm it   Agricultural productivity is still accelerating according to the data that we have    Although agricultural productivity might slump if   genetically modified organisms were made illegal    As you know, we are getting some preliminary   evidence that the wealth effect may be larger than the 3 or 4 percent stemming from capital   gains that basic distributed lagged econometric analysis produces As a general proposition   is it true that because of the random noise in the system any very significant reduced form   type of calculation that you’re currently making to pick up the wealth effect is biased   downward by the nature of the construction of the test? Or do you have ways to filter out   whatever noise there may be to come up with cleaner coefficients?  For example, suppose   that in the real world there is an exact 10 percent coefficient and that if you could measure it   in every detail you would get that number But to the extent there is random noise in the   data, of necessity the estimated coefficient will be biased downward, and if there is enough     12/21/99 16   noise in the system, at the limit it will go to zero Do we have any sense, having looked   only at one major upswing in stock prices to judge this, whether that 3 to 4 percent   coefficient is realistic? Do we have actual useful evidence in the other direction? In other   words, in the few periods of really significant declines in stock prices is there any evidence   regarding the robustness of that coefficient?    I’m not even raising the issue of stability I am   raising strictly the question of the size It is perfectly possible to have all the things you are   mentioning but for the bias to be there as a function of the data themselves I’m just   questioning whether or not--other than by disaggregating the data--we have any indication   that we may be underestimating that coefficient If you disaggregate the data, you clearly   reduce the noise That’s the purpose of disaggregation We have already started some   modest disaggregation and we see some rather startlingly different results  I was just   curious as to whether there was concern about that because if we are underestimating that   coefficient on both the upside and the downside, it could be more destabilizing than even the   less-than-optimistic appraisal of the overall outlook that you just gave    Have you tried at all to capture potential stock price   volatility as a factor that would delay the sense of persistence of the gains? Or is the period   just too short to provide any useful insight?    Thank you Any further questions?  If not, who   would like to start the roundtable discussion?  President Parry    Incidentally, parenthetically, President Parry has   suggested a disaggregation of the wealth effect by regions [Laughter] President Hoenig    President Jordan    President Broaddus    I think you’ve stopped this meeting cold! That’s a   new statistic, which we had better absorb! President Guynn    President Boehne     12/21/99 26    President Minehan    President McTeer    President Moskow    President Stern    Vice Chair    Governor Gramlich    President Poole    Governor Ferguson    Governor Kelley    Governor Meyer    Thank you very much Is coffee available?    Coffee is served   [Coffee break]    Let’s turn now to Don Kohn for his report     12/21/99 40    Questions for Don?    Governor Meyer    President Minehan    Further questions?  If not, let me begin   I think the evidence of a slowdown is quite marginal at this stage  It is showing up   in the housing industry at the edges, where we are seeing some slippage or at least a   flattening of activity However, anything resembling a contraction induced by interest rates   strikes me as not even remotely visible as yet Motor vehicles, which also are supposed to   be interest-sensitive, weakened significantly a month or two ago, but they have come back   fairly substantially And if we look across the spectrum of the capital goods markets, there   is very little evidence of any weakening Obviously, we still have disproportionately large   orders for high-tech equipment versus other types of equipment; but orders for conventional   equipment are still substantial, with farm equipment being an obvious exception   In my view, what we have is a problem of whether to interpret developments as   supply-side driven or demand-side driven On the supply side, there is no evidence of any   slowing in productivity growth What we do have is some evidence from the industrial   production numbers for October and November and from the hours data that is pointing to   gangbuster gains in productivity for the fourth quarter   The notion that when we see this strong demand we are looking at the old classical   case of an economy that is heating up is, I submit, the wrong view We don’t know that the   economy is heating up unless by “heating up” we mean anything that raises the GDP growth   rate At this stage we have a very unusual situation There are very evident imbalances in   demand over supply, and indeed one can readily argue that virtually all of the problems stem     12/21/99 46   from a wealth effect Were it not for a significant rise in wealth-to-household income, we   probably would find that the propensities to save would be relatively stable, that the   unemployment rate would be very low but also stable, and that the current account deficit,   while large, would not be increasing All in all, the fact that underlying price inflation was   not accelerating would argue against a scenario of an economy that is heating up It would   be a scenario of very strong growth--indeed, one credibly involving accelerating growth-­  but all of it stemming from the productivity numbers   All I’m saying at this point is that one could not argue that this economy is heating   up were it not for the gradual decline in the pool of people who are willing to work and an   increasing share of overall demand being met from the import side The heat, if any, is   coming from the wealth effect And that clearly is something that cannot go on indefinitely   The bottom line is that the wealth effect--in line with Herb Stein’s remark--cannot   continue and, therefore, will not continue The reason is that it creates a fundamental   instability in that it fosters more effective demand than supply The two must be balanced in   some manner They currently are being balanced, as I indicated last month and previously,   by more domestic production coming from previously unemployed workers and by   increased imports as a share of total demand Neither of those two sources of supply can   continue to satisfy rising demand without limit Obviously, on the import side it is not   credible that our economy can continuously attract investments to fund the current account   deficit in our balance of payments And on the labor side there is a level, called zero, where   the availability of added employees disappears The one caveat with regard to the   availability of workers is immigration, which I will get to shortly   The reason I raise this issue is essentially to say that the wealth effect cannot   continue to stimulate excess demand indefinitely By wealth effect, I mean a rise in the   value of assets in relation to income Such a rise does accommodate higher equity values   but it cannot continue at the pace we have been seeing There are only two ways in which   such a rise can be thwarted, as indeed it must One is a decline in long-term expected   earnings, for which I find no evidence Indeed, if anything, it is the other way around The   other is a rise in the discount factor This is basically true by definition when we   disaggregate equity market values To talk in terms of momentum, or price/sales ratios, or,   even better, how much in losses a firm has experienced as reasons for higher stock prices is     12/21/99 47   clearly just nonsense The fundamental consideration is that a buyer is purchasing claims   against future cash If neither lower expectations of future cash nor a higher discount   occurs, then stock prices presumably will continue to rise, maybe in excess of the rate of   increase in household incomes   The crucial consideration here is that, while we may not be seeing a change in   earnings expectations, we very clearly are seeing the beginnings of a significant rise in   discount factors Yields on BBB-rated corporates, which are very close proxies for the   average corporate cost of capital, have been rising quite appreciably in real terms since late   1997 They have risen more than yields on US Treasuries, as evidenced by widening   spreads One can evaluate the discount factors on equities in terms of risk, the rate of   interest on corporate bonds, and then derive an equity premium But it is far more useful to   look at the bond equivalent rates in real terms to get a judgment of what type of discount   factors are showing up I think that discounting process is appreciably under way at this   stage Therefore, at the end of the day, I think the Greenbook has to be right that the   Wilshire 5000 will flatten out despite continuous revisions in the data underlying that   projection It is only a question of how much of a bubble there is in this process   I think we have to be wary, however, of our disinclination to recognize that what is   going on in this economy is really quite unprecedented in the post-World War II period in   that productivity growth continues to rise And it is rising to a very substantial extent in the   multifactor productivity component--the residual in growth accounting So, it is not solely   increased capital investment that is driving up the productivity numbers There is a very   substantial rise in productivity growth--in fact it is almost 2 percentage points--which is not   attributable to capital deepening Cyclically adjusted, this rivals what went on in the 1950s   and 1960s and through the oil embargo of early 1973 This basically suggests that we are   getting increases in multifactor productivity on the order of magnitude that was occurring   after World War II, but without the catch-ups of the earlier period In one sense, the recent   experience is far more significant than the labor productivity gains in earlier periods, which   as you may recall were at fairly attractive rates of around 3 percent for quite a period of   time Part of that acceleration came from the move out of agriculture into industry; but what   we are beginning to observe now is something beyond that     12/21/99 48   Acrophobia is a problem that confronts every statistician The concern about putting   down on paper a number that is larger than has been seen historically is very inhibiting   What I am saying is that that is happening So, while we do have these extraordinary   imbalances, I don’t think we ought to be looking at demand and saying it’s unbelievable and   the economy is heating up The point is that we do not have solely a demand-driven   phenomenon here The demand phenomenon stems from a wealth effect, and that should   concern us because it has obvious repercussions But we cannot look merely at demand and   say that housing sales are high, capital goods orders are high, and consumption expenditures   are high Of course they are high They had better be high or we are mismeasuring what is   going on because gross domestic income is rising even faster than its conceptually   equivalent counterpart, gross domestic product   It may well be that if we had better estimates we could resolve the question of which   of these two is the relevant measure of economic growth My own suspicion is that gross   domestic income may be giving a better reading The reason I say that is that gross   domestic income is consistent with the data we see on prices, profit margins, and the   underlying acceleration in productivity And that is really saying that our estimates of retail   sales are biased downward in one way or another or that some of the measures we have in   other product areas are biased downward If we had more accurate numbers, we would be   inclined to say “Wow!” and it would be “Wow!” squared What I want to say essentially is   that we have to be careful about looking only at the demand side rather than the gap   between effective demand on the one hand and supply on the other The two taken together   are what the widening current account deficit and the declining unemployment rate basically   reflect   We need to know precisely what is causing our good fortune because when it   changes, and it is certainly going to change at some point, our basic analysis will matter   And I am concerned that we might misread contractions in the economy or rates of growth,   and as a consequence misunderstand where the forces in the economy are leading us I   don’t think it matters in the current context because I believe the notion that at the end of the   day we are going to need to tighten more comes out of any type of evaluation It’s when we   are on the other side that I think we will have to be very careful     12/21/99 49   I mentioned previously that I see no overheating other than in the stock market The   price indexes are really quite benign In this regard, I think we ought to set aside the   consumer price index The reason I say that is that the PCE deflator is far more usable for   analyzing what is really going on The owners’ equivalent rent component in the CPI is 20   percent of the total index  Now, owners’ equivalent rent is going to start to accelerate unless   I misread how asset prices interact with consumer prices The reason is that the ratio of   owners’ equivalent rent to the value of housing has been going down continuously, and the   implicit rate of return that that is suggesting cannot credibly be expected to continue on a   prolonged basis So the little “pop” we saw in owners’ equivalent rent in the most recent   CPI is probably a harbinger of a slightly stronger number there   The reason the PCE deflator is a better indicator in my view is that it incorporates a   far more accurate estimate of the weight of housing in total consumer prices than the CPI   The latter is based upon a survey of consumer expenditures, which as we all know very   dramatically underestimates the consumption of alcohol and tobacco, just to name a couple   of its components It also depends on people’s recollections of what they spent, and we   have much harder evidence of that in the retail sales data, which is where the PCE deflator   comes from Why we should look at data based on a distorted sample when we have a   universe whose data are more accurate is beyond me The reasons that are given   theoretically are that we want to measure urban or suburban consumer prices and that’s not   what gets picked up in the total It would be so easy to make a simple adjustment in the   aggregate data to cover only the urban component by using appropriate ratios if we want to   do that That is, we could use the base universe of what is consumed to give us our weights,   but that is not what the CPI does So if I had my way, the CPI would be abolished for all   uses other than labor union contracts, Social Security benefits, and all the other uses that   would create an undue amount of political noise if we tried to change them It’s not   statistical noise that I am talking about at the moment In sum, I think we have to be careful   about any reading of inflation trends from the CPI   What I hear from everybody in business I talk to is that pricing power, if anything,   has gotten tougher rather than easier And while it is certainly the case, as Mike Prell points   out, that a number of prices are going up, it is by no means clear how significant those   increases are as yet     12/21/99 50   The one area where we may be underestimating supply-side potential is in   population growth and the underlying expansion of the working-age population We   recently made an effort to find out why increases in household employment are running   50,000 a month less than those in payroll employment We were trying to get a sense of   which measure is giving us the better picture  If we look at the only really significant   independent estimate of the number of households, measured by the number of electric   meter accounts excluding the double accounts that a lot of people have, we should be able to   get a reasonably good estimate of the number of households Indeed, if we take the utility   account numbers literally, they suggest that the CPS household estimates, which are based   on population estimates, have been underestimated on a cumulative basis by something in   the area of 1 percent since the 1990 Census If that is in fact the case, given that we have   some reasonably accurate numbers on the average size of households--remember, we   estimate the average size of households from samples of 50,000--we can then apply that   average to the population estimate extrapolated from the 1990 data In doing that we must   take account of estimates of births minus deaths plus immigrations, both legal and   otherwise A key question here is whether births and deaths are underestimated or biased   That is a possibility, but surely the immigration numbers are a real guess If we take the   household electrical connections numbers seriously, then the issue of closing the gap in the   household employment data versus the payroll data moves forward a pace   The Census Bureau, which does not use the electric utility data to make its   aggregated overall estimates but does use them for some of its local area estimates, argues   that if we are getting a big increase in immigration we should see it in the births and the   deaths data But I wonder if many illegal immigrants have babies that are born in hospitals   where somebody records the babies’ names If the parents are illegal immigrants, the last   thing they want to do is to have births recorded Clearly, deaths are another issue, but if   there has been an acceleration of immigration, that should affect the death rate in 2010, not   now So there is a reasonable expectation that when the 2000 Census comes out, it’s going   to revise upward the population numbers, the household numbers, and the household   employment growth numbers I might say that it will also explain why housing starts are as   high as they are with household formation being as low as it is     12/21/99 51   This hypothesis fits a number of holes in the data, but it also tells us that potential   working-age population growth is higher And, therefore, since our productivity numbers   are based on payroll data, raising the working-age population will obviously also raise the   long-term potential for economic growth We won’t know until we see the preliminary   numbers coming out of the 2000 Census, which I guess we will get in 2002 or 2003 Mike,   do you remember offhand when they will come out?  Who knows how quickly that will get   done with the computers they are working with now!    We may have it sooner than I suggested Who   knows! All in all, my point is that I think we have some statistical problems that are not   irrelevant to intermediate- and longer-term monetary policy   Having said all that, my view on policy is, if I may reference Governor Kelley’s   comment about raising his hand and saying present, that I almost think the best way we   could have gotten through this period would have been somehow to cancel this meeting   The reason is that markets, as far as I can see, seem to be pretty much where we as a   Committee would like them to be I don’t know whether we will want the numbers in the   markets at 230 to be the same as they are before our announcement at 215, but I think they   currently are at appropriate levels   The crucial issue for this meeting, as Don Kohn very clearly pointed out, is to   recognize that we have a Y2K problem It is a problem about which we do not want to   become complacent and presume that it doesn’t matter We want to communicate as   effectively as we can that we have no intention of doing anything through the year-end and   maybe for a short period thereafter But we also don’t want to remove the general view in   the market that we retain an upward bias and have not completed the tightening that we   think needs to be done We therefore face a tricky problem of trying to find a way to   communicate all of that, taking into account what we think the market perceives about what   we may or may not do, if our purpose is not to disturb the markets one way or the other   With that in mind, we have endeavored to craft two possible announcements One, as Don   mentioned, would accompany a “B” symmetric decision and the other a “B” asymmetric   decision Both incorporate language that tries to produce precisely the same result in either   case     12/21/99 52   Accordingly, in what is a rather unusual procedure for us, I would like to distribute   both of these drafts 2/ The evaluation of what we perceive the outlook to be is the same in   both, but it is positioned in different paragraphs And rather than request your comments on   specific wording preferences, I would appreciate it if you would confine your comments to   the alternative you feel more comfortable with, symmetry or asymmetry I assume that   nobody here wants to raise rates at this time At least I didn’t hear that view expressed in   any of the comments today So, if we are going to vote “B,” I would appreciate a judgment   as to which of the two versions you feel most comfortable with In this regard I switch back   and forth between the two every 10 minutes! It just depends on what time I happen to be   expressing an opinion At the moment I feel slightly more inclined toward asymmetry; but   by the time we vote it is just as likely, knowing how my view on this has changed frequently   over the last day or two, that I will be on the other side Frankly, I don’t think our decision   on this issue today matters one way or the other It’s only a question of one’s judgment on   minor issues, and I would appreciate any great insights   I might just note parenthetically in reference to what Don said about the issue of the   intermeeting bias, that this will be the last directive that incorporates a sentence on   symmetry on the old basis However, this directive won’t be published until after the next   meeting and is very likely to be an anachronism by then, so it is not going to matter terribly   much which alternative we choose But there is the question, as Don correctly points out,   about how we want to state our consensus So let us take a few minutes to look at both of   these versions and then I’ll open the meeting up for discussion I might note that both of   these drafts are saying, in effect, that we are very likely to move rates at the next meeting   [Pause] Vice Chairman    President Jordan    President Broaddus    President Poole    President Moskow    President Parry     12/21/99 55    Governor Gramlich    I will accept that Does anybody disagree? We   accept your apology! President Stern    Governor Kelley    How would you fix it?    Governor Ferguson    President Boehne    President Hoenig    President Guynn    President Minehan    President McTeer    Governor Meyer    The arguments for symmetry have won the day I   think that is what we ought to read and vote upon  May I say before I conclude that I just   raised the barrier a little The two changes suggested were worthwhile getting I think they   both are very helpful Now, the last sentence on each of the drafts is bracketed because     12/21/99 58   whether we include that will depend on our subsequent discussion The one thing I do not   think it is advisable for us to say is that the Committee plans to make a public   announcement in January, if for some reason we are not absolutely sure that that is going to   happen If we’re not sure, saying it is, shall I say, a less than thoughtful thing to do   Inclusion of that sentence does have the advantage of indicating that we will be altering our   policy perspective and it reinforces the fact that the symmetry issue is not a significant   policy matter But we have to be a little careful about forecasting that we will do something   if it turns out that we are going to be unable to accomplish that So let’s leave the bracketed   issue for judgment later; that judgment should be reasonably easy to make after we have our   discussion Please read the directive accordingly    Call the roll     Before we turn to our regular agenda, I want to mention   that today is Ed Boehne’s last meeting  He has been attending these meetings for many years; in   fact, none of us has sat at this table without seeing Ed sitting in his chair  He has been a member   of this group longer than any of us  But what is more impressive is that because he was the   Philadelphia Fed’s economist to the FOMC, his attendance at these meetings goes back to 1971    If there is some way that we could perhaps buy him off not to write a book, it might be an   appropriate use of funds!  Needless to say, we are really going to miss you  I think at one time or   another your wise counsel has changed the mind of everyone around this table, and I don't recall   any instance when it went in the wrong direction     Ed, would you move to approve the minutes?     Without objection  Thank you so much  Peter Fisher     Questions for Peter?  If not, would someone like to   move approval?       Without objection     Peter, as I listened to you and as I read through the   materials, technically speaking you are requesting only a temporary extension?       As a practical matter, though, you are setting up a   framework that would make the rescinding of that extension virtually impossible at the end of   the day  I exaggerate only in part  If, for example, the Committee were to decide at the behest of   the US Treasury that our heavy commitment in agency issues was not consonant with the basic   policy it was administering, the way this is set up could lead to a confrontation with the              - 10 -     Treasury  We would have to decide whether we would acquiesce in their views or come to a   compromise, or something of that nature  What disturbs me is that the concerns of the Treasury   with respect to agency issues are not without merit  We are all acutely aware of the role of   agency issues in the financial markets and the increasing significance of what are essentially   large subsidized entities effectively taking over the mortgage market--or I should say that part of   the market that issues conforming mortgage debt   I want to be sure that we are in a position at   the point when those decisions have to be made that we can in fact make them and that we do not   find ourselves irrevocably committed  With a lot of these ratios, the portfolio would be built up   in such a way that in order to reverse what we have done we would foster a major wrenching of   the financial markets  It would be unfair to the agencies, for example, if we suddenly were to   liquidate significant positions that we had held for a considerable period  It is that issue that I   would like you to address      As a practical matter, what alternatives do you have to   Treasuries?  What substitutes are you planning to employ in our portfolio other than agencies, if   any?     Let me ask you this  Supposing we were to urge the   Treasury to conclude its evaluation, which it is currently going through, at a particularly rapid   pace?  How much time do we have before you get to the point where such a large block of your   portfolio is in agency issues that we don't have an exit strategy?     No, I am merely asking you at what point in your   funding requirements do you reach a point from which it is very difficult to work back?  For   example, if Treasury could get these issues resolved in three weeks, or six weeks, or two months,   would that provide a basis for a solution?  If you can give me an order of magnitude or a   timeframe, I may be able to get a Treasury resolution of this issue  What I don't want to see   happen is for the Treasury to go down a very specific path and SOMA to go down a very specific              - 12 -     path and end up with a collision  It is very apparent to me that at some point we could get   involved in a very difficult confrontation  I want to avoid that  I want to see the issues resolved   before we make major changes and then look for an exit strategy  If you said there was an exit   strategy, I did not hear it  All I heard was that we have two particular problems     So you are suggesting to me that there really is no   timeframe in which it would be particularly useful to you to get this issue resolved?     When do you think the tax season begins?     We have no problem--or at least I have no problem--   getting that issue resolved today  That is not what I am concerned about  My concern is   whether, having created the authority--which is essentially what you are requesting--we will   have an exit strategy  And in what specific timeframe would that exit strategy be viable, if at all?    For example, if you told me that it would be very helpful to get this issue resolved with Treasury   by April 1st, I could put on a full court press and probably get it resolved      Correct  Vice Chair     My general concern, assuming that the Committee   authorizes this, is that it not be perceived as permanent--as indeed are all of the other   authorizations we approve in February  The latter are legally temporary but for all practical   purposes they are permanent  I want to make certain that this authorization is not perceived in   the same light     I would suggest, just for the record, that you say you   are presuming that the surpluses that are currently projected in the unified budget will indeed   persist through the years ahead  I say that because five years from now you will not want to look   back and find that you did not take account of that projection              - 15 -       I don’t think there is any question about that  We are   all observing that phenomenon  It is crucial that we confront this problem and get it resolved   before it gets resolved inadvertently by our failure to act  I want to make certain that the   timeframe on both the Treasury’s side and our side is such that this issue can be appropriately   resolved     Agreed  I just wanted to put this issue on the table     President Hoenig     Don, what are your plans at the moment?     Can I ask Committee members to respond to President   Hoenig’s suggestion?  If you have any ideas on that, please come forward  President Jordan     President Broaddus     How do you stand with respect to President Hoenig’s   suggestion?  What I am hearing here is a suggestion that there be some sort of consultative   subcommittee of the FOMC, which would not try to get into the details of the discussions and   work going on, but would have a broad oversight role in looking at the process  I don’t know   whether I got a representative sample of the Committee but that is what I’m hearing from   President Hoenig and a few others  If there is a difference of view among others in the   Committee I would appreciate hearing it expressed because this is a far more important issue   than strictly the technical operations of the Desk  I think it is important that that be understood   and that we don’t get, as President Broaddus said, inadvertent consequences   This should not in   any way forestall the ability of the Desk to carry out our directives  We cannot just arbitrarily   say to the Desk that our target for the funds rate is X, do it!  Well, the question is  “How?”  We   have to keep in mind that there is not an infinite set of possibilities here  But we also have to be   aware of our interactions with Treasury, which is effectively raising the same issues in a different   context  We have to make certain that our decisions as we go forward are consistent with the   purposes of the Committee and our fundamental monetary policy prerogatives  I am trying to   draw out members to address these issues and see where we are  President Poole     We do, remember, still have over $36 trillion of   Treasury debt held by the public     Several weeks’ salary for some of us!  Governor   Gramlich     How about a month?     President Minehan     That is their problem                - 22 -       But that is where we could come in  In other words, in   this negotiation one of the things we could put on the table is for them basically to increase the   30-year funding  The reason they don’t want to do that at the moment is that they have this   projection that the debt will disappear in the year 2013 or 2016  And why would they want to be   buying back 30-year issues, which still have maturities of 15 years, at some significant premium?    That is a much smaller issue as far as I am concerned than this other problem  And it may very   well be that the solution to this dilemma for the interim period is to induce the Treasury to alter   its debt management policies in a manner that makes it easier for Peter and the Desk to function     Well, there is a simple way we could avoid that  We   could have the Federal Reserve Bank of New York accumulate as fiscal agent of the Treasury a   lot of private securities  And they would be issuing public debt on the other side  Or we could   think of some expenditure programs, if you like!  [Laughter]     President Parry     Let me suggest that that is probably not a good idea    The reason is that we’d have to report the extension in the minutes because it involves a formal   change to one of the Committee’s instruments, the Authorization for Domestic Open Market   Operations  It would create more attention and discussion of this issue than I suspect we want  I   think the important consideration is not what we do here formally but what we conclude our   policy is moving toward  How it is officially handled is far less important than our general sense   of where we are going  So, I would prefer that we not truncate Peter's authority in this regard   because he presumably will do as the Committee requests, and we are meeting every six weeks     We can tighten policy and get rid of all of our bonds!    [Laughter]     Yes, I think that is wise  Let me suggest the following    One, I will take it upon myself to see if I can expedite the Treasury’s decisions on this process   and have them made as quickly as possible  I will communicate to them what our concerns are              - 25 -     and what our problems are  I will consult with Don and others on the formation of a   subcommittee of the FOMC to oversee the broader questions and interface with Peter and Don as   they work on this study  And then we’ll keep the study under continuous review because it is   truly a profoundly important issue for this Committee  It should not be, as we tend on too many   occasions to think of it, a tactical question  There is a deep-seated issue here of the role of a   central bank as a financial intermediary  And how we handle that role is not without major   implications  The issue, effectively, has not come up for a very, very long time so we have been   lulled into somnolence on this question  It is a deeper issue than we have been communicating   and I think it is important for us to recognize that  So I would recommend that we move forward   and accept Peter’s request and immediately form a committee within the next week or two and   keep the matter on the agenda as is relevant  And, hopefully, when we get the report--after   Labor Day did you say?     We should then be making a lot of major decisions, but   it is quite important to make certain as we move toward that point that we leave ourselves the   flexibility to make those decisions, which was my original point  Governor Gramlich     Are there any further questions for Peter or comments   on this issue?  If not, would somebody like to move Peter's recommendation?     Is there a second?   SPEAKER(?)  Second     All in favor say “aye”   SEVERAL  “Aye”     Opposed?  The “ayes” have it  Thank you     Questions for Peter?     Further questions for Peter?  If not, would somebody   like to move his recommendation?     I grant you that that is your point of view; you've held   that view  But as I heard the discussion, I think this probably captures the position of the majority   of the members  Frankly, it's a very minor issue and I don't really want us to get into a debate on   it  As I read it, it captures the general view of the majority  If we took a vote, I think that's how              - 94 -     we would come out  So, if you don't mind, let's leave it as is  If that is indeed the case and if   there are no further questions, we will release this statement at 215 pm today     Finally, to close the meeting, let me reconfirm that the   date of the next meeting is May 16th  The meeting is adjourned  We will go to lunch!   END OF MEETING         Is there a second?   SPEAKER(?)  Second     Without objection  Thank you very much  We put you   through a lot of work today!  Let’s move on to the economic situation, and I call on Mike Prell   and Karen Johnson     President Poole     President Parry     President Jordan     President Hoenig     President Moskow     Further questions for our colleagues?  If not, would   somebody like to start the Committee discussion?  President Parry     President Jordan      President Broaddus     President Boehne      President Guynn     President  Minehan     President McTeer     President Moskow     Thank you  Let's take a break for coffee at this stage,   but let's keep it relatively short              - 61 -     [Coffee break]       President Stern      President Hoenig     Governor Gramlich     President Poole     Governor Ferguson     Governor Meyer     Governor Kelley              - 73 -       Vice Chair     Okay  I call now on Don Kohn     Questions for Don?  If not, I will proceed  Let me say at   the outset that I think the balance of risks clearly indicates that we are on the right policy path    Accordingly, I think we should be moving another 25 basis points today, retain the sentence in   our press release expressing the view that the balance of risks remains tilted toward inflation, and   continue on a tightening path until there are problems with that path    As I have commented before, something very unusual is going on in the economy, and   I’d like to spend a moment or two on what I think may well be happening  First, the available   data clearly indicate that productivity is still accelerating  The second derivative is still positive    Moreover, if we disaggregate the productivity data we find that, for the first time that I can   recall, nearly all the measures are showing very significant increases  For example, we are   getting a 4-3/4 percent increase in fourth-quarter over fourth-quarter productivity for   nonfinancial corporations and for noncorporate business, and I think a roughly comparable   increase for the farm sector The only area that actually looks weak is financial sector   productivity, and I suspect that reflects a statistical problem, not a real problem  If that is the   case, it would imply that we are in fact underestimating the overall pace of productivity growth     Clearly, the numbers that we have thus far for the second half provide only limited   information on productivity developments, but there is no evidence in those numbers that the   pattern of accelerating productivity is slowing down  Indeed, one possible explanation for the              - 80 -     remarkable performance of the NASDAQ in relation to the Dow--this extraordinary negative   correlation that Bill Poole put his finger on--is that we have in the market’s evaluation process   for existing capital a clear indication that capital is moving out of the older technologies into the   new  The only question is whether we also see that development in current cash flows  In other   words, are the savings in the economy inadequate to fund the new technologies? If so, we would   expect a drain of funds out of the older technologies into the new  So the question is whether the   cash flows are consistent with what we are observing in the stock market evaluation process   There are a few clues  One mentioned by Bob McTeer is that despite the cash flows in   the oil industry, cash is not being plowed back into that industry to the extent that ordinarily   would have occurred in the past  Those big cash flows could be showing up in various ways--as   dividends, which I doubt; as stock buybacks, probably in part; or as investments in financial   assets  Any of the three adds to the financing pool that's available to the high-tech industries    Moreover, the dramatic amount of stock buybacks, which involves almost wholly the old-  technology stocks, is also adding to the overall financing pool  We are trying at this stage to   develop a detailed flow of funds evaluation that separates high-tech from low-tech  And while   we don't have results at this stage, it is fairly clear from earlier information that the proportion of   capital investment in the high-tech areas that is financed from external funds is higher than that   in the older technologies, and indeed the proportion is rising in the high-tech sectors  Obviously,   high-tech is still a very small part of the system, depending on how one defines it, and it is very   difficult to draw any firm conclusions as yet from the cash flows     Nevertheless, it is interesting to observe that we are getting the type of evidence we   would expect if productivity is still accelerating, namely, an inadequate capacity to finance   rapidly rising capital requirements from internal cash flows  We know that if we take the ratio of              - 81 -     the NASDAQ to the S&P 500 and compare it with the share of producer durable equipment   orders that is going to high-tech, and we define that sector broadly so we are picking up a big   chunk of the capital investment, it appears that the ratio of the NASDAQ to the S&P 500 leads   movements in the high-tech orders share This suggests that the trend toward ever increasing   investment in high-tech capital, not only by the producers of these types of innovations but by   everybody else, is beginning to pressure the markets in a manner that is creating a rate of   economic growth that is higher than we are used to     In response to Bill Poole's comment that money growth has not slowed as much as   might have been expected, I would suggest that recent money growth may not, in fact, be   inconsistent with underlying conditions  We had a discussion in February about whether we   should be raising the money supply targets because structural productivity was rising    Accelerating productivity would lead us to expect faster money growth than otherwise would be   the case  We would expect faster increases in housing and motor vehicles than otherwise would   be the case  Even the interest-sensitive areas of the economy would be expected to show less   response than ordinarily would be the case if productivity is continuing to accelerate   So as far as I can judge just looking at the data, it is not evident that we are seeing, as   yet, a cresting in the growth of productivity  Obviously, there is an upside limit--I guess--but I   don't see any evidence that we are there  Merely employing historical patterns strikes me as not   overly useful in analyzing this type of phenomenon   The question that we have to ask ourselves in evaluating the interest-sensitive areas of   the economy is not whether they are declining, but whether they are declining as a share of the   total  I think the evidence here is mixed  Some data suggest that the share is flattening out or              - 82 -     going down; other data suggest that it is not  I agree with those who suspect that first-quarter   GDP is going to be a lot higher than any of us have in our forecasts at this stage     There are technical reasons why we would expect growth in the first quarter to be   slower than in the fourth, as Mike Prell pointed out quite correctly, but we don't have enough of   the first-quarter data to really be quite convinced of that  The forecast of 4 to 4-1/2 percent GDP   growth implies a quite significant slowing in the growth of productivity, but it may just mean   that growth is falling below the recent trend and not necessarily that the trend is flattening out    The anecdotal evidence we are observing still strikes me as not consistent with any real   slowdown   The question in the real world is whether the expansion is slowing  Let me say that,   irrespective of what the GDP data show, I don't think any slowdown is occurring I don't see any   evidence of it, and I suspect the major reason the expansion is not slowing is that productivity   continues to accelerate  There is no way to avoid that conclusion  The rate of GDP growth is   equal to the growth of employment and the workweek plus the growth of productivity  In   thinking about employment growth, I suspect that to a large extent we are underestimating   immigration  This means that a goodly part of the problem that we have in explaining what is   going on may be resolved when we get the 2000 Census, which may show a higher population   level  We may find that, among other developments, household employment is growing faster   relative to payroll employment than we are currently estimating     All in all, what I am basically arguing is that what is going on now is not simply   explained  I reiterate that it is not evident to me that this economy is heating up  I do not deny   that the growth rates are very high and may be accelerating and may be significantly   underestimated in the Greenbook  But overheating has to mean that we are getting strong              - 83 -     inflationary pressures  I don't know how you may want to disaggregate the CPI or the PPI or a   lot of the commodity indexes  As I have indicated before, the question in my judgment is not   one of price but more an issue of unit costs because unit costs are what engender inflationary   pressures  If prices don't move with unit costs, obviously profit margins fall and the capital   goods boom begins to fade  And for the first time in a long time in the fourth quarter, unit costs   for nonfinancial corporations were zero year-over-year  They are up 03 percent for total   nonfarm business on an income-based estimate  We can talk all we want about the fact that we   see this price going up and that price going up  Unless our data systems are really deficient in   terms of the underlying cost structure as we measure it, I find it hard to reconcile these cost   numbers with a belief that there is any acceleration of inflation--yet  I do not deny that we are   still getting a decline in the number of people seeking work  We are still getting a rise in the net   trade deficit, and those safety valves cannot continue indefinitely  Sometime, somewhere, at   some point, we will experience inflationary pressures unless those gaps close   All I am saying is that I do not see the evidence at this stage  I suspect that if the gaps   continue to open up, something will happen  But I think we have plenty of time to worry about   that  If we continue to move in 25 basis point increments, after a while we really will begin to   move the interest rate structure  We always have the capacity to double up the rate increases and   to do something between meetings  But for the time being it strikes me that we are right on the   mark with a 25 basis point move  I think that the desirability of moving at meetings and moving   in a consistent pattern is very helpful in terms of promoting market stability  I believe such a   pattern reduces risk premiums and volatility and, other things equal, it probably reduces the   equilibrium interest rate required to maintain maximum sustainable growth              - 84 -     So I’m where I was at the last meeting  I guess it took me a long time to say that, but   so be it  President McTeer     Yes      Vice Chair     President Poole     President Boehne      President Jordan      President Guynn      President Hoenig     I think we are saying that the balance of risks is on the  up side       That is a probabilistic statement  And assuming   everybody agrees that the balance of risks is on the up side, I suspect that we have a very wide   distribution of what people think that probability is     No, I think that's right  The way I put it last month was   that that would be the implied strategy if indeed we continued to see the types of imbalances that   we were seeing  But should that change--and indeed, we hope and expect it to change--that will   obviously affect our decisions over the longer run  Or if the inflation outlook gets worse, I   would suspect the consensus of this group would be to accelerate the pace     But I don't see how any of us can forecast that at this   particular point       President Minehan     President Moskow      President Parry              - 89 -       Governor Gramlich     President Stern     President Broaddus     Governor Kelley     Governor Meyer     Governor Ferguson     Mr Secretary, would you read the appropriate language   for 25 basis points and the balance of risks toward inflation?     Call the roll please     May I suggest that Lynn Fox distribute a draft press   statement, and I ask the members of the Board of Governors to join me in my office as we go   into a temporary adjournment of the FOMC                                                      [Recess]     The FOMC is back in session  The Board of Governors   just voted unanimously to accept the requests received thus far from almost all of the Reserve   Banks to increase the discount rate to 5½ percent  You have in front of you a draft statement,   which essentially replicates the February statement  Does anybody have any comment on it?     Good morning, everyone  The changed structure of   the seating around the table today reflects a desire to get a better perspective on the economy!    [Laughter]  Actually, this type of seating arrangement has worked out very well at our regular   Board meetings  But if it doesn't work for the FOMC, we can always go back to the way we   were before   This is Mike Prell’s final meeting  Mike goes back into antiquity with the   institution  Mike, have you ever missed a meeting?     So, he may in fact be uttering his last official words   here today  But like many of our colleagues who have left, his imprint clearly is going to be   on us for a good long time  And if we happen to get off track after this meeting, somebody is   going to do a regression that I don't think any of us is going to like!  In any event, Mike, we   wish you well     We will have many occasions to say that to you   before you leave  There is still a fairly large number of days before your official retirement    As you know, at today’s luncheon we're going to bid our official farewell to Ed   Boehne  Obviously, Ed is not participating in our meeting today; and Bill Stone is here with   us this morning to represent the Philadelphia Bank    Would somebody like to move the approval of the minutes of the last meeting?     Peter Fisher, you are on  Where are you?     On the contrary, I thought that was an exceptionally   worthwhile presentation  Indeed, it strikes me that you at least have come to grips with the   concerns that I had at the last meeting  What you did not mention is that the on-the-run/off-  the-run spreads, which have been a measure of illiquidity in the system, are going to be   arbitraged down  And that is probably a valuable thing to have happen; it is very clearly   desirable for any market  Why the spreads between riskless assets with the same maturity are   as large as they are, wholly on the grounds of the degree of liquidity, doesn’t strike me as   something that is altogether desirable     Secondly, unless I misunderstand the nature of the program, you will be picking up   a number of issues  And in the low probability event that indeed we run out of issues for the   public by 2013--or sooner the way it is going--the Treasury won’t have to go into the market   to bid for those securities  We in effect will have swapped them out with the Treasury and   there would be no market pressure  Effectively we are pre-retiring the issues for the Treasury,   and that is not a bad idea  Now, no one can forecast with any degree of accuracy what the   federal budget surpluses are going to be in the future  And obviously no one can make a   judgment as to whether this program is more than just a stop-gap measure on the way to the   disappearance of the Treasury market, in which case this is all moot   But all in all, I think   you have succeeded in proposing that we do something that, frankly, we probably ought to   have done in the past, which is to emphasize off-the-run issues  Essentially, an endeavor to   move the liquidity premium from on-the-run to twice or thrice off-the-run issues with sheer   money market mechanics strikes me as a desirable thing to do in any event  So, while you   may have taken a good deal of the Committee's time, I think it was quite worthwhile      15    Questions for Peter?     Are you recommending anything in particular?      On a wholly different issue, let me just quickly ask a   question  Baas tend to sell at somewhat lower interest rates than BBBs  BBBs are 10-year   maturities and Baas are somewhat longer  Is that the difference?  In other words, is it the   longer maturity that's creating the spread or is there a real risk difference between Moody's   Baa and Standard and Poor’s BBB?     A rare event!  [Laughter]     This has nothing to do with this particular meeting,   but if you could give me an answer on that later I’d appreciate it     President Broaddus  Where is he?  [Laughter]     Yes     I think you are raising a good point  I wouldn't   think, with the Mexican election on the horizon, that this is the right time  But I do believe it   may well be desirable to put that issue on the table and take it up at a later date  Obviously,   we would need to consult with the Treasury Department on this  But at the appropriate time I   think we ought to raise this issue  These swaps, which were put in place in an earlier period--  and most of which we have eliminated--have had their day and are a true anachronism  But   they still have a political value  And until we can dissipate the political value, it probably   would be difficult to unwind them  But the notion that they will be implemented is as remote   as our running out of Treasury securities  [Laughter]  President Jordan     Governor Gramlich     Vice Chair     I did!  [Laughter]     Any further questions for Peter?  If not, would   somebody like to move the domestic operations?     Would somebody like to move the renewal of the   reciprocal swap arrangements?      19    I'd like to adjourn the FOMC meeting temporarily   while the Board of Governors goes into my office to confront requests from several of your   Banks on the discount rate                                         [Recess]      98  We are back in session  I'll just announce to your great surprise that the Board of   Governors voted to move the discount rate up 50 basis points   Is the draft press release that   was just circulated satisfactory?   SEVERAL  Yes     Thank you  In that event, shall we adjourn for   lunch?     The Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond dissents    Let's move on to the economic situation  Mike Prell and Vince Reinhart     Questions for Mike or Vince?      25    President Stern     President Poole     Shouldn't that depend on expectations regarding   exchange rates?  With a fixed exchange rate structure, then holdings of international assets   gravitate toward the distribution of a country’s foreign trade  But if there are currency risks,   foreign asset holdings would tend to fall quite short of such a distribution     Foreign currency assets?     President Minehan     President Jordan     President Parry     In a country like Finland, which is presumed to have   a major rise in and a disproportionate share of high-tech usage, do we see it in their output per   hour figures?     What would be the order of magnitude?     President Moskow     President McTeer     Does anybody else have a question or comment?    Would somebody like to start the discussion?  President Broaddus     President Minehan     President Moskow     President Parry     President Guynn     First Vice President Stone      49    President Poole     President Stern     Vice Chair     Governor Gramlich     President Hoenig     President Jordan     President McTeer     Governor Ferguson     Governor Meyer     Governor Kelley     It is a little late but let's go for coffee if it's there  It   is probably iced coffee at this point!   [Coffee break]      Mr Lindsey     What actually happened, in basis points, to the   federal funds futures rate for June as a consequence of the CPI release?     What is the May figure?     I just want the change       And what do you have now?     Further questions?  President Jordan     Further questions for David?  If not, let me focus on the   previous conversation because it really covers the issues that I think confront us  My own   judgment, and what I plan to recommend to the Committee, is that we have an opportunity   now to move the funds rate up 50 basis points, remain asymmetric, and effectively adjust our   longer-term posture to a better position than the one we are in at the moment    The reason I am not concerned about moving the rate up quickly at this stage is that I   think the evidence indicates that productivity, indeed perhaps underlying GDP, is still   accelerating  I recognize that the staff’s estimate of productivity growth for the first quarter,   based on the latest published figures and adjusted for the defense spending anomaly, is 1-½   percent  I don’t believe that estimate for a fraction of a second  I don't think it has even a   remote possibility of being accurate because of the evidence we are getting on profit margins,   which clearly are still opening up at this point  Indeed, using the available data on income and   profits, which essentially reflect the unit cost structure of nonfinancial corporations, the      83  productivity growth number that falls out of that system according to staff estimates is a 6   percent annual rate That number is consistent with our unit cost analyses and our estimates   for prices, profits, and wages, granted that the estimate for wages may be a little to the weak   side I would submit that what is creating a 1-1/2 percent estimate for productivity growth is   the combination of a peculiar statistical discrepancy and some very dubious data in areas of   the economy other than nonfinancial corporations; the latter provide our most reliable   underlying data   The general view of a persisting acceleration in productivity is being picked up in a   lot of the company reports where shortages of important inputs reportedly are beginning to   arise These are particularly acute in the high-tech area  Intel is in difficulty  Cisco is in   difficulty  The problem of semiconductor shortages as a consequence of the earthquake in   Taiwan has left some very deep pressures in its wake  One reason is that the effects of   network externalities in the high-tech area of our economy are clearly beginning to show up in   an exaggerated manner  That is, as we are all aware and as I have mentioned previously,   when we go from two-at-a-time connections to large network connections, the benefits do not   just go up arithmetically; they go up exponentially The network externalities effect of our   high-tech system is creating a major underlying acceleration in the economy   All the problems we have discussed previously, mainly the pressures on the safety   valves of net imports and the labor market, are putting substantial pressure on the total system    What is remarkable at this stage is not that inflationary forces are picking up  It is that there is   so little evidence of a pickup  I think, for example, that the acceleration in wages is   unambiguous  The one statistic nobody has mentioned today is the fact that average hourly   earnings, adjusted for the industry mix that BLS publishes, is up 055 percent in April That      84  increase is far greater than even the ECI is suggesting  The average hourly earnings number   has not been a particularly good estimator of the ECI, but it is an indication that the bias is   clearly on the up side  Nonetheless, when we look through the configuration of unit costs, the   estimate we end up with is that unit costs have fallen over the last six months for nonfinancial   corporations, indeed for nonfarm business generally  If this is indeed the case, all of the price   acceleration we have seen reflects widening profit margins  This is not an indication of the   beginning of a major acceleration in prices  Indeed, the core PCE deflator for April rose less   than 01 percent  And over the 4-month period from January through April, when most of the   inflation is showing up in the CPI, the average rate is 017 percent monthly or an annual rate   of approximately 2 percent  While that rate is higher than it was earlier, there is no evidence   at this stage that we are experiencing a real underlying deterioration in inflation of the kind   that we typically have seen in the past    I think we are in a quite different environment than we have seen in the past  In such   an environment real long-term interest rates have to rise, and indeed they have risen very   significantly in the last several weeks  Real long-term BBB rates are up over 50 basis points   after gradually edging higher for quite some period of time  This indicates that the markets   are adjusting rapidly to the evidence that overall demand forces are becoming very strong,   driven in large part by the supply factors themselves     I mentioned, I think late last year, that I was concerned about our tendency to get   caught up in statistical acrophobia and feel the need to make our forecasts converge to the   mean because that is basically what happens in our models  I think we all have a tendency to   do that  I myself think that we will see some slowing in the macroeconomic data that we   usually look at, in part because our seasonal adjustments are inadequate  That is, it is very      85  difficult to seasonally adjust for the type of global warming and related rise in degree-days   that we experienced during the winter months without some impact on the GDP figures  So, it   is perfectly conceivable that the GDP growth numbers for the fourth and first quarters were   just an exaggeration  They will slow down in the second quarter, even though no slowdown   or in fact major changes may have occurred  I think what we have is still the beginning, or   perhaps we are well into it at this stage, of a significant long-term change in the behavior of   the economy  This is not to say that we don't have a cyclical element involved in these growth   numbers nor does it mean that higher interest rates, especially real long-term rates, are having   no effect  Indeed, the evidence is now beginning to show that the alleged absence of any   effect from what we have done to date, or more importantly what the markets have done to   date, is a false notion     As Governor Ferguson pointed out, we have seen a very dramatic shift in the   borrowing of the business sector  Net issuance at the long end has come down, and the total   of business loans plus commercial paper has suddenly surged  What that means is that a very   large number of business firms are moving out of the long end of the borrowing market to the   short end The reason is not that they are going to get significantly lower interest rates,   because they are not, but that they expect the surge in interest rates to be temporary and they   will be able to refinance their recent borrowings at lower long-term rates in the future  This is   the classic way in which officers of corporate and financial firms behave  As soon as they   perceive that interest rates are not coming down, they will begin to adjust their capital   expenditure projections  This process has the effect of producing a gradual slowing     We are seeing some evidence that housing starts are slowing, but the evidence is   really marginal  We are getting the same type of responses that Mike Moskow got from the      86  motor vehicle manufacturers, which suggest that these two sectors of the economy are not   doing all that outstandingly well in May  Activity is still high in both, but it has come off its   recent peaks to a considerable degree  The problem that we have with interest-sensitive areas   of the economy is that if overall economic activity is accelerating, then what interest rates do   is to alter the relative shares of expenditures  And, indeed, if motor vehicles and housing are   flattening out while the economy is rising rapidly, interest rates are doing what one would   expect them to do  Responses are under way, and as far as I can see our policy moves have   tracked the long end of the market very well  If we move 50 basis points today, we will   continue to track it very well, and I think that is what we want to try to do, namely try to   maintain a policy that is consistent with the way market forces in the long end of the market   are going  I cannot say that I would personally envisage that the inflation pressures are about   to ease quickly  But Jerry Jordan is not wrong  I remember 1994 exceptionally well  At one   point we decided to sit still while the markets were driving forward  We chose not to continue   to move and I think correctly  Now, that doesn't mean we will always be correct  It may be   that we were lucky, and if it was luck, the next time we may lose   I believe the risks in moving 50 basis points today are not very large because I think   the underlying momentum in the economy remains very strong  What is going to happen in   the future is probably going to be dependent on a number of developments that we can't really   forecast  One is crude oil prices  Those prices were declining when Mike and his colleagues   started to put the Greenbook together  One of the reasons was a surprising slowdown in   domestic demand for oil  It essentially showed up in the form of a significant slippage in the   demand for residual fuel oil in the first quarter stemming from a major shift throughout the   world toward natural gas  I think the slippage amounted to 300,000 to 400,000 barrels a day       87  In Germany there also was a major shift into lighter distillates  Overall domestic demand in   the first quarter actually was up only marginally over a year earlier  Demand was stronger in   April, and that may be the reason why crude pressures are currently rising  But as far as the   United States is concerned, the prospects of rising inflation pressures stemming from oil may   be over, and I say "may" because one cannot rule out a big spike  The reason relates to the   very large retail marketing margins in gasoline  These occurred as a consequence of the sharp   increase in crude oil prices earlier, which followed a dramatic decline in crude inventories   The jump in crude oil prices pushed up retail gasoline prices at one point, as I recall, some 10   to 15 cents a gallon above where a historically average margin would have suggested they   should be  Those margins have eased back down, but they are still, I believe, something like 8   to 10 cents a gallon above average gasoline marketing margins in the United States  So even   if we have some pickup in crude prices, the margins may still fall back to earlier norms, and it   strikes me that the upside pressure on gasoline prices may no longer be there  The same is   true for home heating oil  Obviously, if there is a big spike in crude, all bets are off, and that   could create some fairly significant problems for the economic forecast   The crucial issue here is what will happen to domestic demand and whether the   financial markets will readjust themselves to higher interest rates and ultimately exert a   retarding influence on consumption expenditures, housing, and the stock market  If those   forces are essentially in place, as I believe they are, we could end up with an economy that   comes in at a level below the Greenbook forecast     I think it is too soon to make that judgment  It is conceivable that we will be more   inclined to reach that conclusion in June, but I think it would be a mistake to do so now   I   believe our best bet at this stage is to follow the long end of the market as we have been      88  doing, and that implies 50 basis points as far as I can see  Because there is as yet no   compelling evidence that inflationary pressures are easing, I believe it would be a mistake not   to stay asymmetric and our press release should reflect such a decision  That is all I have to   say  Would anybody like to comment?  Vice Chair     President Hoenig      89    President Guynn     President Poole     Governor Ferguson     Governor Gramlich      92    President Parry     President Moskow     President Broaddus     President Jordan     First Vice President Stone     Governor Meyer     Governor Kelley     President Minehan     President Stern     President McTeer     Well, we can revise our method of estimating and   reporting it to a monthly basis!  The majority appears to be in favor of 50 basis points with the   balance of risks sentence toward inflationary pressures  Would you read the directive that   would capture that?      97    Call the roll     At the outset I want to welcome Tony Santomero from   Philadelphia to his first meeting  I assume that you have been given the various paraphernalia you   will need, including a Fedspeak dictionary?  [Laughter]  Our first presentation is usually   indecipherable even with the dictionary!  I call on Peter Fisher  [Laughter]     Thank you very much     There will be no market if everyone is willing to accept      the market price but nobody has a transaction         I think the Treasury’s debt to the public is down to $34   trillion minus our holdings of $1/2 trillion or so  And a very large chunk of the remainder is held by   official parties abroad  Do we have any very recent evidence on whether they are paring their   holdings as the Treasury liquidates its debt or are contemplating doing so?  In other words, in your   discussions--or the presumed discussions that you are going to be having with the Japanese and   others on the issue of bidding--are you expecting to get any sense from them that they are going to   be paring their holdings of US Treasury securities?  Or are we going to find that as the supply of   Treasury issues declines, the value of them, at least to many of the central banks, will rise?  It is even   conceivable that they would bid higher and absorb a goodly part of the private floating supply  Do   you have any indication yet of what is going on in that area?     Is there any chance that they would really stonewall and   just continue to do what they are doing?     It is  It’s sad in a sense     President Poole     And yields     Which in turn is likely to have a negative effect on the   propensity of foreigners’ willingness to hold US Treasuries         12    President Broaddus     Vice Chair       13    Further questions on this subject?      No, we haven’t gotten there yet  But if there are no further   questions, we can now turn to that subject    As you know and as Peter mentioned, he has circulated a memorandum on the issue of   diversifying foreign reserves out of German euro-denominated instruments into other euro-  denominated instruments  I assume that this issue, which was discussed previously, is of interest to   us  President Jordan, I believe you want to make a comment with respect to that?     There is a history to this, as you know  Clearly, if the   general policy of the United States government were never to intervene in the exchange markets,   then the optimum amount of foreign exchange reserves would be zero  The trouble with that,   because the Treasury has the presumed ultimate authority to determine our international financial   policy, is that Treasuries change from one administration to the next and policies within any   particular administration change  So it’s very difficult to get a formalized policy directed precisely   at the question of the cost-benefit analysis of what our reserve position should be  It was a moot   issue for a long period of time because, as the dollar deteriorated through most of the period when   we had reserves, we were engendering capital gains and nobody cared  And if our official forecast,   at least as embodied in the Greenbook materializes, we will generate capital gains again  And one   can argue that it may be desirable to do that  But I think the truth of the matter, as you correctly   point out, is that every time we’ve endeavored to come at this issue in a formalized policy-oriented   manner, we have failed largely because it is not the Federal Reserve that has the ultimate authority to   make that judgment  My impression basically is that it has become an issue that nobody wishes to   confront  And I guess that’s really underscored by the fact that none of us knows exactly how much   we have in the way of reserves, whereas 5 or 10 years ago I could tell you how much we had within       17  25 francs--Swiss francs, that is--when we used to hold them  But I would gather that if the dollar   continues to strengthen and if the losses we publish, which are true or real losses, rise substantially,   Congress is going to start to react  It hasn’t  I haven’t received a single note, question, or anything   of that sort in any of my contacts with the Congress  And to my knowledge neither has the Treasury    But that doesn’t answer your question  Maybe the thing to do--not now because we’re approaching   a potential change in administrations--is to have that issue be one of the early items on the agenda   for discussion with the next administration     We can do that now without reference to any particular   federal surplus or deficit  Well, I grant you that if the Treasury were going to do it specifically, it   would--     You are talking about Quemoy?  [Laughter]     I think that issue really ought to be on the agenda for one of   our early Treasury lunches with the new administration  We bring it up every once in a while with   the hopes that they will rationalize their policy  And we might as well keep trying  Are there any   further questions with respect to the euro diversification issue that’s reflected in Peter’s memo?  I   hear no objection, so I assume that you could proceed with that  We need a vote on domestic   operations     Without objection  Also, in my enthusiasm to welcome our   new member, I forgot to ask for a motion to approve the minutes of the previous meeting and I do so   now  Would somebody like to move approval?   SPEAKER(?)  So move   SEVERAL(?)  Move approval     Nobody remembers these things!  In any event Lynn, let’s   do that next time  The next meeting will be on October 3rd and we will now adjourn for lunch      END OF MEETING            Without objection  Let’s now move on to the staff   briefings and the Committee discussion  I call on Dave Stockton and Karen Johnson      President Parry     President Broaddus     President Jordan     Further questions for our colleagues?  If not, who would   like to start the discussion?  President Moskow   PRESIDENT MOSKOW  Thank you, Mr Chairman  When we met in June, one of the   key challenges that we faced was assessing whether the moderation in demand we’d seen at that   point was real  Now we have tangible evidence in the affirmative  Both the anecdotal reports and   the statistical data confirm that demand growth moderated from the first quarter to the second    Today the question we face is whether the slowing will persist or if instead we will see a rebound, as   we have several times in the last few years   Reports in the Seventh District suggest it’s more likely that the moderate pace will persist   in the second half of the year  In support of this assessment, the list of industries citing slowing has   increased and now includes retailing, motor vehicles--especially heavy trucks--machine tools, steel,   aluminum, and paper  Housing in the Midwest had been doing relatively better than in the rest of the   United States, but recently it has moved more in line with the slowing that we’ve seen nationally    As to Al Broaddus’ point, we have not seen any bounceback in the Midwest in the housing area     In terms of consumer spending, most retailers reported overall slowing, with July sales   marked by weakness in apparel and strength in home-related items such as appliances and furniture    One of our directors from the retail industry indicated that this pattern had continued into August    He said that back-to-school sales were disappointing so far  Actually, he said they “stink”    [Laughter]  But customers were in the stores and buying other items  Another retailing contact noted   continued but moderating gains in sales of furniture and housewares  Light vehicle sales are down       30  from the exceedingly strong pace earlier this year, having leveled off at an annual sales rate of 17   million units over the last three months  Automakers are not expecting sales in August and the rest   of the year to deviate significantly from recent levels  However, inventories are somewhat higher   than desired and incentives continue to be very important in supporting sales  One of the Big Three   automakers indicated that it expects to reduce production levels later this year rather than increase   incentives further  In addition, business demand has ebbed or is at relatively low levels for some   manufactured products important to our District  Heavy truck makers, for example, noted continued   significant slowing in activity, and some have announced layoffs  Production of farm equipment is   up somewhat from the low levels of a year ago, but demand remains modest  Due to favorable   growing conditions, record corn and soybean crops are projected for this year, which has contributed   to lower commodity prices and extended the expected recovery period for many areas of the farm   sector    Labor markets are still tight in the Midwest, but we’ve had some signs and reports of   modest easing  The unemployment rate for our five states has been drifting up since early this year   and, while it’s still below the nation’s, the differential has narrowed  Some contacts in the retailing   and restaurant industries noted less difficulty finding workers in the Midwest     In contrast to this evidence, the latest Manpower survey indicates continued strong   demand for labor in the Midwest and all other regions of the United States  Hiring plans for the   fourth quarter are higher than in any year-end quarter in the 25-year history of the survey  However,   our contact at Manpower senses that there has been some easing in labor markets; it’s a feeling   based on discussions with their staff and their clients rather than on hard data  The Manpower   survey results won’t be released until August 28th, so they should be treated confidentially until then       31  Turning to the national outlook, the probability of a soft landing seems to have increased   over the last two months  First, there’s clear evidence of moderating demand  Second, the news on   productivity growth has been outstanding  And third, core PCE inflation has remained modest in   recent months  Although I still believe that the risks are tilted toward higher inflation, I’m   reasonably comfortable with the current stance of monetary policy  One wild card, of course, is the   outlook for a continuing deterioration of the current account deficit  The good news for now is that   our high productivity growth makes the United States an attractive place for foreign capital   investment  But as we discussed earlier, we must be mindful that capital flows can reverse quickly,   putting pressure on the dollar and interest rates  That adjustment process would be stressful for the   US economy and would increase inflationary pressures  Nevertheless, my view is that the US   economy seems well positioned for a soft landing this year     President Parry     President Guynn     President Hoenig     President Minehan     President Broaddus       40    President Stern     President McTeer      President Poole       46    President Jordan     President Santomero     Vice Chair     Governor Ferguson     Governor Gramlich     Governor Meyer     Governor Kelley     Thank you  Shall we adjourn for coffee, which I think   we’ve all earned?   [Coffee break]     Mr Kohn     Questions for Don?    Further questions for Don?  If not, let me get started  I think   there is a fairly general consensus that we are observing a marked slowdown in the growth of   consumer demand after a very strong performance earlier this year  Motor vehicle sales clearly are   down, although the data for August, seasonally adjusted, were little changed from the July numbers    Chain store sales have been quite weak recently, and the data that came out this morning show   significant weakness in mid-August  And in general we are seeing significant softness in all the   housing-related consumer goods markets    One of the elements in our models on which we have very considerable difficulty getting a   good fix is the inventories of consumer goods held by households  Because those inventories tend to   behave very much like the inventories of steel, aluminum, and textiles in individual business   establishments, we would expect retail demand to soften in the event of a backup in inventories of   household goods  But, there just is no evidence of any satiation of consumer demand, especially   taking account of the fact that we as consumers spend an increasing proportion of our money on   impalpable services  Clearly, we can clog up our closets with clothes and our driveways with motor   vehicles, and our stock of appliances can simply get out of hand, which I can assure you is my current   situation  [Laughter]  Nonetheless, I find new things on which to spend money all the time  Even so,   it remains true that to the extent we are still dealing to a significant degree with a goods-related   economy, the excess inventories in households are an important factor that is sometimes overlooked   when we evaluate the economic outlook           72    To be sure, our model does have an inventory adjustment process, and indeed we are   seeing that the stock of consumer goods--mainly, of course, durable goods--has been rising at a faster   pace per capita or per household than in the past  While that is not to say that consumer demand has   reached a point of saturation, history does suggest the existence of a cyclical adjustment process as   inventories go up  And as they go up at an excessively rapid pace, as they indeed have been doing for   the last number of years, there is a tendency for the rate of accumulation to slow  When that   slowdown occurs, it works its way back into the type of environment we currently are observing in   the consumer area  Clearly, the wealth effect is interrelated with this process             It is difficult to judge the extent to which the sharp rise in energy prices has   effectively removed purchasing power from the marketplace  What we see at the end of the day is a   softened consumer sector whose growth rate is well below what it was earlier, but growth continues   nonetheless  There is no evidence of which I am aware that suggests the consumer is pulling back to   an extent that is potentially destabilizing for the economic outlook  As consumer and indeed housing   expenditures soften, there is a feedback into the intermediate products industries and the slowing   reported by an increasing number of such industries, which Mike Moskow mentioned earlier today, is   generally what one would expect under those conditions   In complete contrast to developments in the consumer and housing sectors is what is going   on in the capital goods markets  Here what we are observing, as we have discussed on many   occasions previously, is a continuing increase in prospective rates of return on new capital equipment,   especially high-tech  There really is no low-tech equipment anymore  There is no old-fashioned type   of capital equipment worth its name  As a consequence we are beginning to see a spillover from the   SIC classifications, which is how we often designate high technology  In any event, overall capital   investment continues to boom, an indication obviously that the expected rates of return, which had          73   previously been presumed to be on the rise, actually have materialized  We can see that in two ways    One is that plant managers are continuously ordering an ever-increasing menu of these types of   equipment, which means they are seeing that it works We obviously are seeing the same   phenomenon in the productivity data, which effectively are one way to envisage the real return on   capital  And indeed we are seeing it in still increasing long-term earnings forecasts by security   analysts  As I have mentioned before, the latter may not be very knowledgeable about what is going   on in the business world, but they are reasonably good reporters of what the companies that they   follow are saying about their longer-term outlooks That invariably means that productivity in the   individual companies is showing continued and irreversible increases  At some point, perhaps not   that far down the road, that is going to change  Indeed, it invariably must change because the history   of these types of technological surges or shifts in technology S-curves shows that they lose   momentum after a point  For example, once the availability and use of electricity became pervasive   throughout the economy, its rate of growth slowed quite appreciably  In fact, it slowed to such an   extent that new generating plants were not built as needed, and we can observe the problems that have   resulted from that    At the moment, however, what we see is a quite extraordinary surge in capital investment   whose direct impact on productivity involves a fairly straightforward relationship with a lag  The   analytical problem that exists when we have this type of productivity-driven economy is that it is by   no means clear whether the increased capital investment will create a larger expansion of demand   than potential supply    There are two elements here  One is the time lag that exists between capital expenditures   and the completion of facilities and their operation at full potential  The other is the coefficient that   relates increases in capital stock to increases in capacity  As Larry Meyer pointed out, the evidence          74   to date suggests that the overall impact of accelerating capital investment has been to increase   demand more than potential supply  The result, as we all have perceived, is that we have seen a   significant decline in the unemployment rate and a tightening of the labor markets  If this process   were to persist, it strikes me as pretty much inevitable that we would have to be continuously   tightening  This is because the excess of demand over supply of goods and services would reflect   itself in an excess of long-term credit demands versus long-term savings  Were that the case, real   long-term interest rates would be continuing to rise, but they are not  And the reason they are not is   that personal consumption expenditures and spending on housing have moderated, and that slowing   has helped to offset the very strong growth in capital expenditures  We don't know the eventual   extent of the slowdown  Most of you have indicated that even though consumer demand has indeed   slowed in your Districts, there is no evidence of any cumulative deterioration  Consumer confidence   clearly has not deteriorated  So what we are looking at may well be a pattern of slower growth in   household spending that could continue for a while yet  And so long as it continues, the pressure will   be off the markets    The acceleration of price inflation is essentially still a forecast  Ned Gramlich's table   showed that the year-over-year PCE core is up only 03 percent  The July-over-July number is up a   little more, but most interestingly the rate of increase of core PCE inflation for the last three months   is, as I recall, only slightly higher than 1/2 percent at an annual rate  This is the lowest three-month   number that I have seen in the series going back a number of years  But as Bill Poole points out, we   may be missing the boat here by looking exclusively at the core rate when clearly energy prices are   moving   The electric power shortage is a very serious problem, as those of you in the West   particularly know  Because demand for electricity had slipped for a while, new power plant          75   construction came to a virtual halt, abetted by environmental controls or regulations and a number of   other obstacles that essentially dissuaded utility companies from building new power plants  So, we   have ended up with what is a really serious potential crisis     The crude oil markets are also tightening up  There is not all that much excess crude   production capacity in the Gulf states, which is where almost all of it exists  Saudi Arabia has   perhaps 3 million barrels a day of additional capacity  Kuwait has some  Iraq has some  But it is by   no means clear what the inclination may be to produce and bring those crude supplies to market  As   a consequence, the steady underlying growth in crude demand is having an impact on prices  OPEC   production is lagging because it is very difficult for a country like Saudi Arabia, which has very   significant fiscal problems, to increase its oil output knowing its aggregate revenues could very well   fall as a consequence  Accordingly, as the Greenbook indicates, it is not clear that energy prices will   automatically come down  It is true that the exploration and development budgets of the major oil   companies have gone up very materially, and experience suggests that newer technologies have   enabled the takeout from existing wells to improve markedly As a result, additional sources of non-  OPEC crude will become available, but not to a substantial extent before another year or two  It is   hard to know what is going to happen before then      Natural gas is a disaster waiting to happen  Here again, the earlier slowdown in demand   for power left natural gas prices at relatively modest levels  As a consequence drilling declined fairly   materially  And we are now in a position where the natural gas inventories in storage are about as   low as I remember them     In sum, we have a situation where all three major sources of power are strained and   interacting on the prices of energy  In the circumstances, the notion of looking solely at core prices   may still be comforting but only up to a very limited point  The reason is that rising prices that          76   ordinarily bring added supply forward clearly are working less than adequately to produce that result   in the energy sector currently  As a consequence, while inflation has not worsened materially in the   sense of a spillover of higher energy prices into core prices, that outcome is inevitable unless energy   prices start to come down  Energy remains a very fundamental part of the cost structure even though   admittedly very significantly less so than it used to be  But it is still significant enough to create a   problem if we suddenly get a major acceleration in energy prices, especially in crude oil prices   Where all this leaves us, obviously, is with a slowing economy but clearly one that has   remarkably good characteristics of stability  The major excesses that we were all concerned about for   the last couple of years seem to be diminishing  The gap between aggregate supply and demand is   beginning to close  And indeed, the Greenbook forecast implies that that gap will narrow   considerably more over the next year and a half  We obviously have a significant amount of   monetary policy tightening still in the pipeline stemming from the policy moves that have been   implemented since June of last year, including several moves earlier this year  Clearly, by any   measure those policy actions could not yet have worked their way fully through the system  So we   are in a situation where a lot of things could be fairly significantly worse, but they are not  I conclude   from all of this that we ought to stay where we are  There is no need to move at this particular point    At the same time, it would be highly risky in my judgment to depart from the bias that we used to call   “asymmetric toward tightening”  I still have not learned the language we are now using to describe   our policy bias!  In any event, my cost-benefit analysis of where we are at this stage and where we   want to be leads me at least for now to a no change directive and retention of the statement that the   risks are toward higher inflation  I would like to put that out on the table for discussion  Vice Chair     President Hoenig     I can’t speak for everybody  I think we are moving in that   direction but I don't think we are there yet  I believe the labor market still is the overwhelming   problem but clearly less so proportionally than it was, certainly at the last meeting     I think that is a valid issue to raise at the next meeting    President Poole     President Guynn     President Santomero          79     President Parry     Governor Meyer     President Broaddus     President Stern     Governor Gramlich     President Minehan     President Moskow     Governor Kelley     President Jordan     Governor Ferguson          83     President McTeer     Would the Secretary read the appropriate language for the   directive and the statement that the balance of risks is toward inflation?     Call the roll please     Lynn Fox, would you hand out the version of the press   release that hopefully captures the substance of the Committee’s discussion?  [Pause]  Is this   statement satisfactory to all concerned?     SPEAKER(?)  Amen!     Obviously we can give you the whole statement, but what   we can do, if you prefer, is to give you the operative paragraphs  There are only really two operative   paragraphs in this     SEVERAL  Yes     The rest is boilerplate  We could do that readily so that you   would be able to compare them fairly quickly       I will say that when we draft this, we do it with precisely   that in mind  But we may not do it to your satisfaction  [Laughter]  It may not be a bad idea to have   the comparison in front of us     Good morning, everyone  We begin with Peter Fisher     Someone will think of a phrase to describe it, like “money   speaks louder than words”           How much money did the American taxpayer lose by our   buying 750 million euros at a higher price than we would have had there not been front-running?      It’s at least a couple of percent     We should complain and ask for restitution!  My second   question relates to the exhibit on swap rates and other yields  You indicated with regard to the rather   significant closing of the spreads in 30-year swaps versus Treasuries that the calendar was a factor    But if the private calendar were an element in that, we would have seen more than a modest rise in   the swap rates  The presumption that there is no credit improvement involved almost leads one to   conclude that what we’re looking at is the potential demise of the 30-year Treasury issue  The   probability of that demise has gone down quite significantly for the reasons you suggested--about   everyone in the political arena wants to spend part of the surplus  I agree to half that phrase  The   political campaign has weeks to go and the presumption that there will be any surplus left is   questionable!  Why can’t we say that virtually all of that closing in the spreads is attributable to the   expectation of running out of US Treasury securities?  It’s a supply problem, but the problem   obviously is the issue of a greater potential supply of US Treasuries rather than the private   calendar  Would that be an accurate way of looking at it?     I’m just raising the point that one certainly can explain the   firming of a 30-year swap rate in those terms  But the presumption that the fairly significant decline   in the spreads is attributable to anything other than the potential long-term supply of 30-year   Treasuries I find somewhat less convincing  Am I wrong in that?     No, I had no intention of doing that  I never put zero   weight on anything!  [Laughter]     Or 100  Further questions for Peter?  President Parry       You know the Treasury, to its credit, feels uncomfortable   dealing directly with another central bank except through us  And I think in that regard--     It’s largely that     Let me comment  First of all, you left out in your analysis   of sterilized intervention the most extraordinary set of experiments proving it doesn’t work, which is   the Japanese experience employing $20 billion against the dollar with zero effect  There is no   evidence, nor does anybody here believe that there is any evidence, to confirm that sterilized   intervention does anything  We don’t believe it  The Treasury doesn’t believe it  The Europeans   do, but that’s another question     When is the last time we intervened?     Between June of 1998 and today--or I should say last   week--we probably had 20 or so different requests, at various levels, for intervention  We turned   them all down  And indeed, in this latest case we were not happy with the notion of intervening    What occurred essentially was that the Treasury, feeling under very considerable pressure from the   rest of the G-7, concluded that in the spirit of international comity we had very little choice but to   accommodate the Europeans--                                     We, the Federal Reserve, did have the choice of   saying we would not participate  The presumption that we could do that without it being known is   not believable  We publish data on our intervention activity and if we don’t participate with the   Treasury, it becomes known  Now, that would create a schism within the United States government    And the question we have to evaluate is whether our concerns about the inefficacy and potentially      15  counterproductive effects of sterilized intervention are far more significant than the schism that   would be created with the Treasury  In my judgment the answer is no, for the same reason that we   acquiesce in an awful lot of crazy economics that go on out there--not only in the international realm   among our trading partners, but within the rest of the US government  We do have to maintain a   relationship with them  We are independent, to be sure, but not from the Congress  Indeed we are   not  So I think we have a very serious difficulty in making these tradeoffs     I told                                 when we were talking about it in advance, that the thing we have   to be concerned about is the probability that this intervention will fail  And a failure of the   intervention as we go into the G-7 meeting would put extraordinary political pressure on everybody   to say something  I said to him If this fails, will you support a statement that says that Europe must   address the fundamentals, which indeed are the cause of the weakness in the euro?  And he said   absolutely yes  I can’t second-guess the Treasury on this; they have been very good over the last   number of years and would probably not disagree with a word you said with respect to the   evaluation of intervention  I think what we have to do is to make judgments as to how important   certain issues are  I don’t deny that this is an important issue  But I just do not think, at the level at   which we are intervening and the infrequency with which we are doing it, that it creates an ongoing   problem for us  Is it a negative?  I agree with you that it is  Is it a significant negative?  I don’t think   so  Would I have preferred that we didn’t intervene?  I certainly would  Would we be strongly   opposed to another intervention?  We told them we would be  They wanted to create some ongoing   possibilities of intervention over a period of days, and we said absolutely not in terms of making any   commitment  We did not shut the door completely  We said that in all cases intervention is a batch   process  We do them one at a time but in the context of the conditions in each individual case  And   I would say that so far this Treasury has been a lot less likely to cave in to foreign pressures than      16  previous ones  And in view of that I believe they deserve our support even though we do it with, I   think, some significant chagrin  That’s my view, anyway       Sure     Frankly, I seriously question whether it is worth   fundamentally altering our relationship with the Treasury over what is effectively a very minor   change  Remember that our money is really their money  If there is such a thing as a shareholder of   the Federal Reserve, it is the US Treasury  To the extent that we profit or lose in our foreign   exchange operations, it nets out against our payment to the Treasury each year  In that sense it’s      18  always their money with which we are trading  Whether we are splitting the intervention amounts   50/50 or 100/0, the net effect on Treasury budget receipts, so to speak, is invariant  So it is an act   that essentially involves nonsubstantive accounting  I don’t see what we avail doing that  I think we   do far better going out periodically as we do--we all do--saying that intervention doesn’t work   We’ve all said that publicly and I think that’s far more relevant than our going through the motion of   not participating in the transaction, of not doing 50 percent  I think that creates more problems than   it solves     The presumption being there was front-running     We are not just talking about the market going up  We’re   saying that a decision was made on Thursday--at what time?                                                    I think you’re raising a slightly different issue  The degree   of open market operations required to keep an interest rate constant, and hence the creation of, in our   case dollars and in their case euros, can vary  So it is not the same thing as saying that if the interest      21  rate target is unchanged, the result is full sterilization in the sense that the actual open market   operations offset the foreign exchange operations euro for euro  As a practical matter it is very   close, but it doesn’t have to be exact because they don’t endeavor to do a full sterilization in the   sense that the asset side of their balance sheet is literally unchanged and they merely shift from one   currency to the other  They don’t do that  What they do is to target an interest rate  Basically the   net effect of that is almost exactly as if they were to offset the exchange rate transactions euro for   euro  But it is not exactly that type of full sterilization  Nor does anybody do it that way  President   Broaddus     I think we are doing that  We are doing it, hopefully, by   education  I’ve had innumerable conversations with our counterparts in the central banks of Japan   and Europe arguing the inefficacy of this kind of operation  A lot of us have  I know Bill   McDonough has done that and so have a lot of others  And it has worked in part  I believe there has   been a very major change in the general view about the efficacy of intervention among the central      22  bankers  The problem is that finance ministers change with some frequency  We convince one and   then he leaves office  And his replacement starts tabula rasa  And it is by no means self evident that   a currency cannot be stopped from moving merely by intervening  There are lots of economists who   believe that  I won’t go through a list of our friends who do, but there are some fairly prominent   economists out there who seriously believe that we can effectively implement sterilized intervention   and make it work  If one can’t convince them, then it’s pretty tough to convince a political person   whose background is somewhat marginal in this area  But frankly, education is the best way that I   know of to solve this problem--in other words to get less interest in intervention as a possible   solution  And I would say that we’ve succeeded to a very large extent with the G-10 governors  We   have just not done all that well with the rotating G-7 or G-10 finance ministers       Supposing intervention works and we use it  What would   that do to our credibility?     Absolutely, but it has nothing to do with our credibility  It   may say that our policy positions are conceptually inaccurate or inappropriate     But supposing people could argue that sterilized   intervention actually enhanced an anti-inflationary posture?  If that were factually so, we would   affect our credibility by not intervening  It’s a factual issue; I don’t think it’s a credibility issue     Any further comments?  If not, would somebody like to   move to ratify the foreign exchange activities of the Desk?     Is there a second?     Objections?  Thank you  They are approved     Would somebody like to move to ratify the domestic operations?      As you all know, we have received the initial installment of   the SOMA study and Tom Simpson is here to brief us on it     I am terribly sorry, yes!  I took a look at the clock and   decided it was running fast!  Let’s look at the draft announcement  [Pause]     I presume that silence indicates acceptance?   SEVERAL  Yes       Tom Simpson     Questions for Tom?  Governor Gramlich     President Parry     Well, we can replicate what Bill McDonough was   suggesting for the December meeting at some point  This is important enough       Of course the new administration and the Congress may   take the issue out of our hands and make it all moot     But it strikes me that one question that has to be on the   table is Do we maintain the same form of open market operations that we always have?  If you look   at the size of these required alternative assets, you could buy a lot of baseball teams  I know one I'd   like to sell you!  [Laughter]    SPEAKER(?)  We’re okay, thanks     President Minehan      We are going to start to run out of alternatives     You mean currency?     I think what this tells us is that this whole issue is much   closer up front than I think most of us have intuitively suspected  It is very difficult to get around   the fact that if the off-budget items stay off budget and this actually acts as a unified budget surplus,   the arithmetic is awesome     Okay, any further questions?  Shall we go to lunch?  The   next meeting is Wednesday, November 15th   END OF MEETING                                                Without objection, they are approved   Before we move on to the economic discussion, let me just say that this issue of   intervention will reemerge periodically and I think this was a very useful discussion   I believe the      24  notion that you raised is an important one and was well worth discussing  But if any of you have   significant thoughts on this issue, a memorandum to either Peter or Don or Karen would be useful to   give us a fuller view of where the Committee is in this regard  Let’s turn now to Dave Stockton and   Karen Johnson     Are there any useful data supporting the general notion of a   modest slowdown in the rate of flow of capital from Europe to the United States?  What do we know   about that?  I ask because I keep seeing a number mentioned which I don’t quite see in the balance   of payments data     We do have portfolio data?     It takes a long time for it to go from there to here     Other questions for Karen or David?      31    Governor Gramlich     President Minehan     If nobody else has questions or comments, would   somebody like to start the Committee discussion?  President Parry     President Guynn     President Broaddus     President Santomero     President McTeer     President Moskow       President Jordan     Thank you   To avoid the coffee break running into lunch,   I suggest we pause here and resume with Tom Hoenig   [Coffee break]     President Hoenig     President Minehan     President Stern     Vice Chair     President Poole     Governor Gramlich     Governor Ferguson     Governor Meyer     Governor Kelley     Thank you very much  Don Kohn     Questions for Don?  If not, considering the late hour I’ll try   either to say less or to speak faster or some combination of the two!   The members’ response to the latest Greenbook suggests to me that everybody likes the   alternative simulations presented there by the staff  The trouble is that each simulation gives us a      75  different forecast! The staff has covered the full spectrum of forces shaping the current outlook and   indeed has given us, I think, a fairly incisive view of the true ranges of probabilities in a situation   where something very unusual is happening I’m not talking about the high-tech developments,   which we have been discussing for quite a long period of time  We don't know much more than we   did earlier about those developments, but at least we think we are beginning to understand them    The latest Greenbook has taken the oil/energy problem and has superimposed it on the high-tech   uncertainties And, as a number of you have said, what we infer from that is that choosing the   appropriate forecast is clearly quite problematic   So far as I can judge, there is nothing terribly significant going on in the economy excluding   energy  The productivity numbers still seem to be accelerating modestly, but the levels of actual   output per hour have moved into a range where it's just not credible that they can continue to rise and   ultimately reflect still higher structural productivity in the areas where we’re already seeing large   increases in current output per hour, even cyclically adjusted  So one must be skeptical about those   productivity numbers in the sense that it’s startling to see their second derivative remain positive   after having been positive for so long Moreover, that second derivative has been a larger number   than one would ordinarily expect  Part of the problem is the flattening out of the statistical   discrepancy, which has taken the official GDP-based productivity data to a new high rate of growth   whereas the income-based productivity estimates, specifically for nonfinancial corporations, have   not shown the fairly pronounced changes that have occurred in the official data in the last year   The long-term forecasts of earnings by security analysts, as I have said before, are not an   indication of the true forecast but largely reflect what corporate America thinks about its future   There is just no slowing in those forecasts for the longer term both for high-tech and for non high-  tech firms, despite the fact that forecasts for the short term have turned quite disappointing and      76  indeed have fostered some really bizarre stock price movements among some of the larger and fairly   well established high-tech firms  The implication is that these companies are still finding projects in   which to invest where they anticipate significant rates of return over the longer term One does not   see any significant diminution of that earnings outlook phenomenon, despite the fact that   productivity increases have risen to fairly elevated levels   The one thing I find somewhat of a concern here is that we are not getting in any of these   views about the outlook for earnings the type of impact that substantial energy price changes clearly   must be having  Don Kohn reflected on the increasing costs that clearly are there for business firms   despite the fact that the intensity of energy usage is half what it was thirty years ago  So we clearly   are not looking at the type of environment that we had in the past  But remember that a goodly part   of that very significant decline in energy inputs relative to real GDP had occurred by 1985 and yet   there is no doubt that the Gulf War did have a significant impact on economic activity, basically, as   best we can judge, through its effects on consumer confidence  The comments around this table   indicate that consumer confidence is holding up very well, although the revision of the University of   Michigan numbers for September suggests a fairly sharp deterioration in attitudes in the second half   of the month  I don’t know whether or not this is an aberration, but it's the first sign that any of our   measures of consumer confidence have run into trouble  If in fact that is what is happening, then the   oil price-energy price phenomenon is really beginning to have an impact  And indeed we are   beginning to see some economic effects  If we separate high-tech from low-tech in the orders   figures, which is how we tend to look at these numbers, lo and behold low-tech is doing very well    But it is doing very well because the surge in electric power capacity problems has led to some very   substantial increases in orders for engines and turbines and related backlogs that are having an   impact in the economy        77  In any event, I think the crucial problem here rests fundamentally with oil and our   interpretation of its role  We have seen over the years that even though we tend to refer to oil as part   of the old economy, it really is not  If we look at the extraordinary technological advances that have   occurred in the industry, they really are quite awesome  The capability of using seismic exploration   to find oil has led to a major reduction in the cost of finding oil in any given oil extraction   environment  The ratio of dry holes to exploratory wells has come down dramatically  The   development of various deep and horizontal drilling technologies has lowered the real cost of   extracting oil in a quite significant way  If one merely looked at the underlying technologies and   asked what was happening to the long-term marginal cost of finding new oil, clearly one would   conclude that it has been coming down fairly dramatically as indeed it has outside the OPEC area In   fact, the ability of other producers to offset OPEC has been quite impressive until very recently    Actually, until fairly recently OPEC production was remarkably flat for many years, obviously   reflecting a slowdown in world demand associated with the reduction in the intensity of oil usage but   also, surprisingly, a significant increase in the production of non-OPEC oil   The difficulty that the non-OPEC oil countries are having is that the environment in which   they have to seek and drill for oil is becoming increasingly less hospitable We may be getting lower   costs for any given type of oil exploration and drilling environment, but if the environment is   worsening one would expect, and indeed one sees, that a significant part of those cost improvements   is being countermanded, so to speak  Nonetheless, until very recently the evidence that the long-  term equilibrium price of oil was declining was really quite impressive We have data on this, which   is separate from the anecdotal reports of the oil companies  Essentially the data show that the price   trend in the futures market for oil, specifically the long-term or 3- to 6-year futures prices of West   Texas Intermediate, was edging downward until very recently Two years ago, for example, prices in      78  the futures markets would start at $12 a barrel and rise to $17 where they would flatten out for long-  term contracts  When spot prices rose, futures prices would go quite a bit higher for shorter-term   contracts and then come down in “backwardation,” flattening out at $17 or $18 a barrel This   behavior suggested that, to the extent that the futures markets reflect the true long-term marginal   equilibrium price, the latter was somewhere in the area of $17 or $18 a barrel, West Texas   Intermediate equivalent   Because the oil industry has another very important characteristic, in part I might add   reflecting the advanced technology that it employs, it runs on very low usable inventories  Indeed,   the latter might be described as close to fumes but not quite  Ordinarily over the last decade or so,   usable stocks of oil have supplied about 13 days of demand, down from earlier periods  And   because there is only a 13-day supply in the world market, we have an extraordinarily sensitive oil   price structure  Indeed, what we have seen historically is that oil prices are extremely volatile and   they are volatile in a very interesting way  They spike  We have had significant spikes all along the   way and what this suggests is a very high inelasticity of response to changing demand   As a consequence, when OPEC was able in the spring of 1998 to bring its production level   down by a fairly pronounced amount--they brought it down about 3 million barrels a day, which is a   huge number--that effectively began to open up a significant gap between demand, which was rising   gradually, and supply  The 15-day supply of usable stock available at that time started to evaporate   very rapidly  That stock finally got down to a 10-day supply and the spot price of crude, as you   know, rose at a very rapid pace  The effect was a very dramatic “backwardation” as they say in the   markets, namely spot prices rose to $37 per barrel prior to their very recent decline  At the same   time, the equilibrium price of oil probably did not change very much even though longer-term   futures added $2 or $3 per barrel, largely I suspect because of uncertainties about the potential      79  degree of excess world capacity over the long term In this situation, it was very difficult to build   inventories  With the very substantial backwardation that occurred why would a refiner buy crude at   $37 a barrel and as it was being refined find out two months later that it was worth $3 or $4 a barrel   less?  So inventories were not being built up anywhere in the system, and indeed they were kept at   extremely low levels, thereby exaggerating the price acceleration  Finally, OPEC was induced to   raise their production quite significantly We did see the pickup in inventories that one would expect   When the gap between supply and demand closed, the decline in inventories initially slowed, and   stocks then started to turn up     There is an interesting oddity in the recent data Domestic demand for oil products is   accelerating and production is going up very dramatically This raises the interesting question as to   whether or not the domestic shipment numbers reflect what is actually happening to demand   Remember, those numbers cover shipments from refineries and the primary inventory complex and   do not reflect the buildup in inventories either at retail gasoline service stations or more importantly   at homes in the form of heating oil All this is very suggestive of the probability that underlying   demand is not accelerating but that inventories, because they cannot be held at the refinery level   without potential loss, are beginning to increase at the tertiary level  Indeed, if we look at the United   States, and this is true elsewhere, the demand for distillate fuel has risen exceptionally rapidly in the   last two or three months  In fact, in comparison with a year ago, it probably is up the equivalent of   perhaps 300,000 or 400,000 barrels above the normal daily average in the United States  What this   suggests is that there has been a massive run by the American public to buy home heating oil  They   are not using it yet  It is not winter!  So where is it going?  Inventories are going up in all the   secondary storage areas So, the presumption that there is a home heating oil shortage is something   that only people who don't watch the markets believe  This has been the most publicized shortage in      80  recent memory, which is a guarantee that it is not happening!  And indeed the presumed shortage   raises some very interesting questions about the outlook for oil because, seasonally adjusted, we are   seeing a very dramatic increase in aggregate world inventory accumulation currently  Without   seasonal adjustment, one ordinarily would expect world inventories to contract in the fourth quarter,   and the evidence at this point is that they are not  OPEC production has gone up over 3 million   barrels a day, possibly even more than that, and is now much higher than its level before the OPEC-  engineered price acceleration     So part of the answer to the question of what is holding oil prices where they are is that   capacity is very restrained  There is very little in the way of surplus capacity in the system  Leaving   the inventory issue aside, there is the risk of a spike that is creating major speculative buying in the   crude market and in the product markets  And, as was mentioned before, there is a very serious   concern that Iraq, which is producing 2-1/2 to 3 million barrels a day, may suddenly decide that they   are having a production problem  If we take a chunk of crude that big out of the world system, that   could do wonders to oil prices because outside of Iraq there is just a little more than one million   barrels a day left in available world production capacity  If there are any breakdowns anywhere they   could create some serious problems  But what is happening here is that levels of production are high   because the demand for inventories has surged, as reflected in both the published primary data and in   the unpublished tertiary data  The consequence has to be a real inventory bloat  It is unclear how all   this is going to work out because the inventory problem could disappear if Saddam decides that he   has enough cash and doesn't need any more money from oil sales, or we could have a variety of   breakdowns    In sum, it is very difficult to forecast the price of oil  The one thing we are pretty sure of, if   history is any guide, is that if we get another spike it will reverse itself provided that we can get      81  through this winter, get through the threats coming from Iraq, and hopefully the Middle East does   not go berserk  There are a lot of uncertainties in the outlook for oil that, depending on their   resolution, can fundamentally alter the overall course of the economy Those uncertainties have to be   changing the structure of our capital stock, making it somewhat less efficient  They must be creating   negatives that we really don't recognize and don’t get picked up or have never been picked up by our   econometric models  Simulate the 1973 experience, the 1979 experience, the Gulf War experience,   and I will bet that your results will not produce the recessions that actually occurred  What this   suggests is an asymmetric impact of the oil and energy price effect  Remember, natural gas is a big   problem  Electric power is a big problem  So this is not a situation akin to the old environment   where coal was able to keep the cost of electric power down  We have a whole series of problems   here  We may very readily agree that the most likely forecast is the one right in the middle of the   Greenbook It tells us that everything will be just fine  But these markets are really very tricky and   the presumption that everything is going to work out well is still, in my judgment, a hope   As a consequence, as far as policy is concerned the general consensus around the table, and   in my judgment the right one, is to do nothing today  But the risks clearly remain on the up side as   far as inflation is concerned largely because of the energy difficulties that we have discussed  Even   though I recognize all the arguments that were made with regard to productivity, the NAIRU, and   the assumption of accelerating unit labor costs, they clearly reflect risks that suggest we have to be   fairly vigilant in our assessment of developments bearing on the intermediate economic outlook   Vice Chair     Tom Hoenig     President Guynn     President Minehan     President Broaddus     President Poole     Yes it does     It had the same effect of cutting OPEC production by a   fairly significant amount     Demand was not strong  The data indicating strengthening   demand are very recent  It was not strong in 1998     Yes, but we don't know to what extent the domestic   demand numbers, which have unquestionably taken off, reflect consumption or tertiary inventory   accumulation     If Saddam does something, you'll change your mind?     Indeed!  President Moskow     Governor Kelley      84    Governor Ferguson     President Jordan     President Santomero     Governor Gramlich     Governor Meyer     President McTeer     President Parry     President Stern     Will you read the appropriate language?      85    Call the roll     Good morning, everyone  Would someone like to   move approval of the minutes of the October 3rd meeting?     Without objection  Peter Fisher        I'm not forecasting this, but suppose we had an   unanticipated need for significant easing  Is the structure in the markets out there thick enough   for us to be able to do it without creating some problems?     Are we anywhere near the point where you're getting   concerned about the supply?  Theoretically, as you know, we can get to a point where we could   have significant disruptive effects in the markets if we stayed with our current procedures and   had to introduce a dramatic amount of ease into the marketplace  But is it your judgment that   we’re nowhere near that area for the time being?     No, I’m not referring to spreads  I’m referring to the   extent to which we create distortions in the marketplace that have adverse secondary effects     That’s an important part of the answer     That leads me to a related question on an issue you   didn’t mention--the fairly significant opening up of spreads between A-2 industrial corporates   and swap rates between May and now  Are we seeing strictly credit risk there?     I’m sorry, what do you mean by smothered?     Between Fannie and Freddie yields and the swaps?     It’s as if Fannie and Freddie are co-opting the swap   market--      What happens to the benchmark debate under these   conditions?     Finally, with respect to the notion that the strong dollar   is creating real problems for our trading partners, are they recommending that we lower interest   rates or intervene or what?  I’m just asking, because I haven’t heard this  In other words, who is   doing the drawing in, if I may put it that way?  My understanding is that it is their citizens who   are running from their financial markets to ours  And the problem is--       They should be raising serious questions with their   citizens     So, they’re not talking about blocking the inflow of   capital into this country by putting up barriers or imposing tariffs?      You understand my question is purely rhetorical     Further questions for Peter?     Thank you  It’s time to vote, indeed  Would   you read the appropriate language?     Call the roll, please     I’ve read the part of the statement relating to our   assessment of the risks  Well, you can pass it around if anyone wants to take a look at it    Let me just read the first paragraph to you  “The Federal Open Market Committee at its   meeting today decided to maintain the existing stance of monetary policy, keeping its   target for the federal funds rate at 6-1/2 percent”  The rest just states what I read earlier     The next meeting is December 19th  Shall we go to lunch?   END OF MEETING         I think it’s a good one  Further questions?  If not,   would somebody like to make a motion?     We move to Dave Stockton and Vince Reinhart        Thank you  Questions for our colleagues?     But you’re talking about cost, not price  What’s   happening is that the physical volume of medical care is going up very dramatically     But a good part of that is improved medical care   because the technology is moving at a very rapid pace  And it’s pretty obvious that the actual   health insurance premiums reflect far more than price       Indeed, there’s a very serious question among a number   of analysts in this area as to whether medical prices actually have been going down, not up  But   there’s no question that the dollar amounts are very large and very bothersome     Through compensation?    President Moskow               20        President Poole     Governor Gramlich     There’s also a further conceptual problem as to whether   the implicit model that’s in the market is the same as the one we have       President Minehan     President Poole     Any further questions?  If not, who would like to start   the Committee discussion?  President Hoenig     President Guynn     President Parry     President Moskow       President Stern       President McTeer     President Broaddus     President Minehan     President Santomero     First Vice President Pianalto     Vice Chair     President Poole     Governor Gramlich     Governor Ferguson               65        It’s slightly higher     Governor Kelley     Governor Meyer     Before we break, Dave Stockton wanted to make a   comment               73        Shall we break for coffee?   [Coffee break]     Mr Kohn             Questions for Don?  Governor Meyer     President Hoenig     Further questions for Don?  Let me start then     The forces that in my view have been most prominent since the last meeting   are the still high level of oil and energy prices and the evident weakening of profit   margins  In combination, those forces have interacted and exerted a significant effect on   the capital goods markets where a lot of the recent weakness in the economy is coming   from     I think the way to look at the capital goods markets is, first, to try to get a   judgment as to whether in fact expectations of longer-term profitability in those markets   have changed in any material way  The answer apparently is “no”  If we take the   I/B/E/S data, which are really the best we have on profit expectations, real or crazy, those   numbers have not changed  Indeed, including the data for October, long-term expected   earnings per share in the high-tech sector are still at a very high level  Even for the so-  called “old economy,” the thousand-plus security analysts in the I/B/E/S survey still               81      expect earnings to be quite strong  Now, as I have said before, one can argue whether   these forecasts are realistic and whether they are biased, but the truth of the matter is that   they have not deteriorated  And since they have not, one has to conclude that views with   respect to potential productivity increases, not necessarily in terms of the structural   numbers that we use but as reflected in underlying views regarding investment   opportunities, continue quite strong   It's one thing, however, to make an argument that we may be, for example,   only halfway up the S-curve in a long-term technological expansion and conclude that   capital investment is going to continue very strong  But, if we get, as indeed we are   beginning to get, an oversupply in some of the high-tech areas, we are going to see some   weakening in the growth of capital goods expenditures  I think the poster child here is   fiber optics  The rates of return on all types of investments related to fiber optics have   been extraordinarily high, and the demand has been going up at an unbelievable pace    The problem is one of emerging oversupply Those who got into the business early on are   doing extraordinarily well  However, as in commercial real estate ventures where   developers who are first to get in when vacancy rates are low make out like gangbusters,   those who wait to get in may still see low vacancy rates, but if they do not take account of   all the new buildings under construction, they may come off very poorly  That's what has   happened in the bandwidth market The amount of fiber optic capacity has gone up   astronomically  In one sense, as someone mentioned, demand is tripling but supply is   going up sevenfold  And what that means, of course, is that prospective long-term rates   of return must start to fall                82      We are beginning to see the same thing happen, obviously, with regard to the   outlook for short-term profits, and we are beginning to observe a pullback in this   particular type of investment It’s not that five years from now the levels of both demand   and capacity won’t be very significantly higher than they are today  What we have is a   short-term glut, and there's some very considerable evidence that that is indeed the case   in a lot of the high-tech areas  Clearly, that is not a long-term concern, but the markets   don't know about long-term concerns  The stock price levels in a lot of the high-tech   industries have been undercut by very weak output prices, and those industries are   beginning to experience a squeeze on their profit margins    Another factor, for which Board staff has provided some numerical estimates,   is the question of how large the increase in energy costs has been in the nonfinancial   corporate sector  The staff estimates that total energy costs of nonfinancial, nonenergy   corporations have gone up roughly $150 billion since early 1999 When we think of that   in terms of pre-tax profits, it is a very large number, and it's very difficult to get around   the conclusion that a significant part of the erosion in overall profitability is the result of   the inability of business firms to pass through these increases in energy costs    Remember, the rise in energy costs involves not only petroleum  The increase in natural   gas prices and its spillover to electric power account for a large portion of the higher   energy costs  Even coal prices are up somewhat  So we are looking at a very major set   of cost increases that are beginning to have an impact on profitability     Profitability decreases are also a factor moderating the growth of the capital   goods market in the high-tech area  That growth is decelerating from 50 percent to 20   percent, which is not altogether a disaster  But the high-tech area has constituted such a               83      large proportion of GDP growth that even a little deceleration triggers multiplier effects   that are beginning to affect the consumer markets                 We are indeed seeing some softening in consumer expenditures The October   retail sales figures were consistent with the Greenbook forecast of a 3-1/2 percent annual   rate of growth in PCE for the fourth quarter  But November sales are a little softer  We   obviously don't have very much information about motor vehicle sales this month, but we   are getting the same impression you are, President Moskow--namely, that the sales of   most of the major auto companies are running under their forecasts, which seasonally   adjusted already had been set a shade below October levels  Now, that is not necessarily   meaningful at this point because a very big portion of their forecasts is realized in the last   ten days of the month  We all remember the time when they were providing us ten-day   data  Now they say they don't have ten-day data They have daily data, but they don't   have a mechanism to add them up  [Laughter]  At any rate, the tone in the motor vehicle   markets is a little weaker  We are beginning to see that softening spill over into auto   parts, and that is a fairly big portion of the industry  It's the reason why business   conditions in the Cleveland and Chicago Districts, as I listened to the comments from   those Districts, are described as somewhat softer                 The big jump in initial claims a week ago, while largely stemming from the   motor vehicle industry, is not something that we can immediately dismiss  The numbers   that are coming out tomorrow on initial claims are down a bit, but they are still well   above their recent lows  Insured unemployment clearly has moved up in contrast to the   household survey numbers and the related unemployment rate  This dichotomy cannot   go on for very much longer  In other words, we'll either get a fairly significant               84      downward spike in initial claims after we've passed through some of these layoffs, which   would then return the claims data to consistency with a 4 percent unemployment rate    Or, in the alternative, we could see weaker household data and an unemployment rate that   starts to move up  The outcome is not yet clear, and I don't think we are going to know   what it is for a number of weeks               Whether the general slowing of the expansion is being reinforced by   developments on the credit side is a very important issue  As Governor Ferguson pointed   out, our estimates of overall nonfarm business credit are down quite significantly for the   month of October  The tightening that is being reported anecdotally is really quite   impressive, even though it's easy to exaggerate it  To be sure, this is not 1998, when for a   few days it was impossible to get a bid on an investment-grade bond  Currently, it is just   costs that are being affected, but it's fairly obvious that this economy is not about to   accelerate rather quickly   On the inflation front, we have some very funny numbers  Inflation   expectations, even granted the significant rise in energy costs, have not moved  The   TIPS implied inflation rate on 10-year issues is about where it was two or three months   ago, and if anything it is lower  The University of Michigan survey results, after a slight   increase last month, have come back down  The current data are somewhat difficult to   read  For example, leaving aside the issue of the PCE versus the CPI, if we estimate   prices for the nonfarm business sector the way BEA calculates them, we find that the   inflation rate in the nonfinancial corporate area is really quite benign and that the entire   pickup that we are getting ends up in the noncorporate business residual It is conceivable   that the noncorporate business sector has experienced something close to a 5 percent               85      price increase in the last year, but I doubt it  I think what we have here is the same   problem we have had all along, namely that there are biases in these data and it is very   difficult to estimate the trend   That the core rate of inflation is rising is in my view unambiguous, no matter   what price series we deal with  But estimates of the current level of the core inflation rate   are, I think, open to quite serious questions  The unit labor cost data in the corporate area   are slightly negative over the past four quarters  In the total nonfarm business area, they   are up, I believe, 02 percent  The big third-quarter number is merely the noise that that   series creates and if we look at it in terms of a moving average, there is very little   evidence of any significant acceleration in labor costs  There is deterioration in the   inflation rate stemming from interest costs and energy costs, and those are not trivial   sources of deterioration  At the end of the day it doesn't have to be labor costs that are   causing the overall inflation deterioration   The crucial issue, as Larry Meyer said, is where we put the NAIRU (“neigh-  ru”)--of course, he likes to say the NAIRU (“nigh-ru”)  [Laughter]  How that is going to   end up in the transcript, I don't know!  If you believe the NAIRU is at 5-1/2 percent, then   we have a serious problem  If the number is 4 percent, as David Stockton says the   market is presuming, then we don't have a problem  When this transcript is published   five years from now, we will know the answer to that question, but at this point we do   not   All in all, I think that we have, as all of you have said, a combination of the   potential persistence of significant inflationary pressures and an unquestioned increase in   overall signs of weakness  In other words, my judgment, and I guess I agree with almost               86      everybody else, is that it would be premature to move to a balanced risk statement  I say   that for a couple of reasons  As Don Kohn has suggested, even if we believe that the   risks are truly balanced as of today, the market doesn't believe that is our view  As a   consequence, were we to go to balance today we would almost surely end up tomorrow   with financial conditions that would be too easy in terms of the current outlook  In other   words, we cannot act without affecting the balance of risks itself  It is necessary for us to   incorporate in our judgment of what we should do how the markets are going to behave   because a very crucial policy issue is the degree of financial tightness  If I were asked to   identify what has changed the most significantly in the last several months, I would say it   was the quite remarkable tightening not only of the junk bond markets but of all the   investment-grade markets, and very particularly the banking markets  We are getting   some serious restraint in the latter area, and it seems quite unlikely to me that we can get   acceleration in economic activity from the current level   At the end of the day I would like to stay where we are, including retention of   our statement that the balance of risks is toward higher inflation  At the same time, I   would like to try to capture in the language of the announcement our recognition of the   presence of weakening forces in the economy  I would not want to be in the position of   adopting a hard asymmetric statement of the balance of risks toward rising inflation and   then see the economy weaken from under us  That would make us look really   unimaginative  [Laughter]  Accordingly, I'd like to suggest that we stay with the balance   of risks toward inflation statement, but I want to read to you a draft statement that would   accompany it  In present circumstances, I don't think you can readily vote appropriately   without having the full statement up front, because I think the statement is really what we               87      are arguing about at this point  I don't believe there is a really serious difference of   opinion about where policy ought to be currently  But what we say in this case does   matter  Let me read just the operative part of a proposed press release   The utilization of the pool of available workers remains at an  unusually high level, and the increase in energy prices, though having  limited effects on core measures of prices to date, still harbors the  possibility of raising inflation expectations  The Committee accordingly  continues to see a risk of heightened inflation pressures  However,  softening in business and household demand, and tightening conditions  in financial markets over recent months, suggest that the economy could  expand for a time at a pace below the productivity-enhanced rate of  growth of its potential to produce  Nonetheless, to date the easing of  demand pressures has not been sufficient to warrant a change in the  Committee's judgment that against the background of its long-run goals  of price stability and sustainable economic growth, and of the  information currently available, the risks continue to be weighted mainly  toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures in  the foreseeable future       Accordingly, I would like to put on the table for your reactions the balance of   risks toward inflation language and the associated draft press release that I have just read    Vice Chair     President Poole               88        President Hoenig        Governor Ferguson               90        Do you want to pass?     President Parry     President McTeer               91        Governor Kelley     President Guynn     I'm sorry, did you say you want to make a   different--     Oh, I see what you mean      In other words, you want a vote recount?    [Laughter]     President Stern     President Moskow     I’ve heard that if you rig the numbers in the   beginning, you won't have to do a recount     I don't want to hear any more!  [Laughter]    President Santomero     First Vice President Pianalto     President Minehan     Governor Gramlich     President Broaddus     Governor Meyer     Would somebody like to move approval of the minutes for   the November 15th meeting?     Peter Fisher     Refresh my memory, what’s the difference between A    and P?     Which is which?     Let me ask about the sharp drop in the 10-year swap   differentials associated with the December 5th speech  This is an arbitrage operation  What is it that   makes rates move or can induce that sort of response on an arbitrage operation?       8    If they had those expectations, wouldn’t you expect to see   it more pronounced in the 2-year swap?  It depends on whether it’s solely a mortgage hedging   operation, and it's obviously not  But the way you described it there was a sort of broader soft   landing, monetary ease notion  If that were the fundamental concept from which they were dealing,   wouldn’t one have expected the 2-year swap rate to go down more?     Finally, on the commercial paper spread issue, I assume on   the supply side that there’s really no shift from A1s to A2s that would alter the supply position here    That's a very rare event as I recall  So it’s truly the result of all of the telecom paper that they held;   they thought it was a good investment but became disenchanted  I would assume if that is true, that   the 30-day spread--in fact both spreads--would look like the NASDAQ  Does it?      9    In other words, if you became disenchanted with telecom   A2/P2 paper, the presumption, I would assume, is that you became disenchanted with the companies    The amount of paper issued in the timeframe it took for, say, the 30-day rate to surge couldn’t be   very much  So it had to be what they were previously holding  I have no way of knowing, but one   would assume the telecom segment of the NASDAQ would look like this, in reverse obviously  You   don’t know that?     What happened to efficient market theory?  [Laughter]     Thank you, sir, that's very helpful!  Further questions for   Peter?  Yes, Governor Gramlich     President Jordan     Any further questions for Peter?  Vice Chair, do you want   to use your usual--     I usually don’t get the request for a motion out in time!    You move approval before I get the words out      Let me indicate that the next meeting is going to be a rather   long one because our agenda is quite lengthy  We will be meeting at 9 am on both Tuesday and   Wednesday, which is longer than usual, so I'll give you all a heads up  Let's go to lunch     Oh, I'm sorry  That tells you how hungry I am!  [Laughter]     Sure     What's the opinion?  Does anybody support that?     Slowing activity means the level as distinct from--     What we basically would be saying is that the economy is   going down  We don't have that view      Further suggestions?  If not, let's go to lunch      END OF MEETING                     If you say it fast enough, it has a certain tenor!  Shall we   move on to the economic report?  Dave Stockton and Karen Johnson     President Broaddus, I think not  In my view that legislation   was merely a compromise to get the reporting requirement through and reinstate it  If the issue of   how the statistics are presented or evaluated is disputable, it is on a very minor level  The notion of   whether we go to a specifically different type of policy structure has greater content in it, and if we   did that I believe we would find that all of a sudden blatant concerns would emerge in the Congress    So I would not misread what the passage of that legislation was  It was one of those last minute,   patching together types of compromise, and if anybody thought something was being substantively   changed in the process, they would have objected  The presumption on the part of everybody is that   although it involved a language change, everything remains the same  If we indicated that we were   shifting our approach to this--I guess it’s no longer called Humphrey-Hawkins--one side or the other   would have developed a fairly strident position against us  It is conceivable that at some later date   that we might be able to do what you suggest, but to do it before enabling legislation would be ill   advised  We should in no way misread the changes in the legislation as substantive     I think it certainly has been the general view of the   Committee, as evidenced by the nature of our discussions, that long-term price stability is our   objective  It’s unambiguous, unequivocal, and I would say held pretty much by everyone around   this table  The only operative question is whether it is statutory or not  And were we to try to make   it statutory, I suspect we’d run into some very significant resistance     Vice Chair     Last time I recall 1000 percent being used that way was in   a Presidential campaign [laughter] and it didn’t work out very well!       President Poole     May I just raise a caveat with respect to that?  Historically   during recessions we basically were looking at an essentially trendless inventory/sales ratio  And the   types of cyclical patterns President Poole was referring to involved bulges that looked obviously far   greater than the one that we now have  But in the last decade we’ve had declining inventory/sales   ratios  The point really is that inventory excess is essentially in the eyes of the beholder--or more      21  importantly, in the eyes of the beholder who has his hands on the production lever  And I think we   have to use a different measure to make a judgment as to whether in fact the true underlying trend is   still heading down  In this case, if you tilt the trend, the bulge looks big  The only statistic we have   to help make that judgment is the answer to a question in the National Association of Purchasing   Managers monthly survey of manufacturers, "How do you evaluate the inventories of your   customers?"  And since by definition all inventories are produced either by a manufacturing or   mining or some other goods operation, presumably we have all of the customers represented   implicitly in that sample  That number has started to move up and is now at a somewhat elevated   level relative to the past  But the series is not long enough, as I understand it, to give us a reliable   analytical basis  We actually recommended that the question be put in the survey  Was it a couple   of years ago now?     Okay, several years ago  But that number has moved up,   which does tend to square with what Dave Stockton is saying  It's not an abnormal concern, but   clearly it is edging up  Were final sales to slow, my suspicion is that that particular number would   go up quite noticeably  But reading inventories is not as easy as it used to be  In the past, people   didn’t know precisely what their inventories were, and as a consequence they rose very rapidly at   times and were unambiguously out of line and recessions happened--usually before people had the   inventory numbers that told them inventories were too high  So this is a different type of situation,   but one that still can be a potential problem     One would almost assume that, on the grounds that in fully   automated retail establishments the bar codes check out what is being sold and items are   automatically reordered  So the long lag in bookkeeping, where inventories could build up before   one knew it, no longer exists   Adjustments occur very quickly  If sales go down, boom!  Suddenly   there’s a big shift in the purchasing pattern The question, however, is how prevalent is this totally   automated system  I think the answer to that is only partly--     Yes, no question about it  In fact the "only partly" issue is   the answer to how far out on the S curve we are in a technological sense  President Parry     Further questions for our colleagues?  If not, would   somebody like to start the Committee discussion?  Go ahead, President McTeer     President Minehan     President Jordan      29    President Guynn     President Hoening     President Broaddus     President Parry     President Moskow     President Stern     President Santomero      48    Governor Gramlich     Governor Ferguson     Governor Meyer     Governor Kelley     Vice Chair, top that if you can!     Finally, President Poole     Let me ask--did you land or didn't you land?     Thank you very much  Is the coffee out there?     Let's recess   [Coffee break]     Don Kohn     Questions for Don?     Further questions for Don?  Let me start then   There continues to be some divergence of views among Committee members, and those   views have changed fairly significantly from where they were two meetings ago  Not only have the   average and the median of those views moved, but I think the tails of the distribution have moved as   well  Everybody has moved, and the changes are fairly uniform and predictable among the various   members of this Committee  [Laughter]  The rate of economic expansion has very clearly and   unambiguously moved down dramatically from its pace of earlier this year, which was   unsustainable, to a point where the general view among the members is that if it stabilized at its   current level it would be sustainable  I emphasize the words “if it stabilized,” obviously, because the   syllogism isn't that we had a high degree of unsustainable growth at the beginning of the year, that   growth has moved down to a more sustainable pace, and therefore everything is fine  The key   question, and one we really cannot answer, is whether the growth rate has stabilized  At this point   we cannot know because growth has not been at its current rate long enough to exhibit evidence of   what we would normally call stabilization      70  The problem, as I’ve indicated on numerous occasions and as a number of you have   commented, is that we do not have the capability of reliably forecasting a recession The reason may   be expressed in the terminology that Dave Stockton used--in terms of “nonlinear events”--or in terms   of the analogy that I have often employed in the last two or three years, namely that pressure may   build up on a dam and nothing seems to be a problem  But at some point the dam starts to crumble   and may do so fairly rapidly as the water rushes out of the system, as indeed confidence rushes out   of the economic system  Our models do not forecast a recession because we build them and fit them   in a linear manner so that the coefficients imply multiplier effects that are not sufficiently rapid to   offset the other specifications of the models, namely the adjustment process  If we have an economy   whose growth rate is declining, our models will have interest rates and costs of capital falling at   speeds sufficiently rapid to engender a rebalancing of the economy--often before it falls into   recession We never actually see the nonlinear events in the model because they are defined out of   the model     As we have observed on numerous occasions, such as the oil crises, we have never been   able to use our model structures to forecast a recession out of an oil shock  We've had three oil   shocks in recent decades that were followed by recessions There are two possible explanations    Either strictly unrelated chance events occurred, which is possible, or our models cannot capture the   changes that were going on  My own impression is that an oil shock does not necessarily mean we   are going to get a recession, but I do think such a shock definitely weakens the structure of the   economy  And when we add to the latest shock the natural gas/electric power generation problems   that have emerged, we’re clearly observing significant pressure on the economy   The negative effects of the energy shock have occurred essentially as a result of a   withdrawal of demand through either the "import tax" that we’re all familiar with, or as a      71  consequence of increased domestic natural gas costs Clearly, no matter what one thinks about the   impact of rising energy prices on demand, the increased cost of energy is having an adverse effect on   corporate profits That’s basically because the decline in the profit margins of nonfinancial, non-  energy corporations appears to be greater than the improved margins of the energy corporations    Moreover, the apparent impact of these developments on the capital expenditures of the non-energy   corporations does not seem to be fully offset by the obvious increases that we're seeing in capital   outlays in the energy area  Part of the problem is the current restraint on the limited resources   available to the energy sector, such as drilling rigs  But it is also a result of a very subdued response   that we are seeing largely because the exploration and development budgets of the major energy   corporations are to a very large extent related to the West Texas Intermediate oil price, depending on   whether it is above or below the area of, say, $15 to $17 a barrel  In previous years when the price   went up over $30, as it did in this particular run, those budgets were expanded very rapidly and were   subsequently cut all the way back The energy firms have stopped doing that As a result, we are   getting an asymmetrical macroeconomic response to the natural gas and electricity components of   the cost increases, which have been quite substantial, needless to say   It strikes me that we will not know for a good number of weeks whether the underlying   structure of confidence has been breached  We are at a point where we are going to learn whether   that is indeed the case, because if confidence has not been breached, the normal recuperative   processes, the normal rebalancing processes, will gradually eliminate the risk  Part of the problem is   very obviously stock market price declines, and clearly the NASDAQ declines have a major impact   on the investments of high-tech industries  I have gotten calls from a number of senior high-tech   executives who are telling me that the market is dissolving rapidly before their eyes  But I suspect   that a not inconceivable possibility is that what is dissolving in front of their eyes is their own      72  personal net worth!  [Laughter]  That does bias one's view of what is happening in the world  So, we   have to be a little careful about being seduced by those types of evaluations  I've been hearing the   same sort of adjectives that all of you have heard used to describe everything that is going wrong    And indeed we ought to be very careful to recognize that if one could put hard numbers on the   anecdotal data we now have, we would not be looking at a 2 percent plus growth rate in GDP  It   would be closer to zero  How one reads that evidence is a question, which we have to consider   At this point I would say that the outlook is for a very significantly subdued rate of   inflation and, if anything, pricing power in the corporate sector has been falling quite appreciably in   the last six to eight weeks There are some slightly disturbing price patterns in the consumer area    As you know, I don't like the CPI, so let’s stay with the PCE implicit deflator  For the first time we   are beginning to see some movement in the underlying rental components  Now, owner equivalent   rent is not exactly a market price; it is based on a sample of market rentals  The ratio of rent to value   of properties, which has been going down progressively quarter after quarter, now finally seems to   be showing that the expansion in asset prices may be beginning to spill over into consumer prices     I think the medical cost increases we are seeing are real  They are dollar figures  But the   division of medical costs between price and volume, I'm almost certain, is terribly biased toward an   inflation that does not exist In my view, the inflation rate for the noncorporate sector, which is well   above that for the corporate sector, is not a reflection of real inflation in medical prices because   there's very little evidence that the underlying structure of such prices is accelerating  Indeed, every   analyst who does a microanalysis of a specific price category in the medical services area concludes   that the data we see on medical price inflation are grossly overvalued  And with medical technology   changing the way it is, we are having very little in the way of medical price inflation, if such   inflation is measured properly  Even so, there is no question that we are seeing very significant      73  inflation in medical costs, and to the extent that those costs feed into labor compensation they have   an impact on prices  But, if anything, that process is not accelerating at this particular stage  And   indeed what we're seeing in the implications for inflation expectations in the TIPS spreads is that   irrespective of the price level from which we start, inflation expectations have clearly come down   about 03 percentage point  How much of that truly represents an underlying decline in inflation   expectations is an arguable issue because the TIPS implicit price deflator is fundamentally an   arguable issue to begin with   In any event, when we look at what's going on in the economy and recognize that we have   almost a “go/no go” possibility over the next number of weeks with respect to how this economic   deterioration is going to play out, it seems pretty evident that what we want to be sure of, whatever   we decide, is that we not end up with a symmetric or balanced risks statement That is not the way it   looks out there  If we were to decide to reduce the funds rate by 25 basis points today, which I don't   think is a good idea, we still should adopt, in my judgment, a balance of risks statement weighted   toward the down side  That’s because with whatever move we make, whether it’s 25 basis points or   something else, a symmetric risks statement would imply that we have finished our adjustment   process, and that conclusion in my judgment would be mistaken     So I think the real choices here are 25 basis points plus asymmetry toward the down side   or zero change now with downside asymmetry and the understanding that it is quite conceivable that   we may have to have a telephone conference and move the rate before the next meeting  That's   because we may find in this interval the answer concerning whether or not the decline in the rate of   economic growth has stabilized   What I conclude at the end of the day is that we need to recognize that we really do not   know the answer for the intermediate period  I would encapsulate that into no change in the funds      74  rate, but with a bias toward the down side and the recognition that, if the erosion continues, we very   likely will have to move before the next meeting  And that move would be triggered, I would   presume, by a telephone conference sometime in the early days of January--the first week or maybe   the second week at the latest  Given the uncertainties that we face and the general tenor of what I've   heard around the table this morning, that strikes me as the best thing that we should do for the   moment Vice Chair     President Poole     President Hoenig     President Parry     President Moskow     Now you agree!  So do I     President Guynn     President Santomero     Governor Gramlich     President Minehan      78    Sorry about that!  I was just reporting as a statistician     Well, you have to stand by, you just don't have to answer!   [Laughter]     Governor Kelley     President Stern     President Broaddus     President Jordan     I can tell you that the preliminary press statement does not   include such a reference     May I ask you a question?  Why don't we have that   problem, no matter which direction we see the risks, every time we move to an asymmetric   statement?     Okay  Sorry!  [Laughter]     I know!   SPEAKER(?)  He is very predictable  [Laughter]     Governor Ferguson     Governor Meyer     President McTeer      I think a majority is in favor of no change in rates and the   balance of risks toward the down side Read the appropriate language     Call the roll     I’d like to welcome Dino Kos to his first   meeting as an officer of the FOMC  I tentatively welcome Dave Wilcox, but since he’s   not legally on board as an officer his welcome goes in escrow!  We’ll clear that up very   quickly though, because our first agenda item is the election of Dave Wilcox as   Associate Economist of the FOMC to serve until the first regularly scheduled meeting   after December 31, 2001  Would somebody like to move that?     Approved without exception  Welcome    Would somebody like to move approval of the minutes for the January 31st meeting?      Approved without objection  And now we turn   to Dino Kos     I always thought that you prepared them for   him!  [Laughter]                                                     1 Copies of the charts are appended to this transcript  (Appendix 1)     3/20/01 2    The difference in the March, April, and May   projections of the New York Bank and the Board staff is really quite substantial  There’s   a lot of money in that 2 percentage point difference  Have you endeavored to find out   which guess is more likely to be the appropriate one?     It doesn’t matter  It’s just that New York is   right and we’re wrong!  [Laughter]  I got the message!    In Argentina, Mr Cavallo is replacing Mr Murphy, as I hear  I also gather   that they’ve abandoned their austerity program as a consequence     Questions for Dino?  If not--      Okay, what was your vote?     I would like to adjourn this meeting temporarily   so that the Federal Reserve Board can meet and adjudicate the requests of all twelve   Reserve Banks on the discount rate    [Recess]     The Board has approved the requests of all   twelve Reserve Banks for a 50 basis point reduction in the discount rate to 4-1/2 percent    Finally, our next meeting, as all of you know, is scheduled for May 15th  And that is the   official end of this meeting  Luncheon is served and Don Winn will fill us in on a few   issues that I think you might find interesting   END OF MEETING                       Without objection  All right, let’s go to our   chart show, so to speak  It used to be called that       3/20/01 8    Questions for our colleagues?  President Parry     President Jordan     Have you tried a coin?  [Laughter]     Karen, is it possible that the change toward the   United States and the dollar occurred much more slowly than the underlying productivity   acceleration implied?  Could there just be a lag effect here in the sense that a lot of the   capital investment coming into the United States, specifically direct investment, is really   a stock adjustment catch-up?  It may reflect where the rest of the world, specifically   Europe, would like to have been relative to the United States  Since there is somewhat of   a physical limit on how much money one can move at any particular point in time, is it at   all credible that what we’re looking at here is what we would find in a stock adjustment   model?  Perhaps that capital inflow is reflecting the fact that the desired level of   investment is still above the actual level  In other words, even though the desired level is   now falling, it may still be above the actual level     3/20/01 21     You mean if the earnings fall, the capability to   repatriate into another currency goes down and the dollar is therefore under less upward   pressure?     President Hoenig     Vice Chair     How does that explanation square with, let’s   say, the peak in the value of the dollar in February 1985, after a big run up, and the   subsequent big run down?     And the productivity differential, of course, is   actually a real rate of return differential     3/20/01 26    Which is sort of a standard  Indeed, that’s   essentially what Karen was arguing is going on at this particular stage     President Jordan     Any further questions for our colleagues?  Yes,   President Poole     It’s reconciled to the flow-of-funds numbers,   which obviously are not fully independent but still show pretty much the same trend     Well, there’s another possible explanation of   this problem, which we’re in the process of trying to evaluate at this point  If we look at   the significant decline in the saving rate on the national income and product account   definition by using flow-of-funds data--remember this excludes capital gains--what we   find is not that net assets go down  In fact, they’re pretty much stable  What’s causing   the saving rate to go down in an accounting sense is the very dramatic rise in debt, and   that’s virtually all mortgage debt  What is different about the earlier period versus the   current period is the number of financial vehicles that enable the extraction of equity out   of homes, such as home equity loans and cash-out refinancings  And by far not the least   source of equity extraction is funds that become available as a consequence of the   turnover of existing homes  The use of all of those vehicles is significantly higher in this   recent period, enabling the normally unrealized capital gains to be either realized or   converted to cash through the mortgage market  The problem with this explanation--and   it could explain the whole issue--is that it is not necessarily consistent with a decline in   the saving rate based on equity wealth  But it is consistent if one argues, which we can,   that the extraction of equity from homes is a function of the unrealized capital gains in   the stock market  Now, that’s a credible sort of portfolio balancing argument, but it’s a   bit of a stretch, if I may put it that way  So, until we can understand the actual     3/20/01 29  relationship between the equity extraction out of the mortgage market and its effect on   the saving rate and reconcile that to the capital gains in the equity market, we’re not   going to be able to answer the question you raise  And I think it is a really important   question     Indeed       Further questions?  If not, who would like to   start the roundtable?  President Parry     That’s seven zero?     President Minehan     President Jordan     President Santomero     President Moskow     President McTeer     President Stern     President Guynn     President Broaddus     President Hoenig     President Poole     Governor Gramlich     3/20/01 65    I think we better break for coffee or else it will   get very cold   [Coffee break]            Governor Ferguson        Vice Chair     Governor Kelley     Tell me whether you're using your five iron or   your six iron!     Governor Meyer     Thank you all  Mr Kohn     Questions for Don?    Let me follow on then   The one statistic that has not been mentioned today, which in fact I find the   most worrisome on the down side, is the persistent downward revisions in weekly   forecasts of S&P 500 earnings per share for the year 2001  Those forecasts have been   reduced for the first three quarters of this year and, as I recall, for the fourth quarter as   well  The downward revisions have persisted through the latest week for which we have   data, which was last week  If we look at the year as a whole on a chart, the expected   change in per share earnings seems to be going straight down  The main problem is not   so much the direction; it’s that the slope has not changed  The degree of erosion seems to   be continuing, and it's not all accounted for by high-tech industries  Our estimate is that   only about half the revisions involve the high-tech sector    One consequence of the bleak near-term earnings outlook is that we are   beginning to see a significant amount of capital investment plans being placed on the   shelf  It’s not that expectations of rates of return are being materially reduced for the   longer term  They are not, and in fact the discussion we had earlier with respect to the   outlook for the foreign exchange rate seems correctly suggestive of the fact that longer-  term earnings expectations are holding up because the strength in productivity is still   there     What has happened is that the current uncertainties engendered by the   sharpness of the slowing in the rate of economic growth have increased discount factors   and hurdle rates of return in the markets  In a sense, that has made a lot of projects that   were viable in the context of the hurdle rates of a year ago no longer viable in terms of     3/20/01 84  today's hurdle rates  It doesn't mean that all these projects are canceled, but it does mean   that a substantial number are being delayed  In terms of how fast such delays can   materialize, one just has to visualize a simple model involving the high-tech sector,   where our data show an increase in capacity of 50 percent over the past year  That affects   a significantly large part of the economy, and it’s clearly a rate of increase that cannot   persist indefinitely  I don’t know what the relationship is in the high-tech area between   outlays for replacement and modernization and outlays for capacity expansion, but if we   assume that replacement and modernization expenditures do not change as the growth in   expenditures for new capacity falls from 50 percent to, say, 20 percent--a still very   dramatic and strong increase--growth of capital investment obviously will decline by 30   percentage points  And when we consider the fact that such investment has been going   up very dramatically, the downward spike that we are looking at is very impressive,   wholly independent of the question as to whether there has been a fundamental change in   the longer-term outlook  It’s the acceleration in investment expenditures in 1999 and   2000 that has set up this particular pattern, and the falloff in profit expectations is feeding   this whole process  So the possibility that we may end up with a much lower capital   investment number for the year than we forecast is not to be readily dismissed  I say that   without any expectation that substantially reduced growth in capital investment will   continue beyond this year   Because of the decline in expected earnings and the obviously very sharp   contraction in profitability, we are also getting some slowing in expenditures from the   wealth effect--not as much as one would expect, but still some  Moreover, the overall   slowing in both capital investment and personal consumption expenditures, especially     3/20/01 85  late last year, induced a fairly significant backup of inventories--actually,   disproportionately in the high-tech area  If we look at the inventory-sales ratios in   various segments of the economy it’s pretty obvious, however we calculate these ratios,   that the inventory backup in the high-tech sector has been completely unanticipated and   that high-tech firms as a group have run into some difficulties  The difficulties outside   the high-tech area initially occurred largely in autos and a lot of intermediate materials   While the book value data have grown faster in nominal terms, I believe, than in real   terms, we can get a sense of real inventories from the production data, which by   definition is where all inventories come from  From those data we conclude that the   decline in manufacturing production through the latter months of last year ended a period   of increasing real inventory accumulation  Leaving aside the somewhat questionable   January numbers, February and March clearly are a period of significant inventory   liquidation  Indeed, the data that we have for motor vehicles show some quite substantial   declines  But in comparison with production patterns throughout the economy,   consumption in February and March does not seem to be changing as fast  The   implication of that from the perspective of a statistical model is that the rate of liquidation   in February and March is really quite stark and pronounced   The overall effect of this on economic activity is stabilization at some point, if   all that is involved is an inventory correction  Stabilization would occur reasonably   quickly because, judging from past experience, the current rate of inventory liquidation   seems to be close to a maximum  What happens when a maximum degree of liquidation   is reached is that the economy stabilizes even though the general level of confidence may   be very low and indeed people may anticipate that economic conditions will deteriorate     3/20/01 86  further  They don’t  And the reason they don’t is that the level of inventories becomes a   brake on the extent of the liquidation     The fact that inventories cannot be negative no matter how uncertain, no matter   how bearish people feel, is a fundamental feature of the way the economic system   functions  Accordingly, inventory liquidations and inventory cycles are usually of the   type that produce change reasonably quickly and can lead to a relatively prompt and   pronounced adjustment in the economy  I suspect that we are going to see a goodly   measure of that in the months ahead  Maybe  The “maybe” relates to a phenomenon that   occurs on occasion but one about which I am quite concerned at the moment  It’s called   a “false dawn”  It occurs when there are a lot of indications that the economy is behaving   the way it ordinarily does in a recovery; but then it surprises us, and we get a renewed   wave of weakness  One reason I would be concerned about that prospect is that the level   of consumer confidence has come down fairly dramatically, even though the University   of Michigan numbers did show some improvement in the first half of March  Of course,   if we focus on the observations that were collected after the stock market took a sharp   swing downward, the number comes down somewhat  So the level of confidence is still   an open question     Far more important is an issue that we have discussed around this table,   namely the saving rate  The saving rate has a huge multiplier  All one has to do is add or   subtract 2 or 3 percentage points and that does extraordinary wonders to the level of GDP   and does so very quickly  I don’t know whether the negative wealth effect is going to be   a major problem  Conceptually, one has to presume that there is a considerable effect  I   don't know whether we are going to learn specifically how its impact is working its way     3/20/01 87  through to expenditures; but it is not doing so currently at the pace that we would have   expected from our models   The uncertainties surrounding the negative wealth effect, along with the   absence of any evidence that the rate of downward adjustments to expected profitability   may be stabilizing, make me nervous about the outlook  Nonetheless, the March sales   figures, as Mike Moskow mentioned, are not doing all that badly and the liquidation of   inventories continues  Moreover, the numbers for steel ingot production came out today   They are still going up, and they are going up at a pace that is very clearly consistent with   an inventory turnaround  So, a lot of positive economic information is showing up   Indeed, as I listen to the anecdotal reports around this table, I find encouraging signs that   in my view would be consistent with stabilization were it not for the profits and the   saving rate problems    Another significant issue is Japan  Its economy, the second largest in the   world, has had virtually no perceivable impact on world economic conditions for a long   period of time  For a decade Japan had been a cipher as far as its multiplier effects on   economic conditions in other parts of the world were concerned  I feel that that is no   longer the case  I think the economic situation is eroding in Japan, and I believe it is   eroding at a faster pace than is forecast in the Greenbook  I don’t think it’s all a political   problem  What the Japanese are dealing with are problems relating to a declining labor   force, unfunded long-term pensions, very large deficit spending, and an almost   nonfunctioning financial intermediary system  Japan, remember, has a bank-only   financial intermediary system, and we have seen innumerable examples in a number of   the smaller East Asian countries of what happens when that intermediary system breaks     3/20/01 88  down  We have not yet seen that in Japan, but I think there is a significant danger that we   may  More broadly, East Asia, as the Vice Chair has mentioned, is clearly in some   difficulty   Latin America is not a current problem for our economy, but there is a problem   of political instability in those countries  We need to remember that a number of Latin   American nations, such as Argentina and Brazil, have what might be characterized as   American type high-risk economies  Such economies can function only if they operate in   the framework of long-term time preferences and a political system that thinks longer   term  It’s not evident that that’s the way the political system works in Latin America  As   I have often commented--and Bill McDonough knows this better than I, and in fact Roger   Ferguson probably goes to more international meetings than I do--when we sit around   these international tables, what we hear are people who think like Western economists    But they are utterly unrepresentative of the government officials who employ them, and   we get a false view of how those economic systems work  So there is a degree of   shakiness about the economic outlook in many of our important trading partners, and that   makes the false dawn issue disturbing          In addition, of course, there is the stock market about which much has been   said today  Some market players behave like addicts convinced a heightened dose would   relieve their pain  It does not, and they seek a still larger dose  There is no stability in a   regimen based on false pharmacology, [laughter] nor for stock prices from ever-larger   doses of liquidity  Short-term rates have only a peripheral impact on expected earnings   and risk premiums, and they therefore have limited effects on stock prices  Targeting   stock prices themselves cannot be an effective policy  To restrain an upside stock market     3/20/01 89  surge could require the draining of liquidity to an extent that that would cause a collapse   of economic activity, an obviously unacceptable trade-off  Likewise, flooding a   depressed market with excess liquidity, unless that succeeds in revving up a moribund   economy, cannot revive a deflated stock market    It is important that the Federal Reserve not follow a flawed strategy  I fear that   with a reduction of 75 basis points or even 100 basis points today, which as you know a   number of people are suggesting, stock prices could still fall, leading too many observers   to conclude that monetary policy is ineffective  This is a potentially dangerous view in   my mind especially among the broad array of those who do not participate in the equity   markets  If we do 50 basis points and stock prices fall further, as they well might today,   it is the central bankers who may be perceived as intellectually inadequate, not policy   itself  This is far less dangerous to the economy!  [Laughter]  At least it leaves open up   the possibility that we policymakers can be educated or changed  Beyond that, implying   but by no means guaranteeing in our press release that we may well cut rates before our   May 15 meeting is a Damocles sword over bear speculators who view the next liquidity   fix as more important than higher housing starts   Ambiguity is rarely useful in monetary policy  Uncertainty usually creates risk   premiums, but that depends on the nature of the uncertainty  For those who believe that   the provision of central bank liquidity is bullish for stocks, history tells us that an   overhang of uncertainty about when or whether the Fed will move to lower rates creates a   downside or negative risk premium that may well have a larger sustaining effect than   acting to remove the uncertainty  Markets are very often bought on rumor and sold when   the rumor proves true, or false for that matter  This is one of the rare periods when in my     3/20/01 90  judgment calculated ambiguity can serve a useful purpose in minimizing unthoughtful   activity  I would propose, therefore, that we reduce the rate by 50 basis points and   construct language for the press statement that leaves the door wide open on an   intermeeting move  Any intermeeting action would be governed, however, by a   judgment that the real economy is in some unforeseen difficulty beyond our current set of   probabilities, not by a further weakening in stock prices  I do acknowledge a wealth   effect, which we must take into consideration  The wealth effect itself is real in that it   has an impact on spending and activity, not just psychology  If we are required to   accelerate our downside moves, I prefer to shorten the interval between the moves rather   than increase the size of each move  I do not like where I believe relatively large moves   may lead us in current circumstances  I believe the cost of a policy of smaller but, as   needed, more frequent moves is really quite limited  It does not require us to make the   added move, but leaves our options wholly open  This in my judgment is necessary in   the present environment     I would like to put on the table for discussion, then, a 50 basis point reduction   with a statement in our press release that the risks are still on the down side but that also   suggests that we are focused on what is going on in the economy  Even though we have   almost two months to the next meeting, we will be prepared to act when and if necessary,   but we recognize that “when and if necessary” does not merely mean a decline in the   stock market  Thank you Vice Chair     Governor Kelley      President Poole     President Hoenig,     In the draft language, the only reference to the   market relates to equity wealth effects  At this stage there is no reference to stock prices     President Santomero     President Parry     President Stern     Governor Ferguson     President Minehan     3/20/01 97  MS MINEHAN  Thank you, Mr Chairman  All I can say is “Wow!”  Your   summary was a real tour de force, especially with respect to the stock market and the   undesirability of fulfilling ever-greater market expectations  I agree with the 50 basis   points, I agree with the asymmetry, and I share your concern about a move of 75 basis   points or something more than that  I'm in agreement largely because, first of all, I think   an easing move is necessary and secondly because I believe taking measured steps is   appropriate  It may well be that further ease will be necessary, but I'd like to do that also   in limited steps  And to me the best part of a measured process like that is that it could   focus the “addicts,” as you called them, a bit on saving themselves rather than looking to   us to do the job     I am, however, very worried about your recommended nuances in the   statement  In my view we always have the option to move between meetings  We’ve   done so in the past, the quite recent past  That is part of everybody's understanding of   how we operate  Everyone knows how long it is between this meeting and the next   meeting, everyone knows we’re vigilant, and everyone knows we’re focused on incoming   data  If we add nuances to the statement this time, I think we are going to provide the   addicts with even more reason to focus on us rather than themselves for a solution to their   problems  And I don't think that would be good at all     President Broaddus     President Guynn     President Jordan     President Moskow     On the green?  [Laughter]     Governor Meyer     3/20/01 101    Governor Gramlich     President McTeer     3/20/01 103    Let me suggest that we take a look at the draft   language before we vote, because the language I’ve chosen does not in my judgment   raise precedential issues  This is a very rare occasion  If indeed it got to the point where   this kind of wording became a new, separate part of the decision we had to make on an   ongoing basis, I would vote against it  I think that would be too much  But I believe   current circumstances are very unusual, and in my judgment we gain from the type of   statement that is in this early draft  In that regard the proposed language does not in my   view set any precedents in that it is unlikely to be used again  I think this is one of those   extraordinary periods in monetary policy history where we’re at a very important   crossroads  And being sensitive to it I think is useful  The cost over the long run, which   has been well articulated here and I believe quite correctly, is not something that   concerns me because I don't think we're going to be doing this again   The operative sentence is obviously the last sentence of paragraph three  Has   everyone looked at it?     Well, I purposely didn't want to use exactly the   same language for precisely that reason     Yes  What was the language--     Yes       Governor Ferguson     President Poole     But it is up to us to act or not act     I don’t disagree with you actually, and I’m not   sure that I view that as a bad outcome because in effect what we will be telling the market   is that we don’t agree with it  In other words, we’ll get a lot of those views initially and   when we don’t act, things will calm down  The other day, for example, I had to make a   statement up on the Hill to try to shoot down the view that there was going to be an   intermeeting move because one of our former colleagues got exuberant, as has been   pointed out, and had forecast such a move  When I made that statement, everything   calmed down  In other words, if people want to get stirred up, in my judgment we should   let them get stirred up  But the point is that if we don’t move on that stirring, it actually   reinforces the view that we are not responding--and should not be responding--to the   stock market or to people on the street whose basic view is that our role is to bail out their   poor investment judgments  I don’t think that’s the role of a central bank  President   Hoenig     President Moskow     Well, we have a majority now in favor of the   statement  Let me see if I can get a vote in effect, not a formal vote, on the word   “especially”  Why don’t I quickly go around the table on that point and then we can   close this discussion  Just indicate “yes” or “no” on the word “especially”  Vice Chair     If “especially” is in, the word is “yes”  If it is   out, the word is “no”  Okay?  I’m sorry, the Vice Chair is yes  Governor Ferguson     Governor Gramlich     President Hoenig     Governor Kelley     Governor Meyer?  Oh, you’re already--      No  You don’t get a vote!  [Laughter]  You   already voted “no” on the whole sentence     The others have already expressed their views   so the word “especially” is out  I ask the Secretary to read the appropriate directive and   let’s vote on it     Shall we vote?     Well, you had already said “no” on including   the sentence  If you vote against the whole sentence, then voting on a word is irrelevant     Would somebody like to move approval of the minutes   of the March 20th meeting, which also cover the conference calls of April 11th and 18th ?     Without objection, they are approved  Dino Kos, you’re   on     Questions for Dino?       Yes     5/15/01     4     There is a third, which may in fact be relevant here    Since our March meeting, if one listens to the discussions coming out of Treasury and the White   House, the presumption of eliminating the Treasury debt is becoming less vocal and more   attenuated  Hence, the reduction in yields attributable to a scarcity premium is very clearly   changed  That doesn’t eliminate the possibility of increased inflation premiums  Indeed, we see   some of that in the TIPS yields       There may be more involved in that issue than we know     5/15/01     5     Remember, there was a bulge in the spread against the   staff’s off-the-run synthetic yield measure in April of last year and it then came all the way   down     We’re just back to where it was     Further questions for Dino?  If not, Vice Chair     Thank you  Without objection, they are approved  Dave   Stockton and Karen Johnson, you’re on   SEVERAL  We need another motion     Oh, I beg your pardon  Not that I wish to get beyond   that issue!  [Laughter]     Well, if we move fast enough, maybe nobody will   notice!  [Laughter]     Sorry about that  Dino, why don’t you explain the   issue?     Yes  In my conversations with the Mexicans, I was not   surprised at their position  Indeed, it’s fairly clear that they’re willing, though obviously   reluctantly, to unwind this  And they understand where we’re coming from  I found the   Canadian position really a surprise, given their floating exchange rate--      Well, I have not had a chance to speak to Paul Martin on   this, but I cannot imagine that he would resist this  They don’t have a fixed exchange rate  They   don’t have a need for very large interventions that they can’t support  So the logic of retaining   the swaps just seems to be utterly missing     He’s dodging all bullets  [Laughter]     It’s just not credible  You may recall that when this   issue came up a year ago, we indicated that with a new Administration we’d have to get it   readdressed because the old Administration raised obstacles in certain regards  As far as I can   judge, the Treasury has been very much engaged with us on this and I think we will finally put it   behind us  And I won’t have to dodge another item on the agenda!       Yes  Any comments, questions, or concerns that   anybody wishes to raise?     5/15/01     10     Okay, would somebody like to move renewal of the   reciprocal currency arrangements?     I think we have to do one of those two things  And   sending out statements around here would just be awful!     I believe we ought to consider cutting the statement   back very substantially  Okay, the next meeting is June 26th and 27th  Remember, we are invited   to the British Embassy on the evening of the 26th     END OF MEETING                         Are there objections?  Hearing none, I will assume it’s   by acclamation, though not exactly  Now we turn to Dave Stockton and Karen Johnson             Questions for our colleagues?  President Broaddus     President Moskow     A new model!  [Laughter]     Is it correct to say that we just don’t have enough   episodes of recessionary periods to be able to infer what happens to the coefficients and   nonlinearity, as you put it, during those times?  I gather that is correct, is it not?     President Parry     President Minehan     What would the productivity numbers in the first quarter   and the fourth quarter of last year look like if the volatile pattern in self-employed hours had   been smoothed?     What would that be with a similar smoothing?     Any further questions for our colleagues?  If not, who   would like to start the Committee discussion?  President Jordan     President Hoenig     President Moskow     President Parry     President Broaddus     President Guynn     President Santomero     President Stern     President Poole      Thank you  Coffee is available and I think it would be   reasonable to recess at this stage   [Coffee break]                      President Minehan     Vice Chair     President McTeer     Governor Ferguson     Governor Gramlich     Governor Kelley     Governor Meyer     Thank you  Don Kohn                    Questions for Don?  If not, let me get started   As best we can judge, the decline in industrial production--modest though it was in   April--occurred in the context of a significant rate of inventory liquidation in the non-high-tech   area of the economy  Indeed, rough estimates suggest that the rate of liquidation in that area   continued much as it had proceeded since earlier in the year  An exception obviously is motor   vehicles, specifically light trucks, where there has been some recent backup in inventories after   earlier reductions  Unlike the experience in what we might call the traditional parts of the   economy, inventory liquidation in the high-tech area probably did not start until very recently,   and it has a long way to go because high-tech sales clearly are still falling  Obviously, the extent   of further inventory liquidation will be significantly attenuated if growth in final demand starts to   move up  That, more than inventory liquidation, is the effective tool for bringing inventory-sales   ratios down to where they have to be, which means returning them to a path consistent with their   earlier downtrend  Although the ratios actually have risen only modestly above that trend, they   now have a long way to come down  The liquidation in the non-high-tech area likely will   continue for a number of months, but that in the high-tech area will require a more protracted   period Fortunately, inventories in the high-tech area are not that large a part of total inventories   and hence further inventory correction will not constitute a significant drag if business firms can   get the non-high-tech inventory liquidation out of the way   The inventory correction process is the basic stabilizing force in this type of economy    If demand holds, then clearly, as Dave Stockton said, production must start to rise at some point   because there is a limit to how low inventories can get  Indeed, in a period when inventories are   running off at a very significant pace, firms tend not to anticipate when a sudden need to scramble     5/15/01     77   to fill some orders will materialize  That process I would say has not started, but that’s what we   have to look forward to as the major force of recovery in business activity     The key question is whether this recovery will start prior to any further, cumulative   weakening in the profits and capital investment area  Profit expectations continue to erode,   although the data in the last couple of weeks show a lesser decline than in the previous period    Nonetheless, it’s very difficult to know whether we are over-analyzing a series such as this   Remember, what is involved is a thousand analysts reporting their profit expectations company by   company to either IBES or First Call, and their reports are invariably a reflection of what they   hear from corporate management and not a reflection of any great insights on their part  So, at   this stage we don’t know whether the slowing in the rate of decline in profits is an indication of   some stabilization, but it is a precondition for that stabilization  If profit expectations do not   stabilize, then it is very likely that the ongoing capital goods retrenchment will be far greater than   in the Greenbook or in other forecasts    Despite all the negative things we hear about capital investment--which is devastating   in the dot-com area and almost as bad in the telecoms--the actual level of capital expenditures is   still quite high  This means that the downside possibilities are not small  If we are thinking   solely in terms of the way business cycles have behaved in the post World War II period, then   our presumption is that the potential extent of downside adjustments will be relatively limited    That is, we have not had a really severe correction in this economy in the post World War II   period, even in 1982  But when we begin to look over a longer historical period, the potential   corrections look rather scary  Now, such a prospect involves a relatively low probability   forecast, but if we are looking at loss functions in our determination of policy, its weight is really   a lot more in my judgment than I think we have put on the table  One of the reasons is that, by     5/15/01     78   any relevant measure, stock market prices are still probably higher than what our models say   would be consistent with their fundamental determinants  The trouble that we have with a stock   market decline is that it never stops where the models say it should; it continues lower  Implicit   in all stabilization forecasts, and indeed that is my forecast, is that stock market prices will hold   at higher levels than the models would expect, largely because long-term rates of return and   productivity increases are only very modestly diminished  If we believe that, we also have to say   that price-earnings ratios will tend to remain higher than average  I believe that, but I’m fully   aware of the fact that it is a forecast I hope it will occur, but it is still a forecast     The data in May so far are not giving us any really new insights into the future course   of the economy  Sales of autos and light trucks for May are running modestly below where they   were in April  The weakness is entirely at domestic producers, the Big Three  Imports are   selling exceptionally well this month, as they did last month, and are continuing to take market   share  That’s not very helpful for American production, but it does indicate that consumer   demand is still reasonably good  And indeed the chain store sales data are not bad so far this   month  The data released this week suggest that sales are running better than last month--not a   great deal, but they are not going down, which is very important   My guess is that industrial production is running a shade lower  The reason is that   high-tech output is doubtless putting downward pressure on overall production because the rate   of inventory liquidation in that sector must assuredly be rising  The unemployment rate is   clearly on the way up, and with demand weak or on the soft side, it’s really a question of a   tradeoff of rising or accelerating productivity and rising unemployment or the reverse  Rising   productivity and rising unemployment imply a favorable long-term profit outlook that I think has     5/15/01     79   very important implications, but obviously it means shrinking consumer incomes and consumer   confidence     The confidence issue in this outlook is really quite crucial  The Michigan survey   actually showed a degree of strengthening, and I suspect there’s an element of reality in it  I   don’t think it’s a phony statistic, but clearly the Conference Board numbers, which will come out   shortly, will either confirm or dispute that there has been some stabilization  I think the ABC   weekly index is a little questionable; it has been exceptionally weak, but I’m not sure what   degree of confidence I would put in it   The problem that bothers me particularly is that the risks are really different from any   I’ve ever seen, and they are of concern largely because they are international  We do know that   the extent of the interaction of the United States and the rest of the world is greater than we can   define very accurately  In other words, the correlation between, say, growth in Europe and that   in the United States is a good deal higher than we can explain in the trade flows or in exchange   and interest rates  In fact, the implication, as Karen Johnson likes to say, is that global portfolio   adjustments probably are involved and are serving to integrate the total system to a greater   degree than we can specify  And it’s fairly apparent that any negative interaction is necessarily   self-reinforcing  This type of environment is something we haven’t seen for a very long period   of time  It doesn’t mean that the economy is going to implode  It does mean, however, that the   risk is there  And I think it would be a mistake not to keep a close eye in our evaluations on this   particular process   The crucial arguments in support of forecasts that economic activity will  accelerate   and indeed pick up toward a 3 percent or more growth rate next year largely rest on the notion   that profits will stabilize and that the stabilization will in turn stabilize capital investment and     5/15/01     80   allow the termination of inventory liquidation to trigger a recovery  I do think, as does the   Greenbook, that that is the best point estimate  My concern is that the risk distribution is not   symmetric  Indeed, it has a fairly worrisome tail at the wrong end  A goodly part of this outlook   rests in my view on the very substantial size of the worldwide wealth effect, which currently is   taking a large chunk of demand out of the world economic system  Here I think we depend to a   very significant extent on the prospect that the stock market will stabilize and perhaps even rise   and that gradually the negative wealth effect, which has not yet created any serious evidence of   consumer weakness in our economy, will begin to reverse  I don’t think we know yet how this   will come out  I do believe that we should probably be waiting  The wealth effect coming out of   housing, which is still very solid and still quite strong, is greater dollar-for-dollar than the   negative wealth effect that is coming from stock prices or equity values generally  But again this   is not an issue that we know very much about because we haven’t dealt with this type of   economy previously   The concern here is that even if we do get a turnaround, the presumption that we can   somehow get a “V” type of economic performance involving some significant acceleration over   the nearer term I find very much to be an outside probability  In my view, the economy has to   absorb a very large amount of negative wealth effect that has to work its way through  So, the   outlook is for a soft recovery in the sense that a very quick recovery seems to be extraordinarily   unlikely at this stage, given the existing wealth effect     The issue that has been raised quite properly around the table about inflation, which we   tend to disregard when we’re in a period like this, is quite important  I personally am not terribly   concerned about the outlook for inflation for a number of reasons  One is that the contractionary   effects in the economy are really quite substantial at this stage and are suppressing the ability of     5/15/01     81   the business community to pass through what unquestionably are rising costs  Energy costs have   gone up significantly  Business firms have been able to pass through very little of those costs,   which is one of the reasons for declining profit margins  The virtual stall in productivity growth   in the context of generally rising average hourly earnings or average compensation is clearly   increasing labor costs that now have to be spread across a smaller number of units of output    Here again I think that the pricing power of business firms is very limited at this point, judging   from the widespread anecdotal reports that the capacity to raise prices in an environment such as   this is extraordinarily restricted    How do we relate that very strong and widespread consideration to the fact that our   price indexes seem to be accelerating?  I believe there are several explanations  First, I would   discard the consumer price index  I think it is a flawed statistic  But we are seeing rising core   inflation in the personal consumption expenditures deflator and other measures  As I have   discussed many times in the past, part of the problem with the reconciliation is that service price   inflation is exaggerated in our indexes  If indeed service prices were rising as much as the data   suggest, we would in fact be getting a decline in productivity in the health services area, in legal   services, and in business services  I don’t mean a decline in the rate of growth in productivity; I   mean an absolute decline, which is just not credible  When we do specific evaluations in health   pricing, we invariably find that every single statistic goes down and that one cannot explain the   rise in overall health inflation except by a flawed procedure  The latter involves measuring   inputs as though they were outputs  There is an endeavor to move away from that procedure   What I conclude from all this is that the Greenbook forecast is the most likely outcome    My concern, however, is that there is a very significant asymmetry to the downside in the risks to   that forecast  Accordingly, the appropriate policy position for this meeting in my view is a     5/15/01     82   further 50 basis point reduction in the federal funds rate and a balance of risks statement biased   toward economic weakness  I would hope that a 4 percent funds rate is as low as we will have to   go  If stabilizing forces begin to emerge, which will happen if the Greenbook forecast is correct,   we should be able to hold at 4 percent in June and either then or thereafter remove the bias  In   line with the fact that the economy’s adjustment processes are accelerating, I think we should not   hesitate to start moving in the other direction if and when the indications require that     In my judgment, it is premature at this point to start discussing in the statement we will   issue today the steepening yield curve and its possible roots of growing inflation expectations    It’s not that I think that it is incorrect or false  It’s just that I believe it would be sufficient at this   point to remove any market expectations of another intermeeting move  But as we approach the   next meeting, assuming that stability is emerging, we should begin in speeches or interviews to   address the possibility that 250 basis points of ease, assuming we move today, may be enough   and at least raise the notion that inflation may not be dead  I will, for example, be making a   speech at the Economic Club of New York on the 24th of this month, and I will be raising some   of these issues  But I would hesitate to argue at this stage, given the fragility of confidence and   the fragility of the outlook, that we are at a point when we might begin to change our policy   position, even though I believe this policy issue will be resolved within two or three months  I   do think we probably can stop our easing moves here, assuming we move the funds rate 50 basis   points lower at this meeting  But I do not think we ought to show our hand because I think the   potential consequences in terms of market reactions could be significant and of no help to us  So   I would put that on the table  Vice Chair     President Broaddus     President Minehan     I was actually suggesting that we send it in June     Yes     President Parry     President Moskow     President Santomero     President Poole     President Stern     Governor Kelley     5/15/01     89     Governor Meyer     Governor Ferguson     President McTeer     Careful, sir!  Governor Gramlich     President Guynn     President Hoenig     President Jordan     Okay  The seeming majority is for a cut of 50 basis   points and a statement that the risks are asymmetric toward economic weakness  Could you read   the appropriate statement?     Call the roll, please     I now suggest that the Federal Reserve Board retire to   my office, while we recess this meeting temporarily, and vote on the requests from the various   Banks   [Meeting recessed]     The Board voted unanimously to approve the requests   from several Reserve Banks for a reduction of 1/2 percentage point in the discount rate to 3-1/2   percent     We now have a draft statement in front of us and I would appreciate everyone reading   it and giving your reactions after you’ve had a chance to review it  It is essentially the same as   the last statement, with all the references to further action deleted       May I have comments from everybody, please?    Governor Meyer     Vice Chairman     President Santomero      President Minehan     President Hoenig     Governor Ferguson     Governor Kelley     Yes, the language in this draft was from our previous   statement, as you know     Any other comments at this stage?  Governor Gramlich     5/15/01     98     Let me suggest the following  Frankly, I think   Governor Meyer’s suggestion is an improvement and unless there’s an objection, we’ll just make   that change and put in his wording  Let’s then have a Committee decision on two possibilities   One is to go with this statement with that correction; the other is to craft a statement that   basically tries to capture what Al Broaddus said earlier about being close to the limit of the   easing process  We have various versions of this draft statement  So, Don, why don’t you read   the relevant one?         That’s the key question, whether in fact we move to a   statement in line with Al Broaddus’s proposal today or in June  I think it would be helpful to get   members’ preferences--I assume everyone is in agreement that we ought to do it--for May or   June  Let’s quickly call the roll and see what we get     Yes, just say May or June on including this sentence     May  I beg your pardon--June  [Laughter]     That’s better than a butterfly!  Sorry about that      I voted June     So be it  Yes, President Minehan     Yes, I think that’s a valid point  What we probably   ought to do is cut these statements all the way back  We can’t do it now because we’ve already   voted  But your point, which I think is a relevant one, is not that this should be short  You’re   saying that to the extent we are using the statement as an indication of our views--which we are,   and frankly appropriately so in my view--that we should either circulate it before the meeting or   cut it down     Who would like to move approval of the minutes of the   June 26-27, 2001 meeting?     Without objection, they are approved  Dino Kos     Questions for Dino?  If not--    The Board of Governors accepted discount rate requests     8/21/01 81   from seven banks  This meeting then is adjourned upon confirmation of the date of our next   meeting, which is--     October 2nd As you are aware, that is an interesting   day, which may or may not be devoid of conflicts for other than monetary policy reasons  We   are monitoring the situation fairly closely and if we need to make any adjustments in the meeting   date or location we, of course, will be in contact with all of you immediately     Yes, I would assume that  I amend my remarks   accordingly  Shall we go to lunch?   END OF MEETING         Without objection, they are approved  Now we’ll go on   to David Wilcox and Vince Reinhart  David     Questions for our colleagues?  President Parry     No further questions?  Who would like to start our   Committee discussion? President Broaddus       President McTeer     It was! President Moskow     President Parry     President Minehan     President Stern     8/21/01 26    President Guynn     President Santomero     President Hoenig     President Jordan     Vice Chair    Governor Ferguson     President Poole     Governor Gramlich    Governor Meyer     Governor Kelley    Thank you Coffee is available   [Coffee break]    Let’s turn now to Don Kohn     Questions for Don?  If not, let me get started   I think it's fairly evident, certainly in retrospect, that we are seeing an absorption of   very large capital losses throughout the economic system  I don't know whether one would call   this a structural adjustment, but it certainly is not what we have embodied in our standard post-  World War II econometric models  It's a different sort of phenomenon and it’s clearly being   engendered by a set of forces that are largely without historical precedent in the post-World War   II period This does not mean that we're looking at the type of severe business cycle contraction   that the economy experienced on occasion in the pre-World War II period, but in many respects   the process of adjustment is similar to that in the earlier contractions  As a number of you have   indicated, the current weakness is obviously concentrated in the capital goods markets and to a   very substantial extent it stems from a downward adjustment of long-term earnings expectations   I suspect that the declines in those expectations are really quite modest  What I believe has   happened, as I think I indicated at the last meeting, is that the uncertainties with respect to the   change in the outlook have fostered a significant rise in risk premiums in the capital goods   markets  This essentially means that the hurdle rate that is required to induce a capital   expenditure has increased Indeed, one can talk in terms of a firm’s refusal to invest its cash   flow unless the return is realized in, say, 14 months or to change its PCs every year when the   latter can obviously remain functional for three or four years  Nothing has happened in the last   year to alter underlying conditions except a change in judgments  The PCs haven't changed    The technologies underlying the infrastructure of expanding information systems haven't   changed And indeed all the evidence that we have today suggests that our previous conclusions     8/21/01 65   about the outlook for capital investment are still basically true, namely that firms have a long   way to go in exploiting the total available capital investments that offer significant above-hurdle   rates of return What has happened is simply a fundamental shift in the general degree of   confidence In the same sense that expectations were very clearly overdone on the upside, they   are being underdone, if I may put it that way, on the downside; and that will continue to be so   until the normal cycle, not of the business environment but of human psychology, runs its course   One could argue with some obvious evidence, and indeed a number of you have so   argued, that economic conditions have deteriorated since our last meeting, and I think that   assessment is accurate  But the economy clearly has not collapsed  The fundamental evaluation   of the behavior of the economy is still basically the same, and as in the early spring the concerns   about a false dawn remain  Indeed, we are looking at aspects of that even today   As you may recall, I indicated at the June meeting that corporate earnings were going   to be a particularly difficult technical issue in the nearer term  The problem is related to the fact   that in June security analysts were estimating a double-digit increase in third-quarter per share   earnings, seasonally adjusted not at an annual rate, and that estimate was just not credible  The   only question was the mechanism by which a downward adjustment would start to emerge    Frankly, it emerged a little differently from what I had expected  I thought that the second   quarter was pretty much locked in  After all, by the end of the month, with the information   technology systems that firms now have in place, they knew pretty much what their earnings   would be with one exception It's called end-of-quarter adjustments for which there is very   considerable discretion Looking out into the third quarter and seeing less than enjoyable   prospects for earnings, firms decided to move some of the bad news into the second quarter  As   a result, they reported a very fairly dramatic decline in second-quarter earnings stemming from     8/21/01 66   downward revisions at the very end of the quarter that were not credibly based on real events    After all, it's not as though we are still in the old quill pen days where business firms were three   weeks behind in their bookkeeping   There has been, of course, a very dramatic downward revision in expected third-  quarter earnings But because second-quarter earnings were revised down, we still have a   significant seasonally adjusted increase in expected earnings per share as estimated by the   analysts for the third quarter  Those earnings forecasts still have some distance to go on the   downside What is presumed to be a lead indicator of near-term earnings, the so-called profit   warnings coming out of the companies, is showing fairly significant evidence that further sizable   downward revisions are in the mix  I think one of the key reasons why, I believe quite   appropriately, the Greenbook projects capital investment to continue soft in the second half is   that, as history tells us, the chances that investment spending will turn around quickly are fairly   remote until we get a turnaround in cash flow  It's not an issue of taking out the overhang in   capital investment  I think business firms are in the process of doing that; they may even have   done it to a very large extent by now  But we have to project that capital spending will fall   below sustainable levels, and indeed in a sense build up some backlog  Markets never go from   over-extension back to normal  I can’t recall any case where that has happened, yet our forecasts   always tend to project that it will happen  And when we get close to where we think it is about   to happen we realize that it's not turning around because the over-adjustment on the downside   has not yet occurred In a sense this is not a business cycle issue; it's a human cycle issue   The data, of course, are not as bad as the psychology  Indeed, looking at the profits   data, a part of the problem in the national income and product account numbers, which are a lot   weaker than the data in the S&P 500, is the fact that those data are reflective of what companies     8/21/01 67   must report to the IRS  This means that the value of exercised options is reported as   compensation of employees and a reduction in pretax profits  In standard FASB accounting,   that's not the way they do it; and by that accounting standard, firms have higher earnings   numbers  The IRS numbers, by including the very large dollar value of exercised options, have   added a big chunk to the reported compensation of employees and have taken out a big chunk of   profitability in recent years  Obviously, the value of options is now a rapidly depreciating   number  In that sense we are going to see compensation per hour slow down significantly, and   we will also see some modest buoyancy starting to occur in the underlying earnings figures, for   no matter what companies say, they know that stock options are a game that's being played  And   they know that they can't hedge the stock option exercise effectively because the cost of a   derivative to hedge against an option grant is usually a fairly hefty sum of money  So what they   have been doing in effect is going short on the value of their stock options, and doing that has   been very expensive for a lot of companies  But implicitly it is going to help them or has helped   them in this cycle  In sum, I think the profit figures probably are unduly depressed at this point    Moreover, with the energy costs coming down but the contract costs of energy still somewhat   higher than the spot prices, there is a delayed effect in the impact of high energy costs on profits   Now, I'm not about to say that we will soon get a recovery in profits  I find that   prospect exceptionally unlikely and the reason is that there is no pricing power in markets across   the nation I would suspect that when this whole episode is over we will have a lower rate of   inflation, even in the PCE consumption deflator  As I look at the pricing structure, I see very   little evidence that discounting is coming to an end, as other members have pointed out, and   perhaps that is helpful in the sense that it has been a factor buoying household consumption    It is household consumption or household demand more generally that clearly is the     8/21/01 68   source of strength holding this economy together  In this regard I think the evidence is   increasingly persuasive that the capital gains realized on the sale of homes are inserting a fairly   significant amount of purchasing power into the economy  Indeed, such gains appear to have   been enough to significantly offset the negative effects of the decline in equity prices on   consumption expenditures  The more I look at the data, the more I am persuaded that the   deflationary effect of lower equity prices is concentrated in the capital goods markets  And the   lower implicit rates of return that those prices capture are reflected somewhat less than I think we   would have anticipated in the household sector And, as best I can judge, that is wholly a   reflection of the fact that the propensity to consume out of realized capital gains on homes   appears to be significantly higher than it is on both unrealized capital gains on homes and capital   gains in general on equities This strikes me as a reason for viewing as important the support   that housing is providing to the expansion I suspect that without that support we would be   observing much lower levels of economic activity     The liquidation of inventories continues apace  The rate of liquidation has not slowed   appreciably It does fluctuate from month to month The book value data are questionable, but   alternate ways of estimating inventory change essentially confirm that the rate of liquidation is   significant However, inventory-sales ratios are holding up because the rate of decline in the   consumption of industrial production is about in line with the rate of decline in inventories   In sum, with foreign economies clearly weakening significantly, we are in a situation   as best I can judge where the economy is being held up by household demand, which fortunately   is running somewhat better than I think many of us would have anticipated  The press reaction   to the July retail sales figures I thought was quite startling  When we take out sales of gasoline   and motor vehicles, those retail sales figures were really strong, yet the press played them as     8/21/01 69   tepid With personal consumption expenditures higher in July, third-quarter expenditures should   rise even if they do not go anywhere in August and September  So, insofar as I can judge, the   key source of support for the economy is coming from the spillover out of housing into   household demand  Of course, strength in new construction of homes is helpful, but I believe the   more powerful force on total GDP at this stage is the turnover of existing homes that engenders   realized capital gains   I believe we have some distance to go before we get out of this period of weakness  I   think our forecasts at this stage essentially reflect hope  We do not yet see any evidence of the   beginnings of a turnaround It's not that the economy is falling apart; it is not  But economic   conditions are continuously eroding and we get that sense in anecdotal reports from around the   country A possible exception is Jerry Jordan’s select sample!  Clearly, if GDP is still growing at   a 1 percent rate, we inevitably will find that a large number of companies are doing very well   and that would not be the case were we experiencing a minus 5 percent rate of decline in activity    The widespread anecdotal reports that I am exposed to do not contain very many straws   suggestive of an upturn, but that is the way the economy looks at a cyclical bottom  In fact, if we   go back and look at previous bottoms, we will find people saying exactly what I have just said    Indeed, a necessary condition for a bottom is the exhaustion of negative psychology that sets the   stage for an upturn in optimism   I believe we will eventually get the projected upturn  I don't think that the Greenbook   forecast is wrong by any means  For example, the weekly chain store sales data look quite   impressive  The data that we got this morning do suggest that the tax rebates are being spent    And if they are being spent, and we know there are $36 billion of rebates, then they’ve got to   have a positive impact  Even so, the recovery is likely to be a long process, and the presumption     8/21/01 70   that the upturn will occur very quickly is in my view just a total misreading of the underlying   adjustments to capital losses that are occurring  They are by no means completed, and I don't   think we can get a vibrant response out of this economy until these capital losses are reasonably   fully absorbed  And because activity in many sectors of the economy is already at relatively   high levels, the extent of the recovery cannot be large  Remember, the motor vehicle and   housing sectors are still experiencing well above normal levels of activity, certainly for this stage   of the cycle So I think the process of adjustment still has a long way to go     While the outlook remains subject to a good deal of uncertainty, I do think as many of   you have suggested, that the appropriate policy at this stage is to move the federal funds rate a   notch lower A 25 basis point reduction strikes me as appropriate  If we were to go 50 basis   points, our action would alarm everyone to an extent that I don’t think we can fully appreciate at   this point   I thought the reaction to the latest Beige Book was very interesting  Ordinarily, the   market tends to view the Beige Book in terms of its implications for policy, whether the Fed is   going to move rates one way or the other, and that's it  This time it was different  The markets   took this Beige Book as evidence that the Fed is a credible institution  Our sources were saying   that the economy was softening and there was some spillover from the weakness in   manufacturing to other sectors  We accepted what they said, and the markets in turn believed   what we have been saying For the first time in quite a while, that credibility is based on what   we have done The credibility of our organization is crucial, and as I said were we to go to 50   basis points today I think we would alarm everyone   I do think that the risks remain obviously weighted toward economic weakness, but at   some point we are going to have to stop our easing process  As I said at the last meeting, my     8/21/01 71   suspicion is that we will be stopping when the markets in effect are telling us to stop  That will   show up, for example, when the Greenbook forecast of a recovery actually begins to materialize   --when we distinguish between a forecast and reality  What we need is some real evidence that   the capital goods markets are bottoming, that profit erosion has stabilized, that we are seeing   signs of an upturn instead of still further negatives whenever we evaluate what individual   companies are doing  Instead of getting that, we would start to get reports that say the results   this week are mixed  I haven't seen a mixed report in a very long time  I’m referring   incidentally to surveys that the staff makes periodically of about 6 to 10 companies on a rotating   sample basis  The day that such a report comes in and indicates that these results are mixed will   be the first sign I would take that something is happening  But I would say at this point that the   real-time surveillance of the economy, especially with what is clearly an acceleration in the   deterioration abroad, is one that says we have not as yet completed our easing process  So, I   would put on the table a reduction of 25 basis points with the risks weighted toward economic   weakness Vice Chair     President Parry     President Moskow     President Stern    I just want to say that I think our techniques of knowing   where we are have improved a great deal     Well said!  President Poole     President McTeer    Governor Ferguson     President Minehan     8/21/01 74    President Broaddus     Well, at this stage the preliminarily statement does   two things, both of which it did the last time  One, it mentions how much we have reduced the   rate since the beginning of the year; and two, it eliminates any notion of an intermeeting move    But also remember that what we did most importantly last time was that we cut the funds rate by     8/21/01 76   25 basis points and not 50 And I think that set the pace  Clearly, at the point we see the picture   becoming mixed--when the data cease to indicate weakness almost across the board--that’s the   first sign that the bottom is being hit  We’re at least a meeting away from that, maybe two; we   really don’t know yet But I do think that we have to be clear that there is a bottom to this  I   agree with that     Governor Gramlich     President Santomero    President Guynn        8/21/01 77    I think the market is going to take us off the treadmill     In fact, if we could actually arrange it, that would be the   ideal way In other words, the ideal way would be that we don’t shock the market but that   suddenly we get the federal funds futures rates flattening out because the data are beginning to   look better And at the moment I see nothing to prevent us from doing that  Goverrnor Meyer     Governor Kelley     President Jordan     8/21/01 78     President Hoenig     Before we take a vote, since the press statement is a   relevant part of the decision here, I would ask the Secretary to distribute copies of the draft  Let   me just say that what was done is as close to a de minimis change from the previous statement as   we could come up with  Michelle, did you provide the wording of the last statement as well?     Okay, so we can actually see the changes from the   previous press release We took President Hoenig’s advice, as you can see     Okay, then we can vote on the 25 basis point cut and   the risks toward economic weakness  Will you read the directive language, please?     Call the roll, please     We will recess briefly so the Federal Reserve Board can   meet on the discount rate  The reason we’re going into recess, as you know, is that this press   statement presupposes a discount rate action that has not been taken  So until that’s assured we   cannot adjourn May I ask the Board members to go into my office?  Hopefully we’ll be back   shortly to confirm an action on the discount rate   [Recess]    Good morning, everyone Would somebody like   to move approval of the minutes of August 21st?    Without objection, they are approved  Dino     First, let me say that despite the tensions you   were under, you make it sound very simple And I applaud both what you did and   making it simple  When will you get data on lending volume for October 1st?     Yes     In other words, the volume was essentially   unchanged from September 28th?    But you still don’t know fully why that is   occurring?    As a working hypothesis, assume they’re all   correct! [Laughter] Further questions for Dino?    I’m sure your suggestion will meet with no   objection from your FOMC colleagues  Further questions?  Yes, President Jordan     Vice Chair     President Minehan    But if it’s wholly a matter of supply, can’t you   normalize that judgment against corporate issues?  The yield spreads went up and it’s   very tough to make a judgment, when we see movements like that, as to whether it’s a   relative supply of Treasury securities vis-à-vis other securities or an aggregate supply   effect There’s no way, I gather, that we can separate it out  I took a look at the TIPS   data and they don’t help either The question sort of sits out there as a relatively   important one because if we’re looking at a supply phenomenon, the shift we’ve seen in   the yield curve is what one would expect  There has to be some supply phenomenon   involved But whether, as President Minehan implies, an inflation premium is building   up in the market is in my view an important issue for us to get a sense of     Any further questions?  I believe President   Poole moved to ratify the transactions  Is there a second?     Without objection, they are approved  Thank   you very much  Let’s move on  We now go to the most important part of the meeting-­  the most informative, illuminating, and provocative, right?    I wasn’t calling on you; I was calling on   somebody else!  [Laughter]     10/2/01 15     President Moskow     10/2/01 22     President Jordan     President Parry     President Minehan     Further questions?  If not, who would like to   start the Committee discussion?  President Moskow     President Parry     President McTeer     President Poole     President Stern     President Hoenig     President Minehan     10/2/01 45    President Guynn     President Santomero     Let’s take a break at this stage  Coffee is next   door Let’s return in fifteen minutes, please  Thank you   [Coffee break]    President Broaddus, will you continue for us?     President Jordan     Vice Chair    Governor Ferguson     Governor Kelley    Governor Meyer     Governor Gramlich    Thank you  Let’s move on to Don Kohn     Questions for Don?  President Parry        10/2/01 79    May I make a suggestion?  Why don’t you have   Dave Stockton talk to you about this  He’s got it down pat    I knew you wouldn’t disappoint me!  [Laughter]     Governor Gramlich    Governor Meyer    Anybody else?  In keeping with the way Dave   Stockton started off this discussion, I’ll continue  I think the wide range of uncertainties   regarding what has happened and what is about to happen has been fully explored here   and I believe very effectively so  We learn a lot about the uncertainties that we face just   by listening to those who are involved in evaluating recent developments--for example,   what the individual presidents have said about what is going on in their Districts  And I   think the degree of humility that the rest of us have expressed about our understanding is     10/2/01 82   a measure of the fact that we are indeed dealing with a situation that is extraordinarily   uncertain   The one area that has not been mentioned, which I believe requires a bit of   discussion, is the very dramatic decline that we have had in equity asset prices  We are   talking about losses in the last week or so of more than a trillion dollars in the value of   stock market holdings  What we know about this sort of phenomenon is that it has a   really significant impact  While it may be difficult to make a judgment as to the   magnitude of that impact, we do have to have some sense of what the appropriate value   of stocks ought to be or what equity premiums ought to be in the context of what we   perceive to be the long-term equilibrium real federal funds rate  The work that has been   done around here suggests, adjusted with all due humility, that the equity market is still   slightly above where it ought to be That is not an important issue in and of itself, but   what is important is history  History suggests that markets do not go from over-valuation   to normal valuation and stay there  It suggests that markets almost invariably over-adjust   in the opposite direction That in turn suggests to me that the notion that somehow we   are beyond any further deflation from the asset side is at least open to serious question  I   don’t pretend to say that the adjustment process needs to occur very quickly  Indeed, one   scenario could involve a very large adjustment in equity prices, a couple of years of   hiatus, and then another adjustment  Clearly, that is not a noncredible scenario  We have   seen it in the past   All I want to indicate here is that the risks clearly are on the downside  And   without getting into more discussion on the issue, I would merely say that what we ought   to do--as I think most of the people around this table already have suggested--is to ease        10/2/01 83   by 50 basis points and retain the statement indicating that the risks are tilted toward   economic weakness  The pluses and the minuses have been fully explored, and I think   that would be the appropriate policy at this point  Vice Chair    Governor Ferguson    Governor Meyer     President Hoenig     President Parry     Governor Gramlich     President Minehan     President Jordan     Yes, I agree with the Vice Chair Indeed, one of   the things we haven’t discussed relates to the implications of another episode  My   impression is that in such an event we will do what we’ve done in the past  We would   issue an FOMC statement at that time indicating in effect what you’re suggesting  I   prefer not to put that into the statement today I think it complicates it and probably isn’t   necessary President Santomero     President Stern     President Poole     10/2/01 85    No, I think hunkering down was the appropriate   thing to do right after the shock    Yes, I agree with you  There’s certainly no   need for us to change our normal practices  I do think our degree of uncertainty is higher,   but that’s the nature of the game       10/2/01 86     No, I agree with that     Yes     President Moskow     President Guynn     Governor Kelley    President Broaddus     And finally, President McTeer     Thank you  Would you proceed to read the    appropriate text?     Call the roll      I’d like to call a recess and request that the   Board of Governors meet next door to discuss an appropriate action on the discount rate   requests of the Reserve Banks     10/2/01 88   [Meeting recessed]    As you can see in the draft press statement   we’ve distributed, we’ve adopted the Hoenig principle on these types of press releases on   the grounds that the more we try to say, the more complex the issue gets and the less   clear our actual message  I think that has worked well and we thank you     In any event, this wording is very close to the   previous statement made after our last meeting  I assume you’ve all had a chance to look   at it Does anybody have any strong objections to letting it go as it is?  If not, I thank you   all very much   Our next meeting is scheduled for November 6th This meeting is adjourned   but we will have Don Winn as our guest at lunch to give us a review of the legislative   agenda   END OF MEETING        Good morning, everyone  Would somebody like to move   approval of the minutes of our October meeting?    Without objection  Dino    Will the emergence of fails in the order of magnitude   we’ve been seeing lately impair the market structure in any ongoing way that should concern us?     11/6/01 6    Yet the Treasury reopened the 10-year due to obvious   concerns about--   What was the Treasury worried about other than fails?  On   the face of it, fails seem to be a disruption to the normal market process  If fails are benign, why   does anybody really care all that much?     Has that ever happened?    I was slightly distracted, Dino, when you were explaining   why it is that the Japanese banks are willing to take the lower yielding 5-year swaps rather than   JGBs Did you say it was for tax reasons?     You mean in terms of their capital?     Any negative results?     President Poole     Further comments or questions?  Mr Vice Chair, would   you make your usual motion?     I didn’t think we could rewrite the press statement as a   Committee, but we did!  The next meeting is December 11, 2001  We adjourn for lunch   END OF MEETING         Without objection, they are approved  We now move on to   Dave Stockton and Karen Johnson     President Moskow     11/6/01 16    President Broaddus    Governor Meyer     President Parry     11/6/01 21    Do you know if there is anything special in the adjustment   that goes from starts to value put in place that would be involved in this change?     I think that’s an issue     There’s also the risk that the provision will be not for three   years but for one or two years     President Stern     President Poole     Any further questions for our colleagues?  If not, who   would like to start the Committee discussion?  President Parry     Is that residential and commercial?     President McTeer     President Minehan    President Broaddus     President Stern     11/6/01 37     President Moskow    President Guynn     President Hoenig     President Santomero     President Poole    Okay It is a little after 1100 am I understand that coffee   is available next door Let’s take a break but try to be back in 15 minutes     [Coffee break]          Vice Chair     President Jordan    Governor Ferguson     11/6/01 60     Governor Gramlich    Governor Meyer     11/6/01 65     To say the least!     11/6/01 68    You’re on, Governor Kelley    Thank you very much We now turn to Don Kohn     Questions for Don?  President Hoenig     President Minehan    Governor Meyer     Any further questions for Don? If not, let me proceed     11/6/01 77   This is a particularly difficult period and I want to start off with a few important issues    The first is that we keep forecasting stabilization but there has been no evidence of it anywhere  We   go from one Greenbook to the next with a projection of rising economic activity, at least beyond the   near term  And, indeed, by the processes we employ for forecasting, that conclusion is inevitable    The alternative forecast would be one that violates the rules of statistical inference or, I should say,   the great historical research that Dave Stockton set into motion, which concluded that the United   States has never had a recession that failed to end  That general view is very helpful, I know, but the   important issue is for us to be aware that we are witnessing developments that are quite   extraordinary As a number of you have mentioned, the international outlook is continuing to   deteriorate We currently are observing the obverse of the extraordinary accelerations that occurred   in world economies during the latter part of the 1990s as a consequence of increased globalization--a   development that is now seen as a two-edged sword  Indeed, the dispersion of growth rates in   economies around the world has come down very dramatically    There is an increasingly synchronous and mutually reinforcing pattern of economic   activity among the world’s nations, and we are beginning to see a gradual breakdown of barriers to   stabilization as our economy goes from one stage to the next  The erosion is slow but persistent  It   is a development that I don’t think any of us has seen previously  We certainly don’t put it into our   econometric models, whether they are structural or VAR  Indeed, the one thing we can say about   our models is that left to their own devices they will not project a long-lasting deflationary process    The coefficients and the structure of the models always produce an upturn at some point  There is a   tendency to revert to the type of growth path that has characterized our economic history  We   cannot presume that we can put a few exogenous assumptions into our models and then conclude the   model predictions are telling us something  I submit that that is not true  We are telling the model     11/6/01 78   what to conclude by the way we have built it, and indeed the exogenous inputs that we put in will   not induce a contraction unless we go far beyond the normal range of inputs that we have used in the   past Nonetheless, the real world has the potential to generate deflation, and I think we are moving   gradually from a disinflationary process toward a situation where we could begin to experience   outright deflation I think that inflation rates finally are getting down to a level that can satisfy Al   Broaddus, which is something I thought would never emerge  But the point is that he’s right  At   this stage I don’t know what the next Greenbook is going to show, but I would wager that it will   indicate a weaker economy  What is very disturbing is that we have not yet seen any underlying   basis for stabilization In that regard I found the comments around this room very distressing  To be   sure, nobody has said that the economy is weakening substantially; it is not recovering, but neither is   it going down precipitously    There is one part of our economic system that is saying in effect that the economy is   stabilizing It is called the stock market, and I hope it is right  The stock market patterns of the last   several weeks are essentially projecting a bottom in the US economy and the world economy   sometime in the early months of 2002  If the market were a person, I would ask about the basis for   such a conclusion Earnings expectations continue to decline, and we are seeing patterns that   historically would suggest a rally in a bear market that may be perfectly consistent with a subsequent   decline I wish I could take greater comfort from the recent rally, but I have looked at too many   stock market charts going back to the 19th century to take much comfort in recent developments   I think the surge in motor vehicle sales is a fascinating phenomenon because I do not   believe that we can explain it wholly in terms of price discounting  The problem unfortunately is   that the estimate for October sales is so bizarrely out of the ordinary that even if there is a good deal     11/6/01 79   of real change in the demand for motor vehicles, sales will still have to come down very sharply just   to get back to something resembling normal     I think we are looking at developments that imply a very difficult policy issue  My first   reaction to the employment data on Friday was to presume that the wisest thing for us to do today   would be to move the funds rate down 25 basis points, given the downside risks, and  to continue to   make 25 basis point moves as long as we have to  I struggled through the weekend reviewing   numerous anecdotal reports and looking carefully at the simulations that our models are creating    And most interestingly I took a really close look at what is going on abroad, where the data are not   as good as ours but they are increasingly more disturbing     I thought that your UPS report, Bill, was striking because it is anecdotally consistent with   what we are seeing, namely a gradual but continuous contraction with no evidence of any degree of   stabilization  I believe we are at a point where we are beyond disinflation and getting to the edge of   a deflationary process This means that even if we were to provide a great deal of stimulus, we   would still have to deal with disinflation before we could create a problem of inflation  So we have   a few stages to go through   I must admit that one of the things I read which sort of struck me as being relevant was   that little box on the “zero bound” that Vince and his staff put in the Bluebook  I thought it really   addressed the key question   I don’t think any of us has a big dispute on the economic outlook  But there is a crucial   dispute here It relates to the issue of whether we want to keep our powder dry or whether we want   to make sure that we put in enough shot to knock down the opponent before the opponent eventually   does us in I started with the view that keeping the powder dry was the wisest policy, but as I   struggled through the weekend I came out where Al Broaddus is  The reason I would argue for such     11/6/01 80   an adjustment is that policy invariably gets down to the issue of what happens if we are wrong  And   what I conclude is that if doing 50 basis points today is wrong--if it turns out that the economy starts   to stabilize tomorrow and a lot of things go well--being required to move our funds rate target back   up would be the most delightful problem we could conceivably face  I don’t anticipate that  I think   the chances of that happening are extraordinarily remote  I do think that if we have an inadequate   response today, there is a danger--because as I see it we are at a critical point in the way this   economy is functioning--that we will be taking too high a risk  I don’t know what the future holds   for us I don’t think any of us can know But on the basis of what we do know, what is the   downside if we do 25 and we are wrong or we do 50 and we are wrong?  In my judgment the answer   to that question is pretty forceful As a consequence I must say that, after great struggle, I come out   in favor of 50 basis points  I wouldn’t go to 75 basis points largely because I am not absolutely   convinced that I am right  If I were, I would argue for that larger move     Sure    Yes I think the expectation that we will do another 25   basis points will be built into the market  I’m not sure that’s all bad  I very much suspect, in terms   of the way Don put it, that we already have a goodly part of that further easing baked into the   market  If we were to go 75 basis points, I would really be concerned about what the forward   position of the funds market would be  And taking Bill Poole’s general edict, we must be careful of     11/6/01 81   what we construct out there because how we respond to what is in the forward markets has a very   significant impact So I think it is far safer for us to be moving 50 basis points, and frankly that is   what I would like to put on the table, and to continue in any case a bias toward economic weakness    Vice Chair    I second that     President Parry     Governor Gramlich    Governor Ferguson     Governor Kelley    Governor Meyer    President Broaddus     President Stern     President Santomero        11/6/01 84    President Poole     Let me just comment on that  First of all, if we seriously   believed the time horizon was five years, then I think making a statement that the long-term   prospects are optimistic is in any meaningful sense just wrong  When I talk about it, I’m thinking in   terms of two years or something in that range  If in fact our comments are holding long-term interest   rates up--if indeed we’re that powerful--then I submit to you that if we take the position that the   world is going to be awful for the next five years, we can create that result even if it’s not in prospect   now So I would be careful about what we say we perceive  I personally don’t believe that the   problems are deep seated to the extent that we are looking at a situation like the 1930s or something   of that sort But I do think that we are going through a period where the next year or next couple of   years is going to be subnormal  I don’t know whether I’m talking about just the first part of that   period or whether the second part also will involve less than adequate growth  But I’m surely not   arguing that it’s going to go on for longer than that  I have no evidence that that is the case      But, remember, we have revised down the forecast since   those earlier cuts    It’s not as though the forecast remained unchanged from   the immediate post-September 11th period If it had, we would be in far better shape now The   outlook has deteriorated  That’s the problem     President Jordan     President Hoenig     President Minehan     President Moskow     President McTeer    President Guynn    Will you read the appropriate wording?    Would you call the roll?     The preliminary statement that has been drafted is very   close to the previous one  It’s very short and it will be circulated to you  In the meantime I request   that the Board of Governors retire to the room next door so that we can act on a discount rate   request So, this meeting is in recess and we will return shortly   [Recess]    I think that’s a valid criticism  Would somebody else like   to comment on it?     No, I agree with that  I think the question is whether or not   we phrase it in the way it is phrased here     No, there is a heightened risk premium that has occurred as   a consequence of this What we’re talking about, in the extreme form, is the elimination of just-in-  time inventories    Yes, why don’t we say the “necessary diversion of   resources”?     No, “necessary” addresses the issue that Cathy is raising     Is that adequate?    Would you feel better if we said  “The necessary diversion   of resources to enhance security is likely to detract from advances in productivity for a time”?     No, the reference here is to structural productivity  I might   note that the estimate for productivity in the third quarter is going to be coming out tomorrow  I   don’t know what the precise number is going to be, but it’s going to show strong productivity in the   quarter If we subtracted out the September 11th problem, it would be supportive of the fact that   there have been structural changes in productivity in the last four or five years    So it’s not cyclical productivity we’re talking about     I agree with that  That’s why the words “necessary    reallocation”--     Yes, that may do it    Yes, measured productivity  I think the key question as far   as the statement goes is  Do we want to leave in “and protect against production disruptions”?    The sentence is very long  Let me read it and see whether   or not we need that phrase “Although the necessary…” Do we want to say “reallocation” or   “diversion”?   SEVERAL “Reallocation”     11/6/01 96    “Although the necessary reallocation of resources to   enhance security is likely to detract from measured advances in productivity for a time, the long-  term prospects for productivity growth and the economy remain favorable and should become   evident once the unusual forces restraining demand abate”    The first reference is to measured productivity  The second   one is to true productivity growth so I would leave the word “measured” out    Let me tell you what the problem is  If we’re going to get   into this, we’ve got a serious problem, which is whether in fact we’re measuring efficiency or   improvements in the quality of our standard of living     Environmental and other types of controls do not increase   efficiency They improve the quality of life  Measured productivity is efficiency     It’s conceivable, but that’s not what is being measured    One way of looking at it is that a lot of activities basically don’t benefit us because they are in some   sense protective A big chunk of medical expenditures falls into that category; it depends on   whether the expense is for preventive or curative purposes  What I’m trying to get at here is that this   involves a very serious conceptual problem     We don’t want to get into that     Can we say “the appropriate reallocation of resources”?  I   made the statement in testimony to Congress in very much this way  I got very positive responses     Let’s do it    Yes, in that context we don’t really need measured  Let me   reread it “Although the”--do you want to say necessary or appropriate?   SPEAKER(?)  “Appropriate”    “Although the appropriate reallocation of resources to   enhance security may restrain advances in productivity for a time, the long-term prospects” etc    I think that does it   SPEAKER(?)  All right!     President Moskow     No, it’s part of the boilerplate     Oh yes, it’s part of the boilerplate      Okay?    I think that’s a good suggestion  Is that okay with   everybody?   SEVERAL  Yes     I would first like to welcome our new members—Susan Bies   and Mark Olson    Would somebody like to move approval of the minutes of   our November 6th meeting?     Is there a second?     Without objection, they are approved  Mr Kos    I’ve been hearing talk in the last week to ten days or so about   this issue concerning whether or not we, the United States government, approve of this notion that has   surfaced in Tokyo of purchases of long-term US Treasuries by the Bank of Japan  We are the   government  What in fact is our opinion on this issue?  I guess we’re not the government!  [Laughter]     12/11/01 6    I know of no official who has made any comments, certainly not publicly  Has anybody spoken to the   Treasury? There are only two possible sources Larry Lindsey at the White House or John Taylor at   the Treasury I haven’t spoken to them about this issue  Has anybody?     Well, how in the world can you distinguish between   purchases for one reason or the other?    Maybe I’ll ask somebody the question  I won’t have to ask   you, though I may have gotten a clearer answer out of you than I will from them!  [Laughter]   I find this correlation between the 10-year Treasury yield and duration in the mortgage-  backed securities market bizarre  It’s not a correlation that one normally sees; it’s one we see only   when one of the variables departs from the other I look at these weekly jiggles or daily jiggles that   are occurring and I wonder what this correlation would look like if you went back to before September   4--the first observation on your chart    In the study the change has not been that great in the last few   months What would happen if you went back to the spring?  Do you have any idea?    My problem is that when I see somebody publish a chart like   this I know the earlier data don’t fit because if they did, the producer of the chart would show them    [Laughter]    Yes, I know that Sure     Clearly, the 10-year Treasury note is a crucial element in the   calculation of the option-adjusted duration     Further questions for Dino?    I tried to capture what I thought would be the center of the   Committee’s views  If there are no objections, we will consider this the statement of the Committee    I’d like to remind you all that our next meeting is a multiple-day meeting, to be held on   Tuesday and Wednesday, January 29th and 30th We can go to lunch We have as our guest a   prominent Treasury Department official whose name I won’t mention until he arrives   END OF MEETING         Without objection, they are approved  We’ll now move to   the economic situation  David Oh, today it’s a “double David”  Karen is back?    Karen, I hope your mother is doing well     Gentlemen     Questions for our colleagues?  President Poole?     12/11/01 14      Vice Chair     President Jordan     President Moskow    But I think the question was more related to what I assume is   the effect of moving up a tranche of capital investment and getting an earlier technology    And presumably that’s suboptimal from a market point of   view, but the question basically is whether the effect is big enough to make a difference     The capital-output ratio is the same but the composition of   the capital may not be optimal or as effective as--      President Minehan     How far are we from inserting some mortgage-backed   security duration variable in our macro model?    I’m wondering because this conversation is leading us in a   very peculiar direction What concerns me about it is that we are seeing this very high sensitivity to   long-term mortgage rates, for example in the extraction of home equity that tends to lead promptly to   consumption expenditures  I wonder whether or not we’re going to find that the convergence of those   two lines on the stock-of-debt chart--Treasury and mortgage-backed securities--may have some   macroeconomic significance  I hate to find us doing macro simulations and then orally commenting   on why it doesn’t work in these terms  At some point you’re going to want to put a variable in there   hopefully to capture this    I know you’re not because it’s not in the forecast!  [Laughter]     President Parry     President Minehan     President Jordan     12/11/01 26      Further questions for our colleagues?  If not, who would like   to start the Committee discussion?  President Parry     President Moskow     President McTeer     President Hoenig    President Guynn     12/11/01 36      President Minehan    President Broaddus     President Stern     President Santomero     President Jordan     Okay Let’s break for coffee, which I presume is outside   [Coffee break]     President Poole     Governor Gramlich     Vice Chair    Governor Ferguson    Governor Meyer     Governor Bies     12/11/01 66     Governor Olson    We move on to Don Kohn       12/11/01 68     I have a couple of questions about this “perfect foresight”   model It’s an ideal way to make monetary policy, if we have a perfect foresight or even some   foresight! [Laughter]  I’m just curious about it from a technical standpoint  With reference to the   model, there’s a sentence in the Bluebook that says,  “The policymaker is assumed to view both the   output and inflation gaps with equal distaste, and the penalty on interest-rate changes was selected to   deliver policy predictions that make the funds rate about as volatile as it has been over the past ten   years” I’m a little curious as to why that constraint in the forecast is required if the model fully   determines what the economy is going to do  It’s a fully deterministic model, but there has to be an   optimum path for short-term interest rates that does not require that sort of tradeoff  Why is it there?     I understand that  Why do we want to?  If in fact you’re   getting the sort of result that you find distasteful, are you not suggesting that the model may be at   fault, rather than the assumptions?    I think we all know what’s happening here  Let me see if I can   rephrase my question in defense of my position that the constraint undercuts part of the point of this   exercise You have a set of fixed coefficients here  In any econometric model there is a rigidity that   probably does not exist in the real world, and there are second-order and third-order coefficients that   tend to stabilize instead of producing distinct, exact effects; they smooth everything out  And that I   presume is what you’re doing       I think the issue is not about our feelings or our tastes; this is a   question of fact If you have a perfect foresight model that is wholly deterministic, then any action   you take should exactly replicate what is going to happen in the real world  That’s the presumption    But if you are putting additional constraints into the model, of necessity you must be overriding the   deterministic nature of the model because the model solves in the sense that you have as many   unknowns as you have basic inputs  Consequently, you’re over-determining the model on the basis of   judgments that essentially say that you don’t want an optimum conclusion or, which is more likely and   is obviously a fact of life, that the model itself is not a true replication of reality in all respects       I don’t want to pursue this at length here, but I do want to   determine precisely what you’re suggesting  It involves a very complex mathematical solution  You   just can’t say that smoothing creates this result and that the constraints that you’re imposing with   respect to the exercise, including equal taste--      It’s equal distaste; that is the better term, which is a   mathematical term  The problem is that it’s a very useful concept if only we could apply it!  And I’m   just trying to ferret that out, which gets me to the real question I wanted to ask  Granted that the   presumptions with respect to policy are what you stipulate, namely that in effect there’s equal distaste,     12/11/01 74    that there’s an objective function endeavoring to limit volatility, and there’s a constraint, which is   really part of the model, that the federal funds rate has to be greater than zero  Assuming all of that,   how significant are the effects of alternate economic assumptions on the path of the federal funds rate?    Is this a model in which the input specifications for the economy, not the policy they are imposing,   create a very sensitive, fluctuating funds rate?  Or are the policy restraints such and the nature of the   long-term structural outcome of the economy such that, almost independently of what some of the   input variables are in the economy, the path is essentially robust?     I assumed that, right     That’s the reason why I’m raising it       Yes The reason I’m raising these issues is that I think this is   a very interesting, original addition to the various vehicles that we’re employing in making monetary   policy And despite the presumption, which is obviously factually true, that all we ever set is the   funds rate for the next 15 minutes, there is nonetheless a path that we should have in the back of our     12/11/01 75    minds  Granting all the weaknesses in this type of approach, it is conceptually the way we really   ought to be going about policy issues It gets to the kinds of notions President Broaddus was raising in   earlier periods about the optimum inflation rate--where we should be, how we should get there, and   what is the path of the funds rate that stabilizes inflation and therefore presumably long-term real   growth So I’m merely saying that this is a worthwhile endeavor to pursue  It’s just that I’m trying to   understand it    But the optimum long-term inflation goal should be   determined by the model if you believe the model  There is a level of inflation that maximizes long-  term economic goals  It shouldn’t be an input to the model  President Poole     Okay, go ahead    Further questions for Don?  If not, let me get started   Prior to September 11, I think there was clear evidence of stabilization in some sectors of   the economy  That pattern was broken decisively on September 11  Not only did the quite intense   forces that were causing deflation in asset prices and economic activity prior to September 11   subsequently gather momentum, but new forces of a similar nature began to press down quite   significantly on the economy  Frankly, that was one of the reasons why I was concerned that the   Greenbook forecast prepared for this meeting would be revised downward  I was delighted to find out   that I was wrong And I suspect the reason I was wrong is that something is going on in the economy,   even in the world economy, that was not evident earlier, namely that we are seeing a greater   synchronousness of activity within this economy and worldwide  There is far greater synchronization,   for example, among the twelve Districts, among different types of companies and products, and   clearly among the world economies  That has generally been read as an indication that the world is   becoming more vulnerable to cumulative downturns because if every economy is moving in the same   direction, it becomes a self-feeding, self-reinforcing process that can induce volatility in the economic   system    I suspect that that view has to be tempered at least in part  And I think the evidence we   have seen in the last couple of months, especially since September 11, is that to a large extent the   synchronousness in world economic activity is due to the availability of very substantially improved     12/11/01 78    information  Thirty years ago we used to see companies and industries moving in quite different   directions One of the reasons was that the information available to individual firms was distinctly   different because, unlike the situation today, a real-time data system that permits everyone to look at   the same database did not exist  What that means in today’s environment is that imbalances that   emerge can be more readily resolved, but the resolution can create contraction or expansion in   economic activity  If everyone is looking at the same data and is subject to somewhat the same   imbalances, we get synchronousness, but it is not a synchronousness that is necessarily self-  cumulating on the downside    One can very readily argue that the evidence of the last two months is indeed a fascinating   test of whether the latter is the case  If there ever were a situation in which the fabric of confidence   was going to be breached throughout the business and consumer sectors, September 11 would have   done that Indeed, for a couple of days the economy came to a very dramatic halt  What we are now   observing, however, is not cumulative weakening but the emergence of mixed signs in the economy    We’re seeing some evidence of stabilization, and the question is basically whether we are looking at   the emergence of forces that are engendering not only stabilization but an actual recovery from here    The markets are obviously saying yes  The stock market is difficult to understand, especially in terms   of what we know about earnings, and the bond market is even more difficult to understand  But there   are well-informed people in those markets who are trying to maximize their asset positions  So it’s not   a roulette game out there     If the very considerable and continuing overhang of deflationary forces, which we discussed   at considerable length at the last meeting, is still there--and all of the evidence suggests to me at least   that it is--then the question is what is going to reverse this contraction in economic activity  Well, one   of the elements that have been discussed around the table is the inventory situation  And indeed the     12/11/01 79    inventory numbers are simply awesome  My recollection is that October motor vehicle inventories   went down at an annual rate of $100 billion on a national income and product accounting basis  We’re   seeing very significant liquidations, which essentially means that as soon as final demand stabilizes,   days’ supply in an operational sense will go down very rapidly  When that occurs, business firms will   suddenly start to find themselves short, and orders will turn up  Well, we are not quite there yet, but   we are getting a few very early signals of some firming of demand  They are occurring mainly in the   commodity markets, which tend to be reflective, especially the metals, of the base of the durable   goods economy, the most volatile and inventory-laden part of the economy  Prices are beginning to   move up in commodities markets, suggesting that demand is beginning to pick up there because   inventory liquidation has probably reached a maximum That means that the rate of production will   start to rise relative to the rate of consumption of materials and products     That inventories may now be closer to the point where firms will start to taper off the rate of   liquidation is evidenced by the responses to the National Association of Purchasing Managers question   on customer inventory positions  Since by definition all inventories are manufactured goods, the   people who know what’s happening are those who sell such goods  So, the purchasing managers of   manufacturing or industrial concerns are in the best position to get a sense of the current status of   inventories A full survey of all those who actually hold inventories is a very difficult undertaking, the   data collection process is lengthy, and when such a survey has been tried the results have not been   satisfactory This survey, which is relatively new, seems to be capturing a goodly part of what is   going on in the marketplace     Contrary to what outside estimators are suggesting with regard to the industrial production   index for the month of October, we are beginning to see a very dramatic slowing in the rate of decline    The reason we are seeing a smaller negative than the markets is that there is a lot more current     12/11/01 80   productivity growth--or more exactly growth in output per hour--in the manufacturing area than   outside observers are assuming  That slower rate of decline is also reflected in the very rough weekly   series that’s supposed to replicate the industrial production index; it shows that most of the decline in   October occurred in the first two weeks of the month  Production started to come back in the last half   of October, but it couldn’t come back enough to prevent the average for November from being below   the average for October  These figures, if we can believe them, essentially are saying that the level at   the end of November is above the average level for November or at worst about equal to it  That   would suggest that production levels are beginning to support a reduction in inventory liquidation    If this is indeed happening, then final demand clearly is where the uncertainties are  The   crucial sector is personal consumption expenditures where there are a number of forces at play  One is   motor vehicle sales, which have been startlingly high in October and November and in fact have been   engendering a good part of the liquidation in inventories for that part of the economy  However, as   best we can judge, motor vehicle sales slumped very sharply in the first 10 days of December  They   were really quite weak, and one would assume that they were close to the average level projected in   the Greenbook for the month of December; but they seemingly are on the way down  So motor   vehicles no longer seem to be a positive force     Another positive force that has been removed stems from the rise in mortgage interest rates   They obviously are up quite significantly  Indeed, the 10-year Treasury yield, which usually is a good   proxy for mortgage rates, has gone up almost a full percentage point  And as best I can gather, that’s   pretty much what has happened to mortgage rates  Low mortgage rates have been a key factor in the   turnover of existing homes from which realized capital gains are engendered  And since those realized   capital gains are a major part of the extraction of home equity for consumption purposes, one would   assume that higher mortgage rates will foster some weakness in existing home sales and, indirectly,     12/11/01 81    some weakness in consumption expenditures  It is certainly the case that the cash-outs in refinancings   mentioned earlier also would be affected, largely because the absolute level of refinancings is already   declining significantly, and there is no evidence that the cash-out proportions have changed enough to   offset that So we are beginning to see some softening after a prolonged period when the extraction of   funds from home equity has fostered consumption expenditures     On the positive side, obviously, we’ve seen a significant decline in the prices of fuel oil and   gasoline The effects can be quite substantial, as a number of you have indicated  But remember that   these are one-shot effects and that in order for those effects to continue we have to get still further   declines in crude oil or natural gas prices That’s not likely to happen, but it is certainly the case that   we are now getting the full impact of the declines  What we used to call an oil tax cut probably exerts   its effects with very little lag  It has been a major factor in the markets and it may well be a factor   holding up Christmas sales  But we don’t know that quite yet     The major uncertain negative is the further rise in the unemployment rate  I am not   referring primarily to its eventual level because if the rate went to a higher level and adjusted there, the   markets would also adjust and we would pretty well know what consumption expenditures were   associated with that level of unemployment  But when the rate of change is as great as it has been in   recent months, and when the rate of layoffs is as high as it has been, we are getting a whole new set of   consumers that are shocked by uncertainty  The impact on consumption is indeterminate at this stage    The sign is pretty clear It has to be negative but we don’t know how negative  So at this point we’re   not clear as to how to view this weakening employment situation or we shouldn’t be clear because I   don’t think there is any way in which we can know   Fortunately, homebuilding per se has been holding up, and while the rise in mortgage rates   may trim it some, the weather clearly has been positive in the areas where the major population centers     12/11/01 82    are located  As a consequence, weather is likely to give us somewhat better residential construction   activity in the period ahead, and I presume that’s also the case for some areas of nonresidential   construction   How the combination of final demand balances against the issue of inventory liquidation   probably comes down at the end of the day to capital investment, as a number of you mentioned  And   capital investment gets down to corporate cash flow  Here I think the uncertainty relating to the   ongoing deflationary pressures is still very formidable  While we have had much better output per   hour than we anticipated for this particular period and presumably wage increases and general worker   compensation are decelerating, the ability of firms to pass through increasing costs is virtually   nonexistent This is another way of measuring the extent of the deflationary forces that are pressing   on the economy The evidence we have, both anecdotal and otherwise, is that it is very difficult to   pass on cost increases to customers  Profit margins have come down very sharply  Indeed, if we look   strictly at the nonfinancial, nonenergy corporate sector, profits are down to levels that are as low as I   remember them and the inability to raise prices is really crippling cash flows  What that suggests is   that the outlook for profitability is very important to the general outlook and that’s where final demand   is going to be financed   It’s certainly the case that security analysts, as I have mentioned to you previously, are not   terribly good as forecasters but they are not bad as reporters  And they are reporting that the high-tech   earnings outlook has stabilized in the last three or four weeks  The non-high-tech area, however,   continues to deteriorate though at a lesser pace than it was  This clearly is a pattern of earnings   expectations that is inconsistent with what stock prices are doing if one believes current standard   capital asset valuation models But as Dave Stockton pointed out, it may very well be that the markets   are displaying increased flexibility and that the ability of this economy to recover will differ from what     12/11/01 83    it was in the past Analysts and stock purchasers may be looking beyond the current squeeze in profit   expectations to a much better longer-term outlook and may perceive that the increased flexibility of   the markets may itself enable lower equity premiums and the obverse higher price/earnings ratios to   persist in the marketplace  But how all that will come out clearly relates to the outlook for capital   investment  At this stage I would say it is just too early to make a judgment     When we get to policy, it’s pretty evident to me that the case for standing pat at this point   requires that the stock market remain overvalued for a protracted period of time  Now, that’s not an   inconceivable event It may be, as Dave says, not an overvaluation but possibly a new way of looking   at the market  You didn’t say exactly that, Dave; I’m just interpreting what you said in a somewhat   different manner  Or it may be, as often happens, that the markets stay overvalued or undervalued for   protracted periods of time If that’s the case, it is conceivable that the earnings outlook could stabilize,   perhaps even improve, in which case capital investment can stabilize and consumption may still do   well on the presumption that long-term mortgage rates do not keep going up and create additional   problems  But it is a credible position   I would only argue that the risk of doing nothing is too high because I think that the play-  out of deflationary forces, at least looking at profit expectations, is not anywhere near complete  It   may have an extended period to go; we don’t know that  But so long as that is the case, I think we   would probably be wise to move the funds rate down another 25 basis points, as the market expects,   and retain the statement that suggests that weakness is the most likely risk in the outlook  I don’t deny   that our history--that is, the Federal Reserve’s history--is one in which we’ve typically moved at least   once more often than we probably should have on both ends of the cycle  I’m not sure that’s all bad    First of all, we’re not absolutely certain that had we not moved we would have gotten the outcome that   we are looking at in retrospect  But we’re always dealing with uncertainties and unknowns and we’re     12/11/01 84    always tacking away from one place or the other  If I knew for certain that the economy was going to   be moving up in the second half of 2002 as in the Greenbook, I would say it would be a grave mistake   at this point to move the rate down  I don’t know that and I don’t think anybody can know that  As a   consequence, I think that the least risky action is to reduce the rate because, as I’ve said in the past,   one way of looking at these types of situations is to ask ourselves what are the consequences if we are   wrong And in this case I would suggest that if we move the rate down 25 basis points and that turns   out to be wrong, I cannot conceive of the deflationary forces moving away sufficiently quickly to   prevent us from moving the rate back up well before inflationary pressures rise  If on the other hand   we stand pat and these deflationary forces are larger than we expect, we’ll look back and find that   standing pat was a mistake  I know it’s a close call and I don’t want to argue that this is a closed issue    I do think that the weight of the evidence at this stage suggests that the best solution is in fact to move   down 25 basis points and stay asymmetric to the downside  Vice Chair     President Poole     I agree with that and I think there are two ways to handle that   problem  One is in the balance of risks statement and the other is in the full press statement that we   make  I would much prefer to put something in the full statement itself that recognizes that the   situation has changed from an unmitigated set of negative forces to a more mixed environment now  I   would prefer to do it that way because, as far as I’m concerned, it’s too abrupt an adjustment to change   to a balance of risks statement that says it is just as likely that at the next meeting we will raise rates as   lower them  I just don’t think that’s credible  But it’s certainly credible--in fact I agree with your   probabilities that the chances are probably two to one--that we will not be changing the funds rate at   our next meeting     President Parry    Governor Ferguson    President Broaddus     President Moskow     President Stern    Governor Meyer    We will obviously be considering your notions and I’ll   appoint two or three people to be the proxy for you  It’s going to require two or three people to do   that! [Laughter] In any case, I’m sure that in the weeks ahead there will be a lot of statements about   your contributions to this Committee  But I doubt that any of us has to say very much  I think we’re   all acutely aware of your accomplishments  [Applause] Governor Gramlich     President Minehan    President Guynn     President Santomero    I’m glad it’s short!  [Laughter] President Jordan     President Hoenig     12/11/01 95      President McTeer     I might note that in fact that issue did come up and the   general consensus, at least among the staff, is that it probably would create more uncertainty than   otherwise But it’s an interesting idea     I’m aware of that     12/11/01 96      Governor Bies    Governor Olson    Will you read the directive wording?     Call the roll      I’d like to ask that this Committee go into recess and that the   Board of Governors congregate next door where we will address the issue of discount rate requests by   the Reserve Banks  I hope that while we are doing that, the preliminary statement will be distributed   to everybody   [Recess]     The FOMC meeting is now back in session  The Board of   Governors, much to everybody’s surprise, voted as was contemplated in the first paragraph of the draft   press release Has everyone had a chance to read that statement?  Are there comments or suggested   alterations?    Good morning, everyone  Would somebody like to move   approval of the minutes of our January 29-30 meeting?     Without objection, they are approved  Mr Kos    How do you read the Argentinean situation?  It seems to   be going from one state of deterioration to the next, with the clues largely being some form of   confiscation of foreign assets That leads me to conclude that it will be difficult to get anyone to   reinvest in Argentina if its leaders continue to make it terribly obvious that it’s not safe to do so         March 19, 2002 Page 6 of 117  How much is the exchange rate being suppressed by the lack of a fully free market there?  And   how is this all going to unravel or ravel—I don’t know what the appropriate term is—in your   judgment?       I was just about to mention that  In other words,   somebody is very pessimistic at this point  What in the world does a one-year forward of, say,   5 imply about the inflation rate?  We had the Brazilian experience where we were all surprised at   the lack of pass-through of the exchange rate effects  Do we have any evidence yet as to how   this is materializing in the Argentine situation?  We do know that their inflation rate is rising, but   is it rising with the implied full, moderate, or very little pass-through of the exchange rate   depreciation?     Heaven forfend!    On second thought, maybe we ought to send you down   there! [Laughter]     Vice Chair     Jerry              March 19, 2002 Page 9 of 117   It’s not very encouraging  Incidentally, on the currency   issue, when we subtract out the estimated change in dollars held by foreign holders, what have   the domestic currency trends looked like in the last two or three months?    That doesn’t make it an easy calculation  It may just be   wrong! [Laughter]    I assume $100 bills would move in pretty much the same   way?        March 19, 2002 Page 10 of 117    Okay Any further questions?  If not—    Thank you Without objection, they are approved  Dino   you’re still on You’re going to talk about GNMAs (Ginnie Maes), right?     It strikes me that, if you’re pressing on staff resources, the   most difficult option in terms of the bridge necessary to get political and public acceptability is   the use of foreign debt obligations Unless someone has a differing view, it seems to me that we   can certainly proceed with the Ginnie Maes before we can go forward with the foreign sovereign   debt option I don’t know whether or not that’s a consensus view    Yes President Broaddus     Well, I think we all have problems with them  They are   not options we have chosen to implement over the years, and the reasons are largely the issues   that you’ve raised  These are fallback positions “in the event that”  And the “that” may not   emerge, judging from the most recent fiscal policy stances  So it may be a moot question  But I        March 19, 2002 Page 14 of 117  think all that Dino and the others need to know at this point is, given the alternatives of a series   of not currently acceptable SOMA investments, which is the least worst     Can we have comments on that?  I’m just curious to hear,   say, Dino and Don’s comments on that issue     Suppose they invested the cash in common stock, would   you be appreciative of that?     Okay President Poole     President Stern     President Jordan     Governor Gramlich    I guess we ought to buy the Washington Senators!     President Santomero     Vice Chair     President Minehan    Governor Ferguson     President Hoenig     President Parry     Governor Bies     President Moskow    I think it’s important to point out that most of the credit   allocation effect occurs with the issuance of the full faith and credit securities, not with their   purchase It’s not a question of whether the Fed or somebody else holds them; that is probably   worth a couple of basis points at most  The major issue is clearly the designation, for whatever   reason, of full faith and credit So it’s the Treasury that is making the crucial decision  What we   do with respect to which of those various assets we hold is a very secondary question  There is   an issue of principle here, and I think that is something we have to keep in mind  But as a   practical matter, I’m not sure it matters all that much  I don’t believe, for example, that if we had          March 19, 2002 Page 24 of 117  held the Chrysler debentures, they would have yielded a significantly different return in the   market  It’s not a market issue; it’s an economic policy issue  And it raises critical issues as to   who is making the policy decision—whether we do it or the Treasury does it and so forth    President Guynn     President McTeer     Let’s distribute copies of the press release draft  Does   anybody have any comments or questions?   SPEAKER(?)  Excellent!     If there are no comments, I’d like to turn the floor over to   Governor Ferguson who will continue our discussion on disclosure policy    Let’s just say unanimous    Officially we have to confirm the date of the next meeting,   which is Tuesday, May 7  Let’s proceed to luncheon or supper or whatever you want to call it           March 19, 2002 Page 106 of 117   That would get somebody’s attention, I’m sure  Does   anybody else want to comment on this?    Let me request that Don Kohn review the transcript of the   discussion we’ve just had I think it’s fairly evident that the contingency planning has first and   immediate priority and that there is a mixture of views beyond that  Also, I want to emphasize   that this is not an issue on which those who are voting members of the FOMC at this particular   meeting should carry the day because this is a much broader question  So I suggest that you look   at the full Committee and make judgments accordingly, Don, and if necessary get clarification   from the members  Then I would ask that you report your findings to Dino Kos so he will have   some answers to his question  Those answers, I trust, will be somewhat less ambiguous than   what I heard at the table this morning  I think it was a useful discussion, and implicit in what has   been said are some useful insights as to what the next step should be  Unless somebody has   anything further to say on this issue, I will call on David Stockton and Karen Johnson    First, I was just curious, David, in your hypothesis that the   sharp rise in productivity is a function of companies being blindsided to an unexpected rise in   output or sales, have you taken a look at data for individual industries?  I ask because this   hypothesis is somewhat testable in the sense that one would expect the companies that   experienced the sharpest increase in sales or output also to be in those industries where   productivity suddenly accelerated Has anyone looked at that?  I realize it’s very difficult to do   with our industrial production data because that’s begging the question; we are assuming output   per hour But do we have any collateral evidence?        March 19, 2002 Page 32 of 117    Does the fact that initial claims seem, at least temporarily,   to have stagnated at a weekly level around 400,000 suggest that the type of rises in payroll   employment and in hours that are required to bring the growth in output per hour down may not   be happening?    Well, I thought our data had them a little higher, but   maybe you’re right     Incidentally, what is the staff’s estimate of the March   industrial production index?     President Parry     President Moskow     President Minehan     President Hoenig     President Santomero    Anybody else? If not, who would like to start the   roundtable?  President Jordan     I’m leaving space between you and Bill Poole!  [Laughter]   Go ahead, Bill     President Parry     President Moskow     President Stern     President McTeer     President Minehan     President Hoenig     Coffee is available, and I think we can take a break  When   we return we will resume with President Broaddus   [Coffee break]    President Broaddus    President Guynn     President Santomero    Governor Olson     Vice Chair    Governor Ferguson     Governor Gramlich     Finally, Governor Bies    Thank you very much  Mr Reinhart     Questions for Mr Reinhart?  President Parry     March 19, 2002 Page 81 of 117    Governor Gramlich     President Minehan     Vice Chair    Small, large, and very large [Laughter]  Did you want to   say something, Ned?     Any further questions for Vince? If not, let me get started   This has been an unusually interesting meeting in the sense that we are integrating our policy   discussion with the outlook for an economy that is undergoing significant structural change that   will in turn determine where our policy should be in the future  Our problem is to figure out   where that will be  In this regard, the extent to which the markets respond to what they think we   think is a problem is in my view going to be an increasingly difficult issue for us to deal with as   our presumed credibility continues to rise   As a number of you have mentioned, we are at a turning point, however we wish to   define it A characteristic of turning points is that, as the economy goes from negative growth to     March 19, 2002 Page 86 of 117  zero growth to positive growth, it is very difficult to estimate the slope of the upturn, and   differing slopes imply huge differences in the performance of the economy  We are observing   this interesting phenomenon where all the macro data that economists look at have turned   decidedly positive  But people in the business community, as a number of you have pointed out,   don’t think in terms of the GDP data  They look at their profit figures  GDP is a very interesting   construct It is the market value of consolidated output, and consumer markets and final sales   markets more generally dominate that aggregate  The average businessman is looking at his   sales and his costs Typically, labor costs do not constitute a very large part of those costs   because most of them stem from purchased materials, which reflect somebody else’s labor costs    So the consolidated system that we look at is not the model that the average businessperson looks   at As a result we have to reconcile, as some of you have pointed out, what is essentially a really   quite negative outlook on the part of the business community and what we are seeing in the   consolidated system    I was at a Business Roundtable discussion not all that long ago and presented a GDP   outlook that was not greatly different from what we’ve been discussing today  The numbers   were smaller, but the upturn was there  My audience looked at me as though I were an alien   from some peculiar planet  The difficulty obviously is that we’re not going to get the economic   performance that is implicit in our macro forecasts if indeed the view in the business community   is that profits are not going to improve, that prospective rates of return on new facilities are not   going to be adequate, and that pricing power is completely gone  The reason, as we’re all   acutely aware, is that consumer spending is going to be only modestly helpful at best, and the   major impetus for sustaining the expansion after the inventory investment upswing peters out   will have to come from business capital investment  So, translating all of this, the real danger     March 19, 2002 Page 87 of 117  here is that we could end up with an inventory investment surge, and indeed that’s pretty much   what we may be getting at this stage, and find that the surge and the overall expansion have   suddenly run out of steam   We have seen this pattern before I remember being both fascinated and disturbed in the   early months of 1976 when the economy came out of the 1975 recession like a bull charging out   of a stockade into the ring, and then all of a sudden the economy hit a wall  The swing had been   very dramatic, but there was no impetus left, and the economy slowed down  Indeed, as you may   recall, it slowed down enough that the Carter Administration came in postulating the persistence   of a recession and proposed a fiscal stimulus package because that’s what they had promised   during the election campaign  But circumstances changed, and they got laughed out of the box,   if I may put it that way  This is the type of situation that I think we are dealing with, and it’s   going to be very difficult to pinpoint what is actually going on     In one sense we have seen a dramatic acceleration in the economic adjustment process as   information technology has increasingly affected the performance of the economy  We ended up   with a pattern of 50 basis point reductions in the federal funds rate when similar circumstances in   the past would have called for 25 basis points  Something happened very quickly to which we   responded very sensibly in my judgment  It’s a fascinating issue as to whether the upside ahead   of us will involve the same pattern  At the moment we don’t see it, but I must say that we didn’t   see it on the downside either The logic of a quick economic adjustment process on the   downside presumably will apply to the upside  The argument against that is that, even though   the economy has evidently gone through a period of marked increases in flexibility and   resiliency, we may be facing an outlook for inflation that is much more difficult to assess  We   currently are seeing price discounting, which is going to go away because it’s essentially not cost                 March 19, 2002 Page 88 of 117  based It is basically the consequence of downward pressure on profit margins and, given the   outlook for underlying costs, that eventually is going to reverse, and we are going to get some    price inflation largely because margins have to open up  And as they open up they will   eventually run into the same problem they encountered previously, namely that labor costs will   begin to rise  But the initial impact in an environment in which there is great flexibility and great   resiliency is that we will not get very strong inflationary pressures     As we went through the previous downside period involving a dramatic adjustment   process occurring very quickly in the economy, we reacted very promptly  I don’t think we were   fully aware of the possibility that we could be looking at deflation in the eye  I think Bob Parry’s   immediate reaction to the blue lines in Vince’s charts on alternative scenarios was a response to   that risk And when I looked at those charts I had the same reaction  Do I really want PCE   inflation to go down to 07 percent or something like that?  I would, of course, if I were sure   that’s as far down as inflation would go and that it would stay there  But with inflation at that   level we would be exposed to a significant probability of deflation, and we would not have a   sense that policy was in equilibrium  In other words, we are looking for price stability, and I   think quite correctly And having gone through this whole period, one could argue in retrospect   that we may have moved too fast on the downside  But we were facing significant risks in that   period, and I think our policy moves turned out just fine     My impression at this point is that we are of necessity looking at something different    This is a different type of economy  This is a different type of business cycle  We now seem to   be at a reasonably good point We have come to that point in part by good policy judgment and   in part by just plain luck, but I think it is one from which we can work  My impression without   getting into much detail is that short-term rates in general clearly are lower than we may want     March 19, 2002 Page 89 of 117  them to be  If the economy begins to rebound rather quickly, I think we’re going to want or like   to see long-term rates move up  Indeed if the mortgage rate goes up, we will get some   restraining effects on personal consumption expenditures because a goodly part of PCE has been   financed by equity extraction from the appreciation in housing values  Moreover, if the price of   oil continues to rise, I think that is also going to constrain consumer spending to some extent     So as far as I can see, the balance of risks is no longer tilted toward weakness; the risks   clearly are about equal in both directions  And I do think we may have a short period when   doing nothing is the best policy alternative  I would certainly suggest that we do nothing on the   fed funds rate today But I’m by no means certain about whether we will feel the need to move it   up in May Clearly one could argue that the pattern of adjustment in the economy has   accelerated In this regard, I think the risks of moving in 50 basis point steps are likely to be   much too high So we probably will have to move sooner and in smaller increments, given our   incomplete knowledge about the changing overall structure of the economic system with which   we are dealing   My thought is that at least one way to get a leg up on the possibility that we may want to   move in May, without moving the balance of risks to heightened inflationary pressures at this   meeting, is to indicate in our press statement today that we view monetary policy as   accommodative, without any further elaboration  That, I think, would enable us to move in May,   if we choose, without generating any serious reactions in the markets  And if we decide not to   move in May, that would be accepted as well  By the time of the May meeting, I think we will   have learned a good deal about what is happening to inventory investment and its impact on the   economy and, of course, about trends in profits and capital investment  I’m not saying that we’ll   know the final answers, but we’ll surely know a lot more about the direction  So my judgment is        March 19, 2002 Page 90 of 117  that the call is a relatively easy one for this meeting, at least as I see it at this stage  But I also   believe that our decisions are going to become progressively more complex  The one thing   we’re certain about is that the world doesn’t move as smoothly as Vince has portrayed in his   charts and it’s not going to look that way later  Perhaps he should have taken the numbers off   these charts!  Accordingly, I will put on the table the proposal that we keep the funds rate target   unchanged at 1¾ percent and that we move the balance of risks statement to balance  Vice   Chair     President Jordan    Governor Ferguson     President Parry     President Poole     Oh, we could move intermeeting if necessary    President Guynn     President Minehan    President Broaddus     President Moskow     Yes Let me clarify a point with respect to what I said to   Bill Poole Bill, my view of 25 or 50 basis points is that I would think we’d start with moves of   25 We may have to pick up the pace  Indeed, that’s a judgment we can make  It’s just that I   would not start with a 50 basis point increase  I think that would be disruptive    The burden of proof would have to be on a very   extraordinary change that we really didn’t anticipate  At least that’s the way I would look at it    President Stern        March 19, 2002 Page 94 of 117    Governor Bies     President Hoenig    Yes You know, we’ve been very fortunate  We have   been able to move, with very few exceptions in the last couple of years, only at meetings  That is   not our history We have been required to move intermeeting many times  So it’s only if policy   is extraordinarily well constructed that we move only at these arbitrarily scheduled times  We   hope that will to continue to be the case, but we can’t assume that, and I suspect you may well be   right Governor Gramlich     March 19, 2002 Page 95 of 117    President McTeer    Governor Olson     President Santomero     I think that does it  Would you, Mr Secretary, read an   appropriate directive?    Would you call the roll?    Good morning, everyone  Would somebody like to   move approval of the minutes?    Without objection, they are approved  Dino, you’re on    You gave two reasons to be optimistic relevant to the   acceleration of the monetary base in Japan  There are probably several reasons—perhaps three   or four—that suggest that nothing will happen as a consequence  So, it doesn’t necessarily mean   that the acceleration in growth of the monetary base in and of itself is going to work or is going   to alter what is really a deep structural problem in their banking system      Dino, on the ten-year swap spreads on page 2, what does   the spread between the AAA corporate and the ten-year Treasury swap look like?  In other   words, what is the AAA corporate yield minus the ten-year Treasury rate?         May 7, 2002 7 of 81   The reason I’m raising the question, obviously, is that I   wonder if we’re looking at a situation where the supply side of Treasury note issuance is raising   interest rates That, of course, is the implication of this chart as you interpret it  If that is indeed   the case, you may have found the smoking gun as to the relationship between budget deficits and   interest rates, which economists have been endeavoring to unearth for years  So, that’s why I   raise the question as to how the ten-year swap rate would look relative to the AAA or AA   corporate yields    Oh no, it’s the trend that’s relevant   SPEAKER(?)  The trend, yes     That’s not the trend I’m referring to  I’m referring to this   trend     Well, then do the AA    I have a deep-seated bias that budget deficits do create   higher interest rates So I’m looking for any straw that you can give me  [Laughter]    Other questions?    To be sure  It’s a tyranny, which we never seem able to   overcome  No further questions? Mr Vice Chair, would you like to move—     Thank you Without objection, they are approved  We’re   now on the renewal of reciprocal currency arrangements with Canada and Mexico  Dino, would   you outline where we are in that process and give us a short history?    Does anybody have any comments on the statement?  I   hear none, so I assume that we will adopt it  The next meeting is scheduled for Tuesday-  Wednesday, June 25 and 26 If my recollection serves me, the Ambassador from the United   Kingdom has invited the FOMC to dinner on the night of June 25  Is that accurate?     This meeting is hereby adjourned    END OF MEETING          Questions for Dino?  Are there objections to the   recommendation?  If none, we will proceed on the assumption of an affirmative vote  We turn   now to Dave Stockton and Karen Johnson David    Do you construct a major currency forward index on the   basis of the futures markets?    What I was thinking about is that if you’re going to make a   projection of an extended move in the dollar, as you say, it has to be in individual currencies  If   we’re coming into a period of dollar erosion, I think it probably would be useful to see what an   ongoing index of that nature would look like There are enough currencies for which extended   forward markets exist to be able to create such an index  Most of the rates are actually available   to us    So it might not be a bad idea just to keep an eye on that   because if the markets begin to deteriorate, especially the forward markets, it would be useful to   know where the deterioration is and where the pressures are, just sort of auditing—      I’m sorry, what does the interest rate differential have to   do with this calculation?     Yes, forward  This is for currencies     No, there’s a forward market out there     Only to the extent that it is fully covered The point is that   we have a futures market     Well, that’s what I’m talking about  I’m not talking about   interest rate differentials I’m talking about the futures market  So the interest rate differentials   are automatically built in     No, forget arbitrage  I’m just trying to get a simple   weighted average of futures prices in currencies     It’s a weighted price index  What am I missing here?    I understand that  But that’s automatically built into the   forward rate    That’s true But if you know how to get from here to   across the street directly, why would you go around the block?  I don’t get it Why go through   an extra calculation when you’ve got the number?     I don’t want to make a profit, I just want to see a number!    [Laughter]    I’m not going to show them this index!  [Laughter]    Yes Basically it will pick up by implication the average   interest rate differential But the question is about converting it into individual currencies, which   is what we want to find out    I didn’t think it was going to be a struggle  I thought I was   asking a rhetorical question David, I noticed that in discussing the productivity issue you raised   a question about its current level  Is that related to the issue of the disruptive effect of capital   expenditures on the productivity level?  In other words, are you arguing that, with capital   expenditures going down, the associated adjustment costs diminish and, therefore you’re               May 7, 2002 19 of 81  indicating where the structural level of productivity would be after taking account of the lower   level of capital investment?    We are now approximately seven months into this process    Are we getting anecdotal evidence that people are stressed, that they’re working too hard?  I   don’t see that in the newspapers We usually pick up that kind of story    But shreds are not conclusive       Well, I think it’s impossible     And it’s very difficult to find significant indications that   the data are themselves a problem  In fact, we have three independent sources of hours  We               May 7, 2002 21 of 81  obviously have the formal hours that we create out of the payroll system  We have the   household hours numbers, which look very much the same or if anything imply even a higher   degree of productivity And of course, the initial claims—a system that is wholly independent—   again indicate similar data on the lack of labor input       Exactly     Yes There is no evidence that the statistical discrepancy   is a big issue Parts of the GDP data, as you point out, are hard data  For example, we have full   coverage of the motor vehicle industry for all practical purposes  The data would have to be   tortured to alter the path significantly  So this is a very fascinating dilemma, which may get   resolved, as you say, by later revisions But it can’t get resolved very greatly unless there are   revisions in some of the data that don’t strike me as revisable  And I gather that, if anything, the   hours figures for the most recent historical period will be revised downward because of the   unemployment insurance benchmark number  Minus 90,000, was it?    That’s still a direction  So, it’s really an extraordinary   dilemma  Further questions?  President Parry     President Poole    We do know what Wal-Mart’s inventory levels are, or at   least I presume that we could estimate them reasonably well    Further questions?  If not, would somebody like to start   the Committee discussion?  President Moskow     President Parry     President Minehan     President Jordan     President Santomero    Excuse me, what was the 88 correlation between?     In manufacturing capital expenditures?     Total?    Thank you President Guynn    President Broaddus     President Stern     President McTeer    I think next time you better lengthen your remarks!    [Laughter]     President Hoenig     President Poole     Vice Chair         May 7, 2002 53 of 81   Governor Ferguson    I’m glad President McTeer is not going next!  [Laughter]   Governor Gramlich    Thank you, I think we can take a break and complete the   roundtable after the break We’re running well ahead of any historical schedule, so we can have   a little longer break than usual if we choose to   [Coffee break]     Governor Bies    Governor Olson    Thank you very much  Don Kohn    Thank you very much  Questions for Don?  President   Parry     Governor Gramlich     I think the problem is even broader in the sense that the   inflation compensation is really not that  It’s a forecast of the CPI  And if the CPI has an   upward bias relative to true inflation, then that poses an even more difficult problem—that the   real rate is still higher ten years and out    President Broaddus     Any further questions for Don?  If not, let me comment   I’ll be brief, as all of you said, too But then you revised and extended your remarks!  [Laughter]   This is probably a rather easy monetary policy decision  I sense from virtually everybody a   desire to stay where we are with respect to the balance of risks statement and the federal funds   rate There’s an uneasiness that I think pervades this group in the sense that the economy is   doing what Gary Stern says it always does at this stage of the business cycle  Indeed, what we   see currently is exactly what we see happening in the annals of business cycle history going as   far back as they exist So there should be nothing surprising here  Moreover, in the annals we   often see in the early stages of a recovery a few months with a negative GDP growth rate  What   we’re talking about may last three months, so it’s not necessarily a short period   I think we are now in one of those pauses There is a question as to whether or not the   capital goods markets can lift final demand, which is already at a relatively high level but   obviously is going to have difficulty increasing further  Personal consumption expenditures are   high, and indeed they are holding up The trouble is that, because they are high, the prospective   rate of growth cannot be very large  Much the same can be said of housing  Clearly,   nonresidential construction is not a sector that seems about to turn around and move up  So we               May 7, 2002 68 of 81  are really focusing, at least in the private sector of the economy, on the uncertain outlook for   capital goods   In that regard we are confronted with the extraordinary gloom that the Vice Chair   mentioned is apparent in New York  In one way or another, we have all run into gloomy   sentiment in our contacts with business groups whose basic focus is what I would call “profits   trauma”  Business people just have not recovered from what has happened to their outlook for   profits They don’t know what to do about it or how to handle it  They perceive an utter   inability to raise prices Pricing power, if anything, may be eroding, not expanding, and it’s a   very disturbing phenomenon for them  It has them thinking in peculiar ways, notably in the way   the Vice Chair indicated with respect to cost cutting versus anticipated revenues That is really   not the way an economist would look at this    If there are opportunities for cost cutting, that’s the type of investment a firm will make   since the variance of prospective returns on such investments is much smaller than variances   based on revenue projections or other indications of potential returns over long periods of time    A firm knows its underlying costs  And if a way can be found to reduce costs in one form or   another through a capital expenditure, the variance of the prospective return over the useful life   of the new equipment is very significantly less than on broader revenue-enhancing types of   capital outlays As a result, the hurdle rate on cost-cutting replacement equipment is much less   than it is on other types of capital outlays  Obviously, almost by definition, it is only the cost-  cutting type of investment that is the driver of productivity growth by reducing unit costs    We’ve seen a good deal of that sort of investment, and we’re going to see considerably more    But there is no question that, if firms don’t invest to expand capacity, or at least for a   combination of cost reductions and increased capacity, which most equipment outlays actually            May 7, 2002 69 of 81  achieve, then the result is a lower level of overall outlays  Indeed, that’s what we’re observing at   this particular stage   There is the question that Governor Bies raised with respect to the quite considerable   decline in capital investment over the past year  That issue is relevant to our previous   discussions as to whether or not there is a lag between a capital expenditure and its effects on   productivity and rates of return, which there almost surely is  If we are dealing with that sort of   thing, we need to be very much concerned about the decline in capital investment over quite a   long period and about the related outlook for productivity and profits We do have to be a little   careful in this analysis because, when we disaggregate the data and look at the factors that   engender increases in labor productivity, the effect on labor productivity of a given dollar   investment in traditional capital equipment is actually declining in importance  We’re seeing a   significant impact from the so-called compositional effect of what the investment dollars are   spent on That effect has been increasing in importance in recent years as more investments are   directed to high-tech equipment, where the value added is very significantly higher than it is for   traditional capital outlays  So, on the basis of the actual dollar amounts of capital investment,   one cannot explain or come even close to explaining what is currently happening to productivity    On top of that, of course, multifactor productivity is explaining a very significant proportion of   the growth in labor productivity  So actual levels of plant and equipment technically do not   explain a large part of labor productivity  That is quite fortunate because, if it were otherwise, I   think we would be in a position of worrying about where productivity in fact is going in the   period ahead   In my view the economic outlook generally is pretty much as described in the   Greenbook And from the comments around the table about the individual Districts, I’ve            May 7, 2002 70 of 81  observed very little that deviates in any significant way from the Greenbook or at least the   general thrust of the Greenbook forecast  There are obviously a significant number of risks to   our forecasts Governor Olson put his finger on one about which I am becoming increasingly   concerned, namely the breakdown in fiscal control  The fact that the Senate has not passed a   budget resolution—and this is the first time since when, Mark?     Oh, it’s more than three years, isn’t it?     No, I mean that this far into the season the Senate has not   passed a budget resolution    I think it has been a long time since that last happened   The erosion in fiscal control is becoming very evident  Without a budget resolution there is no   real cap on appropriations committees, and when we’re in a political year who knows what will   happen! Nevertheless, the budget is an ultimate threat out there, though not one that I think we   need to worry about immediately Indeed, one might believe that fiscal stimulus could prove   helpful at this point It’s the longer-term implications that are more disturbing  Obviously, if we   end up with an 8½ percent trend in structural productivity growth, we won’t need to worry about   the budget deficit; it will take care of itself  But I would not count on that   I think the oil issue is a relevant concern, but let’s remember that the ratio of oil   consumption to GDP in this country has been going down steadily since the early 1970s, and   there is no evidence of a slowdown in the rate of decline  So the intensity of oil use in our   economy—and I might add that this extends to a slightly lesser extent to energy use overall—            May 7, 2002 71 of 81  suggests that energy shocks don’t have the clout that they did twenty to thirty years ago  But we   are still confronted with an extraordinary anomaly Even though our models don’t show any   particular need for concern about an oil price increase, history nonetheless tells us that every   time there’s an oil price spike the economy takes a swoon a short time later  Now, we may have   too few observations and we have the small sample problem, but that outcome does get one’s   attention when one looks at it on a chart   One issue that has not been raised today, and I think we have to keep it in mind because it   can happen, is Terrorist Act Two If that should happen, it is especially important to realize that   it would be occurring in a context that differs from that in the aftermath of the September 11   attacks After September 11, most people and indeed the markets had factored in a follow-up   attack That expectation has been gradually disappearing  It’s disappearing from the rhetoric    We see the effect of that disappearance showing up in a return of partisan politics  While people   still talk about the possibility of such an event, any related concern clearly is not being captured   in any risk premiums that we can observe  If anything, the latter are going in the other direction    Therefore, when an event or situation is being discounted in another direction and it materializes,   it then has a very disruptive impact on the economy  I would have said, and I think I probably   did say at our meetings shortly after September 11, that it would take a terrorist attack of a   greater order of magnitude than that of September 11—either a nuclear or biological or chemical   type of attack—to scare people to the extent that our economy would not be able to function    These types of events induce a pulling back, disengagement, fear, and retrenchment  And almost   by definition that means  a decline in GDP  If nobody trades with anybody because they’ve all   retreated into their closets, there is no market output  And we did indeed, I might say   parenthetically, see a fairly significant drop in GDP in the weeks immediately subsequent to            May 7, 2002 72 of 81  September 11  The economy came back fairly quickly, but that retrenchment phenomenon was   there   In my judgment, that is the biggest risk in the outlook in the sense that if the nation were   continuing to factor in another attack, then the economy could absorb it to some extent  But   when it is not being factored in, I would say that its risk-adjusted level, if I can create a new level   of elevated concern, would be at the top of the list  That does not mean that the probability of   another terrorist attack has not been going down; indeed it probably is still going down  But we   have no idea what that probability is None of us has knowledge of that from our day-by-day   reading of the daily newspapers, and our intelligence agencies do not at this stage have that   knowledge They know a lot about the terrorist structures but very little about pending events     So there’s a lot of uncertainty, understandably  And I am certain that when we all read   our transcripts five years from now we probably will look back on this period and say that we   were unduly concerned—that in fact the underlying economy was really improving and that the   productivity increases were reflective of developments that we had not really understood  We   are likely to see that the economy was much better than we thought and that its flexibility was   greater To be sure, pricing power was nonexistent, but nobody cared because unit costs were in   check and everything was basically fine and we shouldn’t have worried  But I’m still worried    My recommendation, which I suspect is pretty much what everyone has in mind at this stage, is   that we stay at 1¾ percent on the funds rate and retain the statement that we view the risks as   balanced Vice Chair      Governor Ferguson         May 7, 2002 73 of 81   President Guynn     President Parry     President Stern     President Moskow    President Broaddus     President Minehan    That’s not our procedure  [Laughter]     Governor Gramlich     President Santomero     President Hoenig     President Poole     President McTeer     President Jordan     Governor Bies    Governor Olson    Did we miss anybody?  Call the roll please     Okay, we have a press statement, which is altered very   marginally from the March statement  Two pieces of paper will be passed around  One is the   March statement with the revisions on it, and the second one would be a final copy if we adopt   the statement as drafted  The latter is essentially just the proposed final May 7 statement       To start, I’d like to welcome Governors Bernanke and   Kohn to their first meeting  This is the first time we’ve had a full contingent at an FOMC   meeting in four years, I believe  Jack Guynn is back  How are you feeling, Jack?    You can kick us around again  [Laughter]    Turning to our first agenda item, would somebody move to   approve the minutes of June 25-26?    Without objection  We have in front of us a proposal to   nominate Vincent Reinhart to replace Donald Kohn as Secretary and Economist of the FOMC to   serve until the election of a successor at the first meeting of the Committee after December 31,   2002 Would somebody like to officially move that nomination?     Is there a second?     All in favor say “aye”   SEVERAL  Aye     I won’t ask for the “no’s”    I was more worried about Vince myself  Dino Kos, would   you start us off, please?      Refresh my memory  What was it that occurred on   August 1 that abruptly opened the bid-asked spreads on Ford Motor Credit Company and GMAC   debt?  Obviously, as shown in the graph, the spread was flat prior to that time, and then it   suddenly bounced     But General Motors did not have the same problems, as I   recall    What would happen if you were to choose a number of   other similarly situated so-called “untainted” companies?  Well, today nobody is untainted,   unfortunately Would you get the same sort of pattern?  What is very interesting about this is   that the widening in the spreads starts on the first of the month  While I vaguely recall that that’s   not the same period in which BBB and high-yield bonds really began to take off against   Treasuries, it’s not that far off, is it?      So it’s not the corporation; it’s the investor  It’s the   demand not the supply, so to speak     They need the debt, but the debt service capability is not   there    What does GE Capital look like in that regard?    Yes What I find interesting about the profitless sales   argument is that the markets knew that July was going to be a really big month for auto sales    Indeed, they caught on to it very early, and the estimates in the marketplace didn’t change much   throughout the month  Yet there is no evidence of this move until the end of that month  So, the   system doesn’t square in a number of respects    That’s true, a pension fund problem would clearly be   reflected in these types of numbers  Vice Chair     Yes, I think that’s clearly what the data show  But that’s   like taking somebody’s temperature and then saying it’s high  It doesn’t tell us why it’s high       Well, that’s a good point  But sometimes, regrettably, it   tends to be    Incidentally, I’ve been impressed with the tightness of the   Australian and Canadian dollars for the obvious reasons of the nature of their international   positions  But that relationship looks peculiarly tight over the intermeeting period  Has it   always been that tight going back?    The composition of their internationally traded goods is   really quite similar  They are very heavy in wheat, minerals, and metals     Further questions for Dino?     The meeting is officially adjourned   END OF MEETING        Without objection  Thank you, very much  We’ll now go   to David Wilcox and Karen Johnson     I’ve been meaning to ask you this recently  I notice that   the export data on high-tech equipment from Singapore, Taiwan, and other East Asian countries   tend to be quite current I always have the impression that I somehow seem to be getting insights   into the American high-tech order pattern in advance from those data  Is that an illusion, or is   there something systematic in that relationship?    Especially in Singapore               August 13, 2002 17 of 92   What I’m trying to get at is that we order, for example, from   Singapore But it seems to me that before data are available on our orders, exports coming out of   Singapore are reported I don’t know whether that’s factually accurate though     President Moskow     President Parry?     Vice Chair    Further questions for our colleagues?  If not, would   somebody like to begin the Committee discussion?  President Moskow     President Parry     President Hoenig    President Guynn               August 13, 2002 28 of 92    President Poole     President McTeer     President Minehan    Thank you President Santomero    President Broaddus            August 13, 2002 42 of 92   Governor Kohn     President Stern    Governor Ferguson    Governor Olson    Thank you I suggest we take a ten-minute break for   coffee   [Coffee break]    Governor Bernanke, would you start us off?     Governor Bies     Governor Gramlich     Vice Chair     President Jordan    A splendid way to end—with a very large question mark    I think we can now move on to Vince Reinhart       Questions for Vince?     Any further questions?  If not, let me get started  All of   you have directly or indirectly emphasized the issues of the overvaluation of the stock market   and the irregularities of corporate governance that have led to a very significant contraction in   stock prices and a major widening of spreads in a number of financial markets  We were made   particularly aware after a congressional hearing a week or so ago how sensitive interest rate            August 13, 2002 70 of 92  spreads and indeed stock prices have become to the corporate governance issue  Both Citicorp   and JP Morgan Chase were accused of what three or four years ago would scarcely have raised   an eyebrow, namely their efforts to structure various forms of credit in ways that would be useful   to their customers without significantly undercutting the safety and soundness of their banking   institutions But that kind of activity has turned into a major concern, and indeed its revelation   has resulted in a very large drop in the stock prices of both banking firms and has widened   spreads on their debt issues quite considerably     That, of course, is not the only example of such a development  We see it throughout the   financial markets  We are now looking at equity premiums that have risen in the latest period   above their 1994 averages, after having declined to virtually record lows  This suggests, as   David Wilcox indicated, that stock prices by some measures may be undervalued or below their   “fair” value, as some people like to say  The trouble with that assessment, unfortunately, is that   stock prices historically have always moved above and below fair value in the sense that they   never seem to stop at fair value  This raises an obvious question  What in the world does fair   value mean?  In any event, the very significant contraction on balance in stock market prices   over recent weeks has raised the possibility that such prices may finally be reaching some form   of bottom  I trust that when I reread these remarks when they are released to the public five   years from now they will not look anything less than thoughtful!     The problem is one that we have not had to confront in this way before  One interesting   aspect of the problem relates to the risk spreads in the stock market and the weakness in capital   expenditures But another very interesting aspect is that, despite the extraordinary weakness in   capital spending, profit margins rose significantly in the fourth quarter of last year and   essentially stayed at the higher level in the first and second quarters of this year  This has         August 13, 2002 71 of 92  occurred in the context of quite small increases in unit labor costs, at least as judged by the   deceleration in the implicit price deflator for nonfinancial corporations, that in turn reflect very   strong growth in output per manhour  As I recall, the estimated four-quarter average growth in   productivity for nonfinancial corporations shows an increase of 57 percent  The staff estimates   that the second-quarter number by itself is 40 percent   Most interesting in this very odd pattern of data is the fact that the evidently significant   flight to quality, which is implicit in the number of widening credit spreads, has been   accompanied by a very marked decline in the ten-year Treasury yield  At the last reading it was   about 42 percent That decline, of course, has had a major impact on thirty-year fixed mortgage   rates Indeed, those rates have fallen below 6½ percent, and I believe they are now close to   6¼ percent At that level we are seeing very significant churning in the mortgage markets, and   as I have indicated previously, the increase in home equity is cumulative over a period of years   because the prices of homes very rarely turn negative  What we are observing at this point is a   very high rate of house turnover Existing home sales are very high, and I’d say parenthetically   that the drop in July in the seasonally adjusted data coming from the National Association of   Realtors appears to involve a deficient seasonal adjustment factor  There is no evidence of any   contraction of any moment in existing home sales except, as a couple of members mentioned   previously, in sales of high-priced homes, which have been pretty soggy  The housing market   has been tight across much of the country, and it has been tight in part because of the strong   influence that immigration is having on the demand for housing     The turnover of homes of necessity engenders realized capital gains, and those gains tend   to be the element in the housing market that extracts the most home equity  Indeed, what we   always observe is that the mortgage loan taken out by the buyer is significantly larger than the         August 13, 2002 72 of 92  mortgage cancelled by the seller And the spread between the two, which is the net increase in   mortgage debt on that existing home, is very close in general to the realized capital gain  To be   sure, a very significant amount of equity extraction occurs without realized gains, and it occurs   largely because of the cash-outs from refinancings  Those cash-outs are becoming quite large    An internal estimate by Freddie Mac for last year indicates that it was a little over $100 billion    The total is down somewhat this year because the refinancings are not as large, and I believe the   ratio of cash-outs to refinancings usually comes down a bit when refinancings to total   originations go up   All in all, there have been very large extractions from home equity  They do not seem to   be impaired or enhanced by fluctuations in stock prices  The result has been a very major   addition to personal consumption expenditures and to home modernization outlays, which, of   course, are part of GDP What we have observed here is a major offset to the quite extensive   decline in wealth from equities  And what is also interesting is that we are looking at two   different segments of household incomes  A very substantial part of the wealth creation and   destruction through equity stock prices occurs in the upper-income quintile, while a very   substantial part of the home equity extraction occurs in the lower four quintiles  And the   evidence is that on average the impact on personal consumption expenditures from changes in   equity wealth according to the FRB/US model is about the same overall as the extraction of   equity from housing  In my view, however, the available evidence suggests that that may be in   error in the sense that we may find after the fact that the marginal propensity to consume out of   capital gains in homes, especially those that are realized, is very significantly above the marginal   propensity to consume out of either realized or unrealized gains in equities  Only in recent years               August 13, 2002 73 of 92  have unrealized gains in equities become a very prominent factor in both personal consumption   expenditures and home modernization outlays     This process seems to be continuing  We are finding that the wealth effect is probably   negligible for the non-equity, nonhousing types of wealth  Consumer durable stocks constitute a   big portion of household wealth, and there is no evidence that the level of such wealth has any   effect whatsoever on consumer spending  But the point I want to emphasize here is that there is   very little evidence of which I’m aware that the continued rise in home prices and the related   expansion of home equity is going to cease  The basic reason is that home equity has almost   always increased In fact, the average value of homes deflated by a GDP deflator has been going   up about 1½ percent per year for a very long period    The explanation as best I can judge relates in part to the fact that the growth of   productivity in home construction is negligible  People essentially buy custom housing, which   does not lend itself to improvements in homebuilding productivity  Indeed, the manufacturing   component of home construction, even though it is rising, is held back to a remarkable extent by   the idiosyncratic desire of homeowners not to have a house that looks like the next-door   neighbor’s The result is very low productivity in construction  In fact, the published figures on   gross product originating in construction show declining productivity on a per hour basis in the   last twenty or thirty years In itself, that is not credible  But if we assume that average hourly   compensation equates across all segments of the economy, we would expect that the differential   in unit labor costs between the home construction sector and the economy overall would reflect   the differential productivity changes And indeed, if we take nonfarm business productivity and   subtract home construction productivity, which is essentially zero, what we get is the long-term   1½ percent increase in prices  So in effect what we get in equilibrium is a constant net increment         August 13, 2002 74 of 92  to purchasing power from capital gains in homes over and above the increase in personal income    When we factor these capital gains into the regular models, we do not get any reversal in this   increment at any time    There clearly is concern at this stage about a housing value bubble that is going to burst    But I think that most of those who look at this in some detail question whether that’s a valid   notion And while the second-quarter increase in home values is now significantly below the big   rise of last year, I believe a 3 percent annual rate is the current estimate that’s being used for   existing home sales  So overall the notion that we’re going to lose the home equity part of the   current support for consumer expenditures does not seem reasonable at this stage  This does not   mean, of course, that we could not get a decline in home prices  It’s the notion that there is an   equivalency between equity bubbles and housing bubbles that I think is an illusion  Moreover,   as I think I’ve indicated several times in the past, it strikes me that with transaction costs as high   as they are in home sales and the necessity to move if the home is sold, the incentive to sell a   house is nowhere near what it is to sell a stock to take advantage of a capital gain  As I indicated   earlier, the impact of immigration superimposed upon the difficulty of finding viable land for   homebuilding is keeping significant upside pressure on home prices over and above the   construction productivity issue So the likelihood of any really important contraction in the   housing area would in my view require a very major contraction in the economy overall   Having said all of that, the general outlook still strikes me as being solid in an underlying   sense, but without question there has been substantial deterioration and it’s not going to be easy   to read the significance of the corporate governance problems  They are turning out to have a   much greater impact on the economy than I would have envisaged when the Enron issue first   surfaced and even when WorldCom showed up  There is no evidence at this stage that the               August 13, 2002 75 of 92  problem has stabilized  Conceivably, it may stabilize after tomorrow when most of the   reaffirmations of the quality of the corporate financial reports come in to the SEC  I doubt it   But I think it is too soon to say where it will go     I have no doubt that everything will look just fine in retrospect if we look back in   October and November of this year and we see that the growth rate was near the 27 or 3 percent   now expected for the current quarter If that’s indeed what is happening, we can’t be   experiencing all the negative developments that are fostering the currently gloomy sentiment    But we can’t know that at this point In fact, most of the concerns that we have discussed are   largely based, I think, on factors that we cannot capture in the Greenbook or in any of the models   with which we are working   I, like all others, think it is most premature to consider lowering interest rates in this   context If we lower rates from their current levels, we will have a greater distance to go to   restore some reasonable level of noninflationary, non-accommodative short-term money market   rates But I must say even in that context that I agree with the Vice Chairman, who stated that, if   we have to ease, he would not favor easing in 25 basis points increments because that would   send the wrong signal If we have to move, my inclination would be to move from 175 to   125 percent, but I don’t think we’re going to end up having to ease  I would recommend that we   stay where we are with respect to rates today  But I do agree with those who have argued, and I   believe with some justification, that it is essential that we at least recognize what is going on    Clearly, the risks are not balanced  They have turned from reasonably balanced, even though   what you called it the last time was—    To uncomfortably balanced  I would have said back then   that they were reasonably balanced  Clearly, that is no longer the case, and I think we need to   acknowledge that In summary, I would hope for a resolution that holds rates unchanged but   does shift the balance of risks statement toward weakness  Vice Chair     President Jordan    President Broaddus     President Minehan    Governor Kohn    Governor Ferguson     President Stern     President Poole     President Parry     Governor Bies    Governor Olson     Governor Gramlich    You sound like a true conservative         August 13, 2002 83 of 92    President Santomero    May I just say parenthetically that I don’t deny that a   balance of risks switch will have that effect  But if we get a few good numbers on orders or sales   or in GDP or profits, I submit that the market will be way ahead of us     President Hoenig    Governor Bernanke     President McTeer    President Guynn     President Moskow    Thank you Will you read the directive language that has   no change in rates but shifts the balance of risks to weakness?    Would you call the roll please?     Would you circulate the draft statement, which tries to   capture that decision?  [Pause]    Does anybody wish to make any comments relevant to the   statement?  If not, I will assume that it is adequate for our purposes and it will be released  Our   next meeting is September 24  We do not have a formal program for lunch, but the usual   exquisite cuisine is available for those who wish to stay!    The meeting is called to order  Would somebody like to   move approval of the minutes of the August 13 meeting?     Without objection  Dino Kos, please    You didn’t explain why the currency growth suddenly   disappeared Is it international?    Is that because of Argentina and Brazil?    Do you have any explanation for that?     The question is, is it?  No, let me put it this way  What is   the correlation between currency outstanding and spending, let’s say, knocking off the $100 bills   which—    Something like 3?     The inflation rate was much higher then     What is happening to corporate yields in Japan?  What do   the spreads look like?  We very rarely hear discussions of that    I’m just asking about prices  Do you mean the prices are   not available?  You don’t have them?     But the spreads are not rising?     The reason I raise the issue is that if there is a propensity   to hold JGBs for fear of private credit risk, especially in the banks, one would have expected a           September 24, 2002 9 of 115  very significant opening up of corporate yields  And I gather your chart doesn’t show that    Unfortunately, the Japanese don’t have a securities market in the sense that—     I’ve tried to make a big point that the Japanese don’t have   a securities market and that all of their intermediation is in banks  I guess it’s true!  [Laughter]   President Poole    I think the answer from all that I’ve seen—and I’ve looked   at this in considerable detail—is that one cannot explain these yield differentials without   adverting to some notion of the equivalent of “Buy American” in Japan, where in a sense the   presumption is that one must support Japanese institutions  I say that because there’s just no   credible argument for these yields—well, maybe for the short-term securities but not ten-year   JGBs—given the fiscal outlook and the demographic outlook         September 24, 2002 10 of 115    Yes, and that argument—     Exactly So I conclude, merely as a fallback explanation—   having examined à la Sherlock Holmes all of the alternatives and found them wanting—that   therefore the missing alternative must be the true one  But that is the type of reasoning that the   logic courses will tell you is very, very fragile  President Jordan     President McTeer     Any further questions?  Vice Chair     Is there anything else on the agenda that we need to   discuss?   SPEAKER (?)  Lunch!    The next meeting is Wednesday, November 6, the day   after Election Day If it were the day before, we’d have a problem   END OF MEETING         Without objection  We now move on to David Stockton   and Karen Johnson     Questions?  President Broaddus    Incidentally, am I correct that there has been a fairly   significant increase in corporate liquidity in the last year or so?    There’s been a grossing up in a sense            September 24, 2002 21 of 115    Is it basically long-term liabilities and short-term assets, as   best we can judge?     So that can be read in one of two ways or perhaps even in   two ways One is that it is a measure of the extent to which caution has confronted the business   community in the last year and they are feeling vulnerable, which is the other side of pulling   back on capital expenditures On the other hand, corporations have the cash available to use in   the event they need it So we may have a significant increase in the financing gap, but it could   very readily be accommodated disproportionately from a reduction in liquid balances as distinct   from further increases in debt     President Jordan     President Moskow     September 24, 2002 23 of 115    President Parry     President McTeer     President Stern    If nobody else has any questions, who would like to start   the general discussion?  President Moskow    What a “fowl” thought!     President Parry     President Jordan    I don’t know if I should admit to this, but in the back room   there were very peculiar things going on  [Laughter]    President Guynn     President Santomero     Vice Chair     President Minehan    President Broaddus     President Stern     There’s coffee outside  Why don’t we break for fifteen   minutes?    [Coffee break]     President McTeer     President Poole     President Hoenig     Governor Gramlich    Governor Kohn    Governor Ferguson     Governor Bies    Are you bidding?    Governor Olson    Governor Bernanke    Thank you very much  That completes the roundtable    We turn now to Vince Reinhart    Questions for Vincent?  Obviously, you have been   convincing as usual I think there’s an emerging consensus within this group as to how we ought   to be looking at the economy and policy  In this regard, I believe it’s important to summarize a   few developments and list various alternatives that we confront   First, I think it’s fairly evident that unprecedented levels of equity extraction from homes   have exerted a strong impetus on household spending  We see this in the incoming aggregate   data on such spending, though not in measures that reflect consumer attitudes and psychology    We know, for example, that the level of existing home turnover is quite brisk and that the   average extraction of equity per sale of an existing home is well over $50,000  A substantial part   of the equity extraction related to home sales, which is running at an annual rate close to   $200 billion, is expended on personal consumption and home modernization, two components,   of course, of the GDP   The long duration of the currently elevated level of home sales is a bit of a puzzle  At   some point it has to drift down to a more normal range, but it’s not doing so thus far  Similarly,   the historically high level of refinancings in the third quarter, as reflected in the data on   applications reported by the Mortgage Bankers Association, is creating a very large increase in   cash-outs We estimate that they, too, are running in the $200 billion range at an annual rate, up   very significantly from where they were a year or eighteen months ago  Perhaps more   importantly, there is no evidence of a slowing in refinancing activity The average rate on new   thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages is well below the average rate on outstanding mortgages  This   differential plays an important role in models of refinancing activity constructed here at the   Board The models, which fit the historical data very well, suggest that refinancing activity   should continue quite strong in the months immediately ahead  Accordingly, we are likely to see        September 24, 2002 79 of 115  fairly high levels of actual cash flows, the monies made available from the cash-outs, until the   end of the year and perhaps beyond   The impact of this development is not easy to isolate from the rest of what is going on in   the economy, but there is no question that a goodly part of the robustness of household   expenditures stems from this source  Cars and light trucks, which have been quite strong, are   examples of the types of large ticket items that are disproportionately purchased when equity is   extracted from the sale of a home  It seems likely that increases in the average size of cash-outs   will persist, and one would expect these monies to have an impact on purchases of motor   vehicles and other big-ticket items  Indeed, I suspect that’s what we are seeing   It’s hard to know how long this process can go on, as Governor Ferguson mentioned  In   my view, it has been induced to a substantial extent not so much by the level of the thirty-year   mortgage rate but by the fact that the rate has been falling at a fairly pronounced pace  Our   models on existing home sales actually suggest that the level of the mortgage rate is what   determines the level of existing home sales; but this is a complex issue, and it remains to be seen   whether in fact the net change in the mortgage rate has an impact on sales  Obviously, it must   have an impact on refinancings because, if the rate on new mortgages stays under the average   rate on outstanding mortgages for an extended period and fosters heavy refinancing activity,   those two rates must converge  And as they converge, the propensity to refinance must   invariably fall   There is some evidence of modest slippage in the sale of motor vehicles after the quite   riveting increases in such sales in July and, even more surprisingly, in August  Through the first   twenty days of September, motor vehicle sales slipped back but they continue to be well above        September 24, 2002 80 of 115  normal in that we are still seeing sales in the area of 16½ million units, a total that would have   been viewed as bizarrely excessive a couple of years ago     We saw a fairly pronounced drop in last week’s chain store sales, which is consistent   with the reports we’ve heard around the table However, I must caution you that those chain   store sales figures are not all that useful as indicators of overall merchandise sales, especially the   weekly data that we look at Motor vehicle sales obviously are as close to an exact number as we   get in economic statistics, and the estimates we are talking about basically come directly from   the motor vehicle manufacturers  Indeed, it is essentially their tabulations, car for car, that   appear in the personal consumption expenditures component of the GDP  So in appraising   consumer spending, there is a very big difference between motor vehicle sales and chain store   sales One is really accurate; the other is close to dubious  Even so, the fact that both are   moving in the same direction is suggestive in my view of some slowing in the growth of overall   retail sales   Another positive element in the outlook is the fact that inventories are getting tight  Our   weekly industrial production data suggest a very modest increase for the month of September but   probably not enough to prevent some inventory liquidation from continuing  I say “continuing”   because I frankly don’t believe the latest book value figures that we have The reason I say that   is that the inventory patterns that we get from the industrial production index together with our   efforts to track the movement of goods indicate that, after some buildup in the second quarter,   inventory accumulation turned decidedly negative in July and August  That in turn is consistent   with the fact that industrial production has flattened out quite significantly even though industrial   consumption still seems to be rising  What all this indicates is that the GDP data and the   industrial production index are telling us different stories  Indeed, when we endeavor to infer              September 24, 2002 81 of 115  activity in the industrial sector from the GDP data, we find that it is rising relative to our official   industrial production numbers  To be sure, there is a question as to which is the more accurate   estimate  A fairly significant part of the initial monthly estimate of the industrial production   index is based on the hours data and the judgments that we make concerning productivity  We    can’t be certain about its accuracy but, as Dave Stockton points out, the anecdotal information   does seem to be more consistent with the slower pace of industrial activity indicated by our index    than is inferred from the goods and structures components in the GDP data, taking out the   markups and making the various judgments for imports and exports that one would get from the   GDP system  I conclude that we are dealing with a fairly tight inventory situation, which is a   plus in that we also have, as was mentioned before, fairly good liquidity in the corporate sector    In a sense this economy is in a position to move forward if a number of the negatives that I will   get to shortly are removed              Another obvious positive is the behavior of the productivity data  I, at least, believe it’s   an unequivocal positive, although the employment figures clearly are not It’s really quite   startling to see how significant the productivity numbers are  In the GDP accounts, we tend to   look at the product data, and those data are showing fairly strong increases  Nonfarm   productivity was up 43 percent at an annual rate in the second quarter  Did you say you’re using   4 percent for the current quarter, David?    So, for all practical purposes productivity is still very   strong as measured from the product data  It’s even stronger when calculated from the data that   are based on gross domestic income  The statistical discrepancy between the two estimates is         September 24, 2002 82 of 115  increasing because the growth of the GDP measured from the income side is moderately stronger   than what we are seeing on the product side Obviously, that relative strength spills over dollar   for dollar into the alternative productivity estimates  And, of course, that’s the reason that   nonfinancial corporate productivity based on income-side data is a good deal stronger than   overall nonfarm productivity  For the last four quarters through the second quarter, the income-  based productivity gain was 64 percent for nonfinancial corporations  That is a quite startling   increase, and indeed I would imagine that business firms have expended a great deal of effort to   increase productivity through various means, including the use of previously unexploited   efficiencies At least, that was a fairly solid argument that could be made early this year, but it   gets pretty thin this far out into the recovery  One would think that business firms had scraped   the bottom of the barrel six months ago  What we have is very substantial multifactor   productivity growth because clearly we’re not getting very extensive capital deepening     Something is happening, but it is not evident in the data  The hours figures we pick up   independently from the household survey track the payroll hours fairly closely, and a substantial   part of the strength that we see in the GDP data is in real product numbers  So, it’s not a data   problem  It’s a data dilemma, but the answer is not that the data are faulty     Interestingly enough, there has not been a significant acceleration in profitability We’ve   gotten some, but margins actually have been flat for the last three quarters The reason is that we   are getting some price deflation in the corporate sector  Part of the acceleration in productivity is   showing up in lower prices rather than in higher profit margins  Nonetheless, the data   themselves look pretty solid and fairly impressive, and one wonders why all the corporate   managers are so gloomy if those data are accurate  Well, they are gloomy largely because they   have no pricing power They see very weak nominal sales, with the prices of many of their           September 24, 2002 83 of 115  products falling abruptly while the growth of their real output is quite significant  Indeed, that’s   where a goodly part of the productivity gains are coming from   It’s this basic attitude in the corporate sector that I think is the source of most of the   major negatives  As I will argue in a minute or two, I think they could very readily have been   overcome were it not for two facts  One is the corporate governance issue; the other is the very   obviously increasing uncertainty arising from geopolitical risks  You will recall that the   economy seemed to be doing reasonably well through June  And even though it’s difficult to   prove and indeed there’s some evidence to suggest the contrary, my view is that the WorldCom   scandal is the issue that really hit home  It told us that Enron was not alone  And indeed the   WorldCom situation comes close to making Enron look inconsequential with respect to the scope   of the malfeasance that is gradually being revealed  One had to dig to find the   misrepresentations employed by Enron  Their procedures were very sophisticated, with all sorts   of special purpose vehicles and other questionable accounting procedures  WorldCom didn’t do   it that way They just put in big fat numbers, forgot everything else, and got away with it  My   shock at the accounting profession has not worn off     I think the impact of all that is now fading And indeed were it not for the rise in oil   prices and the geopolitical risks that are emerging, I would say the chances of the Greenbook   forecast being realized are quite reasonable  All of this is eerily reminiscent of October 1990  In   fact, I just looked at a chart that reflects the emerging uncertainties of the Gulf War  You will   recall that the price of oil was going straight up after Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait  It peaked in   October, and the war was not actively engaged until many months later     What occurred, as best I can judge, is that either the tax effects of the oil price rise or the   repercussions on confidence had a very material effect on the economy despite the fact that the           September 24, 2002 84 of 115  National Bureau has labeled the peak of the expansion as occurring in July 1990  If we look at   the individual data, nothing really moved down significantly until October 1990, and then   everything fell out of bed Between July and October everything tended to drift  The first sign   of a significant downward tilt in the economy was, as I recall, a fairly marked pop in initial   claims We haven’t quite seen that thus far  Yet, as of earlier today the price of West Texas   intermediate oil was over $31 a barrel—I haven’t seen the latest price quotation So oil prices   have moved up fairly quickly, and the effects seem to be spilling over into the stock market and   having a variety of other predictable repercussions     As a number of you have indicated, the rest of the world is scarcely helping our economy    Indeed, the economies in Europe—I should say the euro area—and Japan are continuously   eroding The United Kingdom is doing better  Who said the Japanese are the Japanese?    Japan is Japan; that is the equivalent  I subscribe to that   very incisive thought without defining what it means    Oh, stop your erudition!  [Laughter] The problem that   we’re confronted with is that we used to believe that the monetary response to an oil price spike   was indeterminate  Indeed, a very strong argument was made in earlier years when such price   spikes occurred that the appropriate response of the monetary authorities was to tighten, not to   loosen, policy on the grounds that the central bank should prevent the oil price increase from   spilling over and inducing inflationary pressures in the non-oil segments of the economy     The historical experience is now sufficiently conclusive in my view to suggest that that’s   not what happens and that oil price spikes have a negative influence so far as GDP is concerned      September 24, 2002 85 of 115  That outcome does not show up in our econometric models largely because the coefficients that   we get in our models reflect the impact on GDP of the average change in the price of oil  And if,   within a limited range of that type of coefficient, we put back into our model the price changes   that actually occurred in earlier periods before the start of a recession, the model will not forecast   a recession Indeed, that happens time and time again, and we are confronted with the obvious   question as to why it happens This suggests that the coefficients may in fact be significantly   higher under certain conditions, or it may be that the coefficients are nonlinear and rise with the   rise in the price of oil  As a result, the marginal impact increases as the rise in the price of oil   occurs The trouble, unfortunately, is that we have too few observations to test that hypothesis in   any meaningful way and what we know is largely anecdotal  Anecdotes are in effect small   samples  They have small sample variations, but the mean of a small sample is better than not   having any information at all    I think the way this leads us to look at current events is to recognize that somewhere   within the next month or two this uncertainty is going to resolve itself  One scenario is that we   are going to get the impetus from developments that I would associate with potential pent-up   demands—that is, considerable liquidity in the corporate sector, very tight inventories, capital   investment that has been held down to a marked degree, productivity that is still improving, costs   that are still improving, and profit margins that presumably are at least holding or maybe even   rising Those factors are the tinder for a strengthening economy, if we take away the negative   psychology, and they are really quite positive  Indeed, it could turn out that the upside scenario   presented in the Greenbook is too low   I believe, however, that the evidence is tilted more strongly to the other side based on   what history tells us  We have to be very careful at this point because we’re going to get     September 24, 2002 86 of 115  important statistics in the next several weeks  The August data on manufacturers’ new orders are   going to tell us a great deal The general expectation is that after the sharp rise in July, orders are   going to come off 2 to 3 percent or something like that  If that happens, that will tend to confirm   that the capital goods markets are still in an uptrend and that the Greenbook basically is on the   right track  If on the other hand that number turns out to be very significantly lower, it will   confirm that a real pullback is occurring  And indeed it would be reasonably appropriate to   attribute that weakness to the growing geopolitical risks that we’re seeing and the general fears   that are emerging  After all, this economy has behaved in an extraordinarily resilient manner,   taking one hit after the other, and it didn’t slow significantly in 2001  Indeed, we might have   benefited in retrospect if it had slowed more  That would have given the economy a greater   bounce coming out of the recession  But because the decline was limited, we do not have a   strong bounceback, and we’re now getting confronted with adverse psychological factors  One   can say that some of the latter are endogenous, but there is no means of which I’m aware to   factor endogenously into our FRB/US model the uncertainties of a possible war with Iraq  And   this is where a really important question occurs     I think we have to be careful about how much of a margin we have before deflation   occurs, although my answer to the question of what we do if we ease too much is to recognize   there is nothing written in stone that stipulates we should operate only in the overnight market    There are numerous positive nominal interest rates as we move out on the maturity spectrum    And there is a great deal that we could do in the way of monetary expansion even if we are   dealing with de minimis overnight rates  So I don’t think that the downside barrier is as rigid as   we generally believe unless we take as a given that the central bank can only operate in overnight           September 24, 2002 87 of 115  funds If that’s the case, then potential deflation is a more worrisome concern than I think we’ve   allowed for However, I don’t think that is the case   My own view at this point is conditioned by our not knowing what the August orders data   will show or what the next initial claims number will be  However, we know that it is quite   possible, if history is any guide, that we may be near the end of a deep funk—if I may coin a   word—and that we may come out of it fairly quickly and wonder later what was bothering us  I   doubt that will happen, but I don’t think it’s appropriate to rule that out as a possibility  I have   seen too many instances in which that sort of a turnaround has occurred, much to our chagrin    As a consequence, I would prefer not to move today even though I know there is a good deal of   sentiment around the table to do so  But I do think we have to convey in one way or another that   we may well move before the next meeting  I’m a little concerned about the next meeting itself   largely because—what is its date?    Well, it strikes me that even though we don’t take account   of political considerations in our decisionmaking, there will be many people who will wonder   what we had in mind  So I think we should try to convey something additional in the statement   that we will release after today’s meeting, not just the usual “we’ll keep monitoring business   conditions” In any event, I would like to stay where we are and obviously retain the negative   balance of risks statement while also indicating in our statement something along the lines that   the uncertainties are due in part to the emergence of heightened geopolitical risks  What I think   such a reference will do—and indeed the possibility of war in my judgment is where the real   uncertainty lies—will be to characterize our explanation more as a form of insurance instead of   being seen as an indication that the Federal Reserve has turned very severely negative about the           September 24, 2002 88 of 115  outlook And because we are in a period where there is extraordinary uncertainty about what is   happening, we have a disproportionate credibility  Accordingly, I think we have to be careful   about conveying an impression that we think the economy is weakening because that can be a   self-fulfilling prophecy In sum, I would very much like to find a way in which we can portray   this policy decision as one intended as insurance as distinct from our more usual type of policy   moves that are directed toward longer-term economic objectives  I happen to believe that if we   could somehow take the geopolitical risk and move it aside, if all of a sudden Saddam let in the   inspectors and they really were able to look everywhere in Iraq, the equilibrium price per barrel   for West Texas intermediate oil, as best I can judge, would probably be around $21 or $22 a   barrel I believe the market price would move in that direction fairly quickly and that would   have a very positive economic impact   So I view the geopolitical risk as a goodly part of the uncertainties that are confronting   us, and frankly I think we ought to say that in our press statement, if indeed the Committee   agrees So that’s where I am  To summarize, my inclination is to do nothing at this moment,   stay with the balance of risks toward weakness, but to keep in mind the distinct possibility that   we may want to move before the next meeting  Vice Chair     President Poole    Governor Ferguson     Yes, we’ll do it anyway     I hope you’re right    Thank you Governor Gramlich     Is that the end of the sentence?  President Hoenig    Governor Kohn     President Jordan     President Santomero     President Moskow     I don’t wish to imply anything other than that  I was being   facetious when I was talking about that    Fortunately, I think we have built up a degree of   credibility such that the notion that we would move for political reasons hasn’t really arisen—   other than among an inevitable number of commentators—in a very, very long time  And I   believe that’s really to the credit of this organization I think our record has been really quite   impressive in that respect    You bet  President Broaddus    President Guynn     President Minehan    Governor Olson     President Parry     Governor Bies     President McTeer     September 24, 2002 98 of 115    President Stern    Governor Bernanke     I’m merely stipulating my view that, if the corporate   governance issue and the geopolitical risks were somehow removed, several things would     September 24, 2002 99 of 115  happen The extraordinary pulling back by the corporate community started with the corporate   governance issue, whose effect has been very evident and acknowledged by business contacts    But even that did not fully undermine what was a relatively continuous recovery  If business   firms change their accounting practices, we get a different view of the world  If on top of that   we get considerable uncertainty in the geopolitical area, we are not going to find any economic   model that can conceivably capture such a development  In my view, however, it’s not   something we have to know in advance  We’ll know it when we see it   I’m just saying that we   ought to be prepared to move before the next meeting in the event that we get significantly   negative numbers I’m not suggesting that the numbers due to come out in the next week or so   are necessarily going to be definitive, but I do know that, if this economy is tilting over into a   decline, that will be obvious to us in the next three weeks and it will show up in a number of    different areas If it doesn’t happen that way, that will mean that the expansion is continuing,   and indeed I think the possibility of a lot of momentum when the malaise is lifted is being   underestimated  I do not believe that we can effectively make a judgment that economic activity   is going to be X percent below potential by the middle or the end of 2003  I don’t believe any of   our models can even remotely answer that question in a useful way  To be sure, they will   generate numbers because that’s what models are told to do  But my experience is that such   forecasts incorporate the weakest capabilities that economists possess  Once the economy starts   to move, it absorbs excess capacity very quickly; and when it starts down, the reverse is also   true The very unusual case is the presumption of an economy that will do nothing, which is   essentially what the Greenbook is saying So I don’t think we can look ahead to a simple   decision It is going to be a tough one           September 24, 2002 100 of 115    I wrote it in disappearing ink!     Yes    If somebody could tell me that we were going to invade   Iraq tomorrow, the uncertainty would disappear  Look, our experience with the Gulf War is that   the maximum negative effects of the Gulf War occurred immediately subsequent to the invasion   of Kuwait by Iraq It dissolved after the first two or three months, but it was pretty fierce in the   early stages    We’re ready to vote  Would you read the appropriate   statement, Mr Secretary?     Call the roll please     Okay Would you distribute the proposed language of the   press statement?     People haven’t read it yet!     What we have tried to do in the statement, basically, is to   capture the tone of this meeting and to relate it to the previous statement  As you can see, it’s   restructured from the August statement, but the only thing that’s new in it is the reference to   geopolitical risks Is this okay with everybody as it stands? Let me remind those of you who        September 24, 2002 102 of 115  dissented that we have a new policy now regarding the disclosure of dissenting votes  We are   going to state not only who dissented but also what the reasons were for any dissent     Yes, of course, that’s right  It’s the direction they would   have preferred But I think we all agreed that discussion of those dissents by the dissenters   would be inappropriate The reasons for any dissent would be written subsequently in the   minutes of the meeting, which will come out, as you know, immediately after the next meeting    So it would be appreciated if no one gets involved in any discussion of this because I assure you   that you will be getting a horrendous number of telephone calls  I would suggest to you that the   best thing to do is not to answer them because if you get into any discussion at all you will find   that these callers are very experienced journalists and they will get you to say things you had not   meant to say  I say that from bitter experience  I decided the only safety valve I had was to   marry one!  [Laughter]     No     No     Is it interpreted that way?    That’s all right  If in fact you are correct, then the   statement is wrong  But it says “considerable uncertainty persists    owing in part to the   emergence   ”  It’s the uncertainty that is the critical issue, not the geopolitical risks    I think conditions have changed enough that not to   acknowledge the geopolitical events in one form or another strikes me as misrepresenting the   situation Let me just ask a more general question  When I accepted three speeches tomorrow in   London, only one of them had a question and answer period afterwards and I had intended to   answer only questions regarding corporate governance and other nonmonetary policy issues    Having heard the discussion here, it might not be a bad idea if I spent a little time on the oil price   issue and its implications and a few other matters related to the outlook without specifying one   way or the other how we should act I say that because, in the event we decide to move, it        September 24, 2002 104 of 115  wouldn’t be half bad if some of those points have been made and then a move won’t come as a   particular shock What’s the recommendation of Committee members?       Does anybody else have anything to add?  Bill     I agree with that    Does anybody else have any recommendations?     Okay, I’ll try my best  I can’t guarantee that what I say   will always come out the way I want it to  But I’ve been around long enough that I can put more   words into fewer ideas than anyone else I know! [Laughter]     Thanks a lot!     Welcome  Would somebody like to move approval of the   minutes for the meeting of September 24?    Without objection, they are approved  Dino Kos, you have   the floor     Questions for Dino?    You mean you’re deflecting the bow?  [Laughter]   President Broaddus    I ought to point out that those of us here in Washington   were quite surprised at the Berry article We don’t know where it came from  Berry is very   careful, and he usually wouldn’t write the way he wrote if he didn’t have some conviction about   the validity of his information  So my impression is that he had a better source than we know    Further questions for Dino?  Mr Vice Chair    Dino                               November 6, 2002 98 of 122    President Parry               November 6, 2002 101 of 122   You say that with a smile?  For the official record, we will   indicate that he smiled  [Laughter]    Before we proceed, could I just ask a question?  I, too,   think that it is worthwhile publishing the study  Does anyone have any objections to that?   SEVERAL No     Can I assume that it’s the Committee’s judgment that we   do so?     Yes, informal judgment  It’s the separate judgment of   individual members of the Committee  Is that correct?                      November 6, 2002 102 of 122    Governor Bies     Vice Chair     There’s also the interesting question as to the relationship   between the Ginnie Mae study and the reasons for the study  Remember, we started off with a   presumption that we’d have a shortage of Treasury securities      We had a worthwhile discussion because there was a   probability that such a shortage could happen  That probability is now gone for the foreseeable   future But the issue of whether Ginnie Maes should be part of the SOMA portfolio is a separate   issue    Governor Kohn     President Hoenig    President Broaddus     President Santomero     President Moskow    Governor Ferguson     President Minehan    Anybody else?    Anybody else? Do you have an adequate response on   this?     I hesitate to try to summarize this  I’ve always wanted to   be in the position of the Congress, when they pass an ambiguous law and then just say to others,   “You solve it”     I do think that the issue of limited resources is not a minor   question When we began examining this, there was a 1 in 10 chance that those budget surpluses   really would arrive and that we would find ourselves in a very difficult position with regard to   SOMA So we had no choice but to look at the options  The likelihood of surpluses has   dissipated, and the rest of the work now is largely discretionary  The question is, Is a particular   issue sufficiently worthwhile in the broad aspect of Federal Reserve operations to use the   resources?  And that’s a judgment that I suspect the two of you could make far better than any of   us            November 6, 2002 110 of 122   Okay, this terminates the official FOMC meeting   END OF MEETING        Thank you very much  Without objection, they are   approved We now move on to David Stockton and Karen Johnson     Questions for our colleagues?     Incidentally, the story about the lengthening out of the   time firms are employing these pieces of equipment is important only if the rate of change   remains stable Those stories can very readily be consistent with a dramatic decline in how   quickly the lengthening stops And that will engender, as Dave says, a pop in the output   numbers  So I think there are problems on both sides of this rhetoric    The business community seems to be a little sloppy in the   way they evaluate their investment spending  And I think there are serious questions as to what   Census does with those M3 forms  Remember where the M3 forms originate  They are filled   out by plant managers at the plant level on the shipments literally going out of the plant  Those   are very hard data The only problem with the aggregate data is that Census adjusts those   numbers, and it’s never terribly obvious how they do it     President Parry     President McTeer    In recent months, housing starts have come in above   expectations fairly persistently  Is there a possibility that we are underestimating the degree of   immigration as we did in the previous decade?  In other words, the boom of 1995 through 2000,   which put the expansion of the US economy well above that of other nations, explains the   strength of our immigration  Our economy is still running ahead of them  Is it plausible that   we’re miscalculating the strength of our population growth and hence the growth of households?      Governor Gramlich                     November 6, 2002 19 of 122    It could, but it won’t show up    I wasn’t raising the issue in terms of Bob’s question  I   was raising a second question relative to the demand for housing in a very broad sense    Incidentally, with the very latest revisions in the third quarter, what is the nonfarm productivity   number now?     Four point zero percent?     President Poole    Yes We do get demolitions data on a very delayed basis    And it is true that, if we took the change in the stock of housing, which unfortunately is tied to   the population survey—it’s the so-called vacancy rate survey—and we used the gross additions,   which include mobile homes obviously, we would in the past have gotten a fairly significant   amount of implicit net scrappings  The most recent data don’t show that  They show very little   So there is either a statistical discrepancy here, or something different is going on about which   we will not get a real understanding I guess until we see the 2010 census of housing, which will   be published in 2012! [Laughter]     President Hoenig     President Moskow     Further questions?  Who would like to start off our   roundtable?  President Parry     That agreement has not been ratified yet, has it?         November 6, 2002 26 of 122    President Moskow     President Minehan    President Broaddus         November 6, 2002 35 of 122    President Jordan     President Santomero     President Stern     President Poole     President McTeer         November 6, 2002 50 of 122    President Hoenig     Shall we break for coffee?   [Coffee break]    President Guynn    Governor Kohn    The Chair grants you an indulgence!  [Laughter] Vice   Chair    They don’t want to share revenues!  [Laughter]     That’s a little clearer     Governor Bies    Governor Ferguson     So to speak! Governor Gramlich    Governor Olson     May I just ask a quick technical question? What is the   incentive, given the vote yesterday, for the President to sign such a bill?    Governor Bernanke    I love this econometric language!  Mr Reinhart                                                                          November 6, 2002 75 of 122    Questions for Vincent?     Further questions for Vincent?  If not, let me get started on   comments To repeat some of the issues that I’ve raised with the Committee in the past, the   ability of this economy to withstand so many shocks time after time after time has been   extraordinarily impressive  The necessary implication of that performance in my view is the   emergence of a degree of flexibility in the economy that was not evident twenty or thirty years               November 6, 2002 79 of 122  ago In turn, this increased flexibility strongly suggests that the economy is in a very favorable   position to move forward, assuming a positive underlying trend in productivity     What we have seen in the past several weeks is that this flexibility is reflected in a high   degree of price elasticity of demand  In this regard, we would expect and indeed we have   observed in a period of repeated shocks that sharp price declines have induced very strong   household demand, especially in the motor vehicles area and—indirectly through declining   mortgage rates—in the housing sector  In fact, the sense that deflationary forces are being offset   by high price elasticity has been evident since the spring of 2000  That’s one of the reasons that   I believe that the economy, despite having been shocked repeatedly, is still standing even though,   as I have indicated previously, it is rather wobbly at the knees   It appears that GDP effectively has been pretty close to flat over the last three months  In   addition, the industrial production index—insofar as we can judge from our weekly statistics and   the overall BLS manhours figures—went down in October, although it seemed to come back a   bit toward the end of the month  So what we have is an economy that can work its way through   what in effect is described in the Greenbook as a “soft spot”  However, as Governor Olson   indicated, the evident response of motor vehicle sales to incentives seems to have diminished   recently and indeed to have disappeared   What that means is that one of the pillars of spending that has kept the economy in a   reasonably forward-moving mode has been removed Now, it is conceivable that the hesitation   in motor vehicle sales is temporary, and it may well be that, if the sales incentives are increased   enough, the weakness will prove to be temporary  However, the staff here has endeavored to   adjust the sales figures for the changes in incentives, and the adjustment doesn’t do all that much   for sales  What is clearly the case is that motor vehicle sales slipped below a 15 million            November 6, 2002 80 of 122  seasonally adjusted annual rate in the last ten days of October That slippage has removed, at   least for the time being, one of the elements of forward momentum in the economy, which I   would say is probably essential if we are to get through the current soft spot and in the end come    out with the Greenbook forecast     Fortunately, fairly strong housing starts and underlying housing construction are still   providing important support to the economy  Indeed, the backlogs reported by the large builders   are moving up at a relatively rapid pace  We also have had fairly strong sales of existing homes    Sales of both new and existing homes have been materially assisted by the persisting decline in   mortgage rates, which effectively have followed down yields on AAA corporates and Treasuries    The problem, unfortunately, is that it’s not clear how much longer interest rates on ten-year   Treasuries will fall I mention that even though a good deal of the econometrics does suggest   that it is the level of the mortgage interest rate and not its decline as such that determines the rate   of new and existing home sales  Remember, the sales of existing homes engender a fairly   significant extraction of equity directly as a consequence of housing turnover  And clearly cash-  out refinancings are also a function of the level of the current mortgage rate in relation to the   average rate on outstanding residential mortgages  What this suggests is that there is still   considerable momentum in the housing industry because mortgage rates remain low  Moreover,   there is unquestionably still very strong cash-out availability as we go into December because   applications have gone up very dramatically and there is usually a six-week lag between   mortgage applications and originations  Of course, it’s the timing of originations that creates the   cash-out monies, which as you may recall I said at the last meeting were running at an annual   rate of around $200 billion And indeed that explains a very big part of the rise in mortgage debt   during the last couple of years         November 6, 2002 81 of 122  There’s no question, however, that we are running into downside resistance on mortgage   rates, or, to make a slightly softer statement, that the rate of decline in mortgage rates is slowing    In any event, it’s hard to escape the conclusion that at some point our extraordinary housing   boom and its carryover into very large extractions of equity, financed by very large increases in   mortgage debt, cannot continue indefinitely into the future  And indeed I presume that the rise in   mortgage rates that has occurred very recently is basically a reflection of the strengthening in the   stock market  One can argue that if that’s the case, we may be losing something from the home   equity side but gaining it elsewhere So that probably is a wash   The important issue here is that we’re seeing some erosion in the props that support   demand in the consumer area, and something else has to take its place  We’ve all been expecting   that capital investment will eventually accelerate as consumer spending decelerates  That   probably will happen, but we are still looking  It’s very easy to get exceptionally morose about   the outlook as the data come in, but there are positive signs   One relates to corporate profits To be sure, they are difficult to evaluate I say that after   having spoken to a lot of security analysts and portfolio managers about the consequences of the   very dramatic changes in accounting that have been occurring in the last three or four months,   indeed since June It isn’t the legislation that is doing anything to create significant changes in   accounting It’s the market that all of a sudden is saying that if a firm has a conservative   accounting system, it will be rewarded with a premium in its price-earnings ratio That is exactly   180 degrees from where we were a couple of years ago, and it obviously is having a significant   impact on earnings estimates This means that even if the economy has changed not at all, the   mere shift to conservative bookkeeping would induce a significant decline in projected S&P   earnings, which indeed it has The only question is whether underlying profitability is            November 6, 2002 82 of 122  improving, and the answer to that is apparently “yes”  If we look at the NIPA accounts and   adjust for the fact that stock options are expensed when they are exercised rather than when the   actual opportunity cost is incurred, we get a weaker underlying profit figure than we ordinarily   would expect, given our assessment of what productivity is doing and what everything else is   doing   What is happening, as best I can judge, is that these two sets of profit forecasts are now   finally coming together  In my view, there is quite a good chance that we are underestimating   the outlook for profits in that an upturn is occurring that could prove to be a little stronger than   we currently expect  If that turns out to be the case, and I suspect that it will though I cannot say   I know for sure, it means that cash flows will be improving and that stronger capital investment   will eventually materialize provided the overhang of uncertainty, very specifically the   uncertainty relating to geopolitical risks, dissipates  This is a Gulf War scenario all over again    You may recall that when Iraq invaded Kuwait in the summer of 1990, oil prices initially took   off But as the buildup to the fighting with American forces took place, we experienced a   progressively more debilitating degree of uncertainty  It took a very significant toll on consumer   expenditures and indeed was probably an important, if not the primary, cause of the 1990   recession We now have the same problem to work through  It’s difficult to know when, or even   if, there will be another Middle East War  It’s very hard to make judgments on this sort of thing    Then, of course, as many of you have mentioned, the European and Japanese economies are not   being very helpful, but that’s not a big surprise   In sum, it strikes me that we are looking at an economy that potentially has significant   upside momentum if it can get through the current soft spot  And if that’s the case, I suspect that   the Greenbook forecast will prove to be too low  Because inventories are tight as a drum and         November 6, 2002 83 of 122  capital investment is going absolutely nowhere, there’s only one direction they can go if we   remove the current uncertainty  That’s a big “if”  We can’t assume at this stage that those key   sectors will lift the overall economy in line with the Greenbook forecast or even that they will   produce a positive outcome  We are dealing with what basically is a latent deflationary type of    economy, and we are all acutely aware of the implications of that kind of economy  President   Broaddus several meetings ago aptly expressed what I think is the consensus of this Committee   on the issue of a potentially deflationary hole  It is a pretty scary prospect, and one that we   certainly want to avoid   The question is what we should do at this point  I think it’s correct to say that, if we   move significantly today—and my suggestion would be to lower the funds rate 50 basis points—   it is possible that such a move may be a mistake  But it’s a mistake that does not have very   significant consequences On the other hand, if we fail to move and we are wrong, meaning that   we needed to, the cost could be quite high  I am not aware of anything that suggests we will not   be able to turn our policy stance around if we reduce the funds rate and that turns out to have   been wrong We can turn it around fairly quickly, but I’m not even sure that “quickly” will be   all that necessary What I’m saying is that we can very readily adjust to that kind of mistake  I   don’t think we could adjust all that easily if we were to fail to move and the economy began to   deteriorate and we were looking into a deep deflationary hole   I don’t think 25 basis points is an adequate response largely because it seems too tepid a   move for the potentially deflationary situation we face, which is a go/no-go type of situation    We are either going to get it, or we are not And if we are going to get it, 25 basis points doesn’t   seem to be the right response  If we are not, we’re going to have to reverse either the 25 or the   50, and I’m not sure that matters all that much           November 6, 2002 84 of 122  Assuming we decide to lower the funds rate by 50 basis points, the tricky question in my   view is whether we move to a balanced risks assessment or retain the current tilt toward    weakness We haven’t moved the funds rate this year, and first moves historically have tended   to elicit a greater response than we generally expect  I’m worried that we can readily be seen as   doing too much in that we can inadvertently create a psychology and concern that says “the   Federal Reserve knows something that we don’t know”  As Vincent just discussed, the issue of   our balance of risks statement and its presumed psychological effect is a very tricky question   because we’re supposed to be deciding on our actions independently of how the market is going   to respond Yet we know we can’t do that  As a practical matter, we have to take actions that   include our assessment of the market’s response to our statement regarding the balance of risks   And even though I think we can make arguments that the risks to the economy, even after a   50 basis point move, may well remain tilted toward weakness, I would be very much disinclined   to indicate that in our statement  First of all, it may not be true because the risks after such a   move may in fact be balanced in terms of the outlook for the foreseeable future  Nor do I think   keeping the present tilt toward weakness would add anything  We don’t need to enhance our   credibility at this point  In sum, the benefits of retaining the current tilt toward weakness in my    judgment are very small, and the risks of misinterpretation are very high  Accordingly, I   conclude that going to a balanced risks statement is appropriate if we do 50 basis points  There   are other possible combinations, which I endeavored to think through to a greater or lesser   extent I believe, after listening to the Committee’s discussion, that lowering the rate by 50 basis   points and going to balanced risks seems to average out close to the Committee’s consensus  I   hope I’m right, and so I raise the issue for discussion to find out  Vice Chair            November 6, 2002 85 of 122    President Jordan     President Hoenig         November 6, 2002 87 of 122   Governor Ferguson     Governor Gramlich    Governor Kohn     President Minehan    President Broaddus     President Parry     President Stern     President Poole     President Moskow     President Santomero    President Guynn     Governor Bies    Governor Olson    Governor Bernanke     President McTeer     Okay Would the Secretary read the language?     Call the roll      I’d like to take a short recess and ask the members of the   Board of Governors to gather in my office to act on the requests on the discount rate  In the   interim we can distribute the draft press statement and ask everybody to take a look at it                  November 6, 2002 97 of 122  [Recess]    The Board members need some time to read the statement    Questions?  President Jordan    That will be added  There are two Banks requesting a   50 basis point reduction, New York and Dallas The standard procedure, as you all know, is that   others come in later in the day or the following day  There is a question, in fact, given the   introduction of our new procedures early next year, as to whether we should be doing anything   differently now I think the general consensus is that it’s far better to stay with exactly what   we’ve been doing And then on January 9, we will make the actual change when we move to the   new Lombard rate discount facility  If there are no further comments, I’ll assume this draft   statement is adequate for our purposes  Now, let me ask Vincent what his view is as to the time   needed for the next agenda item       Yes, that strikes me as a far better approach than to   continue without lunch    So we don’t close the meeting     The meeting is now open  Would someone like to move   approval of the minutes of the previous meeting?    Thank you Without objection, they are approved  Dino     Questions for Dino?  Governor Bernanke     Other questions?  If not, Vice Chairman     And our next meeting is scheduled for?    It’s January 28 and 29  With that we adjourn for lunch   and hopefully we will launch our retiring President on a major new venture   END OF MEETING        Without objection  Thank you, very much  Let’s turn   now to David Stockton and Karen Johnson    It turned out to be seedy!  [Laughter]    Incidentally, did you factor in the expanded estimate of oil   reserves in the La Brea tar pits?    I think we will defer in all respects to President Jordan in   case he wants to leave early and go back to the private sector!  [Laughter]    Theoretically, population is also a factor embodied in the   underlying housing demand analyses that we’ve been doing  Haven’t we taken that into   consideration to a significant extent?            December 10, 2002 14 of 87    President Poole    Incidentally, if it is an intermediate product, then that’s a   correct calculation     That’s not to say that it didn’t happen         December 10, 2002 16 of 87   What I’m trying to get at is that unless one is arguing that   the interpretation is questionable as to whether it’s an intermediate or final product, then that’s   no different than any of the other 10,000—     President Moskow    President Broaddus     President Parry         December 10, 2002 22 of 87    President Minehan     President Parry     Are they going to use real estimates, or is some of that   trust fund shuffling and the usual accounting procedures they sometimes use to fill the deficit   gap?  Do you have any idea what they’ll use?     It could be related to the pension funds in the sense that   the state could fire everybody but the prior pension obligations would still be there on the outlay   side     Let’s move on to the Committee discussion  You have   priority, President Jordan    President Guynn     President Santomero     President Minehan    President Broaddus     President Moskow     President Parry     President Stern     President McTeer    It’s still a very uplifting thing  [Laughter]     President Hoenig    Governor Gramlich      Why don’t we break for coffee?  But before we do that,   let me just mention that the reason I left the room was that I got a call from Bill Donaldson,   whom many of you know  He said he is about to be nominated by the President for the   chairmanship of the Securities and Exchange Commission  So I gave him my condolences!    [Laughter] Shall we break?   [Coffee break]     Vice Chair         December 10, 2002 55 of 87    The President-elect was here in Washington today, wasn’t   he?    Governor Olson     President Poole    Governor Ferguson     Governor Bies    Governor Bernanke    Thank you very much Let’s move on to Vincent   Reinhart     Go ahead, Brian     Questions for Brian?     Governor Gramlich    Other questions for Brian?  If not, this is the place where I   usually hold court for an hour and a half  [Laughter] Since I don’t have anything to say at the   moment other than what has been said around this table, I won’t do that today, and maybe I’ll get         December 10, 2002 73 of 87  credit! [Laughter] I would conclude on the policy issue that we should stay where we are at   1¼ percent on the funds rate and retain the balanced risks assessment  Vice Chair     President Jordan    Governor Ferguson     President Minehan     President Poole    Governor Kohn     President Hoenig    I compliment you  President Moskow     President Stern     President Santomero    President Broaddus    President Guynn     Governor Bies            December 10, 2002 75 of 87    President Parry     President McTeer    Governor Bernanke     President Parry     I meant to say Governor Gramlich    Governor Olson    Do I have everybody?  Read the appropriate language,   please     Call the roll, please     Would you pass around the proposed statement?    Is it okay with everybody?  Vincent Reinhart, you wanted   to make a comment?     Would somebody like to approve the minutes of our   January 28-29, 2003, meeting?     Without objection  Dino Kos     Questions for Dino?  Governor Ferguson   March 18, 2003 6 of 101      Are there any risk differentials between the two-year   swaps and the government or central bank rate?  We’re looking at the shape of the yield curve     Incidentally, I’ve always presumed that the GSEs could   essentially construct whatever duration gap they wanted and that the only issue was the cost of   doing it  Since Freddie tends to have a much narrower gap than Fannie, is it correct to presume   that they are willing to pay the insurance premium to create that gap whereas Fannie is not?     Well, aren’t there other factors that determine the size of   the PE?  I assume profitability is one  It doesn’t necessarily follow that the PE is not affected by   the duration gap     So the bottom line is that that’s bad judgment on their   part?     Governor Bernanke     We do see the spread between the synthetic and the   benchmark ten-year issues going down significantly, which suggests that liquidity is improving       That’s certainly the case with the TIPS  Further questions   for Dino?  If not, Vice Chair     Hearing no objection, the last item on the agenda is the   date of our next meeting     Our next official meeting is May 6, but we will be   meeting, obviously, via weekly telephone conferences  I suspect the first one will be next   Tuesday  We will do it on Tuesdays  We’ll have the staff circulate a questionnaire to try to   determine what times would be most convenient for the majority of members to have those   telephone conferences in view of the fact that a lot of people have previous commitments  We’ll   try to work it out in a way that is least disruptive  Okay?      We have no luncheon agenda, so those of you who would like to catch a plane may wish   to leave before lunch    END OF MEETING   March 18, 2003 90 of 101        Without objection, they are approved  We now move on   to the staff report  Dave Stockton and Karen Johnson   March 18, 2003 10 of 101      Questions for our colleagues?  President Broaddus     President Parry     President Hoenig     President Minehan     President Moskow     President Poole     If nobody else has questions or comments, who would like   to start the discussion?  President Broaddus     Vice Chair     President Hoenig     President Guynn     President Parry     President Moskow     President Poole   March 18, 2003 39 of 101      President Stern     President Santomero   March 18, 2003 42 of 101      President Minehan     Governor Kohn     With that we shall adjourn for coffee   [Coffee break]     President McTeer     Governor Gramlich     President Pianalto   March 18, 2003 58 of 101      Governor Ferguson     Governor Olson     Governor Bies     Governor Bernanke     Thank you very much  Mr Reinhart       Thank you very much  Questions?  If not, let me move   forward  Today’s discussion around the table pretty much coalesced into significant alternative   March 18, 2003 71 of 101    outcomes  I believe almost everybody would argue that the economy is weak, and indeed I   suspect on the basis of the most recent numbers that economic activity has probably been   declining in the last two weeks     There was some significant improvement in economic activity from Christmas through   the first week in February, but the economy subsequently began to weaken measurably,   evidently in conjunction but not necessarily in line with the significant rise in gasoline prices that   started in early February  Gasoline pricing is like a withholding tax, if I may put it that way, that   is set by the service station operator  Those who purchase gasoline know exactly what they are   paying, and I would submit that many people are far more aware of the reduction in their   disposable income coming from rising gasoline prices than they are of their weekly tax   withholdings, which they probably don’t look at very closely  The rise in gasoline prices has   been dramatic  Somebody mentioned earlier that this increase might in fact be a factor in the   recent weakening of motor vehicle sales The latter clearly has occurred, and that includes sales   on an incentive-adjusted basis, if I may put it that way  With regard to the advance in gasoline   prices, which in a sense is the specific result of the current geopolitical uncertainty, we can point   not only to Iraq but, as others have mentioned, to Venezuela, which is experiencing serious   economic and political problems  Somebody also mentioned Nigeria, which likewise is having   severe difficulties That country is a very large supplier of oil, and its output could well go down   sharply   Bob, I wasn’t aware that in Texas people are talking about the possibility of a near-term   shutdown in Venezuelan oil production  My impression is that production has risen from a much   lower level to about 2 million barrels a day in Venezuela  That’s still well short of their   3 million barrels a day capacity  One of the problems they reportedly are having, and I’m not   March 18, 2003 72 of 101    sure it’s actually true, is that some of the oil industry workers who were fired absconded with the   software that runs many of the wells, and the Venezuelans are having trouble bringing output   back toward full production       The stated 29 million figure, as everybody knows, is   phony     Yes, but a number of the oil analysts who follow   Venezuela fairly closely are saying it’s 2 million  Now, if you want to go down and look, we’ll   both go down and look     You’re still trying to figure out ways to improve this   place?  [Laughter]     In any event, I think the argument that the geopolitical   risks are affecting economic activity has a certain credibility, but there is no way to know how   much  You can argue that the Iraqi and Venezuelan situations are having a negative effect, but   you obviously can’t argue that all of the negative effect bearing on current economic activity is a   result of concerns about oil  I do think that the fact that the economy slowed so quickly as the   price of oil rose suggests that oil is playing a part  Moreover, it is significant that the stock   market rose sharply and oil prices fell abruptly as the time for a final decision on an Iraqi war   March 18, 2003 73 of 101    moved closer  Governor Bernanke has noted that the hurdle rate goes up as we get closer to the   event, but that presupposes a risk-neutral and not a risk-averse view of the world  So, why is it   that merely moving up the time when an event will take place creates a significant change in one   direction or the other when nothing has occurred to alter the way people view how things will   turn out?  That should not happen unless there are very significant risk-adverse characteristics in   the market     What we are in fact observing here, a very sharp reaction, is evidence in my view that the   Iraqi war issue is a relevant consideration  In particular, the role of Iraq strikes me as a crucial   factor in light of the recent behavior of the oil, stock, and bond markets As I’ve said previously,   we may think that the probability of a very favorable outcome in Iraq is 90 percent, but the   10 percent residual is very scary  That 10 percent continues to be very scary because nothing has   happened to change the outlook significantly  I would also note that the acceleration in   economic activity from Christmas to early February seems indicative of the fact that some fairly   positive developments must have been going on in the underlying economy, which may or may   not have been brought up short by the acceleration in oil prices   The point I’m trying to make is that we should be in a far better position to assess the   underlying strength of the economy once the major uncertainties about the Iraqi war are   resolved, especially if it goes the way people expect  We will then be in a situation where we   can better focus on the other uncertainties and factors affecting the performance of the economy    The erosion that has occurred in this economy in the last five or six weeks has been quite   significant, and we don’t know, of course, exactly why that has occurred  There are ongoing   developments, which have been mentioned today, that may have more serious consequences than   we can know at this point    March 18, 2003 74 of 101    The natural gas issue is a very big question  We are drilling very heavily for natural gas   Yet marketed production barely moves That’s largely because improved technology has made it   possible to drain probably half the reservoir of a new natural gas field in the first year  Since we   are putting so much of our infrastructure investment spending for energy production into a whole   set of gas turbine based systems, our only new source of gas is liquefied natural gas  We cannot   increase domestic production, and we cannot increase our pipeline imports of natural gas   significantly, of which something on the order of 4 trillion cubic feet per year are coming in from   Canada  As a consequence of that, natural gas could be a much more serious problem than we   realize, and it could have a fairly significant impact on the whole petrochemical industry   structure, which is not a small part of this economy  That has nothing to do with Iraq, but it’s a   really fundamental problem for the United States     In general, I think that we have here, as a number of you have mentioned, a true   Knightian uncertainty issue  In the past when we talked about the balance of risks, we presumed   that we were able to judge that balance, which implies some judgment of the probability   distribution on both sides of the forecast  As many of you have indicated, that does not seem to   be the case at this stage  Our degree of uncertainty has gone up dramatically, largely because of   the apparently very marked impact that the Iraqi oil uncertainty and the other geopolitical risks   are having on economic activity  Our presumption is that, at some point in the not-too-distant   future, we will be able to turn uncertainty into actual probability distributions on which we can   make judgments  While we can consider as many hypotheses and scenarios as we think may   potentially be useful, my suspicion is that we really don’t know  It’s very important for us to   convey to the public that we don’t know because the truth of the matter is that nobody can know    If the Committee were to come out with either a balanced risk assessment or a sense that the   March 18, 2003 75 of 101    risks are on the downside, I think such a statement would be conveying more knowledge than we   can possibly argue that we have The smartest thing we could have done last year when we set   our meeting schedule for this year would have been to recognize that today was the wrong day to   hold a meeting  [Laughter]  I tried to convey to the Administration that we were going to have a   meeting today and it wasn’t altogether a good idea to start a war at this particular point  But they   must have lost my note somewhere!   In any event, I think the bottom line here is that it is important that we communicate the   fact that this is truly a period in which uncertainty as distinct from risk is the dominant element   in all of our deliberations  Because of that as we move from uncertainty toward risks, the payoff   from heightened surveillance should be very large  That is, we are going to learn a great deal   about the economy over the next several weeks  As a consequence I think we will be in a   position to address the issue of whether we ought to be moving or not  I do acknowledge the   probability that our next move is more likely to be a reduction than an increase in rates, but I do   not base that on any knowledge that I would feel very comfortable with  It’s more an instinctive   than an intellectual judgment  In the circumstances, I think we probably ought to stay where we   are, indicate that we do not have the capability of truly making a judgment about the balance of   risks, but nonetheless indicate that we continue to view the underlying structure of the economy   as consistent with a favorable outlook     Factors supporting this assessment include improving productivity; I think the staff   forecast for this quarter is a 3 percent rate of increase  This suggests that the potential for growth   of profitability obviously still has considerable possibilities  If the stock market goes up, history   tells us that people who are very depressed will rapidly cheer up a good deal  In my experience   there is nothing more effective for boosting a company’s capital appropriations than having its   March 18, 2003 76 of 101    stock price go up  That shouldn’t happen, but it does  Well, I shouldn’t say it shouldn’t  It does   say that the market value of existing assets has gone up and therefore the opportunity cost of new   assets has basically decreased  So it is quite conceivable that, if the stock market rallies   significantly, we may find that this economy will begin to look like the Greenbook forecast  If it   doesn’t, then I think there will be a fairly strong argument that we should start to ease policy    My impression is that we will probably know a good deal more before the next meeting  If   indeed that is the case and action is required, we probably would be well advised to have a   telephone conference and decide whether or not there’s any action we wish to take or what we   wish to do  Vice Chair     Governor Ferguson     He merely interpreted what I said!     That’s better  Governor Bies     President Hoenig   March 18, 2003 77 of 101      No, I think what we would want to do essentially is to   stipulate that because we’re presumably moving from a period of uncertainty to one of risk we   are involved in heightened surveillance, which implies that our policy will depend on how the   situation unfolds  For example, the stock market is up 20 percent in Europe  If it stays there,   that’s going to change a lot of things, but I don’t know if it’s going to stay there  So it’s too soon   to move in one way or the other     Governor Kohn     President Guynn   March 18, 2003 78 of 101      It was a combination of the great insights of Governor   Kohn and Vincent Reinhart       Governor Gramlich       May I interject a comment here?  Ned and I had a   discussion about this yesterday  We have to be very careful, if we’re looking at new techniques,   not to get ourselves involved in any pegging of intermediate- or longer-term rates  I say that not   because we couldn’t make it happen but because the problem of unwinding that sort of peg will   result in utter chaos  We have no choice but to fix the overnight rate because we’ve tried   everything else and nothing else has worked  Pegging the overnight rate is a fallback position   and one that I’m sure we would endeavor to work our way out of if we could  If we decide that   we want to move to the intermediate rates to try to support rates, the last thing we want to do is   to mention what our goal is because we will never be able to unwind from that if we get locked   in to a specific pattern  I agree with Governor Gramlich that it’s certainly not too soon to give   some thought to these issues  But we have to be careful in determining not only how we phase   our way into a particular policy but how we phase our way out  In many respects, the latter is far   more difficult than the former     President Pianalto     President Santomero     President Parry     Next week will be too soon  We won’t know enough in a   week     Well, what is the Committee’s general view on this?  I   remember that at the time of the October 1987 stock market crash we had daily conference calls   for general updates     I don’t think a daily call is required, but if you’re talking   just about basic updates, is there interest in doing that?     Yes, perhaps weekly     One of the advantages of doing that, incidentally, is that   the interaction among the Committee members will create a higher level of insight as to what is   going on  Too often that kind of discussion would be a waste of time  I don’t think it would be   in this case  So shall we commit to that?   SEVERAL  Yes     Okay, let’s do it  President Stern   March 18, 2003 81 of 101      President Poole     Well, I think we can try, but we will never succeed in that   respect  There’s no way of so manipulating the views and attitudes of the marketplace that we   can expect to alter them in a period like this  When there is continuity in the marketplace, I think   we do convey our intent, and I think we do it rather well  But this is a discontinuous event with   very significant implications  We are not going to avoid the general reactions that may best be   characterized as the market trying to figure out what this group is going to do at any particular   point in time  We have to grin and bear it and do what we think is right, and that problem will   gradually disappear  It should not be a problem that, at least in my judgment, will create a big   market distortion     President Broaddus     Well, the draft language does try to deal with that  I’ll   circulate the draft so you’ll get a sense of what it tries to convey  Let me just say this, however    There is no way we can get this done without a part of the market distorting what it is we’re   trying to do  I know of no words that we can use to avoid that      Basically, the only questions we have to be concerned   about are, does it undermine the structure of the market or does it significantly affect the   credibility of this institution?  I think the answer is “no” in both cases  But I’m also confronted   with Knightian uncertainty in this respect     We had only one event     We’re 0 for 1     I agree  I don’t think we have much time, but I believe   we’ve done a lot more thinking about this than is implied by your remarks  The real danger here   is that this market is running up on the expectation that the real problem is the Iraqi war, that we   are going to get the Iraqi war resolved, and that there’s an increasing likelihood that nirvana   exists somewhere out there  If indeed there are far more deep structural imbalances in the   system than we perceive or than the market perceives, then the economy could turn around very   quickly  In other words, in my view the deflation you’re concerned about cannot exist unless   there is an asset price deflation  The possibility that there will be a false run-up that fails to take   hold is a perfectly credible scenario, and the reactions could be quite significant  In that event, I   think we would have to move in a very expeditious manner  But you’re raising a question of   what type of move we would make, and there has been quite a lot of thinking on that question      Well, you are looking at the question of at what point   money market funds run into trouble and at the timing of other structural difficulties in the   system that may occur well before we get to the zero bound     Governor Olson     President Moskow   March 18, 2003 86 of 101      We’ve chosen not to use that wording     President Minehan     Well, that was my forecast     Actually we do have more information     No, not necessarily       Incidentally, remember that I testified as I did regarding   the probabilities of a strengthening economy because that was consistent with the actual   forecasts of the members of this Committee     I was locked into explaining why everybody had an   accelerating growth forecast back in late January   March 18, 2003 88 of 101      It really hasn’t in the past  We have moved on   innumerable occasions when we didn’t have very much of a clue as to how the markets were   evolving  Governor Bernanke     President McTeer     Do we have anybody else?     Yes, what we vote on is the language shown in the   Bluebook      Call the roll     Would you circulate the draft press statement?  Is that   generally acceptable?       Who would like to move approval of the minutes of March   18?     Approved without objection  Dino Kos, you have the   floor     A collective action clause (CAC) may be in the gazillion   new issuances that follow the Mexican and Brazilian ones, both of which apparently required   very little if any premium in the marketplace to obtain the CAC  Is there any evidence among   emerging-country borrowers that use of the CAC will now spread significantly?  It obviously   provides greater flexibility in negotiating     Talking about Brazilian debt as high quality is a bit of a   change       President Poole     The swings are really quite large, though   May 6, 2003 8 of 115      Further questions for Dino?  I need a vote     Without objection they are approved  Dino, you want to   discuss the Canadian and Mexican swap renewals?     Questions?       Approval has been moved  All in favor say “aye”   SEVERAL  Aye     All opposed, say “no”     Call the roll, please     I think the only additional item on the agenda is to confirm   June 24 and 25 as the dates for our next meeting  Vincent Reinhart will be in touch with all of   you regarding special topics   END OF MEETING          May 6, 2003 104 of 115        We now move on to the economic situation  Dave   Stockton and Karen Johnson      Questions for our colleagues?  President Parry   May 6, 2003 15 of 115      President Moskow     Vice Chair     Getting from the monthly Treasury statement to the actual   deliveries, which is how defense spending is measured in the GDP, is an even greater hurdle     May 6, 2003 19 of 115      There they are guessing  BEA does not have partial   payments or advance payments data until quite a bit later  President Minehan     Further questions for our colleagues?  President Poole     May I just interrupt?  We had a population census   adjustment, which was supposed to smooth out the household series  But my recollection is that,   in the actual published data for household employment, the number takes off very sharply at the   time when the adjustment was made  I’ve been meaning to ask, and I’m asking now, does   anybody know whether we have a discontinuity in the series?     I ask because you gave me a chart that shows hours   worked on a household basis and on a payroll basis  They parallel each other until very late last   year, and then all of a sudden the household hours, which are in a sense a measure of   employment, jumped up sharply  That struck me as just not credible economically       Thank you     Further questions?  If not, who would like to start our   roundtable?  President Moskow     President Parry     President Santomero     President Guynn     President Stern     President Poole     President McTeer     President Hoenig     President Minehan     President Pianalto     President Broaddus     Let’s break for coffee and come back in ten or fifteen   minutes   [Coffee break]     Are we all here?  Governor Kohn     Vice Chair     Governor Ferguson     Governor Olson     Governor Bernanke     Governor Bies   May 6, 2003 66 of 115      In which direction?  [Laughter]     Governor Gramlich     Thank you very much  We’ve completed our roundtable,   and we’ll turn to Vincent Reinhart      Questions for Vincent?     The problem basically is that we have been dealing with   two issues—the GDP outlook and the inflation outlook  We have defined our balance of risks in   a manner that any acceleration in GDP growth would of necessity increase the rate of inflation   and vice versa  Now it’s very obvious that that economic model is flawed badly  As I will   suggest as I expand on Vincent’s remarks, I believe the way to handle this is to unbundle the two   issues and deal with them separately and at the end weight them for a conclusion  That strikes   me as a solution, though not necessarily the only or even the best solution  At the end of the day   it may leave members with the conclusion that the simplest thing to do is to bury the whole idea   and forget it  I don’t think that’s the right way to go because I do believe we can convey   information about our outlook  But the form that we’ve been using recently to do so essentially   assumes a predetermined relationship, which is that stronger economic growth creates inflation   and vice versa  That’s based on a very simple model  But the real world doesn’t seem to want to   conform to that model, and that is creating very substantial explanatory difficulties for us   May 6, 2003 75 of 115      President Parry     Any other comments?  If not, let me move on using a   somewhat different approach to recent developments, and I hope that we will come out with   some agreement on how to handle a number of issues   There is no question that the financial data have improved quite dramatically very much   across the board  I have in mind not only the narrowing of credit spreads and the dramatic   decline in the premiums for credit derivative default swaps but the very significant drop in the   level of interest rates on BBB and even higher-yield obligations  The fall in those rates has   reduced the cost of capital to a substantial part of the business community, which for a   considerable period of time had been blocked out of the lending market by rates that were close   to prohibitive for lower-rated borrowers  To be sure, a decline in the cost of capital does not   necessarily mean that capital investment will pick up  Such investment depends on the extent to   which business executives see real investment opportunities  And in line with what Jack Guynn   was mentioning, I suspect that people who are beginning to say in private that they feel a bit   May 6, 2003 76 of 115    optimistic nonetheless are not inclined to voice their convictions in public because optimism is   not at this point the conventional wisdom     The truth of the matter is that the data on nominal orders and on backlogs for nondefense   capital goods excluding aircraft are behaving better than the rhetoric  Backlogs have been rising   for the last three months, not significantly but they have turned up  We also are seeing upward   revisions to the data  It’s a small point, but the revised data on durable goods orders for the   month of March that were released on Friday were raised significantly The upward revision   stemmed from data that came in higher than the estimates of unavailable data that had been   plugged into the initial report released by the Bureau of the Census  In short, the numbers look   better than the rhetoric That reminds me of what Mark Twain once said about Wagner’s   music—“it’s not as bad as it sounds” [Laughter]     It is clear that we are getting some fairly substantial improvement in the financial   numbers—those for the stock market obviously and, indeed, for all the credit markets  While it   is true that the markets are being driven in part by improved profit figures, to date they have not   been supported by evidence that economic activity is experiencing accelerating growth  The   question one has to raise in this context relates to history, which tells us that more often than not,   perhaps much more often than not, financial data of the type we have been looking at in recent   weeks point to an eventual strengthening in economic activity  That does not happen all the   time  There have been occasions when for one reason or another it didn’t happen  But the recent   financial indicators suggest that the burden of proof is on those who argue that the economy will   not pick up  Those who make that argument must presume that there are no significant   investment opportunities  I find that most unlikely  Indeed, the expansion of the   communications network that was going on prior to the huge decline in capital investment as risk   May 6, 2003 77 of 115    premiums rose in 2000 was by any measure that we know not completed, and the longer-term   outlook for such investment still looks reasonably solid  We also know that considerable   advances in productivity continue to be made, and that is telling us that the underlying profit   opportunities for new investments have to be there in one way or another     There’s a very interesting question as to whether the most recent anecdotal reports that   we heard around the table, which do not indicate any new momentum in the economy since the   end of the Iraqi war, are in fact accurate  The Federal Advisory Council met with the Board on   Friday, and I came away with the impression—in fact the FAC members said this—that they   suddenly are getting a sense of optimism among their business contacts  The reason I find that   important is that the banking community has a special window on what their customers are doing   well before actual data on their activities become available  I was struck by these comments and   by the fact that they came from all twelve Federal Reserve Districts    This morning Don Kohn got a note from our good friend, Bill Dunkelberg, at the   National Federation of Independent Business  They have just run their survey—the data are not   yet published, and I don’t know when they will be published—and it shows that their index of   confidence, which is the overall index they employ, rose 5 points in April  I believe that is a   monthly record  It is a huge increase  The report also indicated that the index rose to a level of   100 or not far from where it was in 1999 and in earlier years  In other words, if anything it’s   close to normal based on longer-term patterns, after being at its lowest level in March since   1993  According to the report, hiring plans jumped substantially  Capital expenditure plans also   were up, and plans to add to inventories remained strong  There are 1,400 firms in this sample    Those results don’t quite square with those from the Institute of Supply Management, but it is   possible in one sense to reconcile them  All of the surveys of the Institute of Supply   May 6, 2003 78 of 115    Management are taken in the first half of the month, even though the institute waits two weeks to   publish the data  So the National Federation results could be an indication that something   different has been happening more recently  We don’t know yet  These surveys are useful    They’re all diffusion indexes  They’re not hard data  But they are the first indication that   something may be changing     The data that we have been getting on production and employment have been, just to   state it as simply as I know how, awful  We can ascribe the weakness in the employment data in   part to the fact that business firms have displayed an extraordinary capability in recent quarters   to meet a tepid but still rising real demand for goods and services with ever lower employment   This is another way of saying that the ability to increase productivity is there, but it can’t be the   result of large capital expenditures because we’re not getting such capital investment  My   hypothesis—and I frankly don’t know whether it is true, but it would explain what is going on—  relates to the fact that in the 1995 to 2000 period we had very substantial capital expansion  We   had growing markets and very high perceived rates of return on new production facilities as   distinct from investments made for cost-cutting reasons  As a consequence, there was an   inordinately large emphasis in the business community on investing to expand facilities  A result   was that business firms paid little attention to the inefficiencies that invariably arise as they are   building new plants, adding new equipment, and revising the structure of doing business  Those   inefficiencies build up over time, but if the costs of those inefficiencies are relatively modest   compared with the rates of return on new facilities, businesses essentially forget the   inefficiencies  What I think has happened is that, when the spending boom ended in the year   2000, there was a cumulative level of inefficiencies sitting there that were available for   exploitation with a relatively modest amount of additional investment  That exploitation has   May 6, 2003 79 of 115    gone on for several quarters  The implication, of course, is that the underlying structural   productivity gains from 1995 to 2000 were in a sense actually greater than the published   numbers because there were negatives associated with those gains that were not part of the actual   evaluations     This means essentially that going back and cleaning up the barn so to speak is turning out   to be a highly profitable activity  The first-quarter earnings numbers are nothing short of   spectacular in the sense that, after they were revised up very late in the quarter, they surprised   everybody  Now, I don’t know whether the gains are being sustained in the second quarter    They still seem to be holding up, but it’s too soon to be sure  We do know that there has been a   tendency for analysts to revise their forecasts down repeatedly for a quarter as they go through   the quarter  They are doing that now but at a much slower pace than is typical, implying that the   productivity spillover is still significantly there     I don’t know what the short-term behavior of the economy will turn out to be in terms of   the GDP numbers  I do know that, if we look at outside forecasts that are done in very   considerable detail on the bases of both working down from the macro data and building up from   individual company data, we find that JP Morgan Chase and Salomon Brothers/Smith Barney   both have 40 percent rates of increase in GDP for the third quarter  So does Goldman Sachs,   which has, of course, been on the bearish side of these forecasts  I myself find it difficult to   believe that such growth is in prospect because, if it is, that has to mean that by a few weeks   from today growth of real GDP estimated on a monthly basis has to move up appreciably or else   4 percent growth cannot realistically be achieved in the third quarter  That forecasters at these   three organizations believe that it can be achieved I find somewhat startling  It may be that they   are beginning to pick up what the Dunkelberg data are picking up, namely evidence that suggests   May 6, 2003 80 of 115    to them that something significant is happening that will boost GDP growth  To be sure, the   Goldman Sachs numbers tail off after the third quarter, but they’re still higher than the second-  quarter numbers that we are now looking at, which are not all that good   In any event, we did get a report this morning of a sharp increase in chain store sales  I   don’t know how much of the increase may reflect a poor seasonal adjustment for Easter, but it is   a very big increase  In fact, in the last four weeks the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi seasonally   adjusted weekly index on chain store sales went up 3¾ percent, and that rise is not at an annual   rate  It’s the increase over the four weeks     The evidence bearing on the economic outlook is a mixed bag at this stage  The   difficulty in all of this is that a deflation process may be sneaking up on us  It is not doing so in a   way that I anticipated in that, no matter which set of price indexes one uses, the rate of inflation   has fallen fairly dramatically during the last six months  Incidentally, the issue I was raising with   respect to the owners’ equivalent rent was not that the other smaller components of the index are   not falling  Indeed, some are falling more, but I’m seriously questioning whether in fact the   owners’ equivalent rent in the current environment of very rapidly changing homeownership is   best proxied by the way the BLS does it  This involves taking a sample of rents on rental   properties that have the same physical characteristics as single-family homes  I’m not arguing   about the data as such but in terms of whether in fact we are looking at true deflationary   processes  Indeed, remember that the 35 percent probability of deflation in the staff baseline   forecast includes falling inflation as a consequence of improving productivity  The real issue   that we have to get at when we’re looking at the notion of deflation is not only what prices are   doing but also why they are doing it  An economy in which prices are falling at, say, a 5 or 10 or   15 percent annual rate but where rising productivity is matching the decline such that the   May 6, 2003 81 of 115    nominal rate of return on capital is stable or rising tells us that we do not have a destabilized   economic system  So price declines per se don’t tell us very much without advertence to the   concurrent rate of return on capital and whether in fact we have a stable environment  Indeed, I   would argue that a necessary condition for the type of deflationary problems experienced in the   Great Depression is not only a decline in product prices but of necessity a decline in asset prices    If product prices are declining but asset prices are not, the likelihood I would submit is that   individual companies may be having pricing problems but they’re not having productivity   problems  The rates of return are there, and that’s the reason that asset prices are high     I do think we have a concern here  In my view we cannot avoid the fact, as Governor   Bernanke pointed out, that we face an asymmetry  We know what to do with inflation when it   rises  The Committee has taken action to counter it many times and has succeeded in doing so   many times  We haven’t confronted the problem of potential deflation in a very long time, and I   find that possibility to be something on which this Committee must have an ever-increasing   focus  We have to be careful, however, about how we think about this process and make sure   that we’ve got it right and that we’re not merely looking at the zero bound issue  This is a far   larger issue that involves the mechanism by which the economy functions rather than just how   pricing affects products as distinct from assets     My general view with regard to the policy implications is that we probably would be wise   to move the funds rate lower unless we see a fairly substantial pickup in economic activity  I   would suggest, however, that it would be a mistake to ease policy today  The reason relates to   the issue that several of you have mentioned  I did try, incidentally, during my congressional   testimony last Wednesday to open up the possibility that we might ease today  I raised for the   first time the notion that falling inflation would be unwelcome, and I did emphasize a couple of   May 6, 2003 82 of 115    times during the testimony that we, the Federal Open Market Committee, do have further room   to move lower  I think reactions to my remarks did briefly lower somewhat the May federal   funds rate futures, but the stock market then rallied and pulled back down the probability of an   easing action     The reason I think we have to proceed cautiously is that the recent strengthening of the   stock market and financial markets generally, including the narrowing in yield spreads, is a   potentially fragile situation because it is not as yet being supported by positive developments in   the real economy  So if we were to come out today with an easing move that the market does not   expect, the question would arise as to what we in the Federal Reserve know that those in the   market do not  Because we are in such an unsettled period, we have the capacity of completely   reversing the nascent rise in financial market values  If that rise continues, it will lift the   economy with it  As a consequence, I think we need to be careful  I subscribe to Bill Poole’s   general edict about not trying to fool the market  It doesn’t serve our purposes  The ideal   monetary policy is to have nothing happen in the market every time we move because market   participants have fully discounted our action  That creates the best general environment except   for those rare occasions when we want to change the state of psychology  That is what we did in   very early 2001, when we went out of our way to move rates sharply lower at a time the market   did not expect us to do that  We did it because we wanted to alter general attitudes, but at this   point I think we’re far better off not to surprise the market  That’s largely because, even though   a number of us may think that we know how the markets will respond, things happen that we   don’t expect  I submit to you that we currently are dealing with a very chancy situation, but we   are reasonably sure that if we do what the market expects, then nothing will happen  We do not   know with any degree of accuracy how the market is going to behave in the event that we do   May 6, 2003 83 of 115    something one way or the other  Frankly, I don’t know how the market will respond if we move   the funds rate lower today  But as a commentator in the Wall Street Journal said today, if the   Fed were to do something the market would respond wildly  The reporter did not specify in   which direction  [Laughter]  I suspect the reason is that he didn’t have a clue, and I can   understand that   In any event, I think we have a tricky policy issue in front of us today  Ordinarily, as you   know, our procedure is for the members to express their views in the policy go-around, vote, and   then look at a draft press statement  I’d like to do something different today  We’ve drafted a   statement that tries to capture some of these issues  I’d like to circulate it around the table and   have it as a point of discussion as members comment on policy  I would appreciate it if my   colleagues would distribute the statement  Vice Chair     Governor Ferguson,      May I interrupt? I should have addressed this  If the data   we’re seeing from the Federal Advisory Council and the National Federation of Independent   Business prove to be a false dawn, we will know it by the time of the next meeting  And if that   should be the case, I think the burden of proof will be on those who think we should not move at   that time  The absence of signs of an improving economy at that point would suggest potential   deterioration that will require us to respond  I think that’s what you were questioning      It’s yours!  [Laughter]     Governor Gramlich     That would be a very interesting seminar topic because   there are various aspects to it     President Poole     Governor Kohn   May 6, 2003 88 of 115      President Hoenig     I think you’re giving instructions to the gentleman to your   right     President Broaddus       It is, indeed, another way  But if we start to do that type of   statement, we have to be very careful to make sure that we have the actual capacity to implement   the goal  Too many times people have said we will not allow X to go below Y or we will not   allow some specific thing to happen  That’s very forceful if one has a lot of troops to invade the   other guy if he is opposed  But we don’t have the tools to guarantee certain things  And if we   put out a guarantee and fail to follow through, the effects could be really devastating  My   bottom line here is that this approach is not something we can do today  I think your proposed   revision requires Committee discussion in a far broader context     Actually, the Bank of Japan thought it could      President Stern   May 6, 2003 92 of 115      President Minehan     This is not the first time that particular phrase has been   argued  The issue basically is this When we talk about risks to something we have to say what   that something is  In other words, just to say the risks are balanced or unbalanced is fine if one   knows the base against which the evaluation is being made     The point here is that the term “sustainable growth” is a   proxy for an expanding economy whose growth is internally sustainable, meaning it does not   have in it the seeds of its own demise  Now, one can argue that that is maximum sustainable   growth, and one can argue that it won’t matter—the difference here is hardly discernible—  May 6, 2003 94 of 115    whether we’re talking about growth of 3 percent, 3¼ percent, or 3½ percent  It’s somewhere in   that area, but we shouldn’t be putting down a number     That’s what we mean     You’re called on     President Santomero   May 6, 2003 96 of 115      Governor Bies     Governor Olson     Governor Bernanke     That’s called oranges and sausages     President Parry     President McTeer     President Pianalto     President Guynn   May 6, 2003 100 of 115      Is there a general willingness or desire to do that?     Yes, I think it would be a mistake to pull it out     But if it’s the consensus—  President Moskow     It’s very difficult to make that judgment  Basically, if our   sole purpose were to do exactly what the market expects, what we find is that one-half of the   primary dealers who responded to a recent survey expected the FOMC to adopt a neutral   statement  The other half were about evenly divided between expecting an assessment tilted   toward weakness and expecting a continued deferral of any assessment  So, not all the views   were the same  I think we’re running out of people who have not commented     That seems reasonable  Would you read the appropriate   statement on which we will vote?     Correct   May 6, 2003 103 of 115      Good morning, everyone  Would somebody like to move   approval of the minutes of the June 24-25 meeting?     Without objection  The next item on the agenda is the   proposed election of Brian Madigan and Charles Evans as Associate Economists to serve until   the election of their successors at the first meeting of the Committee after December 31  Would   somebody like to move the approval of both?     Is there a second?   SPEAKERS(?)  Second     Without objection  Thank you very much  Dino Kos,   you’re on     On the contraction in currency growth, was that   concentrated in particular countries?     Is it possibly a disinflation problem?  The rate of inflation   is falling everywhere  The decline in the growth of currency seems rather dramatic, and it calls   out for an explanation  You’re not about to give it to me!  [Laughter]     That’s the reason I asked if there were any regional or   country concentrations, but Dino says no     It’s very likely that this currency development is utterly   benign and of no significance whatever  But then again, it may not be  The only reason I raise   the issue is that the data may be trying to tell us something  My view is that, whenever we see a   significant statistic that is at variance with our then-current model of the way the world works,   we shouldn’t readily dismiss it without some understanding of it     On the MBS coupon distribution, the dates on your charts   are not adjusted to the actual period when the refinancings or other mortgage loans occurred  In   other words, there’s a two- or three-month lag, so the current mortgage rate is really not the   relevant one  Or more exactly, with these MBS coupon distributions, the relevant rate is the   current rate but adjusted to the point of initiation, not the acquisition by the holders of the MBS   securities     Further questions for Dino?     Further questions?   August 12, 2003 10 of 110      Further questions?  If not, would somebody like to move   to ratify the transactions since the last meeting?     Without objection  Dino, you wanted to talk about Ginnie   Maes      And we will revisit this issue because this whole question   is going to be a very important one  Finally, Vincent you can get your few words in  Maybe   there’s nothing left to say!     Well, we can start at 730 am and serve breakfast     I see  Do we have to announce that in advance?      What happens if we’re two minutes late?     Can we have a dinner meeting the previous night without   creating a big problem?     Governor Gramlich has an insight     Governor Ferguson has an interesting recommendation   August 12, 2003 97 of 110      Oh, I thought you were talking about having a conference   call     A conference call for this type of discussion is very   difficult to do     Have a breakfast from 730 to 900 am     Then the meeting begins  That’s a little sneaky   August 12, 2003 98 of 110      Is it anybody’s birthday, incidentally?  [Laughter]       The next meeting is September 16  We will get together   on Monday night, September 15, for a dinner and discussion    END OF MEETING   August 12, 2003 99 of 110        Any comments?  That’s fine  We now move to the   economic situation, and I call on David Wilcox and Karen Johnson     Questions for our colleagues?  President Moskow       The accompanying productivity rate would have   something to do with that particular scenario     President Stern     President Parry     President Broaddus   August 12, 2003 21 of 110      President Minehan     If there are no further questions, who would like to start   the roundtable?  President Moskow     President Parry     First Vice President Stewart     President Guynn     President Santomero     President Pianalto     President Minehan     President Broaddus     President Stern     President McTeer     President Poole     Why don’t we break for coffee and come back in ten or   fifteen minutes   [Coffee break]     President Hoenig     Governor Kohn     Governor Ferguson     Governor Olson     Governor Gramlich     Governor Bernanke     Governor Bies     Thank you very much  Let’s turn now to Brian      I vaguely recall seeing another survey of primary dealers,   which showed 60 percent of them—or something like that—indicating that they thought we   would move toward balanced risks  It was circulated today  I may have misread it       That’s the one  Did I misread it?  How did that percentage   get to be so significant?      The previous one was a risk toward weakness   August 12, 2003 70 of 110      They got this different result so I assume—      In other words, no change in the balance of risks means   that they expect the same statement about the balance of risks that we made previously?     I see  So Stone McCarthy thinks it is—     I did find that survey result rather startling when I saw it   this morning  Questions for Brian?  If not, let me proceed  Perhaps the most interesting   development we are observing, and a number of you have commented on it, relates to the   emergence of a clear divergence between the views of this Committee and a significant portion   of the investment and financial community with regard to the evolving economic situation    Indeed, as I read the views expressed by the members around this table, there also is a   divergence between the central tendency of the members’ outlook for economic activity and the   staff forecast  In fact, there’s probably a problem in the way the economy looks to most people    As best we can judge, GDP for the month of July is already more than 2½ percent above the   second-quarter average at an annual rate This means that GDP will be 2½ percent higher for the   third quarter even if we have zero change for August and September  And from what we can   August 12, 2003 71 of 110    already observe in the most recent data, zero change is very unlikely for the month of August    What we’re seeing is an accelerating GDP, not as a forecast but as it has begun to be reflected in   incoming indicators  One would scarcely infer that from the anecdotal comments around this   table   Part of the reason for the apparent difference between perceptions and the GDP data   relates to the fact that GDP measures final sales and, as such, it consolidates out a significant   amount of intermediate activity that is reflected in the comments of our contacts in the business   community  Consumption expenditures are clearly at a very significant level We know that   recent motor vehicle sales are in fact higher because our data for such sales are based on full   coverage  But we also know that motor vehicle firms are having very significant pricing   problems and that domestic manufacturers currently tend to be unprofitable in many of their   operations  I think this provides us with a clue as to where the general problem lies  As I see it,   the fundamental problem for business firms really gets down to the issue that a few of us have   commented on today, namely the lack of pricing power  There is no evidence of any   improvement in business pricing power, and that fundamentally colors the way the business   community sees its activities  Profits are rising, but business executives seem to be surprised by   the improvement in their profits  To a substantial extent, those profits are coming out of cost-  cutting activities, and that inevitably means, as I’ve said in the past, that business firms are still   taking advantage of potential productivity gains that were not exploited during the boom period   of 1995 to 2000  So, unless and until businesses see some prospect of passing through more of   their costs to prices, it is my experience that the business community will have a very forlorn   view of the outlook and some reluctance to move forward on capital investments except for those   that are essential to maintain current operations     August 12, 2003 72 of 110    As we look at this process, we tend to formalize it essentially in terms of a model   structure in which the rate of inflation is related to the level of the gap in GDP  While the results   of fitting the data to such a model are reasonably robust, there is evidently a considerable amount   of noise in the data  As a consequence, it would be perfectly credible to get rising inflation with   a constant output gap for several quarters and not violate the underlying robustness of the   relationship     In any event, we are looking at different views of the way in which the economy   functions  In the past, as a number of you have mentioned, the tendency of the Federal Reserve   has always been to tighten when the economy showed signs of a macro pickup  In this period we   have a very obvious reluctance to move in that direction largely because we’re looking at a world   in which global competition is much greater than it was earlier  To use the example of natural   gas, the real problem in natural gas distribution is the fact that there are a lot of remote deposits   of natural gas that cannot readily be moved to where the demand for the gas is located    Similarly, in the past there were areas of capacity for various types of output that could not be   moved to markets in part because some of them were behind the Iron Curtain but also because of   the inability to move goods and services the way they can be moved now   Clearly we are looking at a different economic world from the one we have experienced   historically, and we are moving ahead of the markets in our assessment of that new world  But   in doing so, we have to be very careful  I say that even though it may very well be—and indeed   I think the evidence supports the probability—that in the end the Fed will turn out to be right and   the markets wrong  Still, there is a fairly large minority probability that the outcome will be the   other way around  The reason I say that stems from my observation over the years of economists   who have constructed very convincing models of how the economy functions, only to see those   August 12, 2003 73 of 110    models break down when applied to real world situations The most famous example   undoubtedly was the very clever Stock-Watson model developed a number of years ago on short-  term forecasting  It had worked for every business cycle prior to its publication, and it failed the   first time it was actually applied  That sort of experience leads me to suggest that a little   humility probably is required here  We need to be wary of talking ourselves into viewing certain   relationships as absolute and persuading ourselves that it cannot be otherwise     This leads me to propose that we maintain the policy stance we adopted at our June   meeting  That would coincide incidentally with what the primary dealers suggest we ought to be   doing  I think we have to be aware, however, of a very significant upside risk to this economy    It relates largely to the fact that inventory changes can be very rapid  Business firms almost   surely are still liquidating some inventories, at least insofar as the available July data seem to   indicate  Indeed, C&I loans and commercial paper adjusted for mergers and acquisitions were   declining into July and have only very recently stabilized  And I understand that staff in   querying market contacts as to why commercial paper issuance has stabilized found no evidence   of any inventory accumulation To be sure, it’s not accumulation per se that’s critical  A slowing   in the rate of reduction can move the economy That effect would be amplified, of course, if the   economy were to experience a normal swing in inventory investment  That would involve a   swing from a $20 odd billion annual rate of liquidation, which I gather is roughly what we are   experiencing in the current quarter, to accumulation at an annual rate of something on the order   of $60 billion to $70 billion at an annual rate  In the context of the staff forecast for final sales,   such a swing would occur if businesses returned to inventory accumulation at a pace that was in   line with what have been normal inventory–,sales ratios  We do have what appears to be an   ongoing downward trend in such ratios and the staff is not projecting any near-term impetus   August 12, 2003 74 of 110    from inventory rebuilding, but an upturn in inventory accumulation does occur in 2004  There’s   no reason in my view why it can’t occur in the fourth quarter of this year or even within the next   several weeks    When an inventory swing occurs, it is always a big surprise  What we find is that, even   though surveys may show that business firms think their inventories are at normal levels, they   may nonetheless in a very short period of time perceive them to be inadequate and initiate a   pronounced turnaround in inventory investment  So that is a significant risk to the forecast, and   it should temper the degree of assurance with which we comment publicly about the economic   outlook, which I presume a number of us will be doing in the months ahead  It is very easy to   become certain about economic behavior that may have been very consistent over a number of   years, and yet history contains what can be very disturbing surprises in this regard  I merely   suggest that one remember that history   I can’t add terribly much to the evidence that profits and cash flows are rising  Lead   times are still very tight  We certainly would be better off with a resumption in the growth of   employment, but I think we have to recognize that the aggregate amount of compensation is a   function of the GDP and its distribution is a function of whether it’s related to employment or   productivity  Obviously, if at any given level of compensation and GDP we have an acceleration   in productivity, the economy will end up with higher unemployment, and those who are   employed will earn higher real wages  What invariably happens in that case is that the   distribution of income becomes less equal but the level remains the same  Unless we can argue   that the propensity to spend is significantly higher in the lower income groups than in the higher-  income groups, which seems to be the conventional wisdom though it does not seem to be   validated all that much by the data, then whether we are getting productivity gains or getting   August 12, 2003 75 of 110    more employment only modestly affects the average propensity to consume  Even so, there’s   very little doubt in my judgment that rising employment does affect overall confidence and   exerts an effect on consumption from that direction  So it is important that we get the rate of   GDP growth up adequately above that of productivity to get an upturn in employment  I must   admit that I’m a little skeptical about the size of the 2004 rise in employment projected in the   Greenbook  That’s basically because I find it hard to believe that productivity growth is going to   fall as far as the staff has it declining  But that’s a minor issue   In any event, the critical policy issue today probably is reasonably clear for us  What is   not clear is how we will proceed beyond today  I think the incoming data are going to matter to   a very considerable extent in testing the differing hypotheses of whether in fact we are living in a   world that differs substantially from the one we have experienced in the post–World War II   period  That’s because the model we’re working with is not the model of the post–World War II   American economy  My bottom line is that we should stay where we are with the funds rate at   1 percent and retain essentially the same risk evaluations that we adopted in June  Governor   Ferguson      President Hoenig     President Parry     It will be  President

have not been issuing a press   release after the end of each meeting for very long  We can always return to our previous   procedures, if that will make you sleep better     Well, we can leave it to Vincent to explain it and solve the   problem  Would you read the appropriate directive language?     Call the roll     Where is Michelle Smith?  Will you distribute the   proposed statement, Michelle?   [Pause]                 Yes     This, as you notice, is repeating words we’ve stated   previously  I might say that a number of us have been struggling with this whole communication   issue  Vincent, do you want to discuss what our plans are on this?     I’m sorry, I may have cut short the previous discussion  I   was assuming because I heard no negative comments that the statement is okay with everyone    But I don’t want to assume that  Are there any further comments?  Yes, President Moscow     Well, the initial claims are down  And the payroll   employment statistics clearly had a bias in them; the seasonal that occurred in the payroll   employment series because July 4 was on a Friday is potentially a problem  The unemployment   rate came down  The numbers are truly mixed  To say more than that we’d have to add another   sentence, and I’m not sure we should be doing that       Yes     President Minehan     Yes  May I suggest something?  I have some sympathy   for what you’re saying  But this is not the meeting to make that change       But remember it’s a combination of wording that’s almost   identical to the last statement plus wording from my testimony on monetary policy, which is   essentially what we have been using     Also, the definition of what constitutes “a considerable   period” is very flexible     Go ahead       Yes  There is a critical addition to this statement, an issue   that wasn’t mentioned in the last statement, and that is business pricing power     We tend to talk about inflation in the context of the CPI or   the PPI, the usual measures  But really what this whole deflation issue is about is pricing power    There is none out there of which I’m aware  My judgment would be that, as soon as I see the   emergence of business pricing power, I would start to think about voting to remove the   imbalance with regard to inflation  In other words, so long as pricing power is nonexistent, I   would say that the risks of an emergence of inflation are minimal  It’s little more than definition    So I do think we’re in a period when we actually can make a statement that we can hold tight   for—using a flexible term—“a considerable period” without too much risk  If pricing power   starts to pick up and everyone notices that it’s picking up, which means profits will be moving   and the whole system will be changing, I think we could readily change our statement in such   circumstances with no significant disruption     I’d like to hear from the rest of you  I agree with   Governor Ferguson that there are slight variations in the way to say this  We could say, for   example, “in these circumstances the Committee believes” rather than “the Committee judges”    That alternative is perhaps a bit softer; “judges” may be a stronger word  But this is an important   issue, and I’d like to hear from those of you who have views one way or the other on this    Governor Gramlich     I don’t wish to imply that the monetary policy report and   testimony have the same status as these statements       President Poole     Don     I’ve been listening to this conversation, and I will tell you   that there is something to the point that the last sentence is essentially repeating the sentence   immediately preceding it     If there is any significant doubt among us, we should not   decide this issue on a majority vote  If there is a substantial concern among even a large   minority of this group, whether they’re currently voting members or nonvoting, I think we’d   probably be wise to leave it until we can discuss matters more fully in September  Governor   Bernanke     Governor Bies   August 12, 2003 93 of 110      It used to be there   Let me tell you what the alternatives   seem to be coming down to  I would say that we have two choices  Either drop the sentence   completely, or just say, “In these circumstances, the Committee believes that policy   accommodation can be maintained for a considerable period”  I hate to ask for a vote, but it’s   the only way I’m going to get a real sense of this group  One alternative is to leave in the   truncated version; the other is to drop it entirely  I will stipulate that, unless we get a significant   vote in favor of putting it in, I would recommend that we drop it and bring it up for discussion—  not this particular sentence but the basic process—next time  May I see a show of hands?       Yes  In fact, let me read the whole last paragraph  I think   that’s a better way of doing it  “The Committee perceives that the upside and downside risks to   the attainment of sustainable growth for the next few quarters are roughly equal  In contrast, the   probability, though minor, of an unwelcome fall in inflation exceeds that of a rise in inflation   from its already low level  The Committee believes that, on balance, the risk of inflation   becoming undesirably low is likely to be the predominant concern for the foreseeable future  In   August 12, 2003 94 of 110    these circumstances, the Committee judges that policy accommodation can be maintained for a   considerable period”     I know, and the reason I changed it was because I had   “The Committee believes” in the preceding sentence  I’ll put it back to “believes” and use   “judges” in the previous sentence  Can I see a show of hands on dropping that last sentence   completely?     Yes, to stop at the phrase “the risk of inflation becoming   undesirably low is likely to be the predominant concern for the foreseeable future”  That’s the   end of the statement, period  Let’s get a count       Yes, in this case it should be voting and nonvoting   members on the grounds that this is a procedural question and I think everyone’s voice should be   heard  So, can I just see by a show of hands those who prefer to drop the sentence completely?     One, two, three, four, five, six, seven  It’s seven of nineteen?        Well, on the basis of that vote it’s right on the margin But   I would say that we have to put in the truncated version of the final sentence       I realize that we all have to eat dinner, and we all shall    But it’s pointless not to use this time for more important things  For example, Michelle Smith   has volunteered to give us a lecture on the epistemology of the ancient Spartans, and I thought   we might want to keep our ears tuned to her accent as she does it in the original Greek    [Laughter]  But since she’s eating, I decided it wouldn’t be nice to call on her  So maybe we   ought to get to less important matters like communication policy     Let me start off by saying this  Just the fact that we are having extensive discussions on   communication policy is an indication that our basic monetary policy, which is by far the most   important thing we do, seems to be generally on track and not particularly controversial  Indeed,   one can look back at our history and see a policy that since 1979 is about as good as a central   bank can get it  Nonetheless, despite what has really been a long run of broadly successful   monetary policymaking, we find ourselves confronted with what to some observers is a seeming   inability to communicate  I find their argument less than persuasive, but I understand the   problem  It stems essentially from an episode that arose in the last few months  I’d like to give   you my view of what happened and why; others may have a different view  The experience puts   at least some of the issues we will be discussing in the context of where we are and what we have   to do     It’s evident that mistakes were made both by us in communicating and by the market in   interpreting our message  It is interesting to note the nature of the mistakes  I must tell you that   I was quite startled when I learned the reason that the ten-year note rate went up significantly   after our 25 basis point cut in the funds rate in June and our related statement  The reason was   that the market had anticipated a significant shift by us to nontraditional means of monetary   September 15, 2003 3 of 78    policy operations  Indeed, market participants obviously had discounted such a shift to a   significant extent by driving the ten-year rate down to just modestly above a historically low   3 percent  I look back, and I say, “What happened?”  How did they get the view that there was a   sufficiently high probability that we were going to use such an approach to lead them to   essentially discount it in the market?  The market moved down almost to where it probably   would have gone if indeed we had embarked upon an aggressive effort—for example, to buy   long-term Treasury notes or bonds     Two things are obvious in retrospect, and I must say only in retrospect  One is that there   was a general view in the marketplace that we would not reduce the funds rate below 75 basis   points largely because of the difficulties that would create for the internal dynamics of the money   markets  The money market mutual funds issue was only part of those dynamics  Second, the   belief was that not only would we start to engage in a further easing of policy but that we would   do so at 75 basis points using a so-called nontraditional approach    However, we in fact had concluded that we could go very significantly below 75 basis   points on the funds rate  While we recognized that there would be impediments as we moved the   rate downward, we felt that, with some diligence, these could all essentially be dealt with  We   believed that, if we needed to go well below 75 basis points for economic reasons, we had the   capacity to do so  Essentially we recognized—as a consequence of a number of excellent studies   by the staff—what would happen to the repo market and fails and the implication of moving   significant quantities of assets, including money market funds, to the commercial banking   industry  We were aware of what that would do to leverage and of various other problems that   would arise were the funds rate to sink well below 75 basis points  The general conclusion of the   September 15, 2003 4 of 78    staff, and I think of the FOMC members, was that this would create some difficulties but, if we   needed to move the funds rate down further, it would be desirable to do so         In light of the market’s belief that we would couple a cut to 75 basis points with a move   to nontraditional means of conducting open market operations, almost everyone in the market   apparently was well positioned, having already bought bonds extensively  The truth of the   matter is that (1) we did not view 75 basis points as a limit and (2) we had concluded on the basis   of evaluations of probabilities that it was quite unlikely that we would need to go to   nontraditional operating methods     In effect, what we kept saying to the market is that the probability of deflation of a   pernicious sort was remote; but if it happened, it would be a significantly dangerous event    Therefore, we felt we needed to have on the shelf plans for using the nontraditional means   required to address that possibility  We decided to go all out to find the answers to a number of   questions—answers we did not have, given the long period we’d had of fiat money in which   inflation was rampant and deflation had never entered anybody’s mind as a problem  The   prospect of deflation in this country had not occurred to anyone until the Japanese demonstrated   that it was possible to have fiat money and deflation—not necessarily of a pernicious type but   definitely deflation   As a consequence of that, we embarked upon a full court press to get as much   information as we could on deflation and its implications  We thought about what types of   policies would be required in order to implement an anti-deflation policy, and we engaged the   financial community quite extensively in this effort  I gather that you, Dino, and others at the   New York Bank and elsewhere communicated with market participants to learn exactly what the   implications of deflation might be for various sectors of the marketplace  We learned a great   September 15, 2003 5 of 78    deal  At the end of the day, we made an assessment of the probabilities of various developments   and what would happen if they occurred, and we thought about what we would do and how we   would do it  Having concluded our research and brought our knowledge up-to-date, we   effectively closed the book and put the general plan on the shelf  And we told the marketplace   that we had come to two conclusions  (1) that 75 basis points was not, as the market had often   suggested, the lower limit—that indeed we could go lower—and (2) that we thought the   probability of our having to use nontraditional operational methods was remote     Now, we used the term “remote” all the time  I noticed that every one of us who said   something about the deflation issue started off with pretty much standard language—almost   boilerplate—to the effect that the possibility of deflation was remote but this is what we would   do if that very unusual event occurred  Even in elementary courses in mathematical probability a   remote event remains remote irrespective of the number of times one mentions it  [Laughter]    This turned out to be a misunderstanding on the part of many traders who have a different way of   looking at the world  To these people, the Federal Reserve—indeed, every organization—is   viewed as a conspiratorial organization; and since we continued to talk about deflation, the fact   that we used the word “remote” was not the relevant issue, but the number of times we used the   word was  Therefore, they thought the appropriate way to assess the probability of whether or   not we would go out and buy long-term bonds was to add the number of times we said “remote”!    Indeed, they did that and concluded that the probability was far better than 50 percent that we   were going to engage in a very massive action in the long end of the market   Should we have caught that?  Maybe  I’ve been in these markets for years; I don’t even   want to mention how long  It never entered my mind that that was the market’s interpretation    When I testified in July at the Senate hearing on our monetary policy report, somebody read to   September 15, 2003 6 of 78    me a statement that bond prices had declined because the market was disappointed that we had   taken purchasing long-term notes off the table  And I naively said that I wasn’t aware that we   had taken anything off the table  I didn’t know what they were talking about   What this basically tells us is that the issue of communication is not simple  There are a   lot of people who are telling us what we should do, as if they knew!  I submit that even the most   thoughtful people who are giving us instructions on what to do would probably have made   exactly the same mistakes that we made in interpreting how the market would read our use of the   word “remote”  There’s a tendency for people in the market to be surer about what they are   saying than they could conceivably have reason to be  In the circumstances, I merely want to   suggest as a preface to this discussion that it is important that we clarify what we are saying  It’s   important first to come to a judgment on how to communicate  I gather that most but not all of   us are of the belief that we should be saying things over and above announcing the actions that   we are taking  I personally happen to think that, indeed, there is value added in communicating   not only what the Committee did at an FOMC meeting but what the reasons were and also,   importantly, a general view of the economic outlook as we see it  I think it creates a more   efficient marketplace if we can communicate that, whether we’re right or wrong, so people can   interpret where we’re coming from  That’s not always easy because our press statements are   talking for nineteen people  So while we can get something of a central tendency view, it is quite   difficult to do  But I happen to believe that there is value added, and by implication value to   GDP, if we are forthcoming in trying to communicate our view of the future and the context in   which we are making our decisions     I’d also argue, however, that we are a very powerful organization of unelected officials,   and we owe it to the public—to the electorate and everybody else—to be as transparent as we   September 15, 2003 7 of 78    can be, but with an important caveat  Namely—in part reflecting the fact that markets do not   work wholly rationally—if we are too transparent, we will effectively reduce the capability of   this organization to operate in a manner we are required by statute to do  I have no doubt that if   we were operating under full transparency—which essentially would involve having television   cameras on us at our meetings—we’d all end up reading prepared statements  We’d be very   careful and noncontroversial, and we would not challenge the views of other members of the   Committee  That, I think, would very significantly undermine the capability of the Federal   Reserve System to carry out its responsibilities  So with those opening remarks, in lieu of a far   more interesting discussion from Michelle, I will turn the floor over to Vincent Reinhart     Let me just add to Vincent’s comments  The procedures   we currently are using to communicate are essentially ad hoc  They have been working in the   sense that we have succeeded in releasing by 215 pm on the day of the meeting a press   statement on which we’ve gotten the general agreement of the Committee  This has nothing to   September 15, 2003 12 of 78    do with the issue of lack of communication to the markets  This has to do with our own internal   practices   It strikes me that we have been fortunate, because I think we in fact are trying to do   something that in the long run is not possible  Namely, we are trying to craft a statement by   nineteen people, which I hope everyone agrees is just not feasible  If we ever did it, no one   would want to read it—or they shouldn’t!  The practice of releasing the press statement at   215 pm on the afternoon of the meeting puts us in a position of dropping on the table a draft   statement that a significant number of the members of the Committee have not seen before    Fortunately, we have not had considerable divergences between the views held by individual   members and those expressed in the drafts  But I can’t imagine that that’s a proper way to go   about doing this because at some point we’re going to run into a set of serious differences within   the Committee and it’s going to take a long time to resolve them  We could very well run   beyond the self-imposed 215 pm deadline  That could create a lot of difficult problems    In any event, it really isn’t fair to drop on you a draft—granted it’s only a paragraph or   two—and ask that you make a judgment on whether it communicates what we are thinking    That’s especially the case when the action is not something that is in dispute by the marketplace   because the statement then becomes a critical vehicle by which we convey the substance of our   discussion at the meeting  So we have to find a means to communicate somehow to the full   Committee what the various options will be in the statement we will look at subsequent to the   vote  There are a number of ways of doing that, and I think we do have to move in that direction    Otherwise we are taking too many risks that someday—when the decisions are getting difficult   and the economy is changing in a manner on which we don’t have full consensus—the way we   currently forge the press statement will cause us problems  If it is not the general belief among   September 15, 2003 13 of 78    the Committee members that we’re all looking at the same things on the economic landscape, we   will find that this particular process is going to serve us quite poorly    I would suggest that the solution to this problem, in my judgment anyway, has to meet   several requirements  One is that we should not have every member involved in trying to draft a   statement during the meeting itself  Two, we ought to have a form of communication in advance   of the meeting that would enable individual members, should they see something in the   contemplated wording of the announcement to which they cannot acquiesce, to so inform the   Secretariat  That way we can try to capture a consensus from the Committee in advance of our   endeavoring to draft the statement  I think that is feasible   We cannot and should not try to draft a series of statements and send them out in advance   for everybody to look at  First of all, I think that would be extremely time-consuming  Second, I   have a concern that it would be the focus of the discussion at the meeting rather than a statement   that reflects that discussion  In effect by sending out early drafts, we would risk the possibility   that the drafts would distract us from concentrating on the areas of the economy we normally   discuss, and I don’t think that is a good idea  I don’t know where we’re going to come out today   or, if we don’t come out with a clear plan today, where we will come out when we talk again   about our communication policy  Is that at our January meeting?     I do think that our experience of the last several years   highlights the difficulties we confront in trying to reach a consensus when we have a range of   opinions on one issue or another  We have to solve that problem  As far as I can see, the   problems we’ve had in shifting to the kind of statement we’ve issued recently have caused very   September 15, 2003 14 of 78    little damage  But I think that’s partly good fortune and not necessarily good management or   good judgment  I don’t think we can take the risk of leaving that type of problem unresolved   As I said at the beginning, the fact that communication is the problem and not the   fundamentals of what we do—namely, what the target funds rate is, how soon we move, and the   size of any changes—suggests that we are handling those big things rather well  Communication   should be a relatively modest part of what we do  The fact that we have the luxury to spend a   good deal of time on it is an indication that the rest of our world, if I can put it that way, is   running satisfactorily   Let me call for a small break at this time so everybody can go get dessert  But let’s come   back as quickly as we can, and we’ll resume with questions to Vincent  Then we’ll go to a broad   discussion of the issues  I might add for those of you who have specific points of view that differ   from what Vincent laid out or from what I laid out, we will use the discussion period for you to   expound on your views  If your commentary gets too extended, people will get up and leave!    [Laughter]  Why don’t we take a short break    [Dessert break]     What I’d like to do first is to open up the floor for   questions to Vincent  Then I’d like to have those who want to make small presentations of their   points of view, which are somewhat different from or in contradiction to Vincent’s, take the floor   for an appropriate amount of time  After that we’ll have an open discussion, and you can put on   the table various ideas or talk about your concerns regarding what we’ve done  Let’s see if we   can get most of that out of the way and completed this evening, if possible  Questions for   Vincent?   September 15, 2003 15 of 78      Well, going all the way back, that’s what the tilt does     It could be both       First of all, there really is no such thing as an accurate   forecast  We don’t have any capacity as such to forecast how the economy will evolve  All   we’re doing is extrapolating current imbalances and assessing how they might resolve   themselves in the future  I’m merely communicating that, in my judgment, we have to go   beyond the individual actions we take and continue to indicate how we view the outlook  In that   regard, what we do now I think we do rather well, frankly  My own view is that if we could   somehow find a way to make what we have been doing in the last two or three months stable and   functional, that would be ideal  I do believe that indicating our view of the balance of risks is   wholly appropriate as a way for us to fulfill our obligation to the public in terms of being   transparent  Making a forecast doesn’t add anything because those forecasts, in my view   anyway, aren’t very valuable     I would say that we have to be very careful not to commit   the Committee to any series of future actions, which would necessarily imply that we know how   the economy is going to evolve  We may feel reasonably certain about it, but we’ve been wrong   too often in the past; and I think the cost of a mistake of that sort is very large  That’s my view     Let me say this  I think what we have been doing is fine    For example, I would not have changed anything that we’ve done in the past two or three months   on the basis of what has been happening in the marketplace and what people have said  My own   judgment is that, if the economy in June had looked the way it did in April, we would have made   a 25 to 50 basis point adjustment in the funds rate, and probably half of it would have been   unwound by now  The brouhaha essentially has occurred because we are right on the fulcrum of   a change in attitudes in the marketplace  When we dropped our set of conclusions on the market,   that pretty much exacerbated the significant increases that were already occurring, partly as a   result of the ongoing convexity of delta hedging  The market proceeded to put everything   together in one fell swoop and attributed it to us  Well, thank you, but no thank you  So, I think   the answer to your question is that what we’re doing now fulfills our obligation in terms of what   we ought to be doing  In my view the problem is how we come to a conclusion on the particular   statement we should make to the public at the end of our meetings     President Poole   September 15, 2003 17 of 78      Remember, these are questions for Vincent  We haven’t   gotten to members’ views on the substance     May I interrupt you?  You’re into part two of this   discussion  You may have the floor after people have asked questions or clarifications of   Vincent  There may well be some questions or clarification issues, so let’s get those out of the   way and then move on     That’s what you’re going to tell us about in a few minutes   after others have raised their questions!  [Pause]  Well, maybe Vincent has been perfectly clear    Does anybody else have questions for Vincent on the substance of what he said?  If not,   President Poole  [Laughter]     I’m surprised that the correlation is as good as it is     I understand that, but actually I would have expected a   wider scattering than your chart shows       Anybody can jump in on the discussion  I’ll just give my   initial response to President Poole’s observations  I think you’re describing the way the markets   work and raising the question of whether information helps the markets  Let me give an example   of something not dissimilar to the markets we’re dealing with, namely the long-term crude oil   futures markets  Those futures markets are interesting in the sense that they are largely anchored   to a long-term equilibrium price of crude oil six to seven years out  That price essentially   reflects the conventional knowledge of the technology at the time and how long it would take to   bring new sources of oil on the market  For example, the markets currently are saying that the   equilibrium price is $23 a barrel or thereabouts What that has done, if you look at the futures   markets, is that the contracts are all anchored out there in the $20, $21, $22 area  As a   consequence, irrespective of the short-term price, there are those—especially small, independent   September 15, 2003 21 of 78    drillers—who have to make judgments as to whether they should in fact drill  It will take a long   time to drill, so they essentially sell in the forward market whatever amount of oil they think they   will get  The futures price facilitates the decisionmaking that is involved at that particular time    But one thing about those crude oil futures markets is that they are awful forecasters  You will   find that they project the market poorly because all sorts of events that affect the market occur in   the interim  Does that mean that they are of no value to the functioning of the crude oil market?    I would say on the contrary  They actually affect the future; they essentially distribute demand   and supply not only in spot markets but over the future—even though their forecasting capability   is very poor and, indeed, far less accurate than the predictive capability of the fed funds futures   market depicted here in this chart     So I think there is a value, even if it is incremental, in our communicating in a manner in   which the markets can understand our thinking  You mentioned the 1997 period and the fact that   nothing happened with respect to funds rate then  Well, the fact that nothing happened is   important  To basically say that the economy is going to be dull for the next several months and   that the federal funds rate is not likely to change is a profoundly important statement if you   believe it  To say something is not going to change involves as much risk as saying that it will   change because our ability to look out there and make that judgment is limited  You may   consider your data to indicate a poor correlation  I think the fact that the quadrants are correct is   essentially communicating some information to the market that it did not have previously  In   that regard, I think we do a service to the market by endeavoring to communicate—as poorly as   we do it—the general expectation of the balance of risks among the Committee members     Well, if it were not instructive, this correlation would be a   random distribution or it would be negative  Remember, it’s not negative     I agree with what you just said  Take as a given that the   availability of factual information about the economy is an ongoing phenomenon and that the   market is responding as it does in a fairly sophisticated way  The question is, if we superimpose   on them our view of the outlook, do we do harm, are we irrelevant, or do we do good?  In order   to determine that I would create this sort of scatter diagram  If the data points were in the wrong   quadrants, we certainly should stop because we’re doing harm  If this were a wholly random   distribution, I’d say that we’re not doing harm and we’re not doing good, but we’re wasting our   September 15, 2003 23 of 78    time  I’m submitting that the evidence you’re adducing this evening strikes me as confirmation   that, while we may not be adding a great deal, we are adding something This is a positive   correlation, and it seems reasonably certain that you have enough observations here that the   correlation is significantly different from zero  Is that correct?     I take that as evidence that we are making a contribution   over and above the evidence of how the economy is doing because the market’s assessment of   that evidence is already built in when we make our statement  I grant you that part of what’s   built in is an expectation of what our statement will be, but this does not strike me as an   indication that we are doing any harm  To be as conservative as I can in judging this, I would   say that there is no evidence here to suggest that we are doing harm to the marketplace as a   consequence of our actions       Well, I hope we‘re trying not to do that  I would agree   with you on that  We should not be trying to communicate what we’re going to do at the next   meeting; if we believe that an action needs to be taken, we might as well do it now     If that’s the conclusion you’re reaching, I’m on your side   on that argument     September 15, 2003 24 of 78      I think you said “will be going”  You didn’t mean to say   “will”     President Parry     We’re now in open session     I happen to agree with that and would recommend that   heartily, as I’ve been doing for years without success  Sorry to interrupt     By level you mean what?     If we knew what the gap was     Well, we do have views  But you’re going a little further   than I think we actually can  Let me raise one question  Unless I’m mistaken, it seems that the   actual statement of the balance of risks can be formulaic  I still don’t see why it has to be   different in the Bluebook and in our statement  What is the argument?  I remember that the   statement we used originally had unbelievably archaic language     It was bizarre  We got rid of the “woulds,” “coulds,” and   “mights,” and we were left with still partly archaic language, in my view  Is there any reason   that we can’t make the statement on which we vote the exact statement that is in the draft press   release?     What are the arguments against it?     Well, let’s break Bob’s argument into two pieces  It seems   to me, in the context of what you mentioned earlier, that there is no reason that we can’t have in   the Bluebook the exact language for various choices on which the Committee might vote, and   then that language would appear in the statement  That does not require a good deal of effort    As we’ve been discussing, the other part of the statement is essentially the rationale for our   decision, which we also need to describe  The language regarding why we came out in a   particular direction cannot be formulaic because different reasons occur all the time  But I see   no reason that the staff cannot paraphrase in the Bluebook different alternatives of what might be   said in justification for a position that the Committee might ultimately adopt  Therefore, when   we vote, the explicit language and a generic form of the explanation as to why we are voting that   way is part of the vote     After the vote, we would present the draft statement, which would be composed of the   exact formulaic language and presumably a bit more stylized or nuanced language regarding why   we did what we did  Undoubtedly people will have differences of view, but in that process   we’ve created the possibility that two-thirds or three-fourths of all the information that a   Committee member would want to know with respect to the statement is available in the   Bluebook  If there is a serious question as to how the statement will come out, I think there’s   more than enough time to communicate with Vincent and indicate that there are problems  I’m   September 15, 2003 29 of 78    just trying to think about the timing issue a bit more  How much of the Bluebook is tied into the   Greenbook?     Yes, it has to be produced after the forecast, but I’m trying   to get at the question of whether there is enough time to get back to Vincent  When does   everybody receive the Bluebook?  I know when it arrives on my desk   SEVERAL  Thursday     Everybody gets it at the same time?     Okay, I was thinking in terms of the nineteenth century   and delivery by Pony Express!  Then there’s no problem  I do think we have to have a   mechanism, if a significant minority takes issue with certain language, to communicate that by,   say, Friday before the Tuesday meeting  We would need some formal mechanism to make a   judgment as to how that affects or doesn’t affect this process  Originally, when we started   issuing a statement after the meeting, we made those statements in my name  I didn’t think that   was appropriate  If I go out and make a speech, that’s one thing  But no matter what we do, the   statement we make about the policy decision at an FOMC meeting should be a Committee   statement  We may not be able to agree to language about the reasons that we took a certain   action  The language in the press release, if it represents a Committee statement, basically says   that twelve people came to a conclusion for the same reason, which is not always the case  So if   we can’t agree on wording about the rationale for our decision, then I think we are forced to go   September 15, 2003 30 of 78    back to plain formulaic language on what we did without explaining why we did it  In my view,   that would be unfortunate; but it may be necessary     Yes, you would call up and say, for example, “I happen to   be in favor of alternative 2, but the reasons you give in the Bluebook are not the ones I consider   the appropriate reasons for coming to that conclusion”  If the staff gives all the potential   alternatives, then that’s not an arguable issue  The only arguable issue is that the rationale for   any particular position that we might take is not a valid one     Okay  President Broaddus   September 15, 2003 31 of 78      Let me just comment that we do have an inflation   objective  It’s called price stability  It’s not that we don’t have a target; we just don’t announce   it  It’s interesting that the discussion always seems to get to the issue of inflation targeting  The   September 15, 2003 33 of 78    issue is not the pros and cons of announcing a target that we actually have but what to do if that   target is not being achieved   I want to call to everybody’s attention the most egregious form of that problem, which is   the ECB’s M3 problem  The ECB had concluded that an M3 target, if followed appropriately,   would be the most effectual in stabilizing the European economy, so the ECB had a target for   M3  M3 never worked  Most of the time in discussing policy the ECB had to explain why M3   was not doing what it was supposed to be doing  Now, I submit to you that it’s one thing to get   out there and say this is what we will do—that we have an inflation target of between 1 and   2 percent and this is what we’re going to do to achieve it  That’s all well and good  But what do   we do when inflation is right at either 1 percent or 2 percent?  Do we take action to make it stay   within the range?  More often than not, as history has indicated to us, that doesn’t work  Then   we’d have to explain why it didn’t work  Or, if we chose not to take action to keep inflation   within our target range, we’d have to explain why  Suppose the target range was 1 to 2 percent,   and inflation was up at the 2 percent level  The policy would call for us—as in New Zealand, for   example—irrespective of whatever else was happening, to literally raise rates  At that point in   time, all other evidence might be indicating that the economy is in the process of sagging, and   the last thing the central bank would want to do in those circumstances is to raise rates     It strikes me that, if we had a 1 to 2 percent inflation target and had not announced it, we   would be free at that particular point to make a judgment as to whether to tighten or not  It’s not   clear to me—and it has never been explained to me to my satisfaction—what the cost–benefit   analysis is on announcing inflation targets  For a central bank not to have inflation targets is not   to be a central bank  The question is not that  The question is, do you announce the target?  If   September 15, 2003 34 of 78    you do, then you’re confronted with the issue of whether you will absolutely adhere to that rule,   and you face the distinct possibility that you will fail in achieving your end     Now, presumably, we can always succeed on the upside  We can tighten enough to   guarantee that we will bring the economy down far enough to prevent inflation from breaching   the upper limit of the target  We cannot guarantee success on the downside—the Japanese have   demonstrated that very clearly  As I think all of our discussion about the zero bound suggests,   even an inflation rate of 1 percent creates serious problems  It’s not clear to me what we’d gain   by announcing a numerical target for inflation  Everyone says we’d gain credibility  I don’t   have a clue what that means  And there is no evidence of which I’m aware that tells me that   announcing a target improves the performance of the central bank    As I was mentioning to one of our colleagues the other day, I remember a wonderful little   study that was done on the Bundesbank at the height of its “credibility”  Somebody came up   with a conclusion that the Bundesbank’s sacrifice ratio was no better than anybody else’s  I said   to myself Well, if that’s the case, what is the value of credibility?  What does it do for you?    Most important, what does it mean?   As far as I’m concerned, putting together the issues of inflation targets and announcing   inflation targets as one package makes no sense when they’re obviously divisible  To me the   cost–benefit analysis of announcing has never been demonstrated  Indeed, we don’t even know   for sure that those who are practicing that approach and announcing their inflation targets will do   better in the next period of inflation  I will put it to you this way  If in the next inevitable period   of inflation, those who announce their inflation targets do better than those of us who don’t, I   will change my point of view   September 15, 2003 35 of 78      Let’s take that example  Is there anybody in the   marketplace today whom we have failed to convince that we’re not going to do anything on the   funds rate for a while?  Look at the federal funds futures markets      Okay, but let me go further  The scenario is as follows   The core PCE, which is a monthly series, pops above a rate of 1 percent  We are highly   accommodative  Do we go back to neutral at that point or when the PCE is at 1½ percent?  What   do we do?  In short, supposing we do go back to neutral and then find that the next month the   September 15, 2003 36 of 78    statistic goes back down  You see, it’s one thing to say we’re going to do something, but   operationally we have to deal with numbers   If you have a rule, either you adhere to it vigorously and unequivocally, with no   exceptions, or you deviate from it and give reasons that you are not following it  But in order to   do the latter, you have to have a set of principles that determine when you will deviate from the   strict rule  If you have a strict rule then you don’t have to discuss deviations  You literally act in   accordance with the rule  The rule says when the core PCE rate as published by the Bureau of   Economic Analysis falls below 1 percent, the federal funds rate will be reduced by some   formula  If it goes back above 1 percent, you reverse the action   In other words, if we have a strict rule, the market will know exactly what we will be   doing as a consequence of the rule  Indeed, we don’t have to have any meetings because it’s   automatic  To the extent that we don’t automatically follow the rule, then the question is what   principle determines when we deviate from the rule and when we apply it  I submit to you that,   if we have that sort of principle, then that is the rule, and the actual rule from which we deviate is   not operative  That, indeed, is what we do today  I’m not clear what we gain by publishing   targets that we say we are going to adhere to when we know we’re not going to adhere to them   And when we are not following them, I am sure we’re going to have to spend a considerable   amount of time explaining why  If you think it’s difficult to come to a conclusion of this   Committee as to why we’re doing something, try getting agreement on why we’re not doing   something!  [Laughter]  That is going to be even more difficult   As I said to you, Al, I’m not against inflation targeting per se  If it can be demonstrated   that it actually works—that the mere stipulation of a target that is announced actually conditions   the marketplace so that indeed the target has an effect—I will admit that I am wrong  I will jump   September 15, 2003 37 of 78    to the other side on this issue, as Bill Poole did on announcing the tilt  But there has been no   definitive test of this  I would suspect that, when inflation occurs, those central banks that have   not announced inflation targets will do as well or as poorly as those that have  If that turns out to   be the case, then the positive value of inflation targets doesn’t exist  But the negative value—  having to explain why we’re not adhering to the targets—creates a very serious problem  I don’t   see what announcing inflation targets does for us     Why not?     Suppose BEA revises the number from above 1 percent to   below 1 percent in the middle of the month?  They do revise the numbers  They could publish an   initial number of a 11 percent annual rate of inflation and find out that they made a mistake    Suppose they then revise their data and move the rate down to 09 percent  What do we do?   September 15, 2003 38 of 78      I hope not       If we’re going to go with inflation targeting—where we   actually stipulate what our targets are and say we will act to achieve them—I think we first have   to go through a full court press of literally simulating all the situations that could arise and how   we might respond  We need to decide what principle will determine our response and how we’re   going to convey that principle—the rule that would prompt us to move or not to move    Remember, if we have an explicit rule from which we never deviate, this Committee will   adjourn  It has no function  Milton Friedman would have gotten exactly what he thinks a central   bank ought to be!  To be continued  [Laughter]  President Hoenig     Do you mean “the considerable period of time” phrase?     Well, that’s a valid alternate procedure       You would go back to announcing only our action, and   you would publish the minutes fairly soon after the meeting?     With no further comment?     Then move up the publication of the minutes?     Governor Ferguson     President Guynn     What does the Bank of England do with respect to that?     I’d hate for us to spend our time doing that     As Roger said, there are certain things we can’t come back   from once we do them  This we can come back from  In other words, one of the reasons I feel   somewhat comfortable with what we have been doing is that I think monetary policy is at a   major fulcrum in the sense that clearly something different has happened in the world—general   global disinflation  It is phenomenally significant, and it alters the normal historical response of   a central bank to changes in the economic outlook  We’ve been trying to suggest to the world   that the response time is different and that the normal pattern of the way a central bank ought to   behave to maintain stability is different from in the past  But after having done that and, I hope,   succeeded—and I think we are succeeding, frankly—there’s no reason that we can’t just go back   to the preemptive policy procedure that we embarked upon a long time ago  But if we’re always   September 15, 2003 46 of 78    going to be prescriptive—if we’re always going to forecast what we’re going to do for the next   six months and lock it in, then we’re in real trouble       President Minehan     They added up the “remotes,” as I put it     No, we created a lot of them  The problem basically is   that a number of those in the market don’t listen to the subtleties; they just take note of how   much time we are spending talking about a particular subject           You’re not suggesting that we have a Politburo here that   clears everybody’s speeches?     I agree with that  The question is, what are you   recommending that we do?     First Vice President Stewart     President Moskow     President Stern     May I interrupt you for one second?     That’s a very interesting point, and we need some factual   information  In the event that we move the minutes up, a concern that has been expressed here—  I think Jack raised the issue—is that we all will start to edit the minutes more than we do now    May I just ask for a show of hands on this?  Those who would probably do more editing than   they currently do, would you please raise your hand?  Now those who would do the same   amount?  I presume nobody would do less!  [Secretary’s note Those who expressed an opinion   were about equally divided as to whether they would probably edit the minutes more intensively   or not change their current practices  Several members expressed no opinion]     September 15, 2003 53 of 78    Now, what we just saw was people’s current intentions  But it is a very interesting   question because, if Jack is right, it could be very difficult to produce the minutes more quickly    I hadn’t thought about that  It always struck me that moving forward the publication of the   minutes was strictly a staff resource question  But if an earlier release date indeed makes it more   difficult for us to produce the minutes—not just physically doing them, but getting members to   agree on the content of the minutes and especially that they accurately reflect the meeting’s   discussion—then I think we have a real problem     Continue     I agree with that  Eventually, we’ll run into trouble on   both of these issues  Not at the moment, though  We’re okay for a while because the basic point   here is that we’re trying to convey why we did what we did     Some of the boilerplate language with variations—   specifically splitting the Phillips curve into two—actually was essential for us to explain why we   did what we did     There may be an exit strategy issue that we have to   resolve      Governor Gramlich     Governor Olson     Governor Kohn     You know, I’ve always thought that sustaining meant self-  sustaining—in other words, a situation in which the gears are working in a perpetual motion    That’s closer to the “imbalances” interpretation, I would suspect  But I never thought of it in   terms of the two alternatives that you gentlemen mentioned  I always thought it meant self-  sustaining       I’m a little puzzled by it     The English language is wonderfully elastic  President   Poole   September 15, 2003 59 of 78      That’s a very interesting point     Governor Bies     And the speeches are scheduled three months in advance     That sounds like a forecast to me     Let me get a clarification  If in clarifying the language we   use straight declarative sentences, I think we’d be making statements as to what we think is   going to happen and not what we see as a risk     My impression is, and I may be mistaken on this, that the   very act of writing declarative sentences forces you to take a position of stipulating something   quite specific  Falling back to a probabilistic Bayesian type of language seems to be fuzzying up   the statements, but that’s exactly what we’re trying to do to create a sense that these are   probabilities and not certainties  I don’t think there’s any question that clear language is superior   to Bayesian language, but can we be that clear without inadvertently making a forecast?       Let me make a request  Take the last statement and the   one we’re going to use tomorrow and rewrite them  Take a look at it because I’m curious about   how you would do it   September 15, 2003 63 of 78      That’s exactly the reason that I ask     Take a shot at it and see what you come up with     President McTeer     President Santomero     Governor Bernanke     President Pianalto     Well, thank you very much  We’ve gone around the table,   and I must say to you that my impression was that more substantive issues were put on the table   than I had expected and, indeed, potentially more conclusions  I think it’s fairly evident that   there are generally two schools that are emerging  One is the de minimis alternative, which I   gather we can do without objection, of making the language in the directive conform exactly to   the language in the statement  That is something that everyone could acquiesce to, which would   strike me as a way to solve one immediate problem  We thank the President of the San   Francisco Bank   Also, I believe we have covered the issue of the relationship between the statement and   the minutes in a very productive manner—identifying the possible tradeoffs or alternatives and   the like  Finally, the issue that has been raised on this side of the table about stress-testing is an   important one  Tomorrow we will do what we have to do to have continuity from the previous   meetings  But I do agree with the point that Mike Moskow raised—that when we begin to   observe an economy that is starting to heat up, the language we have now isn’t going to work    To be sure, we have a communication agenda topic scheduled for our January meeting, but I say   to you that that’s too late  I think we ought to ask the staff to indeed stress-test some language—  not for tomorrow’s meeting but for the meeting thereafter—so that we’ll get some knowledge of   alternatives as to how we might exit from the current situation under various scenarios  I never   thought of the term “stress-test,” but it has a certain analogy to what we’re looking at here, which   I think actually works     September 15, 2003 69 of 78    In conjunction with that, we ought to do what I mentioned to Susan, for example  I hope   that she can find some words that do not have a probabilistic character—which is always   confusing to the average person—and yet avoid a forecast  That’s going to be a tricky problem,   and I’m not sure that it is resolvable  My own view—and if it turn outs that I’m wrong, that’s all   the better—is that we can’t get away from the probabilistic language because indeed that’s the   kind of world in which we live  Trying to make a deterministic world out of a Bayesian world   just isn’t doable     Therefore, I think we ought to implement as soon as we can the proposal to get the same   wording in both the instructions to the Desk and in the statement we make to the public  As   quickly as possible, we should try to formulate the actual phraseologies that we might use as the   economic conditions evolve and in the event of certain developments in the marketplace  We’re   all presuming as a given, with no possibility of error, that so long as the output gap stays open   the rate of inflation will fall  Well, as I’ve said to many of you, I remember well that people held   that view even more strongly in the late 1960s; and it was only a very few years later that we   realized it was wrong, when nobody could explain how it was possible that inflation was rising   with a very large gap remaining  Indeed, stagflation was something that was not conceivable in   the standard Keynesian models that we all adhered to before the 1970s  So we ought to   recognize that, and as firmly as we believe we understand the way the economy is growing, we   should make contingencies for it to move in exactly the opposite direction  I think that would   serve us well   So I would suggest that we move forward and try to communicate between meetings, not   necessarily with an actual meeting, but with memoranda from Vincent on various alternatives   and soliciting people’s views  This is not something we’re going to have to implement at the   September 15, 2003 70 of 78    next meeting  But we have to start thinking about how we’re going to phase out of where we   are, as indeed we’re going to have to do at some point   So I thank you all for a very thoughtful discussion  It has been quite useful  Unless   somebody has some closing remarks, let’s call it a night and convene in the Board Room at   900 am tomorrow    END OF MEETING   September 15, 2003 71 of 78       Good morning, everyone  I’d like to point out before we   get started that today is the last FOMC meeting for Gary Gillum, who as you may know has been   a member of the Secretariat for the past fifteen years and is completing forty years of service in   government, twenty-three of them at the Board  I was informed very late in the game that he is   the only economist in the Federal Reserve with a degree in metallurgy  [Laughter]  And when I   think of all of the questions I’ve had on metallurgy!  [Laughter]  I’m actually not joking  I had   this big fat book on the shaping and making of steel; it was so large that if you could lift it, you’d   win a prize—and here we had a resource of which I was never even aware  The Federal Reserve,   I think, is startling in all respects  In any event, Gary, we wish you well in your new endeavors   [Applause]  If you get back into metallurgy, let me know     The first item on the agenda is the minutes  This is usually boilerplate, as somebody said   last night, but it isn’t this morning  We have to discuss a proposed addition to the minutes,   which relates to the special session that we had last evening  I call upon President Parry     I know our objectives are for sustainable long-term   economic growth and price stability, but is either objective itself only long term?  I think each   goal is ongoing  “Long term” may mean we’re not always focused on our objectives but only in   the longer term  Is that what you mean?   September 16, 2003 3 of 106      Well, maybe I’m splitting hairs  But an objective is by its   nature something that one seeks  We’re always seeking long-term sustainable growth      That’s what I’m trying to get at  I’m just being a nitpicker      Well, it could be wrong!  [Laughter]     But is it a virtue to be consistently wrong?     Well, I’m going to appoint a committee to relook at those   two sentences!  [Laughter]  Does anyone disagree with what I just said?     I think our ongoing, unchangeable objective is to seek   long-term stability, defined in terms of prices and other things   September 16, 2003 4 of 106      It’s not standard  I know exactly what it is that we want to   do  I’m not so sure what the appropriate English terminology is       Yes  The substantive point is that an objective is an   absolute and invariant to the issue of time  And that objective is to seek sustainable economic   growth over the long run  Now, I don’t know what the appropriate wording—     Yes     No, I admit that there is a problem in the wording of the   Federal Reserve Act as well       I think for the moment the answer is that we should review   it but not change it here  It doesn’t add to anything except the level of confusion  Is that   acceptable?  President Minehan     Well, what do you want to do by raising your hand?     There’s also another consideration  Suppose we conclude   that we don’t think any changes are necessary?     Does anybody object to that?     Does that seem adequate to you?     I agree with that     Yes   SEVERAL  That would be good     President Poole     That’s what keeps Michelle employed!     Well, that may restrict us  We may actually want to make   changes before January, so I’m not sure your proposal is a good idea  Look, press questions do   not strike me as an insurmountable barrier for us to move forward in what we’re trying to say on   this issue  If there were no questions, that would mean people were not interested in what we are   doing  So let’s take it as a positive if they ask a lot of questions  Let’s use this particular   discussion as a definitive example of why it is not in fact possible, as Cathy Minehan says, to   edit anything serious with nineteen people  The length of this is maybe one-twentieth of a   September 16, 2003 8 of 106    communiqué  It’s scary  Let me ask if what we have worked out here is acceptable  Does   anyone want it reread?  What is the Committee’s wish?     Why don’t we just read the final sentence       Okay, why don’t we wrap it up?  Would somebody,   therefore, like to move approval of the minutes?     Without objection  Dino, you’re on     On the chart showing the European ten-year government   yields, why are the UK yields so persistently higher than those on the continent?     It’s a remarkably stable spread   September 16, 2003 13 of 106      I doubt it     It can’t be the heavy mortgage borrowing because that’s   all floating, as I recall     I like Karen’s explanation better than yours  Yours may   be true, but I don’t—     Further questions?  Yes     Further questions?  If not, would somebody like to move   to ratify the domestic open market transactions?     I want to make sure that the changes in the second   paragraph in the statement are acceptable  Is that correct?  Nobody has commented on them    Also, in the third paragraph we have said “remains” the predominant concern rather than “is   September 16, 2003 94 of 106    likely to be” the predominant concern  Is that acceptable to everybody?  Does everyone know   what I’m referring to?  The “remains” is about three lines up from the bottom in the marked-up   version of the draft  Okay, I will assume that there are no objections to those changes  Please   call the roll     Our next meeting is October 28  Let me just say that I will   be appearing before the House Budget Committee before then  If it turns out that there is a need   for us to communicate something officially, I could do it then, having preceded it with a   telephone conference of the Committee  I don’t think that will be necessary, but I wanted to note   that conditions in the economy might be changing faster than we anticipate and, if that’s the case,   we have a vehicle that could be used to put a Committee view out on the table  Let’s go to   lunch   END OF MEETING   September 16, 2003 95 of 106        Without objection, they are approved  Dave Stockton and   Karen Johnson, please     I notice that consumer spending in the first part of   September seems to have sagged from the August levels  We know that motor vehicle sales   came off their hyper highs of the latter part of last month; and while the data released this   morning on chain store sales are not weak, sales clearly slowed recently  Since we have fairly   explicit federal government tax adjustments day-by-day through the months of July and August   and into September, do we have enough information at this stage to infer the marginal propensity   to spend from the reduced withholding and the two large payments, the childcare credit and the   refunds?     What would you call the relationship between the tax   reductions and spending?     September 16, 2003 21 of 106      It is true, however, that the big cash flow effect from the   tax cut was in July and August and not in September  Is that correct?     I’m really raising the question of whether the weakening   in sales in September is a coincidence or possibly a reflection of that phenomenon     We were getting sales at a 172 million annual rate in July    That’s the total of autos and light trucks  They were 163 in the previous couple of months      So what you’re basically saying is that there has to have   been a big increase in personal saving for July, if I can put it that way, and that obscures   whatever effect one can pick up from the tax cut?     Governor Gramlich     President Parry     President Poole     You know, these actually are two separate ways of looking   at a forecast  Incidentally, my recollection is that in 1994 or 1995 the forward funds rate was   extremely high—well above 6 percent—so that would have been an even more important   differentiating factor then  There is no doubt that using the approach President Poole is   suggesting results in a consistency between the forecast and the yield curve as it goes out to   two-year rates, four-year rates, and ten-year rates  Because of the anomaly of those rates being   September 16, 2003 27 of 106    embodied in intermediate interest rates now, our assumption that we will keep the funds rate flat   for a very protracted period of time leads one to the conclusion of necessity that the long-term   rates have to come down  So we have this odd problem of choosing between two paths, both of   which are uncomfortable  I’m uncomfortable making a forecast out a year from now about what   long-term rates are going to do  That’s a loser’s game, I think  But there is the other side, as   Dave points out, in that there have been fairly significant periods when the forward federal funds   rate was way beyond any level I ever would have anticipated going toward—and indeed in the   end we didn’t   These are two different types of ways of looking at the outlook  In one we have to adjust   the long-term rates because they are inconsistent  In the other we get a future level of short-term   rates that no one in this room has any interest in implementing  So I don’t think there’s a   solution here, and there are arguments for both sides, I think       Historically, the usual issue was whether the staff should   make a forecast with an unchanged funds rate, giving the Committee the evaluation of what   would happen if we didn’t change anything  So I think this procedure of doing several separate   simulations probably is the only way out  I’ve noticed that nobody has raised the question in   recent meetings of holding the funds rate unchanged throughout the forecast period to give the   September 16, 2003 28 of 106    Committee a sense of where the pressures lie  We decided that that isn’t very helpful  In any   case, I think there is no real solution to this, and I’m not sure that it matters all that much so long   as we know the premises underlying the federal funds rate forecast     President Broaddus   September 16, 2003 29 of 106      President Moskow     President Minehan     Any further questions for our colleagues?  If not, who   would like to start the roundtable?  President Hoenig     President Guynn     President Santomero     President Minehan     First Vice President Stewart     President Parry     President Moskow     President Stern   September 16, 2003 50 of 106      President Poole     Why don’t we break for coffee and come back in 10 to   12½ minutes  [Laughter]   [Coffee break]     President Broaddus, please     I was just saying that hurricanes usually destroy things and   that the reconstruction, when it takes place, adds to the GDP     President Pianalto     Governor Kohn     Governor Ferguson     Governor Gramlich     President McTeer      Governor Olson     Governor Bernanke     Vincent Reinhart     Do you want to revise these charts?                                                       3 The materials used by Mr Reinhart are appended to this transcript (appendix 2)   September 16, 2003 74 of 106      Questions for Vincent?  If not, let me proceed  As I   listened to the comments around the table, I noted something that is self-evident in a way but that   we really ought to think about  I observed that the correlation between the regional reports at the   previous meeting and those at this meeting is extraordinarily high and virtually everyone’s   assessment of regional economic conditions moved to about the same extent  In effect, that is   telling us that we have a truly national market  That was not the case fifty years ago  Back then,   mortgage interest rates were 50 basis points higher on the West Coast than on the East Coast;   and if we go back even further to the early years of the Federal Reserve System, we find   different discount rates at the Federal Reserve Banks around the country  It is important to   recognize that we have a unified national market, even though we may take it for granted  The   reason it matters is the same as the reason that the increase in globalization matters     Over the last decade or so we have seen a fairly dramatic rise in globalization That   development coupled with significant deregulation and major technological advances in the   United States, as I’ve commented previously, has led to a marked increase in competition; that   increase has been slow but persistent and more and more evident as the years have passed  This   growth in competition and the related evidence on disinflation are clearly a global, not a national,   phenomenon  Inflation has been falling everywhere  So it is not idiosyncratic to the United   States but is occurring increasingly throughout the globalized world economy    In my view we are seeing a different type of phenomenon with respect to the inflation   and disinflation process than we saw in previous cyclical periods  I don’t know at what point the   September 16, 2003 78 of 106    accelerating pace of globalization began to occur, but I do think its emergence bears critically on   the reason we favor maintaining our accommodative policy posture for a significant period of   time  All this is unlike what we would have done in previous cyclical periods, when the first   signs of accelerating economic activity would have led us to move aggressively to tighten   monetary policy    We are not likely to tighten quickly  Indeed, the evidence in support of that conclusion is   clear even among those of you who are questioning, and probably correctly so, how much weight   we should place on the gap analysis and on expectations that inflation will stay near its current   low level  I think our general view is that inflation is probably going to stay down  There is no   evidence of a break in the disinflationary forces  Those forces may be diminishing, and indeed   they may be in the process of being gradually contained, but if so this process clearly is a fairly   lengthy one   This raises the obvious question of whether we are observing an ongoing trend  I suspect   the answer to that is “no”  We’re getting all sorts of indications, regrettably including an   important one just yesterday, that the process of globalization is slowing down  We had a   breakdown yesterday in the WTO negotiations  Protectionism is emerging in this country in   areas where it was not evident previously  Recent developments indicate that the politics of   protectionism, which were fairly well contained as the economy moved through the whole   deregulation-technology period, are beginning to surface in a variety of places  If indeed this   political trend continues to strengthen, then the competition that has been holding down the price   level will begin to weaken  As that occurs, we can expect inflationary pressures to reemerge     I think it’s important for us to recognize that we may be going through what I suspect is a   unique period  I think policy has been adjusting to that development over the years and very   September 16, 2003 79 of 106    specifically in the most recent year  My own judgment is that the current situation is not   permanent  It is a transitional phase that has led us away from a fairly high degree of regulation   and control and has fostered a very significant shift away from the old views regarding the   regulatory structure  Many observers once perceived that structure to be appropriate, though I   exclude myself from that judgment     The bottom line in all of this—and what I think emerged in our discussion last evening—  is the recognition of the need to begin to think about where we should go from here  The next   step is clearly either to confront serious disinflation, which has been our concern through most of   this year or, what I see as far more likely, to move away from that concern  As Vincent   mentioned, we ought to think about an exit strategy that will let us find our way back to a more   conventional Federal Reserve policy     In retrospect, I think it was a mistake to include a sentence in our press statement in   August indicating that an accommodative policy can be maintained for a considerable period  It   may not have created an immediate problem, but I don’t think we should be judging policy in   terms of any fixed time frame  Instead, it should be judged with respect to the process of   implementing our objectives  As Vincent just suggested, we need to begin to consider how we   will work our way out of this  Rephrasing the sentence in the press statement, as he put it, is a   way out because we could readily translate “considerable period” into the notion of a “process”   that involves a change in the disinflationary outlook  If we decide to introduce the notion of such   a process in our statement today by adding a reference to the containment of disinflationary   forces, we could drop the “considerable period” from our statement at the next meeting but retain   the new reference  We would then be in a position to drop that new reference at a later time   when we perceive that disinflation is no longer a significant concern  In fact, initiating that   September 16, 2003 80 of 106    approach is what I would like to recommend today, namely to retain the balance of risks   statements exactly as we had them in August, with the sole exception of adding to the   “considerable period” statement a reference to its process equivalent relating to our effort to   contain disinflation     In sum, what I would like to put on the table for a vote is holding the funds rate   unchanged and retaining the balance of risks language we had the last time, with this minor   change  The statement, if you go along with this, would be exactly the same as our last   statement apart from some updating of the economic references and the addition of a reference to   the containment of disinflationary forces to the existing sentence relating to the maintenance of   policy accommodation for a “considerable period”  Before we vote, I would like to distribute the   draft of the statement so you can see what it looks like  Governor Gramlich     That’s not true  You had a single the last time!       But that’s different from this draft in the sense that I’m   using the term “considerable period” so it’s not changed and then redefining it  What you’re   doing involves moving faster than I think is wise to do     We’ve used such sentences before  Is that okay?   September 16, 2003 81 of 106      Governor Ferguson     President Minehan     President Poole     May I make a suggestion?  You know, that’s not bad   phraseology for our statement two meetings from now  That’s where we are going  I just don’t   think we gain very much by moving in that direction too soon  In fact, I’m sure that we probably   lose something  But keep that phraseology in mind  That’s not a bad way to say what we mean        President Parry   September 16, 2003 84 of 106      President Santomero     Governor Kohn   September 16, 2003 85 of 106      President Hoenig     First Vice President Stewart     President Stern     President Pianalto     President Guynn     I must tell you that I’m listening to all of this, and I agree   that it is an awkward statement  Essentially there are really two choices  One, we can literally   stay with exactly what we had in our previous statement and try to figure out another form of exit   strategy  Or two, we can go with the proposed new language  But if there are any doubts about   the clarity of this new sentence—and I quickly acknowledge that there are—I think there’s a   valid point to be raised here about using the new sentence  President Moskow     You weren’t raising an urgency of doing it today, were   you, Don?     You’re supporting the sentence as proposed?   September 16, 2003 89 of 106      Well, I hope you’re right  President Broaddus     Governor Bies     Governor Olson   September 16, 2003 91 of 106      President McTeer     Governor Bernanke     When we eventually get to that point, I think that’s where   we’ll be in terms of conveying our assessment of the situation       Yes, we start by getting the first difference, and then when   we get to zero, we meld into it the concept of muted risks to inflation       Well, that depends in part on how we change the statement   as we go forward  That is the reason I thought the issue of the stress-test that Mike Moskow was   raising last night was the right one  Governor Gramlich     That is a good argument  President Hoenig     That’s where I’m coming out as well, I must tell you     On this issue I think the argument for doing nothing has   won the day  There’s also another marginal issue here  The data for the last week or two are not   incorporated in the forecast presented in the Greenbook  There’s a somewhat edgy element in   those data, which I will grant you is more consistent with leaving the statement alone on the   grounds that we will have another month to play with the wording  So as far as I’m concerned,   the argument for leaving the statement unchanged wins, and I would make that recommendation    Incidentally, for the next meeting we ought to make sure that the statement on the balance of   risks in the draft press release is the same as in the Bluebook  We don’t have time to fix that   today, so you’ll have to bear with me on this temporary problem  But we’ll get rid the   inconsistencies  Would you read the inappropriate language!     We’re ready to start our meeting  Would somebody like to   move the minutes of the September meeting?     Thank you  Without objection they are approved  Dino,   you’re on     It looks as though each of the two types of intervention   operations had some modest effect on the exchange rate and, when combined, that disappears    Do I infer from what you’re saying that the two earlier MOF regimes actually had some modest   effect on the exchange rate but the combined method did not?     I knew you wouldn’t!  [Laughter]     It’s even arguable as to whether it’s sterilized     I’ve been wondering out loud recently whether the   extraordinarily significant bias on the part of commercial banks and households in Japan not to   engage in a significant way in the purchase of foreign assets—far more so than is true in the   October 28, 2003 6 of 126    world at large—is a factor  Does carrying that over into the international exchange market create   a bias in favor of the yen?  If so, that essentially means that the equilibrium price of the yen vis-  à-vis the dollar would tend to be higher than would ordinarily be the case if there were capital   flows more reminiscent of what we’ve seen in the past in Europe and the United States     My second question relates to the issue of how the foreign   exchange markets are functioning  There is considerable bias in forecasts currently toward a   weaker dollar, largely as a consequence of the rising US current account deficit  Yet we’re all   taught, and the markets seem to suggest, that the spot rate captures all of the forward supply and   demand as well as the spot through arbitrage operations  Largely because of the over-the-  counter derivatives market one can go out ten, fifteen years in any of these major currencies    Consequently there is an arbitraging interaction along the maturity schedule of forward contracts,   which ultimately fixes the spot rate  If that is indeed the case, it suggests that all market   knowledge is effectively embodied in the spot rate and that, therefore, forecasting a change is a   contradiction in terms  Is it correct to say that these foreign exchange markets are sufficiently   sophisticated and deep that essentially all of the information is embodied in the spot rate so that   forecasting is based on the presumption that one knows something that the market does not   know?   October 28, 2003 7 of 126      Algebraically I don’t necessarily agree with you  In other   words, let’s say we have an aggregate supply and demand for a commodity—the reasoning   works the same way for a commodity—with segregation with respect to the time frame  There is   a sense in which the aggregate supply and demand equate to get an average price, and that term   structure is essentially a function of the different levels of supply and demand along that period   spectrum     I’m not saying what pins it down; I’m just saying that it   exists  Algebraically you have enough observations to solve the problem   October 28, 2003 8 of 126      That’s all I’m saying     I don’t know what those words mean     Well, I’m just saying that there is a futures price for   lumber  And I would submit that all along the curve of the futures market for lumber is in effect   an arbitraging operation, which is fixed at a level that encompasses the aggregate demand and   supply all the way out on the futures curve     I acknowledge that the markets can’t predict; that’s the   problem  But unless somebody insists that this issue is important to the decision we have to   October 28, 2003 9 of 126    make today, [laughter] I think you and I should go in the corner of the room later and argue this   out with each other     That’s all I have  Does anybody else want to ask a   question?     Anybody else?     If there are no further questions, would somebody like to   move to ratify the domestic open market operations?       Okay, that sounds good  Is that satisfactory to everybody?    Good, let’s go to lunch     [Lunch break]     Let’s turn to Vincent Reinhart     Why don’t you put each question on the table and ask for   comments    Certainly     I think we have to be a little careful here because there is a   prerequisite to this discussion that we don’t talk about, namely how much can we rationally   October 28, 2003 89 of 126    expect monetary policy to do  If we believe that monetary policy has the capability of affecting   the economy incrementally in all sorts of ways—to create whatever level of unemployment,   GDP growth, and inflation we choose—and we can implement policies that will accomplish such   objectives, then I can see announcing very explicit target levels  My problem with that type of   policy commitment is that it promises far more than monetary policy has the capacity to deliver    We have to be very careful about what we set up as our goals; we need to make sure that they are   reachable goals  If we say, for example, that our goal is to get the unemployment rate down to   46 percent with a growth rate in GDP that would close the output gap by X percent or something   like that, that’s all well and good  But do we actually have the capacity to accomplish that?  My   answer is that we most certainly do not  Now, if indeed the e-mails you’re getting come from   members who believe that we can, that’s an important issue  We have to stay within the bounds   of what we believe this Committee can do, and I just want to make sure that that is explicitly   recognized before we go further     Indeed, I think everyone does that because we all have our   own objectives and hence when we vote we make policy decisions based on those objectives    Implicitly we all do that, or else we would not be able to come to a conclusion  What I’m   arguing against is the capacity of the members of this Committee to have a similar view on all of   the goals We really can’t achieve that sort of unanimity—a majority determines it—because   each individual member has to be free to make a final judgment on the basis of whatever   conceptual framework he or she has with respect to the economy  If we all had the same   conceptual framework, I will acknowledge that the proposition you are arguing would enhance   our transparency  But frankly, knowing all the members of this Committee, I think we’d have   trouble getting a philosophical agreement among all nineteen people on how the economy works   to the degree that is required to formulate monetary policy  I’d say that would be very difficult    Governor Ferguson     President Guynn     President Hoenig     President Parry   October 28, 2003 95 of 126      This is a minor issue because we can readily do what Bob   is saying in that context     The trouble is that, when you run into a problem, you tend   to add adjectives and adverbs to any statement      And it becomes the oyster that Jack’s been chewing on!    [Laughter]  President Poole     Sure     Governor Bernanke     Actually, that option should be on the table  Where I have   a problem with what you’re saying is this  The notion that disinflation is unwelcome at this   October 28, 2003 99 of 126    juncture is a value judgment all of us share  As I indicated to Ned, if we all agree that the   desirable level of unemployment is X, then that’s in the same category  If we can stipulate that   we agree on the desirable level for every one of the goals, what you’re suggesting can work  I’m   basically saying that we’re not going to achieve that  And to try to do it when it’s patently   unattainable I think will waste a lot of the Committee’s time  It’s not that in principle it’s bad  I   just think it’s utterly unachievable  Governor Kohn     President Broaddus     President Minehan     Governor Olson     But he goes far beyond what you just said     He has specific numbers  We just voted on instructions to   the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in which we used exactly the kind of language you’re   talking about  In fact that happens to be an issue on which we all agree  So we can use that sort   of language  But I think Ned is trying to get something more specific than that  He’s trying to   put in hard numbers or get something more conclusive than a vague notion of what is maximum   sustainable growth  If we all agreed on what that number was, then we could do it  But that’s   not going to happen     Ned, am I misinterpreting what you said?     Well, then tell me what I’ve said wrong     Well, the question is whether in fact in the real world that   is capable of being achieved     Okay, I withdraw my negative comment  President   Moskow     That would solve a lot of problems     The obvious problem is that if we release the minutes   earlier we’ll find that the whole Committee is going to want to get involved in editing them   Theoretically, in my judgment, earlier publication of the minutes is the ideal solution to our   communication dilemma if we could find a way to ensure that we can produce a document that is   comparable in terms of quality to what we do now  I don’t know what types of comments   Vincent gets on the draft minutes  But looking at the changes, there are very few  If that indeed   is the kind of document we would get two weeks after the meeting, we could consider it the   major vehicle for communication  I think the value of that is overwhelming compared with our   October 28, 2003 107 of 126    mincing the language the way we’re trying to mince it in our press release  Maybe we ought to   think of a way to do that       Yes, that’s correct  That’s the issue  Nevertheless, the   minutes are not bad now  I think they do describe conceptually what we are doing     If we could find a way to group the members into a   constant alignment of similarly minded people, each group could assign one person as a   representative to the editing committee  Then we could have a small group of people sitting   around editing  I wouldn’t suggest that that’s about to happen     We’d stipulate what action we took     There’s going to be an explanation, two or three sentences     Yes     Well, we really ought to explore that       Why don’t you try to do the minutes earlier for this   particular meeting?  [Laughter]  This is the easiest meeting for which you’ll be able to do   minutes  It will give you the baseline of how close you can get to an actual implementation of   the early release option     We’re running out of allocated time at this particular   moment  May I suggest, in order to move this process forward, that in conjunction with the   Secretariat, we will appoint a committee of Governors and Presidents—an estimable group if   they wish to join—and see whether or not we can at least narrow this down  We actually   narrowed it down some today  It appeared to me that, if we could find a way to solve the   problem of drafting and editing the minutes more quickly, that solution of releasing the minutes   earlier would carry the day in this Committee  Am I correct in that?   SEVERAL  Yes     But there are problems in doing that  Maybe we can learn   some things from the British experience and find a mechanism that will enable us to succeed in   accomplishing that  One possibility—I'm just throwing ideas out in the air—is that at the late   January meeting, when we vote on a number of things, we could vote on an editing committee    In other words, we could appoint a subgroup of this Committee that for the coming year   basically would be charged with the drafting requirements of the minutes  The interesting point   about that is that to make it work we cannot go back to the full FOMC for a decision on the   minutes because if that happens then it becomes a wholly indeterminate process  I’m just   throwing out that possibility  There has to be some constraint on the exercise of democracy in   this group if we’re going to achieve this goal  The question is what constraints we are willing to   impose on ourselves  Currently we all have the opportunity for a complete input  It is true   statutorily that only twelve of us can vote, but that has scarcely been evident in the discussions   October 28, 2003 110 of 126    within this Committee  If somebody has a good idea even if he or she does not have a vote, that   idea may weigh more heavily in the final deliberations than the comments of someone who is a   voting member  So I think we’ve got to do something along the lines I suggested   May I have the Committee’s acceptance of a notion to set up a subcommittee or working   group that will move forward on this subject from where we are?  Perhaps when there is   something to report Vincent could send out a note  And the conclusion of that note may well be   that we ought to have a phone conference  Incidentally, we now have a videoconferencing   system  It worked very well at the Dallas meeting  Why don’t we do videoconferencing FOMC   calls?  Is there a reason at the moment why we wouldn’t?     I venture to say that there’s a solution to that  We are   approaching the bewitching hour, and to make sure that Michelle does not tell a falsehood about   when our meeting ended, we’re going to have to bring this session to a close  Regrettably, I have   on my list five people who wanted to speak and were not able to do so  But if there is a next   meeting on this, the five of you will get priority even if you’ve forgotten what you wanted to   say!  I’ll give the list to the Secretary  With that, the meeting is adjourned   END OF MEETING   October 28, 2003 111 of 126        Without objection  We turn now to Dave Stockton and   Karen Johnson     David, I see you don’t have an estimate for real adjusted   durable goods for September yet  Do you have a sense of the order of magnitude?  The reason I   raise the issue is that the extraordinary difference between total durable goods and real adjusted   durable goods for the month of August—   October 28, 2003 18 of 126     I’ve found it to be a very useful statistic over the years, and   I’d like to get a sense of it  President Hoenig     President Moskow     President Parry     President Stern     President Minehan     President Poole     President Santomero     May I just add to that?  You emphasized before that we’re   dealing with a linear model  How many observations do we have that indicate that, as the   inflation rate moves down, the marginal changes in the gap are indeed linear?  Or are we   possibly looking at a situation in which the model works fine with an inflation rate over   2 percent and, indeed, is linear up to 11 percent or something like that but the number of   observations we have below 2 percent is really quite small?  I was curious whether or not you   have any sense as to whether we’re dealing with a different regime in the same sense as when a   particle approaches the speed of light its characteristics change  Now, I scarcely want to draw   that as an analogy to your model, but there are such regimes, and basically I suspect that a   problem like that may be involved here       David, do you think that the revisions in the NIPA data   could significantly alter our view about some of the key relationships we’re now taking as being   fitted with some robustness?  The BEA doesn’t have new data on the most recent periods, does   it?   October 28, 2003 30 of 126      Isn’t the latter the most likely problem because that figure   is a residual and often has been revised far more substantially than the other elements of the   system?      Further questions for our colleagues?  If not, who would   like to start off the Committee’s discussion?  President Moskow      President Parry     First Vice President Stewart     President Poole     President McTeer     President Minehan     Thank you  Let’s break for coffee for ten to fifteen   minutes   [Coffee break]     President Guynn     President Hoenig   October 28, 2003 49 of 126      President Broaddus     President Santomero     President Pianalto     President Stern     Governor Kohn     Governor Gramlich     Governor Ferguson   October 28, 2003 64 of 126      Governor Olson     Governor Bies     Governor Bernanke     Thank you very much  We now go to Vincent Reinhart     Thank you  Questions for Vincent?     Just remember, if you want to parse words, “unwelcome   disinflation” is part of disinflation  You can size it however you so choose  That’s what our   communication problem is getting us into  Further questions for Vincent?  President Santomero     President Minehan     Further questions for Vincent?  If not, let me just say that   Cathy is raising a general concern that I think we all share  One can see it by trying to use   language to calibrate mechanisms that are digital  Every technician will tell you that that leads   you nowhere  In any event, we’re going to get a clarification of the outlook in the next couple of   months, and it will be significant in the sense that Christmas sales will be a fundamental test of   consumer attitudes going forward  That will resolve the issue of what part of the tax cut actually   was spent in the third quarter—75 percent according to Goldman Sachs, significantly less   October 28, 2003 79 of 126    according to most others  We’ll know that by the time of the January meeting  The labor   markets are either turning or they’re not  The evidence suggests that they are, but again, we’ll   need more time to make that judgment  Obviously capital spending is a crucial issue, and that is   apparently improving  Again the question is, if I may use a new term, whether it is “slogging”   away  [Pause]  There are not many foreign policy buffs around this table!  [Laughter]     If it turns out that the economy, after going through this   recent surge, simmers down very dramatically and indeed exhibits weakness, then from a policy   point of view we’re obviously well positioned at this stage  I think a weakening in economic   activity is unlikely  I believe it’s more likely that evidence of an old-fashioned business cycle   expansion is beginning to emerge  The pieces are falling into place  Some are little things like   the upward revisions to profits, which have been exceptionally extensive  We haven’t seen   anything like these numbers since the height of the boom back in the 1990s  We’re seeing for   the first time this year an uptick in the long-term outlook for earnings per share     Unlike in previous periods, the economy is moving forward largely on the basis of final   demand, as I think Dave mentioned  There is no question that in July and August firms were   liquidating inventories, and the data we have for September confirm that the liquidation   continued through the end of the quarter  My recollection is that, when I saw the original   Greenbook projection that had inventory liquidation continuing through the rest of the year, I   was incredulous  I was even incredulous about it continuing in the third quarter  But clearly   that’s what we’re seeing  Indeed, the data on durable goods inventories for manufacturing   confirmed that this morning  It is probably the case that motor vehicle inventories did rise in   October, just judging from the falloff in sales  But there is no evidence as yet to suggest any   October 28, 2003 80 of 126    significant inventory accumulation, and in a way that’s probably good rather than bad because   we’re looking forward to an acceleration  Purchasing managers at manufacturing firms, who are   probably best positioned to have a sense of whether their customers’ inventories are high or low,   are reporting that they are extraordinarily low  Since all inventories by definition are produced   by manufacturers, with the exception of a few items in mining, lumber, and the like, these people   are very focused on the process  Basically they are saying that the inventory situation is getting   tighter and tighter  So there’s an upside risk here, which is something we have not seen for quite   a substantial period of time     If the economy starts to heat up, obviously we’re going to have to create a credible exit   strategy from maintaining an accommodative stance for a considerable period  We have a lot of   alternatives, and maybe that’s part of the problem  We may have just too many widgets to push   and too many permutations and combinations with nineteen people to get any single set of views     I think we could remind the market that we first used the term “accommodative” in early   2002 when we moved the funds rate down to 175 percent  Bob Parry has raised that issue   publicly  He got a lot of attention  [Laughter]  Anything that anybody on this Committee says   gets a lot of attention, largely because the truth of the matter is that we are in uncharted waters    In our personal experiences we have never been at a point when the inflation rate for all practical   purposes is zero  We have reached price stability  In previous periods when the economy was   turning and inflation rates were 3, 4, or 5 percent, a preemptive policy move made a lot of sense    But what are we preempting from when inflation is effectively at zero?  What that means is that   we have a lot of time to sit and watch the process going forward  But as Ben Bernanke pointed   out, one possible explanation of what the markets are doing is that they are merely replicating   our past behavior, which is called backward-looking analysis  I think that’s right  That’s what   October 28, 2003 81 of 126    markets always do  It is going to be a fascinating process if this economy, as is most likely,   begins to show far greater signs of underlying strength and sustainability  We’re going to have   to work our way through to determining where we need to be on the funds rate   I ought to emphasize that we have a number of ways of doing that  Obviously, the   accommodation issue can be redefined  We can return to an assessment of balanced inflation   risks  We can say that the risks to sustainable growth are on the upside  Or we can rephrase how   we state the balance of risks  And we can make all of the adjustments with different timing  For   example, there’s no reason that we cannot start raising the short-term funds rate and still have the   next sentence of our statement indicate that we will remain accommodative for a considerable   period of time  Or we can decide to drop that statement at the first stage   But let me emphasize this  The bottom line is that we should have the policy that is the   right policy  If we actually allow this whole question of who says what and how the press will   read it—whether it’s up, down, or sideways—to affect our judgment regarding the   implementation of the optimum policy, we are making a very bad mistake  The people out there   who are in either the cheering or the booing section know less than we do, and they demonstrate   that periodically  Whenever I suspect otherwise they dissuade me!  [Laughter]   So the first thing we have to do is to decide what we want to do  Then as a wholly   separate exercise we need to determine how we want to explain it, in what manner, and to whom    If we intermix these two issues, we’re making a very bad mistake  If we allow the movement in   rates to reflect how we expect markets to respond, we’re going to find that we all presumed that   if we move X the markets will respond Y, but in fact when we move X the markets will do   something else  We can’t be sure how the markets will respond  There is no solution to that   October 28, 2003 82 of 126    dilemma  In my view, we have to keep that in mind in the discussion we’re going to have   shortly  We have to separate policy from communication     Having said that, we do have to determine what we want to say in our press statement   after we decide what we want to do on policy  I agree with those around the table who have   cautioned against doing anything significantly different today  I say that because I have no idea   how the markets will respond  I know everyone has his or her own view about that, and I   appreciate that  But anybody who says he has a clue about how the market will react is in my   judgment expressing a lack of knowledge    As far as I’m concerned, the policy issue today is straightforward  I think there’s no issue   with respect to the appropriate policy  Policy is actually working well  It’s hard to remember   this, but not too long ago we were looking at the possibility of an awesome downside on the   inflation rate, and we weren’t sure we had the tools to deal with it  We know exactly what to do   on the upside  We may not get it right, but we know what to do  As a consequence, we may   have looked at the Greenbook forecast six months ago and asked what Dave Stockton was   smoking  Well, whatever it was, it was pretty good!  [Laughter]   My bottom line is that at this stage we have to make minor adjustments in the first   paragraph  We can’t talk about weak labor markets; we need to say we’re in a period where   they’ve stabilized or something like that  But I’d just leave the rest of the wording alone and   ship it out and go work on something else  That is my recommendation, and I’d be interested in   your reactions  President Hoenig     President Poole, what do we do about the shovel?    [Laughter]     I meant to say that, and I don’t think I said it explicitly    We really ought to have the simulated exit strategy spelled out in full detail before we take the   first step  We have to know where we want to end up under various conditions so that we don’t   find ourselves as perpetual ditch diggers  President Broaddus     Governor Ferguson     President Santomero   October 28, 2003 84 of 126      President Minehan      Governor Kohn     President Parry     President Guynn     President Stern     First Vice President Stewart     Governor Bernanke     Governor Bies     Governor Olson     President Moskow     President Pianalto     Would the Secretary read the appropriate language?     Call the roll please     Our next meeting is Tuesday, December 9 Excuse me, I   forgot to mention that there’s essentially no change in the press statement  Now, what’s your   pleasure with regard to the discussion on communications?  Do you want to talk over lunch or do   you want to recess and come back?     Welcome  I trust you’ve brought all of your wisdom with   you  If not, go home and get it!  [Laughter]  Who would like to move approval of the minutes of   our October 28 meeting?     Without objection they are approved  The next item is the   election of a Vice Chair  Governor Ferguson     Is there a second?   SEVERAL  Second     Is there opposition?  [Laughter]  Congratulations!  As   you’ve observed, the democratic process has worked without a flaw  Let’s turn to Dino Kos     The domestic credit markets have been rather tranquil   despite what is presumed to be a significant shift in the propensity of foreign holders to purchase   US assets  I assume that implies either that markets saw rates going down and have been   supportive of that or that the sensitivity of market interest rates to the substitution of official for   private purchases is really quite small  If the latter is the case, the notion that the official   purchases had to be there to fill in the gap is in a sense really missing the point  Which of these   two explanations, or a third if you have one, would seem most credible in this context?     That’s the crucial question     Further questions for Dino?       Sure     Governor Bernanke     A fairly significant amount of international holdings are   tied to the dollar—I’m now talking about China in its current development stage  Do you have   any evidence that that creates a more volatile exchange rate adjustment process for floating rates   against the dollar?  Theoretically, if 95 percent of the world’s currencies were tied to the dollar   and 5 percent were not, that 5 percent obviously would be moving around rather rapidly     I think that is certainly a good point  Nonetheless it’s hard   to believe that you wouldn’t get significant volatility  If you don’t like 5 percent, try 1 percent,   and I’m sure you’d get a lot of volatility     Okay  Any other questions?     I have a question for you  Suppose their capital is   negative  Does it matter?     As I’m sure you know, the Federal Reserve has   continuously given away its surpluses for political reasons if for no other reason     The rest is in the Ministry of Finance     Further questions for Dino?  Would somebody like to   move the ratification of the domestic policy actions?     I suggest that we take a brief recess to get lunch and come   back to the table here  Governor Ferguson will then give us a progress report on the activities of   his working group   December 9, 2003 102 of 133    [Recess]     Governor Ferguson has the floor     Why don’t you indicate the members of the working   group     I want to support what Cathy is saying, and I do so from   the point of view of somebody who has to figure out how to get a consensus out of this group    It’s far easier to get the requisite number of members to support a policy than to support what we   say about it  For example, with twelve Committee members and, say, ten who favor the policy   decision, there could be fifteen different reasons that might cause members to vote for it    Therefore, it is far easier to get a group to support the actual policy than to get a consensus on   why it is the appropriate policy  The multiplication of the problems that emerge—just using   Cathy’s moving parts terminology—to get people to agree on why they voted a certain way is a   wholly different ball game  I suggest to you that this is a remarkably uniform group in the sense   that I think without exception we all hold a reasonably consistent view as to how the economy   December 9, 2003 109 of 133    functions and, therefore, which levers are required to do what  The only difference really boils   down to questions of how we view the outlook     Nonetheless, this is a very complex process, and I just want to agree with Cathy that   reducing the number of moving parts is going to be very important  We also have to avoid like   the plague, if Michelle Smith has a 215 pm deadline for releasing our statement to the press,   anything that will extend these meetings well beyond when we ordinarily adjourn  Just take   today as an example—today’s agenda was not particularly extensive, but it’s already twenty   minutes before 200 pm  If we start trying to discuss all the ifs, ands, and buts in the statement,   we will not finish in time  But there is an alternative  We can go to a 400 pm announcement   but let the press know well in advance that we are changing the time we plan to release our   statement  We can go later than that if you want  But there are lots of other implications about   this whole communications business     Let me just indicate to you that in good congressional   tradition the clock has stopped at 200 pm       Well, unless somebody has some formidably important   issues to raise at this point, the meeting is adjourned   END OF MEETING      December 9, 2003 119 of 133        Without objection  Thank you very much  Let’s move on   to Dave Stockton and Karen Johnson     In recent days there has been some discussion among   those in the international oil markets that OPEC is becoming increasingly sensitive to the fact   that the dollar is declining  The notion is that the OPEC price range of $22 to $28 a barrel that   they allegedly are endeavoring to maintain is becoming obsolescent, largely because of the   change in the dollar’s exchange rate  That raises a question as to whether there is any evidence   at this particular point that oil consumption in Europe, for example, is actually stronger than   otherwise would have been the case—obviously at the prevailing dollar price  Or are the taxes in   Europe so large that the price of crude really doesn’t matter all that much, and hence there is no   significant exchange rate effect on the supply–demand balances for oil?     It looks as if the OPEC price is $2 to $3 a barrel under that   for West Texas intermediate  Is it something like that?     The issue came up at the Board meeting yesterday about   the relationship between the gap and the rate of inflation outside the United States  In other   words, the model in the United States is reasonably robust for that type of calculation    Historically we’ve never been able to get reasonable estimates of a relationship between gap and   price elsewhere  Has that improved in recent years?  Or is there any deeper insight into whether   it’s a data problem or an economic problem?     Do we have any explanation of why a phenomenon such   as we observe with some robustness in the United States could conceivably exist here and not in   similar market-oriented economies abroad?     President Hoenig     President Poole     President Parry     Maquiladoras were emerging in the 1990s with far greater   numbers of people outsourcing from the United States as our unemployment rate continued to   fall     Do you want to know something?  These workers are not   as skilled as some people think  The entire skill level in the United States continues to rise, and   these jobs that are being outsourced require what we now would call below-average skills    We’re not sending off to India the work that requires really sophisticated software knowledge  A   good deal of the work being sent off is the overnight processing and standard data-crunching   services that in the twenty-first century involve a relative skill level not significantly different   from certain important manual labor skills a hundred years ago     Some of what people believe just “ain’t so”  President   Moskow     December 9, 2003 26 of 133      Are we seeing it in the tranches of the longer-term   issues—say the thirty-year bond or even the ten-year note?  Are those tranches moving up?  Or   as you pointed out yesterday, is this a reflection of improving liquidity in the TIPS market to the   December 9, 2003 28 of 133    extent that we’re getting a lower TIPS yield and hence an artificial liquidity-related increase in   inflation compensation implied in the five-to-ten-year part of the TIPS structure?      What has happened to the one-year maturity ten years out?     Yes     Is it correlating with what is conceptually identical to   inflation expectations for a forward period?  Do the two give the same answer?  My recollection   is that they do not     December 9, 2003 29 of 133      Which is not an inflation premium issue     Yes, but President Moskow is raising a question based on   looking at that chart  I think he called it scary, and it is scary if you believe what it implies  If it   is indeed is telling us something, it’s obviously very important for policy  If it is not, it’s   important that we know that     President Santomero     President Pianalto     Any further questions?  President Minehan   December 9, 2003 33 of 133      Who would like to start the Committee discussion?     Well, isn’t it mainly the issue of house-price inflation that   is scaring both of those central banks you mentioned rather than—      Well, we just discussed the notion that the output gap   doesn’t make any difference there     Okay, can we move on to the economic discussion?    President Moskow     President Parry     President Poole     President McTeer     President Guynn   December 9, 2003 48 of 133      President Minehan     Thank you  President Santomero     President Broaddus      President Pianalto       Let’s take a break and be back in ten minutes   December 9, 2003 62 of 133    [Coffee break]     First Vice President Lyon, please  Welcome, incidentally     Governor Kohn     Vice Chairman Geithner     Governor Gramlich     President Hoenig     Governor Ferguson     Governor Olson      Governor Bernanke   December 9, 2003 78 of 133      Governor Bies     Thank you very much  Brian Madigan, please     Questions for Brian?       You haven’t seen the three dimensional one yet!     Further comments or questions?  If not, let me get started    It’s fairly evident that the economy is at a turning point by virtually all the measures that we   have  Historically, it has almost invariably been the case that the Federal Reserve would tighten   under such conditions  Indeed, preemption is something that has filtered its way into the   monetary policy lexicon  The issue of preemption implies, of course, that we will adjust our   policy ahead of anything that we can readily foresee  In current circumstances, therefore, there is   and there will continue to be a lot of pressure on us to move rates higher  We have resisted   because of a quite considerable and significant difference in the present economy from what we   have observed in the past      In recent decades, the turning point toward accelerating economic activity usually   occurred when the inflation rate was 3 percent or 4 percent, sometimes even higher, and the   December 9, 2003 88 of 133    necessity for preemption was critically obvious  The problem with preemption, though it is   something that is very interesting to observe in retrospect, is that it doesn’t necessarily follow   that we are preempting future developments that will actually occur the way we expect  So, we   have to be careful not to try to preempt something that is not fairly likely to happen There is a   risk and indeed a cost to being wrong  The risk was one that we were willing to take in earlier   years because the economic outlook was such that we could not really afford not to be   preemptive, even if we recognized that we might misread a turning point and act prematurely,   with clearly negative effects     The markets obviously are presuming that the earlier sort of paradigm is currently what is   in place  It is not  It is not because we are at a very low inflation rate, 1 percent or thereabouts,   and the output gap, however one measures it, is quite sizable  As a consequence, what we have   been trying to communicate to the markets is that we don’t wish to take the risks of preemption   when we don’t have to  That is what induced us awhile back to put a reference to a   “considerable period” in our statements to underscore the fact that we are in a different type of   period  It’s very evident that our effort to communicate that message succeeded  We succeeded   in the sense that the basic tilt of the yield curve is reasonably consistent with the presumption   that we will not adjust policy right away or that we need to move right away  Leaving aside the   issue associated with the five-to-ten-year inflation compensation measure that we were   discussing earlier, there’s very little evidence that the markets are pricing in a buildup in long-  term inflation expectations   Consequently, I think we may reasonably conclude that the markets believe us  In Al   Broaddus’s term, we clearly have “credibility” in this regard, and it’s very important that we not   squander it The reason I say that is that we took a risk with the insertion of our reference to a   December 9, 2003 89 of 133    “considerable period,” not a risk so far as economic policy or monetary policy were concerned   but a risk that what we said could significantly erode the credibility of this institution, with   negative effects  That did not happen We chose to take that risk rather than to take preemptive   actions that could have been a mistake  As a consequence, we are now in a position where we   have to figure out how we should gradually move away from our statement regarding a   “considerable period”  It’s fairly apparent that for a central bank to forecast how long it is not   apt to move is a mistake, of which we are all aware     In my judgment, what we have to do at this stage really rests on how best to disengage   ourselves from this problem with minimal negative effects and, I hope, major positive effects  In   this regard I’m inclined to the view, but I’m not certain, that if we use “considerable period” this   time we can change almost anything else in the statement without fostering any adverse impact    Indeed, that’s what I would suggest that we do  I do not deny that the most likely outcome is that   inflation will continue to recede  The problem in acting on that belief, however, is that if we are   wrong the consequences will be quite negative, to say the least  The chances of being wrong are   there  I don’t think they represent the majority probability, but as we were discussing earlier   there are large variances among some of the equations that link the output gap and inflation  We   also discussed the fact that this phenomenon is very difficult to filter out in other economies    Moreover, we have the problem of taking a regression analysis largely based on periods with an   inflation range of perhaps 2 to 10 percent and extrapolating that regression linearly to below   2 percent and presuming that we are getting the same interactions  So, not having past   observations of how this augmented Phillips curve functions at this low inflation level, we’re just   making an extrapolation, and it could be wrong  If it is wrong in the context of an economy that   December 9, 2003 90 of 133    is accelerating rapidly and a marketplace that is getting fairly jittery, the costs to the stability of   the markets are in my view potentially too high     Therefore, my general view and approach here is to presume that the inflation risks are   close to balanced What that does for us, if we also have balance with respect to growth and   retain the words “for a considerable period,” is to give us the flexibility to do several things  For   one, if our statement regarding balanced inflation risks turns out to be incorrect and the rate of   inflation continues to fall, it doesn’t cost us very much  We can very readily move rates lower if   necessary in the context of a statement referring to a “considerable period”  Moreover, my   proposal would also put us in a position where we may be able in January to change the   reference from “considerable period” to some concept of “patience” or the “ability to have   patience”  In turn, that would provide us with the flexibility to move, possibly as early as March   if we have to but certainly by May    In any event, so long as we have a reference to either “considerable period” or “patience”   in our statement, we will have the capability of moving the funds rate lower  In my judgment,   putting out a statement that essentially captures that capability gives us, as far as I can see, the   maximum flexibility that we can achieve at this point  It also gives us an exit strategy that puts   us in a position where we can be adjusting our policy  One needs to remember that the current   federal funds rate is well below any estimate of the equilibrium rate  That is, when we start to   raise the rate, we may have the problem of having to return to the equilibrium rate relatively   quickly  As many of you have mentioned, a quick adjustment in the rate structure at this stage   could destabilize a number of the elements in our forecast  We will want to move as moderately   as we can in the process of returning to a neutral position at a point when the output gap is   declining but still there  Obviously, we can’t wait until the gap closes to begin to move because   December 9, 2003 91 of 133    financial markets may be adjusting well in advance of that  Expectations of growing pressures   will be there We also have to bear in mind that our estimate of the output gap is not all that   clear-cut  Fifty years ago we had no difficulty knowing what capacity was in a lot of industries    Open-hearth furnaces produced a certain amount of steel, and the chemistry prevented them from   doing very much else until steel manufacturers started putting in oxygen lances and eventually   going to oxygen furnaces  Assembly lines for motor vehicles involved very rigid systems a half   century ago  Now, manufacturers use batch processes, and consequently the notion of what is   capacity is an increasingly flexible concept  But in order to generate an output gap we need a   point estimate of capacity, and that’s what we use  As a result, there’s a question as to whether   the gap means the same thing today that it meant twenty years ago  I think not  I believe the   potential variance of that measurement has increased considerably, and I think we have to take   that into account   My bottom line in all of this is that I would recommend that we not move the funds rate   and that we communicate in our announcement something similar to the type of risk balances   I’ve just mentioned for growth and inflation  Let me read a way of doing this  It’s only five   lines  “The Committee perceives that the upside and downside risks to the attainment of   sustainable growth for the next few quarters are roughly equal  The probability of an unwelcome   fall in inflation has diminished in recent months and now appears almost equal to that of a rise in   inflation  However, with inflation quite low and resource use slack, the Committee believes that   policy accommodation can be maintained for a considerable period”  You will observe that the   previous statement of balance for growth and inflation combined is not in here and that the   “considerable period” reference is employed in lieu of that and I think for appropriate reasons    So that’s my recommendation Who would like to comment?     December 9, 2003 92 of 133      President Minehan     President Moskow     Yes  Let me just quickly read that paragraph  It’s very   short  “The Committee continues to believe that an accommodative stance of monetary policy,   coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing important ongoing support   to economic activity  The evidence accumulated over the intermeeting period confirms that   output is expanding briskly, and the labor market appears to be improving modestly  Increases   in core consumer prices are muted and expected to remain low”     President Poole     Governor Bernanke     Governor Bies   December 9, 2003 96 of 133      Governor Ferguson     Governor Kohn     I don’t disagree with the way you phrased it     President Hoenig     President Guynn     President Santomero     President Parry     President Pianalto     First Vice President Lyon     Governor Olson       President Broaddus     Vice Chairman Geithner     President McTeer     Would you read the appropriate text, please?   December 9, 2003 101 of 133      Call the roll     Good morning, everybody  The first item provisionally on   the agenda was a discussion of the minutes of our January 27-28 meeting  But Michelle Smith is   in the process of trying to shoot down a very peculiar headline in the New York Times, and she is   writing something on that  So I’d like to postpone this agenda item until later in the meeting   because I don’t feel we ought to discuss it without her being in attendance  So first let me   recognize the fact that, as all of you are aware and saddened by, Bob Parry is attending his last   FOMC meeting—which means we give him two votes!  [Laughter]     However, there is a restriction  One has to offset the   other  We’ll be feting you at lunch, hopefully, and obviously we wish you the best     Let’s turn to Dino Kos     I noted in the chart on the Fed custody holdings of   Treasury securities, shown in the middle panel on page 1, that there are a couple of periods of   very significant rise  If one tries to compare them with the Japanese intervention data on page 4,   it obviously doesn’t square in the slightest  Indeed, it looks as though the intervention of very   early 2004 didn’t show up in the custody holdings until the third week in January  Is that the   typical time lag?     Well, I assume the Japanese are dominant     Cash meaning deposits?      Where?  In domestic banks or foreign banks?  In dollars?     I thought the lag was just two or three days   March 16, 2004 7 of 107      Do the securities go into custody at the point of purchase?     I’m sorry, I meant at the point of settlement  So it’s not an   issue of their purchasing a security, taking it home, and then sending it back, so to speak  They   purchase it, and at settlement it goes into custody as a book entry item, and that’s it     On the bottom chart of page 1, everybody uses that spread   between the ten-year note and the three-month bill  But what the comparison in that chart is   supposed to capture is better captured by using a one-year maturity nine years out because   clearly the ten-year note is picking up an average of everything from one day out to ten years  I   understand that it’s not a market rate  It’s a work of art, based on first differences in the chart  Is   there any reason that we don’t do that other comparison instead?  That’s the rate we really want   to see       The spread is actually 5 points, not 3   March 16, 2004 8 of 107      In the short term it would be, but not as the slope of the   yield curve changes  The spread is affected by that slope  The point is that what you’re trying to   measure here is being muddied by the fact that the numbers are already partially in the   numerator  With respect to the chart at the bottom of page 3, those IMM commitment data can’t   have anything to do with the dollar because the euro is unchanged  It’s a technical issue with   respect to the yen and has nothing to do with anything else as far as I can see     Yes, it looks as though 100,000 contracts just got—is it   yen delta hedging?  It’s curious     Other questions for Dino?  President Minehan   March 16, 2004 9 of 107      Governor Kohn     President Poole     It’s not a great burden, I hope!  [Laughter]     Any further comments?  If not, the next meeting is May 4   END OF MEETING   March 16, 2004 93 of 107        Any objections?  Does anyone else want to speak before   we close the questions?  If not, I will accept your motion and assume, without objection, that the   Desk’s transactions are approved  David Stockton and Karen Johnson     Do you have any breakout on foreign affiliate earnings in   foreign currencies and the extent to which earnings are converted to dollars—resulting in much   larger amounts of dollars at the prevailing exchange rate?       There’s a lot of hedging going on     I know you eventually get it, but at this stage do you have   the foreign affiliate earnings by major geographic areas?     March 16, 2004 18 of 107      In other words, Commerce publishes the data but with a   significant lag?     I ask because theoretically one could take the dollar   earnings and literally convert them back to their foreign currencies     Of course, you don’t know what’s hedging and what isn’t   hedging, but at least it gives you a rough idea  The problem is that you need to wait for the   earnings data     Yes, a significant part of that is the oil earnings of US   companies  I must tell you, though, that if you try to reconcile company reports with the   Commerce numbers you will think you’re looking at two separate universes  The bookkeeping   that goes on there makes Enron’s bookkeeping look like Accounting I  President Poole     President Parry     President Moskow     Bill Wascher and his group, as you may know, are trying   to simulate the old breakdown  If they succeed, we’ll probably learn a few things about this   issue     Any further questions for our colleagues?  If not, who   would like to start the Committee discussion?  President Moskow     President McTeer     President Minehan       President Broaddus     President Poole     President Parry     President Santomero     President Guynn     President Hoenig   March 16, 2004 48 of 107      President Stern     President Pianalto     It’s 1105 am  Why don’t we recess for a short coffee   break   [Coffee break]     It’s interesting that the red line in 2001-04 is rising   whereas the other one is flat, which of course reflects our moving the funds rate down  That   alters the meaning of the chart  Anyway, Governor Kohn     Governor Gramlich     Vice Chair     Governor Olson   March 16, 2004 63 of 107      Governor Ferguson     Governor Bernanke     Governor Bies     Thank you very much  We’ll turn to Vincent Reinhart     Questions for Vincent?  I don’t have terribly much to say   because as others have indicated, most has been said  Just let me point out a few issues  The   rate of productivity growth is beginning to slow; and over the last several months, the high-  March 16, 2004 75 of 107    frequency data show a marked deceleration from the elevated pace we saw earlier  Thus far,   however, that slowing has not been accompanied by much growth in employment  So the issue   is not whether the growth of productivity is falling; it is already significantly lower  The   interesting question relates to employment and whether its recent weakness reflects statistical   noise or whether there’s something going on that we did not anticipate  I must add that an   assortment of recent labor market data suggests that there was a significant pickup in February   and March  If that is indeed the case, it may be that the weakness in January and possibly in   February was due to weather-related problems   Committee members have increasingly discussed the possibility that the persistence of   low market interest rates is fostering increased efforts to reach for higher yields in financial   markets  In my view, this is probably one of the most important issues confronting us because,   clearly, the longer we maintain very low interest rates, if indeed there is significant reaching for   better yields, the more the liability side of business balance sheets is going to be peppered with   securities that may not be all that viable in a rising interest rate environment  I’m not sure how   we can evaluate that risk, but it is an obvious issue that should be concerning us  And I think   that, more than any other issue, is probably what is going to move us eventually toward   tightening    The difficulty that I have with tightening any time soon is that the economy may not yet   have reached the point where we can confidently say that this recovery is fairly solid and robust   going forward, even though the current data clearly are exhibiting considerable strength    Ordinarily, I would have hoped to move toward adjusting our risk assessment of inflation to full   balance in our press statement for this meeting  The reason is that, if we are beginning to   contemplate a tightening action, we should gradually de-emphasize our reference to patience  A   March 16, 2004 76 of 107    move in that direction today would be consistent with continuing to adjust our statements   meeting by meeting and fostering a momentum that might enable us at the appropriate time to   tighten with a minimum effect on rates   My own judgment is that it would be desirable when we move to have been so   transparent about our intention to do so that financial markets will not respond all that much    This means that we have a very interesting but difficult job to do in trying to alter the general   attitudes in financial markets  Ideally, the day we move everybody should have a sense that our   action is consistent with our previous statements about the outlook     This raises an interesting question about whether we ought to be moving toward a   balanced risks statement on inflation or stay where we are  Before the data began to turn   somewhat negative, I was hopeful that we could definitely move in the direction of balance    Now I’m a little concerned about doing so  The reason is that, if we move today toward   balanced inflation, we will essentially have created a sequence of doing something—not   tightening, but moving in that direction—at every recent meeting  That would then create a   problem for us at our next meeting if we don’t want to move at that time  So, I am marginally   inclined not to change our inflation statement at this point  But I must say it is a very close call    The sole reason I would argue for not moving is to avoid creating momentum toward a policy   action if, indeed, the economic expansion is slowing down   So I come out in favor of leaving the inflation risks sentence unchanged  But if there is   considerable interest in changing it, I would certainly want to consider the arguments for doing   so  I do think we would be taking a risk that I don’t believe we need to take at this point  In my   view we are in a position where we can sit with patience for a considerable period!  [Laughter]  I   March 16, 2004 77 of 107    recommend that we change the language in the first operative paragraph of our statement along   the lines that Vincent has indicated but that we not change the balance of risks sentences   What we have in the draft statement and what I’d like to put on the table for discussion is   a first sentence in the operative paragraph that talks about underlying productivity as providing   important ongoing support to the expansion  That is not a change  The second and third   sentences incorporate some updating  They read “The evidence accumulated over the   intermeeting period indicates that output is continuing to expand at a solid pace  Although job   losses have slowed, new hiring has lagged”  The fourth sentence is unchanged and reads   “Increases in core consumer prices are muted and expected to remain low”  That’s all I have to   say at the moment  Comments anybody?  President Poole     Governor Gramlich   March 16, 2004 78 of 107      President Minehan     President Moskow     President Parry     President Stern     President Guynn     Governor Kohn   March 16, 2004 80 of 107      President Santomero     President Pianalto     President Hoenig     Governor Ferguson     President Broaddus     Governor Bernanke     President McTeer     Vice Chair     Governor Bies     Governor Olson      This is a very close decision actually—not so much in the   numbers but in the fact that all of us, as best I can judge, could go either way if we had to  It’s   just too close to call  I think Governor Olson probably correctly summarized where we stand    And there’s a lot to be said for President Poole’s argument that it’s really not going to matter all   that much because what will matter is what the data show  So in a way I think it’s probably best   for us to do nothing and let the market essentially move the expectations on the federal funds   rate  Therefore, let’s have a statement read that essentially involves no change     March 16, 2004 87 of 107      Since we will be approving the statement as well, could   you distribute the draft statement, please, just to be sure?  It’s in effect what Vincent had   indicated, so I trust there are no surprises  [Pause]  If there are no comments, please call the roll     We now have to go back to the agenda item we deferred at   the beginning, which was a discussion of the minutes of the previous meeting  There were   important issues raised  Vincent, do you want to comment?     Let me first follow up on your transparency assessment  I   think Cathy Minehan has raised an interesting point  I would say this  We run the risk, by   laying out the pros and cons of a particular argument, of inducing people to join in on the debate,   and in this regard it is possible to lose control of a process that only we fully understand  We   have a ratchet in here where, if we were to move forward, we can’t go back  So the concept of   transparency is a very important concept but one that should be approached with a recognition   that we cannot move back and forth on it  I’m a little concerned here that by raising certain   issues we may not be able to backtrack  I hadn’t thought about it when I originally read the draft   minutes, but in seeing the concerns that other people had, I think there’s something here that we   have to consider  I do not recall so many people raising questions about the minutes before   because I think most of us read the minutes passively  That suggests to me that, if there were   really a strong focus on them, we’d find a greater degree of disagreement among us about their   content  Now, I don’t know whether what I just said is true  I suspect it is just on the basis of   my experience  What was it—four or five people who commented?     I was not one of them, so I would make the count six  It   would be useful to discuss this even at the expense of delaying our tribute to our guest of   honor—is that what we’re calling you today?     Does anybody have any thoughts on this?  I must admit   that I didn’t think about some of these issues until I saw the comments others made, but I’m a   little concerned about other people getting into the debate when they know far less than we do  I   don’t know what Michelle has to say on this but my impression is that, if we go in that direction,   we may find ourselves coming to a conclusion that is not based on our best judgment  She’s   nodding in agreement     Yes     May I make a suggestion?  This could get to be a very   long discussion, and we don’t need that  Do you have time to make changes?     Oh, I understand that  Let me make the following   suggestion  Those who haven’t commented should provide comments to Vincent  The reason I   say that is that we may very well find that those who didn’t comment actually strongly support   the minutes as written, and it’s important to know that  We could then do—we’ve done this on   March 16, 2004 91 of 107    numerous occasions on other matters—a notation vote  If there is a problem in trying to find out   who is where or what the issues are, Vincent can get on the phone and talk to each of you and   make a judgment  In my view, that’s the best way to resolve this, and I think it’s worthy of   being resolved  It’s an important issue      Okay  Any comments relevant to this?     He will try to infer from your comments, and I think we all   trust him in this respect, a way to rewrite the minutes that he thinks will gain a majority vote    Then we will find out whether he is accurate  [Laughter]     No, at this time the only thing Vincent will be involved   with is finalizing the minutes for the previous meeting  That has nothing to do with how we   proceed going forward on this   March 16, 2004 92 of 107      Now, wait a second  May I ask a question?  If we have a   subcommittee that is putting out a draft of the minutes to be voted on, none of us is in any way   forgoing our legal commitments  It’s the delegation of the vote that’s the legal issue  A   subcommittee to facilitate that process is, in my judgment—I don’t know what the General   Counsel has to say on it—     It doesn’t matter how it’s done because the ultimate   decision is made finally by a notation vote  On this one, I think it’s probably not necessary to   appoint such a group, but that doesn’t change the previous discussion     Good morning, everybody  This is the last FOMC meeting   that Al Broaddus will be attending  I believe he attended his first meeting in 1973     You don’t remember?  Well, I guess the FOMC didn’t make   a big impression on you at that time!       We will miss you, but of course we will have a luncheon for   you after our next meeting  Your official date of retirement is August 1?     Well, whatever you have to say for the future to the FOMC,   we will give you another 324 seconds to say it at this meeting     Would somebody like to move to approve the minutes of   March 16?     Without objection, they are approved  Mr Reinhart, do you   want to make some comments relevant to this set of minutes?     Any questions for Vincent?     President Geithner is proposing the election of Joseph Tracy   as an associate economist of the FOMC  If there are no objections, I will assume that his request is   approved     Dino Kos, would you start us off?     The volume of financing in the mortgage markets has come   down very sharply and has stayed down for quite a long period now  I would assume, and indeed   you implied it, that hedges have already been taken on a goodly part of the positions held  So the   impact of a change in yields clearly has been far less than it was last August when the maturity, as   you said, went from one-half year to three and one-half years, or whatever it was  What is left out   there to be hedged?  And what are the vulnerabilities in the event, for example, that we get another   50 basis point rise in the ten-year note?     But that doesn’t move as rapidly as when we get a big   interest rate move and there’s a huge option takedown of mortgage positions   May 4, 2004 8 of 112         Presumably there will be a lot of delta hedges moving in with   that type of operation     Well, that’s what history tells us—that at the lowest levels of   refinancing, duration has been about four and one-half years  But can that change in any way?    There’s nothing mathematically necessary about it, is there?     A reflection of the house turnover rate?     I’m a little surprised that in your charts New Zealand has all   of a sudden become a major international power  Considering the fact that the yield spreads   between New Zealand and Australia are locked, you must be trying to convey some subtle message   here     You ought to try the zloty or something     There are indications that inventories are building up on the   docks in China and that warehouses are beginning to fill, which I presume is related to the recent   weakness in commodity prices, especially for steel  Prices for cold rolled sheet, which is the   premier steel—especially in China—for car making, have come down quite significantly  And   that’s a classic inventory play  Are you picking up anything that suggests that there’s more to this   than just temporary gluts?  The data are, of course, nonexistent, but what does one hear about the   inventory situation in China?     There is an old classic adage that suggests that, when   everybody says “nobody has any inventories,” it is telling you that the rate of accumulation is   horrendous and that the level is already very high by historical standards but you haven’t sated the   demand for the still higher level that occurs just before it turns around  And the first sign is a break   in price  What has happened to the copper price in the last three or four days, by the way?     In the last three or four days?     Industrial activity or more broadly a goodly part of the GDP   is better measured by metals prices than by lumber, whose demand is fairly concentrated, or   certainly by agricultural products      Aluminum is peaking, as is zinc and I think tin  Somebody   still buys tin, but that’s down, too, I believe     It has flattened out     Okay  Any other questions for Dino?  If not, would someone   like to move the ratification of the domestic market transactions?     Without objection they are approved  Dino, would you like   to talk about the swap lines?     Before we adjourn, I think Vincent wants to discuss some   audits     If there is no other business, we are adjourned  The next   meeting is June 29-30, 2004   END OF MEETING   May 4, 2004 101 of 112        If there are no objections, I will assume that your request is   granted  We now move on to the staff report, and I call on Dave Stockton and Karen Johnson     Incidentally, has General Motors reported yet?     Questions for our colleagues?  President Moskow     Further questions for David or Karen?  If not, who would   like to start our Committee discussion?  President Moskow?     President Broaddus     Thank you  President Poole     President McTeer     Thank you  President Minehan     President Guynn     President Santomero       President Hoenig       Governor Kohn     Thank you  President Stern     First Vice President Moore     Vice Chairman   May 4, 2004 51 of 112         Let’s break for coffee and be back in ten to fifteen minutes   [Coffee break]     President Pianalto     Governor Bernanke     Governor Gramlich     You get the academy “reward”  Governor Olson     Governor Ferguson     Governor Bies     Thank you  I think we have covered everybody  Mr   Reinhart     Questions for Vincent?  President Moskow     President Poole     President Santomero     Traders react to what they think other traders are going to do   who react to the way they think still other traders are going to react  To try to anticipate how they   will react is a futile activity in my experience  President Hoenig   May 4, 2004 77 of 112         May I just interrupt?  I’ll anticipate what I’m going to say in   my comments to you in a few moments  This language enables us to move the next time  But the   wording is very interesting  The word “measured” is referring solely to the rate of increase, not to   when the increase will begin  We have no way of knowing what the data are going to show over the   next several weeks  As Vincent pointed out, whatever we decide here and whatever the response,   the reaction is likely to be a small fraction of what the market will do on Friday  If, for example, we   were to go very far and try to move more than the markets expect and we end up with a 50,000   payroll number and 01 on the core CPI, we will have moved awkwardly  I’m not sure what the   reactions would be to that  But I don’t think this proposed language restricts us in the slightest  As   you say, Tom, we always move in a measured way  So the use of the term “measured,” if I take you   literally, should have zero effect because that’s the way we always move  Merely stipulating that   doesn’t change anything     Do you mean what will we say or what will we do?   May 4, 2004 78 of 112         What we will do is that we will move the funds rate up     And the first move we make will be a big deal, especially if   it’s in June and not in August as everyone expects  Unless you want to move either today or in the   intermeeting period, which I would not recommend—     Anything we do, whether it’s 25 basis points or 125 basis   points is by definition measured  [Laughter]     President Minehan       President Moskow     Oh, of course we can come back to it     Okay, let me talk in a measured manner  [Laughter]  First of   all, I think there’s no question now that this recovery is broad, deep, and evolving into a sustainable   expansion  Indeed, I have the suspicion that a very unusual factor in this recovery allows us to   project it further than is usually the case  Corporate management is very conservative and not prone   to anticipate a recovery and, hence, to move ahead of it  Moving ahead of the recovery usually   means putting in plant facilities more quickly, expanding the company’s labor force well before the   additional workers are needed, and making all the other expenditures that corporations have made in   past recoveries, with the result that capital investment plus inventory accumulation has invariably   exceeded internal cash flow   In 2003, for the first time since 1975, cash flow exceeded capital investment, which suggests   that there is a very considerable hurdle—in terms of spending decisions—to which the business   community is still responding And I suspect that it relates to the corporate scandals and other   corporate concerns that have emerged in the last couple of years and are still lingering  We are   seeing very considerable gains in corporate profits, and margins are up very significantly  Cash   flow in the first quarter was quite strong, and analysts are continuing to raise their estimates for the   second quarter  In short, business managers are being pulled along by the data rather than being   anticipatory  This is not unusual because we’ve had a very shallow recession and we’re not getting   the usual rebound in any respect, with the exception of the very strong growth in profitability    May 4, 2004 81 of 112       All of this leads me to conclude—and I think this view is held pretty much universally as   well as within this Committee—that we have completed our period of accommodation, which was   an endeavor to address the rather substantial contractionary forces that became evident in mid-2000    In retrospect our policy accommodation appears to have worked  Whether we will look back upon   this period two years from today and say that our policy was the right policy is going to depend on   how we come out of this period of accommodation    With regard to the outlook for inflation, we have a number of indicators that we look at  For   one, as many of you have mentioned, we have the “gap”  I am uncomfortable with the gap analysis   basically for two reasons  One is that it requires that we view the inflation projection from the   perspective of regression analysis, and that kind of analysis always has a large element of potential   error in it  If the projected inflation rate is above the current rate, we’re never quite sure whether   there has been a fundamental change in the structure of the economy, which isn’t captured by the   regression, or whether the actual inflation rate is eventually going to move up  As a consequence,   unless our projections are right on the money all the time, which they almost invariably are not,   there are always serious questions about whether our gap regression analyses are really telling us   something that we need to know   Second, there is the question of whether a single figure describes the process  A number of   you have mentioned the skilled labor shortage  The very soft rise in wages and salaries in the   production worker data is suggestive of the development that we’re all aware of—namely, that the   skill differential has been rising fairly dramatically  As a result, we have a shortage of skilled   workers and a corresponding surplus of lesser-skilled workers  And as I’ve argued in certain   speeches recently, what we are failing to do in this country is to raise the degree of skill in the   workforce as a whole sufficiently quickly to create a more balanced skill supply–demand situation   May 4, 2004 82 of 112       and in the process to remove the surplus of the lesser skilled so that we end up with an overall   balance  We don’t have that at this stage  I’m wondering whether or not the differential pressures   of stronger wage growth in skilled areas and weaker wage growth in lesser-skilled areas create   problems in doing this type of evaluation  In my view that is at least open to question   As a consequence, I think that it is important to look at the structure of underlying costs    Because profit margins tend to be constrained, within limits, the issue we ought to be looking at   when we are trying to evaluate the behavior of inflation is not the core PCE or the core CPI but   underlying unit costs in the economy, as best we can judge them  One way of analyzing this is to   look at a set of data composed of nonfinancial, non-energy corporations that account for maybe   55 percent of the GDP but obviously a significantly higher proportion of the growth of the business   sector  If we look at those data, we see that the acceleration in costs has been very limited  Indeed,   over the last four quarters this sector has registered an average price rise in the neighborhood of   1 percent  And it turns out that two-thirds of that rise is reflected in higher unit profits and that   actual underlying unit costs are rising very modestly, the result of a combination of declining unit   labor costs and declining unit interest costs, offset in part by rising costs of energy, indirect business   taxes, and business transfers   I understand the issue of whether we mis-evaluated the data on prices last year and, hence,   have been operating under a presumption that inflation had gotten lower than it actually did  But I   think that the more important question here is what unit costs are doing  Consequently, trying to get   a long-term projection of where inflation is going may require that we start from a higher base than   the one we’ve been assuming is currently the base  As I think David Stockton mentioned, we have   now reached the point where changes in unit labor costs have become positive  We have to assume   that there has been some upward movement in unit energy costs and probably in unit interest costs    May 4, 2004 83 of 112       But one has to remember that, whenever we are talking about unit costs, if the denominator is rising   at a fairly rapid pace, it holds down unit costs, all else being equal  So it is not clear to me that unit   interest costs are in the process of going up  Nevertheless, I think the point here is that we are not   yet in a position where we are seeing underlying cost structures moving significantly  To be sure,   they have picked up in the last several months  In fact, my recollection of the data is that   productivity growth from December through March, as distinct from the first quarter over the fourth   quarter, is in the area of just under 4 percent  In fact, if I sort all the pieces of paper in front of me, I   may actually come up with a number  [Pause]  Voila!  The staff estimate of output growth per hour   between December and March is 39 percent at an annual rate  Compensation per hour,   interestingly enough, is up at a 5 percent rate for the same period, reflecting a 31 percent increase in   wages and salaries and significant increases in other labor income  The latter increase, as you saw   in the ECI, is to a large extent pension costs and medical insurance costs   So we are beginning to see a process of increasing costs  But the productivity numbers are   still sufficiently strong to suppress the overall rise  Remember, the major difference between 1994   and today is productivity growth  In 1994 we didn’t have any productivity growth to speak of, and   we had to move very fast to contain inflationary pressures  The reason we have been able to be   patient in this recent period is that we knew unit labor costs were falling fairly abruptly, and   whatever the price data showed was frankly irrelevant in that respect   I think we have a set of data here that, as far as I can judge, seems to be consistent with a   gradual building-up of inflationary forces  But I fully recognize that we can’t measure that by   looking at different simulations as we try to do in certain respects in the Greenbook  I’m   uncomfortable with the very narrow ranges that the Greenbook’s alternative simulations show    That’s because, if we look back over the last several years or maybe the last decade or so and ask if   May 4, 2004 84 of 112       we were wrong at times because we misforecast the exogenous variables, I’d say “only partly”    Mostly, the reason we were off was that the model structure was changing  The coefficients inside   the model were moving, and that created a wholly different environment from the one we had   expected  We alter the exogenous variables in our simulations, but we do not change the structure   of the models  Of necessity the simulations are based on the assumption of a fixed model structure,   and at this stage, I am a little concerned that that may be giving us some false sense of complacency,   if that is indeed what we have   Still, the change in unit labor costs in March, if we’re going to take the staff’s figure, is zero    And with profit margins apparently continuing to rise, that is suggestive of a unit cost change that   on a monthly pattern is not exhibiting any acceleration  In that respect, I think we can state that the   pace at which we’re likely to remove our policy accommodation is going to be “measured”  The   data could run away from us, and obviously that would create a problem    In any event I would say that we have to position ourselves for the possibility of moving at   some meeting, unless we want to take the very unusual step of making a move between meetings    That, I will tell you, would create some extraordinary impact in the marketplace largely because we   are perceived as highly credible  So, if we eliminate that option, we either move today, or we wait   until June  We are not going to move today in part because we are awaiting, and will soon get, a   couple of major statistical reports that could cause us some difficulty, to say the least, if they differ   radically from what we expect  And the point of waiting until June is to be sure that we are   positioned to move at the June meeting if we desire to do so then   When I say “move,” I mean by 25 basis points  I mention that partly because of the   experience of February 1994  Those of you who were here then may remember that there was a   groundswell opinion within the Committee in favor of moving rates up not 25, but 50 basis points    May 4, 2004 85 of 112       And I went berserk for the first time and, I hope, the last time at an FOMC meeting, on the grounds   that, whatever we did, the markets were going to respond fairly exceptionally, which in fact they   did  So, on the basis of that particular history, I would say that we should not move more than   25 basis points in June  We may move 75 basis points in August  I don’t know what we will decide   then  But the point at issue is that, if we’re not going to move more than 25 basis points in June,   then the type of statement proposed in the Bluebook—which was more recently revised by Vincent,   and I’ll read the specific rewording—strikes me as an appropriate response to the data we now have    The sentence as it now reads is, “At this juncture, with inflation low and resource use slack, the   Committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be   measured”     Frankly, I think that positions us appropriately, considering our lack of knowledge  I know   that President Poole has raised the question of putting in something about the economic outlook  I   have no objection to that particularly  I’m not sure it adds anything, frankly  It does add words, and   I think the fewer words that we put in these statements, the better off we are  You will have   observed that we are spending more time on this statement than we have on previous statements,   which is fine  Indeed, since we’re limiting ourselves to very few issues, in my judgment that says   that this process is turning out to be the right way to do this  In any event, to repeat myself, my   recommendation is that we stay where we are and make the few changes in the statement that   Vincent suggested  I would be curious to hear your reactions and get the conversation going again    Who would like to start?  Governor Gramlich      President Guynn     President Santomero     I don’t know what the next move will be     Remember, though, that we haven’t made an intermeeting   move in quite a long while, and one of the reasons is that we haven’t been in the process of making   changes in our policy  If we go back and look at the history, we have often moved between   meetings     We might     Look, unless something very unusual happens between now   and June, I think if our first move were 50 basis points that could create some real market   disruption  But if our presumption is that we have to accelerate the pace, then I think “measured”   should be dropped in June   May 4, 2004 88 of 112         It may  The tradeoff here is that a disruption will occur now   if we don’t say something like “measured”  And we are at an earlier stage of the economic recovery   than presumably we will be later, in which case it’s quite conceivable that we might do inadvertent   collateral damage  If the market is likely to respond to this statement by tightening, which we   suspect it will, it’s going to tighten more if we don’t use “measured” or some similar word  And   subsequently we might find that we’re running into a period where there’s more slack in this   economy than we now anticipate  I don’t think it’s a high probability, but the cost of a mistake here   today may be much larger than the cost of a mistake later     Governor Ferguson     You are indeed measured     Vice Chair     President Stern     President Pianalto     Governor Kohn   May 4, 2004 91 of 112         President Minehan     President Broaddus     Well done  Governor Olson     President Moskow     My “berserkedness” was partially edited out  [Laughter]     President Hoenig     Governor Bies     The answer to that is that the facts are going to determine   policy and I should hope that the markets are acutely aware of that  If that were not the case, they   wouldn’t have been moving the federal funds futures around as the data came in  At the end of the   day, if we wished to be stubborn, we could keep the federal funds futures at 1 percent indefinitely    It would have certain odd implications for the economy, but we could do that  We could just   basically create enough reserves to make that possible     I thought that’s what you interpreted that word to mean     All of which suggests that when we have nineteen people   around a table trying to write a statement, as we’ve indicated on innumerable occasions, there are   difficulties in the process     President McTeer   May 4, 2004 97 of 112         We had that discussion about our statement earlier, as you   may recall—a couple of meetings ago  We said that, if we had retained our old terminology,   “asymmetric to the downside” was really how we viewed the outlook on inflation  But our   judgment was that we’d create more problems by changing the wording in our statement than not    And I think a two-step move—     President Poole     Governor Bernanke     The secretary will read the resolution for us     Call the roll, please     Good morning, everyone  Would somebody like to move   approval of the minutes of June 29 and 30?     Without objection  Will somebody move the election of   Scott Alvarez to serve as General Counsel until the election of a successor at the first meeting of the   Committee after December 31, 2004?     Is there a second?    SPEAKER(?)  Second      Without objection, so ordered  Dino Kos, you’re on      Is it possible that the presumption in the market that the   federal funds rate will follow a certain pattern—prior, let’s say, to the market’s move last Friday   after the employment report—has created an anchor to the structure of rates that, by its very nature,   delimits the extent of volatility?  That could be an explanation of the low volatility  The issue really   gets down to whether the market believes that is exactly what is going to happen and it is taking that   presumed pattern for the funds rate as a given  And they believe that because we’re telling them   that  That automatically will lower the volatility, which raises another obvious problem—that the   system is less resilient to shocks from unexpected events  That makes me a little nervous if that is   indeed the explanation    Second, on the issue of potential endeavors to adjust duration in the mortgage market, I have   the impression that the last big waves of refinancing took out a very big chunk of moderate interest   coupon mortgages  While it may very well be true that, when interest rates fall or duration falls   back, there would be inclinations to hedge—essentially buy fixed-rate mortgages  But if you clean   out the whole base, there’s nothing left  There’s a very delimited amount of potential hedging   activity that becomes required, except for the idiosyncratic shift in duration that has nothing to do   with refinancings  This is not a convexity issue so much; it’s more an endeavor to judge where   there is potential for refinancing  Do we have a judgment on this?    August 10, 2004 6 of 103            The answer is that that’s likely  Obviously, if the duration is   falling, investors would be getting increasingly uncomfortable  But that’s not where the big change   is obviously      Those are the only candidates      Home purchase originations have been high, but they haven’t   been high long enough to make a big difference      That’s true  You know, on the chart where Dino has those   red dots in the regression, the latest observation was right on the new curve      Vice Chair     But the slope going forward has not changed      An interesting point is that the implied volatility on the   S&P 500 is really startling  Whenever we see things of that nature, we say, well, what goes down   must go up—the inverse law of gravity      The interest rate is essentially anchoring the equity premium    What we’re really saying is that there can be an element of too much good news  I think that’s   where we have to be careful  Further questions for Dino?  Would somebody like to move approval   of the Desk’s transactions?      Vincent?      Questions for Vincent?  If not, let me confirm the date of the   next meeting—September 21, 2004  This officially terminates the FOMC meeting, and I request   that the Board of Governors meet in my office to discuss requests for changes in the discount rate   END OF MEETING   August 10, 2004 90 of 103        Without objection, they are approved  We’re now at the staff   reports  Dave Wilcox and Karen Johnson   August 10, 2004 9 of 103            In evaluating the oil price impact in the United States, we   tend to look at the issue from the crude price; essentially a change in the value of crude imports is   viewed as a tax effect  But I wonder if there is not something a little different going on at the   moment, or at least through the spring, with the very significant rise in refinery and marketing   margins  That drove the gasoline price up the equivalent of an additional $5 per barrel on the price   of oil  The reason we talk in terms of net imports only is the presumption that domestic energy   earnings are recycled with a propensity to spend not significantly different from consumer spending    August 10, 2004 15 of 103          But that clearly has not been the case here because, despite the huge rise in refinery marketing   margins during the second quarter and indeed partly through the first quarter, there has been no   evident pickup in capital investment on the part of oil companies based in the United States  So in a   sense, the tax so far as households are concerned—or if you want to put it this way, the propensity   to save—has risen  And hence the multipliers have changed  I wonder whether that doesn’t put a   slightly different timing configuration on this because in the last several weeks we’ve observed that,   as crude prices have risen, gasoline prices have come down  Essentially that gap has now been   restored to where it was  If that is indeed the case, the impact of the oil effect on the third quarter is   not going to parallel the actual change in the price of crude  But how much different it will be is   hard to judge  Also, with respect to the question of the large inventory accumulation going on   worldwide, in one sense, I guess we don’t really care whether there is excess unused capacity or   capacity used to increase inventories above normal  We add the two of them; it’s the combination   of the two that’s really involved here      Yes  And that’s where this missing barrel question comes   from  It seems extraordinarily odd that after remarkably flat world consumption—at a little over   80 million barrels a day for a long period—suddenly demand has just taken off  We didn’t see that   during the 1990s, as I recall      Hasn’t their oil consumption gone from 4 million to 6 million   barrels a day in a couple of years, or something like that?       It’s the in-process inventories that are building up  If that is   indeed the case, then it’s not consumption      In large measure they don’t have room to store more oil  In   fact, they’re behind schedule on building their strategic reserve because they don’t have storage   capacity  Where is it all going?  Maybe there’s a big hole in the ground that they’re filling in     Is there any credible scenario in which the Russians would   allow that oil production to decline at these prices?      I think they have an incentive to make believe they are   cutting back to get the price up but to keep selling the oil      President Moskow      I think that’s a good point to make      There’s an interesting history here  Incidentally, there have   been significant periods of a so-called contango curve      In 1985, for example, the curve sloped up  Something   unusual happened about three to four years ago  Prior to then, the far distant six- to seven-year   futures huddled around $18 to $20 a barrel, which appeared to be the general judgment of what the   marginal supply price was in the long term outside of OPEC  And the six- to seven-year futures   price held in a very narrow range as the spot price went up and down very sharply  Indeed, the spot   price went well below $18 a barrel for a while, and at that point the longer-term futures were still   $18 to $20 a barrel   Sometime just a few years ago the long-term futures price started to move up, and it’s now   at $30 a barrel  The argument essentially being made by some—and I think it has some validity—is   that, prior to this recent period, the general world price was determined among commercial buyers   and sellers, or producers and users of oil, largely by the level of world inventories  Starting first   with the Intifada and the problems emerging gradually in the Middle East, the general assumption   that OPEC crude supply was secure began to deteriorate, and the situation has obviously gotten   significantly worse  What has happened is that a whole group of noncommercial interests, seeing   August 10, 2004 20 of 103          the geopolitical arbitrage, have decided that they want inventories of oil and that the best way to get   those inventories is to buy long-term futures  Now, the only people who can sell to noncommercial   interests are commercial interests  So those who own all the liquid barrels by definition have been   selling net claims to noncommercial interests, thereby reducing their supply  Or another way of   looking at it is that they are increasing the demand versus supply    The way to pick up these data is in the CFTC’s net position on the NYMEX  The   noncommercial interest is now net long; it has been long for some time and has been rising for quite   a while  It has gone up and down recently, but it still is net long  That means, in effect, that we   have a whole new set of buyers out there, but without changes occurring in the underlying general   level of the inventories     If this is the case, questions are being raised about what would happen if 4 or 5 million   barrels a day got knocked out of the Saudi crude supply because of some uprising or something like   that  That premium is in the market, and I think it’s a very interesting question as to how rapidly it   will disappear short of enough inventories actually being accumulated worldwide to satisfy the   needs of both commercial interests and the net speculative interests of those who have a sense of   geopolitical risk that they want to hedge  At some point, the latter group is going to get enough oil,   at which time they will stop their hedge buying  And at that point I think the price will come down      I think the best way of visualizing it is this  When what I’d   call the OPEC premium rises, the underlying ex-ante demand to hold inventories worldwide rises    If supply exceeds consumption, inventories will rise to the level at which that demand is sated, and   at some point it will be sated  The only issue is, Where is that number?     If oil goes to $80 a barrel you’ll be surprised at what—      I guess the staff’s estimates are that the supply of oil is close   to unitary elasticity over the long run in the United States and that it’s very inelastic in the short run    But with enough time, we just price ourselves out of the market      That’s a very important point      Governor Ferguson     Further questions for our colleagues?  If not, who would like   to start the Committee discussion?  President Moskow     Excuse me—was that for light vehicle or total sales?       President Poole   August 10, 2004 25 of 103            President Pianalto   August 10, 2004 26 of 103            President Santomero     President Guynn     President Hoenig     President Minehan     President Stern      President Yellen     Vice Chair     Governor Kohn      Governor Gramlich     Let’s break for coffee and return in ten or fifteen minutes   [Coffee break]   August 10, 2004 51 of 103            Governor Bernanke     President McTeer     Governor Ferguson     Governor Olson     Governor Bies      President Lacker     Let’s turn now to Brian Madigan     Questions for Brian?  If not, let me get started  I think one of   the problems we run into is that monthly estimates of employment have an exceptionally wide   potential variance  Remember, we’re dealing with 130 million workers, and 1 percent of that is still   a huge number  It is readily ascertainable that if we have significant volatility, as we also do in the   case of changes in productivity, we can get some remarkable statistical changes in the employment   data without all that much change in the growth pattern of overall economic activity  And, indeed, I   suspect that’s part of the problem we are running into     There is, however, a more general question that we have discussed in the past but that is   perhaps worthwhile reiterating  It relates to what is lacking in this recovery—namely, a degree of   enthusiasm on the part of the business community to move in advance of the numbers and expand   August 10, 2004 69 of 103          capital spending and hire employees before they are needed in an endeavor to be positioned to   accommodate anticipated growth in demand and perhaps improve market share at that time  In the   past, anticipatory business spending was reinforced by the fact that recessions were not as shallow   as the most recent recession or the one before that  As a consequence, the current cyclical rebound   does not have the momentum that one typically sees in an economic upswing, especially in terms of   an inventory turnaround that feeds on itself and induces a degree of aggressive activity on the part   of the business community  The latter shows up in surges in new orders, further inventory   accumulation, increased production, very significant hiring, and a slowdown in output per hour if   not in underlying structural productivity   What we are seeing in the data, as has been commented on previously, is a level of capital   investment and inventory investment that is falling significantly short of cash flows, a highly   untypical development  Why that is occurring is not all that difficult to hypothesize  Clearly, it   stems from the shallowness of the recent recession and the limited momentum of the resulting   rebound  But as we can perceive in detail at the micro level, we are also witnessing an unusual type   of concern that is not classifiable as business optimism or pessimism  It takes the form of a high   degree of caution stemming from the corporate scandals, the consequent aversion to risk-taking by   boards of directors, and the very clear rise in the hurdle rate of return in the last couple of years  We   can’t measure that readily on a macro level, but we can do so by listening to corporate executives   who say, with some exaggeration admittedly, that they spend a disproportionate amount of their   time with their general counsels  That means that when they go into the boardroom for a decision   on a capital project, which in the past typically used to be a pro forma activity, there is considerable   trepidation as to whether the final resolution will be that somebody will ask for the resignation of   the CEO   August 10, 2004 70 of 103          Now, all this may seem in some degree apocryphal, but in one sense it is not  To the extent   that we find a good deal more sluggishness in this recovery than can be accounted for by rising   energy prices, there have to be other reasons aside from the shallowness of the recent recession    Human concerns, if I may put it that way, do explain some of the sluggishness  In any event, what I   hear in talking to business executives is that the absence of the very significant surge in business   hiring and other spending that we ordinarily see is associated with widespread efforts to get the last   modicum of efficiency out of a company before a single new worker is hired  That’s what’s   happening  And, clearly, this has been an extraordinary period because, in all the history that I can   remember, we have not been through a surge in productivity of this nature in an environment of   considerable softness  This makes the jobs number a highly unstable number  It also makes it a far   less significant indicator of economic activity than I think we tend to regard it   We are usually of the view that the employment data released on the first Friday of every   month are the first real indication of economic activity that we see in that month  That was largely   true when productivity growth was 1½ percent and it didn’t vary all that much  Indeed, the hours   figure was as good a proxy for real GDP as we could get  But when we have the wide variances of   output per hour that we have been observing, we have to ask ourselves what, in fact, the   employment data contribute to our estimate of actual GDP  In a technical sense, the answer is   nothing  That’s the denominator of the productivity number  It’s not the numerator   If we assume that we already have data on GDP for July, which we have built up from the   product side, would we even advert to the employment figure to determine the GDP number?  The   only reason we do it is that we believe productivity growth is relatively stable  That was the case in   the past, but it’s highly questionable whether that’s the case today  What we do know is that what   determines the level of consumption is effectively income, and income is the mirror image of the   August 10, 2004 71 of 103          nominal GDP or of cash flow if you want to put it that way  To be sure, it does matter whether   consumer expenditures are being made by people who are employed or unemployed, but not all that   much  The propensity to spend out of cash flows is not evidently that different between the   employed and the unemployed  Therefore, the particular rate of productivity growth that distributes   income between the employed and the unemployed is not as critical an issue as I think analysts tend   to think it ought to be  This means that it doesn’t matter all that much what employment is  What   matters is income  And income in and of itself is a function of GDP   Now, we obviously use the employment data because they are so current, but we use them   in the context of the presumption that for any particular quarter there is a limit to GDP growth    How we behave with regard to the nth revision of the Greenbook forecast when new employment   data become available is that much of the change in employment ends up, as indeed it should, in the   productivity numbers and not in the level of GDP  Therefore, the emphasis we are putting on these   monthly employment changes is misplaced in my view     In any event, there does appear to be some pickup in the data for the third quarter,   fragmentary as they are  We clearly saw a significant rise in motor vehicle sales in July  Moreover,   Mike Moskow’s contacts at some of the motor vehicle companies are reporting that early August   sales suggest, if anything, an increase from the significantly elevated level of light vehicle sales in   July  If that turns out to be the case, we may start to get more widespread spending surprises on the   upside  The latter might not have an immediate effect on GDP, largely because they would be   offset by inventory reductions, but they would have such an effect down the road  We also have   seen chain store sales move up fairly consistently for the last number of weeks   The hesitancy in corporate borrowing, which has been associated in part with the excess   cash flows of recent quarters, may be coming to an end  Corporate borrowing has clearly picked up   August 10, 2004 72 of 103          in recent weeks  We’ve seen the largest numbers in some time on the issuance of bonds, extensions   of short-term debt, and even equity offerings  As a consequence, what we probably are observing is   a flattening of profit margins, and perhaps even some retrenchment; but clearly we are seeing the   beginnings of the type of pressure consistent with the financing gap exhibited in the Greenbook for   the fourth quarter  Remember, we are only about seven weeks away from the fourth quarter, and   something seems to be in the process of changing   In sum, it strikes me that the softness that was very evident in May and June is difficult to   find in the July numbers  I must admit that I find initial claims to be an important statistic because   the error rate variance in those numbers is very low  To be sure, the data on new hiring implicit in   the payroll figures, if you take them at face value, show a fairly pronounced decline in the rate of   new hiring  That seems odd because other data for recent months point to a significant pickup in the   turnover of jobs in that the number of employed people who are shifting jobs has gone up quite   significantly, at least in the household data  That is usually indicative of increased confidence in the   job market  In addition, no one has mentioned the quite strong consumer survey indications that   jobs are becoming increasingly plentiful  The Conference Board’s latest measure shows continued   strength in that regard  I have a healthy skepticism about the 629,000 employment increase in the   household data for July, but if we put June and July together the average is still quite large  The   variance, unfortunately, is also very large  While we have to be cautious about the employment   data, the markets in my judgment responded far more negatively to the release of the latest numbers   on Friday than I thought the underlying evidence warranted   This leads me to what I think policy ought to be, which—if you’ll excuse the expression—  I’ve termed “opportunistic disaccommodation”  [Laughter]       What that essentially means is that, given an unbiased   balance of risks at this stage, we should be choosing to raise rates, and we should endeavor to get   back to a neutral policy stance as quickly as we can  The more successful we are in doing so, the   better policy will be  I am a little concerned about leaving gaps in the timing of our moves largely   because that assumes that we can see into the future with some degree of accuracy  We have been   very fortunate with our announcements and our guidance to the markets in the last year or so  It’s   not something that we can repeat consistently  We will not be able to make statements that   somehow imply that we have great discretion on what it is we can choose to do, even as we say we   will be guided by the data  The problem is that we may be overwhelmed by the data and our policy   discretion may be completely lost in the process    Consequently, the sooner we can get back to neutral, the better positioned we will be  We   were required to ease very aggressively to offset the events of 2000 and 2001, and we took the funds   rate down to extraordinarily low levels with the thought in the back of our minds, and often said   around this table, that we could always reverse our actions  Well, reversing is not all that easy    That’s the reason why, when we have a chance to reverse as I think we do in this period, we should   take advantage of it  Moreover, anything other than moving at every meeting strikes me as   something that requires a hurdle of evidence greater than usual  I don’t deny that, if we suddenly   are confronted with exceptionally weak data or oil prices spike to $80 a barrel and we begin to see   some significant weakening in the economy, continuing to increase the federal funds rate in the face   of such developments would be a risky operation, even though I agree with Governor Gramlich,   who said that persistent tightening would in general be the appropriate course for policy  I can   conceive of developments that may argue against raising rates further at some point  In my   judgment, they would have to be very significant to stop us from getting back to a neutral policy   August 10, 2004 74 of 103          position and in a position to move in either direction  At that point, our balance of risks assessment   will truly guide the direction in which we will ultimately go   We’ve often discussed that ideally we’d like to be in a position where, when we move as we   did on June 30 and I hope today, the markets respond with a shrug What that means is that the   adjustment process is gradual and does not create discontinuous problems with respect to balance   sheets and asset values  That is not something we’re going to be able to accomplish very often  I   think we are able to do it in this period, and we should try as best we can to continue the tightening   process until we reach our objective  That would be the optimal outcome  But I frankly don’t   anticipate that we are going to be able to wend our way back to neutrality, wherever that ends up   being, without having any market disruptions as a consequence of moves that we make at meetings    This is an exceptionally difficult thing to do  Yet it’s the type of thing we ought to reach for and see   whether we can manage it, recognizing that if we succeed we should not say, “Well, we have now   solved the problem of monetary policy”  All we will have succeeded in doing is to have worked our   way out of a very difficult policy scenario that occurred as a consequence of the bubble economy   that emerged in the latter part of the last decade and the subsequent events  Therefore, what I’d like   to put on the table is that we move 25 basis points and make a statement equivalent to whatever   version is the revision that Brian was talking about  Would somebody like to comment?  President   Poole     I would argue against it      There’s nothing that prevents us from doing that     Well, it’s another side, but there is an interesting reason for   my position  If we’re going to make the statement that accommodation can be removed at a   measured pace and then we say, “Nonetheless, the Committee will respond to changes in economic   prospects as needed,” that is clearly related to price stability on the upside  It makes no sense to talk   about putting both price stability and maximum sustainable growth in that particular context  If   you’re going to do that, you might as well just take that sentence out completely  The internal   coherence of that, in my judgment, is questionable    In any event, to be sure, there are lots of different things that could be causing the softness,   but at least in my judgment, the major one is very clearly energy  Not to acknowledge energy as an   issue in this statement, with all the events that are going on, suggests that we’re working on a   August 10, 2004 76 of 103          different planet than the one on which we live  That is not to say, though, that there aren’t other   factors involved  In fact, the word “importantly” qualifies the role of energy prices; the statement   doesn’t say they are the “sole” reason for the softness we’re seeing  Governor Gramlich     President Minehan     President Moskow      Well, that thought is implicit  If we don’t believe that, why   are we moving the funds rate up 25 basis points?  So, essentially, it is implicit in our actions     Oh, absolutely, it is  And one of the things that I think we   are finding with the statement is that the increased flexibility we have created for ourselves by   working through the phraseology in the Bluebook gives us greater latitude to do these statements in   ways in which each meeting is handled idiosyncratically  From an exposition point of view, I think   that is essential   August 10, 2004 79 of 103            Governor Bernanke     President Santomero      President Lacker      President Hoenig     President Guynn     Do you mean the very last statement under “assessment of   risk”?     It reads, “Nonetheless, the Committee will respond to   changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability”     No, there’s nothing wrong with discussing the condition of   labor markets  It is part of our overall evaluation of what is going on in the economy  But the   argument that I was making is that we are overemphasizing the importance of employment as an   economic activity issue  In other words, one often hears that the purpose of the economy is to create   jobs  Well, every economy creates jobs, and the economies that create them more often than not are   subsistence economies—where the incentive to work in one way or another is complete  You don’t   have unemployment in subsistence economies  So, it is a question of getting a notion of the   sequence of events in terms of what causes what  That’s the only issue that I was addressing     President Stern     President McTeer     Governor Kohn     It’s not as good an indicator as when productivity is not   moving around     Actually, you’re raising the issue that Governor Gramlich   raised, which is the level of employment as distinct from the change and the level of the   unemployment rate  These are other indicators and goals of policy  I’m talking mainly about   working off the employment statistics in our analytic evaluation of how the economy is doing as   distinct from raising the question of whether full employment, however we define it, is a desirable   goal in the same sense that full utilization of resources is a desirable goal  I should hope it is    Indeed, that’s what we are mandated by statute to adhere to as a goal  But that is not the first   difference question, which I think Governor Gramlich very appropriately pointed out  Governor   Ferguson     Are we doing that?     Vice Chair     That’s not what I said     In fact, we purposely surprised the market in January 2001    We structured our announcement so that the market would truly be surprised, as you may recall, by   moving the date up on when we actually made a move  So I’m not arguing that surprise has no   August 10, 2004 85 of 103          value  I’m basically saying that, if we have to surprise the market, by definition we are behind the   curve     We have on occasion run into situations where there was a   50 percent probability of our moving one way or the other, which meant that no matter what we did,   it would be a significant surprise That has not been the case recently  But I’m not sure we know   how to avoid that  Governor Bies      President Yellen     I happen to agree with you on that  I think it’s a very   difficult issue, and it’s one that Vincent will discuss for a few minutes a little later  President   Pianalto     Would you read the appropriate language, Mr Secretary?     Please call the roll      Good morning, everyone  Would somebody like to move   approval of the minutes for our August 10 meeting?     Without objection, they are approved  Dino Kos      Shouldn’t your next-to-last sentence be, “Noted and   complimented”?  [Laughter]  Why do we bother intervening at all in the functioning of reserve   markets a week or so before an FOMC meeting?     That is readily changed  [Laughter]     If I might say so, it sounds absurd on the surface, and it   sounds absurd beneath the surface as well!  [Laughter]      All he needs to do is to state what his intentions are in   advance  In other words, he can indicate that he will supply a certain amount of reserves over a   September 21, 2004 6 of 100          specific period  The current approach is clearly not the optimal policy procedure  I’m not sure   it’s doing any harm or causing problems, but I can conceive of a situation in which we might   find that the injection of reserves on the upside or on the downside leads to an inadvertent effect   if an external event occurs in the process when you’re reestablishing the balance later in the   maintenance period     May I make a request?  I’d like to ask you and Vincent to   be a committee of two to do an analysis of this problem  And then will you submit possible   alternatives to the current procedure at the next FOMC meeting?     Is there agreement on that?  Or would somebody like to   make a comment?     I’m saying that may be a possibility  Let me put it to you   this way  All I can say is that, on the surface, the way we’re doing this now doesn’t seem right   to me  To be sure, we’ve gone through this experience several times, and it has had no adverse   consequences The reason it has had no consequences, possibly, is that there were no intervening   events in the rest of the maintenance period that required an adjustment  Now, it may turn out   September 21, 2004 7 of 100          upon reviewing this issue that the existing policy has no alternative, but I doubt it  Let me   withdraw my request at this point because I had assumed the need to look at this was self-  evident, but it is not self-evident  As a consequence, I think we ought to open the matter up for   further discussion  Are there any other comments on this issue?  President Minehan      Well, there have been very serious questions over the   years about whether the Desk should be trying to lock in the desired federal funds rate every   single day So, first of all, the funds rate has not been at 1½ percent     So whether that degree of rigidity should be involved here   is no longer an issue  It’s now a question of the degree of deviation from the objective, not   whether there should be any deviation  In that sense, if we want to read the directive explicitly,   Dino has breached the authority given him—which I’m glad he did     There could be other ways of doing it  I don’t necessarily   see all of the commentary about Desk operations  Has anybody commented on specific   deviations from the funds rate target—other than the obvious anticipatory arbitrage against a   potential rise?      Remember, there’s another aspect of this  By Committee   desire, we have been changing the funds rate only at meetings That was not the case in the past    So there’s another element implicit in this to which the market is adjusting  All I’m saying,   though, is that the current practice does not seem to me to be the optimum, thoroughly thought-  out procedure to guard against the one single issue that we haven’t faced—a shock in the   maintenance period subsequent to the Committee’s decision     Well, there are numerous people around this table who are   far more familiar with the actual mechanical operations on a day-by-day basis than I  But just   September 21, 2004 9 of 100          looking at the final result, it seems clear to me that something here doesn’t work as well as it   should and that there may be better ways of doing it  That’s all I’m saying     And no adverse event occurs during the maintenance   period  It’s only that that matters  There’s no credible argument, if there is no adverse event,   that these intra-maintenance-period fluctuations have any lasting significance, as best I can tell     President Lacker     Should the Desk today and yesterday create sufficient   reserves to keep the funds rate at 15 percent?     He’s not doing it right      Now, wait a second  He has no limit on the amount of   reserves he can create at will  You cannot tell me he is trying and failing; he’s just not pushing   the button hard enough    September 21, 2004 11 of 100            I didn’t mean to get into this  [Laughter]  Unless others   wish to raise significant issues about this today, let me ask you the following  Does everybody   agree that this is a subject that we should at least get some further insight into and that we should   leave it to our two professionals in this area to advise us?  Go ahead, Governor Bies     For the same reasons we’ve created the carry trade,   because if you lock in with some permanence one leg of it, that reduces the risk—      Governor Ferguson      Okay  President Santomero, do you want to say a word   before we end?     Strangely enough, it’s the first time, in my recollection,   that we have projected a potential path of monetary policy in a manner that was wholly credible   to the market, which is what has created this very unusual situation     Questions on other issues to Dino?  If not, would   somebody like to move to ratify the domestic transactions in the System account?      Vincent Reinhart, you wanted to mention something about   the minutes?     Not at the moment  I want to put the FOMC meeting on   pause, as we like to say, and ask that the Board members proceed to my office       Would everyone be seated please?  I would like to report   that by unanimous vote the Board of Governors accepted the requests of the twelve Reserve   Banks for an increase of ¼ percentage point in the discount rate—much to everybody’s surprise!   As we close today, I would like to take a moment to recognize and to thank the   gentleman sitting on my right because this is Normand Bernard’s final meeting as Deputy   Secretary of the Committee  He has announced his intention to retire from the Federal Reserve   September 21, 2004 87 of 100          effective at the beginning of November  It is the end of an era  Norm has worked at the Federal   Reserve for more than forty-two years  As far as we can tell, today’s meeting is the 345th that   Norm has attended in serving this Committee, and I want to emphasize the word “serve”  His   dedication, his integrity, and his willingness to do whatever needed to be done have meant that   Committee members could always count on him  His institutional memory, as you well know, is   prodigious, as of course are his files!  [Laughter]   From a personal perspective, he and his team have been a pleasure to work with   throughout our meetings and in the preparation of the minutes and transcripts  And Norm   always has an amusing story to contribute  I have here in my hand a piece of paper, which is a   bit yellowed, signed in 1962 by William McChesney Martin, granting Norm access to the   minutes and other confidential material of the Federal Open Market Committee  As the fourth   Chairman of the Federal Reserve since then, I regret that I am the one to witness the end of   Norm’s extraordinary forty-two years   Today, Norm, we hope you will consent to join us in having a group picture taken   because we would like to have it inscribed and presented to you as a token of our sincere   appreciation  Moreover, I understand that there is a cake in the next room prepared for us as part   of the celebration  It has the number “345” outlined on its frosting  That, I can assure you, is not   the calorie count  [Laughter]  It’s commemorating the record number of FOMC meetings that   you have attended  I know I speak for the entire Committee when I express our deep gratitude   for your hard work, your good humor, and your steadfast support over the years  We wish you   the very best in the future      Without objection they are approved  David Stockton and   Karen Johnson, please     For the first time, Karen, you seem to be painting a short-  term picture of an unsustainable pattern in the current account deficit As I have listened to you   in the past, the issues as I’ve heard them are that we always talk of the need for a much higher   rate of increase in exports than imports to close the huge existing gap between them  You are   now raising a somewhat more subtle issue in which it is not only the gap but the absolute size of   the foreign trade magnitudes relative to GDP that have an accelerating impact  In other words, if   we had a very small external sector but a very large difference between imports and exports, the   percentage of the current account deficit to GDP would be small despite that sizable percentage   difference in the growth of exports and imports  But now that the trade numbers are getting   larger and larger in absolute terms, their impact on GDP—other things being equal with regard   to the ratio of imports to exports—is becoming ever larger and a source of increasing instability   The reason is that, as the current account deficit continues to widen because the growth of   exports fails to exceed that of imports, the bases of both are changing  And if under such   conditions the deficit is rising relative to the GDP, we have an arithmetically unsustainable   pattern even in the short run     I’m not asking a question, I’m just making a statement     Am I inferring correctly what you say?     I think that’s a very useful insight   September 21, 2004 22 of 100            I have one quick question on energy issues  On virtually   all the previous occasions when oil prices went up, it was difficult to distinguish between rising   prices of gasoline and home heating oil and rising crude import prices  So the estimate of the tax   effect from imported crude and the impact of gasoline prices on PCE gave roughly the same   answers, as I recall  We have an unusual test period in the second and third quarters of this   year—in fact, probably all of this year—in which, because of the huge differential spreads in   refinery marketing, we’re getting different results  Does that enable us to econometrically   differentiate where the real impact is?  In other words, does it show up in the equations in   shortfalls of consumption expenditures as a consequence of the rise in gasoline prices or a later   rise in crude oil prices?  Or is it too soon to make that judgment?     An interesting question is whether drilling is a function of   profits at the production level, which one has always assumed to be the case, or if the aggregate   consolidated profit is more relevant  I say that because the implication here is that the propensity   to spend out of the refining marketing margin may be much lower than the propensity to spend   out of the profits from crude and natural gas production, which would signal another way of   coming at this particular issue  President Yellen     President Moskow      Or ours unwind    September 21, 2004 26 of 100            President Minehan      Not quite  Now, if I believed in the efficacy of   intervention, which I do not, it would not surprise me to be sitting here and observing the   sequence of events that Dino has described this morning  Dino is talking about reductions in   volatility and related increases in stability  We’re looking at an extraordinarily stable system in   which there is a benign response to 75 basis points—or will be  [Laughter]  Well, I’m not prone   to avoid making forecasts!    September 21, 2004 31 of 100          The question that I think arises is whether, on the basis of history as Karen points out, we   can get through these periods without crises, as a developing literature around the world   suggests If there were a way in which we could move the dollar’s exchange rate down   significantly in a manner that had no secondary effects, would we not want to accomplish that?    Would we prefer the euro–dollar relationship at this stage to be at 145 instead of 122?  The   answer is, “Yes, we would”  But we don’t know how to get there  The general presumption   might be that we can get there through intervention, but the experience with interventions   suggests otherwise  There are some people here who were at the Fed during the Plaza Accord   period  I was not, but I was watching from the outside, and I don’t recall a lot of intervention    My recollection was that in February 1985 the dollar and the pound sterling were almost at parity   at one point  The situation was like an avalanche waiting to break; and when the G-5 met and   released a few statements, the avalanche did break  There wasn’t a great deal of intervention,   but it appeared to be extraordinarily successful  That struck me in retrospect as sheer luck  I   don’t recall that the G-5 said anything of great significance    We have a degree of credibility in the Federal Reserve, but I’m not at all certain that if,   for example, the Secretary of the Treasury and a number of us started talking in that direction,   we would knock the dollar–euro exchange rate down sharply  I hesitate to think of the   consequences If it were easy to do, I would recommend it  The problem here is that there is a   wide consensus that this is the time we want the devaluation of the dollar to happen, not later   when the economy may be in a weakened structural situation     And with respect to the issue that we discussed earlier, the   absolute level of our current account deficit was lower     You couldn’t do it and control it      Well, that in a way is what we’ve been trying to do    We’ve been trying to do that obviously by persuading the Chinese and others who have been   intervening in the foreign exchange market  What I find disturbing about the scenario that Karen   has outlined is that we may achieve the adjustment in a wholly inappropriate macroeconomic   environment  I’m not saying there’s anything we can do or say about it, but I don’t think we can   just push the issue aside  Who else in the world is going to think about this other than the   September 21, 2004 33 of 100          Federal Reserve?  There’s no one else in the American government  On the G-7, there’s really   no one else but the United States  To the extent that events of this nature go on, they are   observed and evaluated but without some notion of whether there are policy relationships   involved  I’m just saying that, if we don’t do it, I don’t know who else will  As I look around   the world, there are a lot of very good people, a lot of thoughtful people, but the mechanism   through which adjustments would occur is the G-7     Or the G-10  The trouble is that if we go from G-7 to   G-10, I’m not sure that’s an improvement  So as a matter of course, I would not merely say that   there’s nothing we can do about it and that we should just forget about trying to do so and go on   our merry way  The problem is that no one else is doing anything  The probability of our   thinking about it and coming up with and doing something constructive is very low, but it’s not   zero, and it’s probably zero for most of the rest of the world  President Santomero      Governor Gramlich      I think it will take an Immaculate Conception      It’s extremely hard  But I would say that we are in the   best position, with the best resources, to think about it  The probability is that in the end we will   come up with nothing worthwhile  But unless we keep thinking about it, I don’t think we can do   our own job on American monetary policy       That’s an important insight about the nature of the   adjustment process  The fact that you cannot forecast exchange rates is telling you something   good about the flexibility of the adjustment process, which in itself is a useful insight in terms of   knowing what to do analytically and from a policy point of view     President Hoenig     Our dialogue with the staff regarding the economic   outlook was a little lengthier than usual, but I think it was a very important discussion  It does   impose some time constraints on us going forward, however; so I would request that we try to   keep our comments slightly less lengthy—unless, obviously, one has important things to say!    [Laughter]  With that, who would like to start off?  President Moskow    September 21, 2004 37 of 100            President Poole   September 21, 2004 39 of 100            President McTeer     President Minehan     President Pianalto     President Lacker     President Stern     I gather your bottom line is to recommend to those of us   who root for the Baltimore Orioles that we move to St Paul!  [Laughter]     President Santomero     Shall we break for coffee?   [Coffee break]     President Yellen      Vice Chair     President Hoenig     President Guynn     Governor Kohn     Governor Gramlich     Governor Bernanke     Governor Olson     Governor Ferguson   September 21, 2004 70 of 100            Governor Bies      Thank you very much  Mr Reinhart     Thank you  Questions for Vincent?     Further questions?  If not, let me make just a few short   remarks  The general outlook, as best I can judge, has been fairly well described around this   table, and I don’t have anything significant to add  I do want to respond in a way to President   Minehan’s last remark The only thing that I think should be, and probably is, on the table, is   whether we should encourage lower ten-year interest rates, given how close they are to levels   that would prompt a lot of mortgage refinancings and a significant drop in duration in the   mortgage market, with the potential cumulative effects of such a development that others have   pointed to   We have to be careful largely because, while there’s no question that some softening has   occurred in the overall expansion of the economy, the numbers in the Greenbook, if they   materialize, are really quite strong, and in that regard it’s quite credible to forecast much more   September 21, 2004 81 of 100          rapid growth in employment than we have experienced in recent months  That’s largely because   the standard error in the payroll series is quite large, and other indicators of employment have   been quite a bit stronger than the payroll series  For example, in recent months the net difference   between hires and separations in the private sector has shown strength, job openings have   increased, and initial claims have been remarkably low  So it is by no means out of the question,   especially since productivity growth is probably slowing at this stage, to come up with some   outsized employment number  And if we take seriously the scatter diagram that Vincent has   shown with respect to the response to employment surprises, we could get a fairly dramatic   change in financial conditions in this particular market   One concern in the latter regard is that the carry trade has come back  If duration falls on   top of that, we may end up with a situation that, in the event of an employment surprise, could   create some significant collateral damage in the balance sheets of American businesses, with   negative repercussions on the economy  Remember that a surprise in which interest rates fall   and, hence, create capital gains in balance sheets, never caused anybody to go broke  There’s an   asymmetry here relating to the speed of adjustment   So it strikes me that, even if it is our opinion today that we will pause at the November   meeting, we should not convey that message at this point because we would be taking risks that I   think are unnecessary and could be quite costly if we are wrong  On the other hand, the risk of   fostering a presumption at this meeting that we will increase rates further in November and even   in December leaves us in a position where we can pause in either of those two months or in both,   if we choose to do so, without significant consequences  If we do decide to pause later in the   year, we will end up with lower long-term rates, higher bond prices, and presumably higher asset   prices on the balance sheets of a number of financial institutions   September 21, 2004 82 of 100          In sum, I think we have to lean against conveying the presumption that we will pause or   essentially bring to an end our current policy course, which I think has been more successful   than we generally expected when we initiated it  Keeping our press statement essentially   unchanged but obviously leaving open the possibility of a policy change therefore strikes me as   the best thing to do  Accordingly, I recommend a 25 basis point increase in the federal funds   rate and a basically unchanged statement as in alternative B  Remember that we have a seven-  week interval before the next meeting, and a lot can happen one way or the other in that period    Before we take a vote, I’d like to have copies of the proposed statement distributed  Why don’t   we all read the draft release, and the floor will then be open for discussion  [Pause]  President   Poole     Governor Bernanke     President Moskow     President Stern   September 21, 2004 83 of 100            President Hoenig     President Minehan     Let me put it this way, if the Greenbook projections   actually turn out to be right, that would be extraordinary      President Lacker     President Pianalto     President Santomero     Governor Kohn     Governor Ferguson     Vice Chair     Governor Olson     President Yellen     President McTeer     President Guynn     Governor Bies     Mr Secretary, will you read the appropriate language?     Sorry, I didn’t mean to skip you  I realize that silence   would not have been your position     Call the roll     Good morning, everyone  Welcome, Madam Acting   President  It’s a pleasure to have you here     And we welcome Debbie Danker, an old Fed veteran You   were here when I arrived originally  Lord knows how long you were here to begin with!    [Laughter]  Anyway, welcome back, and we wish you well     Incidentally, for those of you who don’t have it on your   calendar, our farewell luncheon for Bob McTeer is planned for after the next meeting  I just wanted   to make you all aware of that  Would somebody like to move approval of the minutes of the   September 21 meeting?     Without objection, they are approved  Officially we need to   select Deborah J Danker as Deputy Secretary to serve until the election of a successor at the first   meeting of the Committee after December 31, 2004  Would somebody like to move that   nomination?     Without objection, that is approved  Dino Kos, you are on     Why don’t you do that?    Yes, why don’t you get it out of the way?      Let me just say up front, since I was the one who raised the   issue originally, that I thought you reviewed it quite effectively, and I personally concur with the   position that you’ve come to     With respect to the TIPS ten-year rate, the oil price has had a very unusual effect on it over   the years, and one of the reasons is that the spread of the crude oil seven-year futures has behaved   rather differently relative to the spot price in recent years than it had previously  Since the spread   between light sweet crude prices, for which the WTI is the best measure, and gasoline and home   heating oil prices is reasonably flat, can’t we take the forward WTI price, convert it into a gasoline   and home heating oil price and subtract that from the CPI—with the CPI weights—to get   effectively a judgment as to what core rate is implied in the CPI, presuming that the food   component is average?  That gets around the question of trying to answer to what extent the recent   oil prices affect the forecast of the CPI that is embodied in the TIPS yield  Is that something you   can do readily?     You take the long-term forecast?     You don’t take the crude price?  You take the crude plus   markup, I assume  Is that what you’re saying?   November 10, 2004 7 of 107      In that context, how would this very latest run-up since the   end of October look?     It’s lower, but it’s less lower than—     And because the spot prices have moved so dramatically,   though the spreads have not changed all that much, there has been a significant closing of the   percentage gap in prices even though the absolute gap has opened up     I was curious how all that turns out because it’s pretty   evident that the ten-year TIPS compensation is giving us a quite significantly different reading    And it would be useful to know whether or not it’s merely a statistical issue—with one based on   core inflation and the other based on the total CPI—or if there’s something more deep-seated there     It’s terribly important for us to get judgments on what the   TIPS is showing  We can always talk about its liquidity or say that it’s X or Y  Some day we’ll   look back and say that the TIPS market was giving us signals and we had too many excuses as to   why we weren’t looking at it     I think that’s useful to know     Questions for Dino either on the presentation or on Vincent   and Dino’s conclusions with respect to the discussion we had last time?  Governor Kohn     Let’s stay on the subject  Are you on this subject?     Let me just say that we have a very delicate problem to deal   with  Being involved with monetary policy and, indeed, by tying monetary policy as we do to the   global environment, we can’t make believe that the current account deficit is irrelevant  And we   can’t basically argue that it will essentially adjust without market forces being critically involved    Yet there is no question that we have to avoid conveying the perception that we are essentially   talking the dollar down because we think that’s what would be required to adjust the imbalances    It’s a very tricky issue    I have a tough problem because I was invited by Jean Claude Trichet to appear on a   European panel sometime late next week  And the subject matter is the euro  Now, I could get   November 10, 2004 11 of 107    around the issue very readily in my prepared remarks, but there is a forty-minute Q&A period with   a panel of only Jean Claude, me, and one of the Vice Governors of the Bank of Japan  So I’m in   the process of writing a speech in which I replicate to some extent what I’ve said before on the   current account balance—where it’s coming from, what the issues are, and essentially arguing at the   end that there is significant evidence that high current account deficits of developed countries have   in virtually all cases adjusted without crisis  What I don’t usually say is that invariably a significant   element in that adjustment is a decline in the real exchange rate   Now, I’m trying to put together something that re-emphasizes what I’ve said before—which   is accurate as best we can judge—and that is that the inability to forecast exchange rates in the   intermediate period is an extraordinarily robust statistical conclusion  Indeed, one can find all sorts   of examples where everybody is projecting that a currency will move in one direction and it goes in   the other  I intend to put enough discussion of that in my statement to indicate that there is no   short-term issue here with respect to the dollar  And I plan to talk as well about the fundamental   questions that, as a practical matter, get down to the government deficit  And that’s it   We have evidently very poor capabilities of addressing private saving  We’ve tried   everything under the sun  Some of it works better than others  None of it obviously works very   well, if you just look at the straight downward trend in the household saving rate  So I think what   I’m going to try to do, and I hope that the rest of you will try to do so, is to emphasize the one area   where it will matter, which is fiscal policy  And I think that we can have some effect  There is a   growing awareness in the Administration that this issue really has to be addressed and that it   requires a significant turnaround in what has been going on in recent years  I think there is a   recognition that that has to be done  If we are out there encouraging that, which we of course have   been doing generally for quite a long period of time, I think that could be a positive force   November 10, 2004 12 of 107    I would scarcely say to you, “ Don’t discuss the current account deficit”  That’s like not   talking about the crazy aunt in the closet  You have no choice  It is an element of significance in   the outlook, and the forces that are driving it one way or the other are things we have discussed over   time  But the one thing we have to try to avoid, to the extent that we can possibly do so, is to imply   that an imminent decline in the exchange rate is in front of us  If we do that, then observers will   presume that there is either some generalized official view about that on the part of the FOMC or   that individually, without an official position, we all believe the same thing  And the credibility of   the FOMC, which we take great pride in, will work against us  Everyone will presume, irrespective   of their own views, that we understand the markets, and they will behave accordingly  And that   could create some fairly significant problems for stabilization  So we now have three subjects on   the table  Would anybody else like to comment?     Sure, by all means     Further questions for Dino or Vincent?     Yes, let’s first move approval of the Desk’s domestic   operations  Would somebody like to do so?   SPEAKER(?)  Yes  I so move     Without objection, they are approved  Now, we’ve had three   comments on the memo that was circulated and that Dino has discussed  Unless I hear significant   negatives, I will assume that those three “votes” so to speak capture the consensus of the group  So   if any you would disagree with the recommendation of Dino and Vincent, please speak up  Or if   anyone wishes to add something relevant to their conclusion that reinforces it, speak up  [Laughter]     I want to confirm that the next FOMC meeting is scheduled   for Tuesday, December 14  Before adjourning, the FOMC will go into recess while the Board   members join me in my office to discuss discount rate requests    [Recess]        The Federal Reserve Board has just voted to raise the   discount rate at the request of ten of the Reserve Banks  This FOMC meeting is now adjourned   END OF MEETING      November 10, 2004 92 of 107        I guess you win on both counts  We will move on then to   David Stockton and Karen Johnson     Questions for our colleagues?  President Poole      President Moskow     Remember, that a flat forecast—because scrappage is   rising—implies a significant slowdown in the rate of increase in the number of vehicles on the road    That probably has to occur at some point because we’re running out of space  But that’s a forecast   that was more confidently made a decade ago, as the market continued to rise  I think it has become   November 10, 2004 22 of 107    a very tough forecast to make  In my view, David is just as likely to be right as the whole structure   of the research operation of GM     I’m just worried about running out of street space     President Santomero     Vice Chairman     President Minehan     Further questions?  Karen, I noticed that the unit import   price excluding petroleum for the month of October, which was released today, is negative for the   first time this year  Do you have any notions as to what that is about?     Could you take a look at that when you have a chance?     If there are no other questions, who would like to start the   Committee discussion?  President Moskow     President Poole     President Minehan     President Yellen   November 10, 2004 34 of 107      President Lacker     President Hoenig     President Guynn     President Santomero     President Pianalto     President Stern     Shall we take a coffee break and return in fifteen minutes,   please   [Coffee break]     First Vice President Holcomb     I thought there was more horsepower  [Laughter]     Vice Chair     Governor Kohn     Governor Bernanke     Governor Bies     Governor Gramlich     Governor Olson     Governor Ferguson   November 10, 2004 67 of 107      Mr Reinhart     Thank you  Questions for Vincent?  President Minehan      Further questions?  If not, let me get started  We are seeing   what appears to be the first indication in this Committee of an increased variance of opinion which,   November 10, 2004 74 of 107    if you go back over the previous meetings, you will find was virtually nonexistent  The reason that   our opinions are only now beginning to spread is that the policy stance we’ve taken over the last   year or two has been very unusual  During this period, we have had a very substantial and   surprising growth in productivity, which drove unit labor costs down and created a view that   inflation had very little probability of emerging  Therefore we could be fairly well convinced that a   low funds rate, a highly accommodative funds rate, could be maintained for quite a significant   period of time  As a result, our general policy and the variety of terminology that we began to use,   including “patient” and “considerable period,” became the central mantra of this Committee   I think that period is coming to an end  It’s not that we suddenly found some extraordinary   capability to communicate to the markets our views, which would then craft their general   expectations  It’s that the last couple of years were a very special and unusual period and not likely   to be continued into the future  We’re going to move back, I suspect, far closer to our more general   position, which at one point was that we never projected the future, we merely tried to give a sense   of the balance of risks  That assessment often didn’t convey very much because we didn’t behave   as though we really viewed it as a projection; we responded largely to the data as they evolved  My   suspicion is that we’re moving back in that direction, and we’re beginning to see the reasons for   that in the context of structural productivity gains   If, indeed, structural productivity growth is 2¾ percent and if the general response of the   wage market to the unemployment rate continues where it is, we will end up with, as the projection   in fact implies, a 4 percent increase in compensation per hour and around 1¼ percent for the core   inflation rate  Were we able confidently to project that indefinitely into the future, we could be   fairly well convinced that inflation will be contained   The only problem is that our ability to make judgments about separating cyclical from   structural output-per-hour changes is questionable or, I would say, modest at best  This issue is   November 10, 2004 75 of 107    coming forward, for example, in the context of the slowdown in high-tech investment, which a   number of people have mentioned  Now, if there is, indeed, a slowdown in high-tech investment   or, as the Vice Chair of the Board of Governors indicated publicly, if the slower rate of decline in   high-tech prices is suggesting a reduction in the extent to which the high-tech area is contributing to   productivity, then we have to ask where we should place the long-term productivity number  And   what is our confidence level for that number?  It’s quite likely at this stage that 2¾ percent may well   be the right number  I say that in part because, despite the 337,000 increase in employment in   October, if you examine the hires less separations, which theoretically should be coming from the   same data source, that series is showing a smoother trend of gradual decline in the rate of job gains    The latest data we have on that obviously are for September  That series shows less volatility than   the payroll numbers but, on average, is not terribly different from the payroll series since the   beginning of the year; both indicate a gradual slowing  If that were, indeed, the trend, then the   productivity outlook is better  If it is not and we are looking at an acceleration of employment, then   chances are we are getting closer to a level of structural productivity growth that is lower than   2¾ percent   Now, the reason I raise this issue is that, although we may choose 2¾ as our number, the   argument that 1¾ may actually be what we’re looking at is not readily dismissible  Making the   distinction between what is happening short-term in output per hour and what is happening to   underlying productivity is very difficult  Indeed, the data for the numerator of output per hour come   from a source wholly different from that of the denominator  I think we felt a sense of comfort that   a goodly part of the productivity growth had to be structural when we had this very high rate of   growth  That was almost certainly the case because the numbers were so high  As a result, what   we were observing was definite downward pressure on inflation, to the point in fact where we were   at the edge of being really quite concerned about the onset of deflation  That is no longer the case    November 10, 2004 76 of 107    And I think we’re beginning to confront problems that really bring us back to the way we used to do   forecasting, which had much wider areas of variance  Clearly, the variance of the views of this   group is beginning to reflect that   Earlier we discussed the issue of the dollar  We’re not sure exactly how to translate the   exchange rate into unit import costs  Indeed, for those of us who were in Basel the last couple of   days, the startling new piece of information was that the fascinating decline in the rate of pass-  through of exchange rates into unit import prices, a decline that is progressing in the United States   at a fairly remarkable pace, is exactly what they are finding in the United Kingdom, according to   Mervyn King at the Bank of England  When he raised that point and I mentioned our findings on   that, everybody looked around, and there was general agreement that we were all seeing the same   phenomenon  It all started, as you may recall, in the failure of the devaluations in Brazil and   Argentina to create increased inflation, which they did not  Something very unusual is going on   with respect to the exchange rate translation issue  And this is obviously a very important question   for how we view currency depreciation and inflation and, therefore, what the implications are for   monetary policy     We have very significant problems with private saving  The household saving rate has   come down very dramatically and now is close to zero  We have to resist the notion that there’s   some floor at zero, which the saving rate can’t go below, and that therefore it must flatten and turn   up  The idea of having a negative personal saving rate is not out of line with the way the world   works  Remember, the average household does not look at the book value of its equity holdings,   which is what the saving rate is  The average household looks at the market value  And we can   readily have, as our data have shown in the past, a negative saving rate with a significant part of the   population believing that they are saving at a fairly pronounced rate, which has been the experience   of recent years  We don’t know how that is going to come out   November 10, 2004 77 of 107    We do know that Australia, as I understand it, has had a negative saving rate for a while    Our flow-of-funds accounts here do not show a negative saving rate, but they indicate that almost   all of the change in the saving rate in the last decade has been in the upper quintile of the income   distribution, and there it is driven very substantially by asset values  People in the upper quintile   look at the market value of what they own  Adjusting their saving behavior in response to the book   value of their net worth would never enter anybody’s mind  Hence, this is a synthetic number, and   let’s be careful not to presume very much about what it is telling us   The fiscal issue is very critical because it is the only issue in which policy per se has a clear   positive contribution to make  It is going to be very interesting to see how this plays out  I must   say that I’ve turned a little optimistic in the last week or so listening to some of the Administration   people in this respect  I’m not sure whether it will translate into something of significance or   whether in fact, Ned, as you put it, “we all know how likely” that is   When it comes to policy, with the increased uncertainties that we have about how the   economic situation is evolving, we have to acknowledge to ourselves that our forecast is going to be   wrong  It always is  We expect it to be wrong  The question is, Where do we want to take the   risks?  If we project continued low core inflation because of a 2¾ percent projection for structural   productivity growth and that growth is in fact at 2 percent or less, inflation expectations will rise,   bond yields will rise, and asset prices will fall, as, of course, will the dollar in that context  We   could face problems of balance sheet losses if the change is rapid  Our ability to separate cyclical   from structural changes in output per hour, as I said before, is modest at best  Should inflation   expectations rise, the higher the funds rate, the better position monetary policy will be in to address   unexpected inflation increases   If we signal today a pause for December, the ten-year note yield will decline, engendering   an even larger correction should underlying inflation unexpectedly rise in the months ahead    November 10, 2004 78 of 107    Capital gains do not impair balance sheets  Capital losses do, however, especially if they are rapid    If rates move up and the economy slows, the ten-year yield will decline and possibly equity prices   as well, but balance sheets will not be impaired  The structural damage obviously would be quite   limited in that regard  Should the economy weaken, of course, we always have the option of   moving rates lower     It strikes me, therefore, that even if we believe the risks are symmetric with respect to how   the economy is going to emerge, a cost–benefit analysis of the consequences of our taking various   actions leads me to conclude that we would be far better positioned today not only to move 25 basis   points but also to signal nothing about December  The best thing that can happen is for the market   to perceive that we are implying another rate increase in December because the further beyond the   1 percent range and into a positive real rate that we can get, the better off I think we will be     I want to repeat that we don’t know very much about the interaction of very large   productivity gains, wage rates, unit labor costs, and the NAIRU  We’ve been experiencing these   gains only in recent years  I personally would feel a lot more comfortable if the federal funds rate   were back in a range that is consistent with much of our historical data rather than on the edges of a   number of our econometric functions of how the economy works  The edges are significant in the   overall picture, but I wonder how much emphasis we can put on the outer edge  Their significance   depends on whether or not the functions are bending in one way or another, whether they are still   linear, or what their nature is at those points  Therefore, overall, I think we are far better positioned   to get the funds rate up as fast as we can this year and then recognize that we have time to discuss   pausing as we get into next year  Now, in the December meeting we may want to suggest a pause   for February 2, which I guess would be the particular day of the meeting  That will very much   depend on what is evolving  If, for example, the weakness in the high-tech area continues into next   year, I’m not sure how to read that  If it says that we’re getting much less in the way of   November 10, 2004 79 of 107    technological advance, it suggests that the productivity growth rate is lower  If it is suggesting that   capital investment is going to slow, we get a potential decline in the outlook for real GDP     How we should play this is going to depend very much on how these numbers evolve, and   at this particular stage, I think that we have to start preparing for a communication transition as we   get into the early weeks and months of next year  We do have our semiannual report on monetary   policy in which to make a very broad statement  But we may have to decide something in   December about how we want to position ourselves for February, especially if, as now seems likely,   we move another 25 points in December   What I’d like to propose is that we move 25 basis points today and have a statement that is   as little changed as possible, so we seem neutral with respect to the move we might or might not   make in December  Then we can proceed to observe how the data evolve over the next number of   weeks  It is very unlikely to turn out that an upward move in December will be inappropriate and   yet the markets will not have made that judgment already  If we deem a move in December   inappropriate, it will be because of the types of evidence that will move the federal funds rate and   indeed the whole financial structure  So the concerns that we would have about moving in a   manner that would shock the market would not be relevant  I don’t think that is going to be a   problem, but I do think we have to start thinking of the word “measured” as having a fairly short   life expectancy  We have to begin to reflect on how to approach our communications in a way that   will be more consistent with an increased variance of opinion in this Committee in coming months,   as I think is going to be the case  President Hoenig     Maybe we ought to circulate the potential statement so that,   if you find that any of the language is inconsistent with your views, you can comment on it  Why   don’t we do that?  It’s the one labeled B′  People may misinterpret what is actually being proposed,   so let’s not leave that to chance  President Minehan     President Poole     A divergence of both the mean and the aggregate variance   Governor Ferguson   November 10, 2004 82 of 107      President Yellen   November 10, 2004 83 of 107      Governor Gramlich   November 10, 2004 84 of 107      It’s the first sentence that relates to alternative B—the very   top one     In other words, by stipulating how much we have done   already, it suggests that that may be enough     President Santomero     President Stern     President Moskow     Governor Bernanke     I’m sorry—I was referring to the 1 percent     Governor Kohn     I’m not saying that  I’m saying that the cost of a mistake in   policy is skewed, which is a different statement  I’m acknowledging that the probability   distribution is symmetrical on the outcome of the event, but the cost–benefit analysis on a mistake   is not     Absolutely     President Pianalto     Governor Olson     President Guynn     Governor Bies     President Lacker     Vice Chair     Are you volunteering to be the chairman of a committee to   look at that issue?  Do you want to make a statement, Ms Holcomb?     Would you read the appropriate language?     Call the roll, please     Good morning, everyone  Normally, when I ask approval of   the minutes, they are in the same form as the draft sent to you earlier  I just wanted to indicate that   there is a change since that earlier communication, and that is the addition of the notation vote by   the Committee authorizing President Santomero to accept the honor of the title “Cavaliere” to be   awarded by the government of Italy  I believe that vote was affirmative  [Laughter]  So, would   somebody like to move approval of the minutes of our November meeting?   SPEAKER(?)  So moved   SPEAKER(?)  Second     Without objection, they are approved  Dino Kos     With respect to the direct net currency shipments abroad,   recently I have seen reconciliations between other techniques that endeavor to get to the aggregate   amount of currency held abroad and the direct currency shipments  Are those other techniques   indicating much the same story?  I presume, with the growth of currency in circulation slowing and   with the foreign piece such a huge part of that, that a direct measure of shipments looks much like   what we estimate is the total  Is that accurate?   December 14, 2004 6 of 118             The way we estimate foreign holdings from the stock of   currency is not a bad technique  Indeed, as I recall, the several different measures yield roughly the   same result  So, the implication is that the net change in that estimated stock less the direct   shipments is, indeed, a presumed “other” component plus statistical error  Does that tend to be a   small number or a large number?     So that suggests that there’s an unexplained significant   residual  On the IMM traders report, to what extent are the net long and short positions useful in   anticipating changes in rates?  My presumption is that, historically, if there was a relationship, it   disappeared as soon as somebody observed it  What are the facts?     But there is other evidence that does suggest that, when   everybody becomes absolutely committed to the view that a currency is going to move in one   direction or the other, one can always make money on the other side of that transaction  At least   that’s my recollection of history  But I guess since nobody knows what these data are in real time,   one can’t make that statement     But if they do see a relationship, it disappears     Other questions for Dino?     Any further comments or questions?  If not, would   somebody like to move to ratify the domestic open market operations?   SPEAKER(?)  So moved     Let’s have a short recess so that the Board of Governors can   address the requests of the Bank directors for discount rate changes   December 14, 2004 69 of 118                                                             3The materials used by Mr Reinhart are appended to this transcript (appendix 3)    [Recess]     We’ll turn now to Mr Reinhart     Thank you  The floor is now open for discussion     President Stern     Governor Bernanke     Vice Chair     Governor Hoenig   December 14, 2004 83 of 118             President Minehan     Governor Gramlich   December 14, 2004 85 of 118             President Guynn     President Moskow     President Lacker     Is that true?     I think that’s the logically necessary position for this   Committee to take     The one just enunciated by Vincent     Suppose we had a situation in which the nonmembers held   different views from those who voted but then we show a unanimous vote  We’d get a lot of   comments as to why the indicated vote was wrong  We can’t do it that way  The voting members   have one privilege and one privilege only  They get to vote on the policy at that particular point and   on the nature of the statement  The discussion of what is going on in the economy and the issues   that are on the table and the relevance for potential future policy changes is a full Committee   discussion  But the specific policy decision that is reported is the vote of the then-Committee  And   the membership of the Committee changes from time to time     No, that is not the purpose  The purpose is essentially to give   the reasons why we voted the way we did     It has always been that way  The point is that, if you divide   the Committee into two separate groups and then discuss what those who voted on the particular   statement thought and what those who didn’t vote thought, we are actually no longer talking about   the Federal Open Market Committee  The Federal Open Market Committee is composed of the   twelve members who have the right to vote at a particular time  That’s the law  We can’t get   around it     Yes     Well, you don’t have to do that  The basic statement is that   in that last section of the minutes we are merely stipulating “the reasons for the policy decision”  In   that context, only the views of those who actually voted on the policy are included, and we don’t   make reference to anybody else     That’s indeed what we do     The definition of the Federal Open Market Committee is   statutory, and there is no such thing as a nonvoting member of the Federal Open Market Committee     Okay  President Yellen     Governor Olson     President Pianalto     President Santomero     When we started this process, frankly, I was quite dubious   that this would be a successful operation  I’m pleased to say that I was mistaken  I thought the staff   ran an exceptionally effective demonstration that this is a feasible operation  In the course of   discussing the different alternatives as we went forward in the various iterations, I think we   December 14, 2004 96 of 118           probably enhanced our understanding of the process and how it was functioning  So in that regard, I   think the experiment has worked   I’m not concerned, as you are, Cathy, about the question of the tradeoff with respect to the   statements and the minutes, largely because I don’t look at the forward-looking statements as   something we’ll be continuing in the future  I look at that as an historical aberration that enabled us   to do forward-looking projections and stick with them, because we had this extraordinary period of   increasing productivity growth for a long period of time  That essentially put us in a position of   significant control over inflation—indeed, we had declining unit labor costs—which enabled us to   effectively say that we were not concerned about inflation for the period ahead, knowing that   productivity growth doesn’t change all that quickly  We were, therefore, able to engage in an   experiment with our statements that lasted for well over a year   I submit to you that that was the aberration and that the future will not look that way  We   are going to find, when we eventually unwind from this “measured pace” approach that we’re not   going to be able—credibly—to reproduce that kind of description of monetary policy in the future,   at least not without very extraordinary events occurring  So I think the issue is moot  When this   period has ended and we’ve reached where we wish to go with this policy of “de-accommodation,”   I think we will go back to a very short term, balanced focus and give the type of indication of   Federal Reserve policy that existed in the past   I think that there are risks to moving forward on this early release of the minutes, but I agree   with the way Bill put it—namely, that it’s a close call  The way I would phrase it essentially is that,   if we move forward and we find out in retrospect that it was a mistake, the cost is not all that large    It’s certainly not as large as I think it would be were we to decide to move the transcript timing from   five years to six weeks and found out that we were wrong  Since we cannot reverse in either case, I   December 14, 2004 97 of 118           think the costs in the latter case would be far greater than if we to move to the three-week window   on the minutes and find out that was a mistake  We can live with that; I think we can live with it in   a way that might require us to change the way we handle the minutes or what we say in the minutes    But it’s not going to be a big deal   So I would lean toward following Vincent’s recommendation that we begin expedited   release of the minutes at the February 2005 meeting and maintain a schedule of releasing the   minutes of regular meetings three weeks after the day of the policy decision  Since I perceive that   that’s largely the accepted view of this Committee, I’d suggest that we put that on the table for a   vote  Call the roll     This, incidentally, is a full vote of both the Presidents and the   Governors on the grounds that it’s a decision that relates to the policy of the Committee, and all   members and potential members, in my judgment, should vote     “Yes, I guess” is a formal vote      I just want to congratulate Vincent on an extraordinarily   well-done job     Yes     I think that’s a good point  But let me ask this  What are the   reasons not to announce it earlier?     Let me put it this way  I heard no discussion here that in any   way would preclude announcing this decision today, given that we’ve come to a conclusion and that   it was effectively unanimous—with a couple of “I guess” votes  [Laughter]  So unless there’s an   objection, I would submit that it’s certainly possible to do this today  We have the time to put a   sentence in the statement indicating what the Committee concluded and voted on regarding this   issue today     I’d say it’s because the discussion of this issue occurred   subsequent to the vote on the policy decision     Let me go back  That would be the answer, but we could   certainly move it up if—     Is that really necessary?     Well, I think the logic of our decision forces us into the   position of doing precisely what Governor Gramlich is suggesting  Let me ask, Are there any   dissents to actually releasing the minutes of today’s meeting on an expedited basis?     By all means, go ahead     Three weeks is a long time  [Laughter]     Are there any arguments that anyone can think of?  The date   these minutes would be released would be January 4  If it were Christmas Day, I think it would   create a problem     Let’s at least think of what we intend to do  The proposition   currently on the table is (1) to announce that we’re going to release the minutes early and (2) to do it   in three weeks  I haven’t heard serious objections, nor have I heard serious reasons—which are far   more important—not to proceed  So unless I hear objections from anybody, I would read it as the   consensus of this Committee to make the statement that we’re going to do it and to actually do it as   of January 4  Is that acceptable to everybody?   SEVERAL  Yes     So be it     May we leave that issue of explaining the terminology to the   Secretariat to make a judgment on?   SEVERAL  Yes     In that event, I want to confirm that the dates of our next   meeting are Tuesday and Wednesday, February 1 and 2, 2005  This meeting is adjourned, and we   are off to have lunch with our former colleague, Bob McTeer   END OF MEETING   December 14, 2004 103 of 118        Without objection, they are approved  We move on to Dave   Stockton     Dave, you put down finger-crossing as a serious econometric   technique  I want to communicate that in my experience the t-value is quite high  [Laughter]     Questions for our colleagues?  You realize that, if there are   no questions, this is a historic occasion!  [Laughter]  Hearing none, who would like to start our   discussion?  President Moskow     President Poole     President Yellen    December 14, 2004 19 of 118             President Santomero     President Guynn     President Minehan     President Pianalto     President Hoenig     President Lacker     President Stern     First Vice President Holcomb     Vice Chair     Governor Kohn     Governor Ferguson     Why don’t we break for coffee at this time   [Coffee break]     Governor Bernanke     Governor Gramlich     Governor Olson     Governor Bies has laryngitis, as I’m sure you’re all aware,   and Debbie Danker will read her prepared statement     Thank you  I will call on Brian Madigan     Questions for Brian?     Further questions of Brian?  [Pause]  I actually have very   little to add to what has been said so far  It is probably worthwhile reiterating, to emphasize it, that   the policy we have been engaged in is largely the consequence of the fact that we’ve had a very   shallow recession and we have not had a recovery that is typical of historical experience  In the   past, we’ve had rebounds that involved an ongoing process comparable to other cyclical recoveries,   so the forecasting of the recovery has been a lot easier than we have found it to be in recent months    This time, without the typical rebound, we’ve been getting a set of endogenous forces that impacted   with modest exogenous forces to produce not very great changes in the economy  Indeed, if one   goes back and looks at a Greenbook from earlier this year, the economy doesn’t look all that much   different from what we are seeing now  So not having a considerable history to draw upon to make   judgments about various potential outcomes—and one cannot readily project the underlying trends   and assume that a particular outlook is going to materialize—we end up in a period where our   forecasting is somewhat befogged     We can put down a whole series of numbers  We can allow our econometric models just to   run their equations and see what they tell us about the underlying forces affecting the outlook  But I   suspect that we will find the resulting forecasts not very useful or accurate when looked at in   retrospect  That leads me to the conclusion that we should continue our policy of “opportunistic   de-accommodation,” as I like to call it, so that we are moving toward a position where we will be   better set to respond to what might happen to the economy either way  It’s almost like the tennis   player who has to move sharply to his right to hit a shot and tries to go back to the center of the   court as quickly as possible to be in a position to handle shots coming in any direction  If we can   bring the funds rate up to a level that we feel confident is putting us in the center of the court—  ready to respond to shots in any quadrant—I suspect that we will find ourselves in as good a   December 14, 2004 64 of 118           position as we are likely to get  I think we will find that trying to fine-tune policy to the forecast is a   very difficult game to play  We can seduce ourselves into believing that the relative accuracy of the   forecast is something we can count on in the future  History suggests otherwise    So, I think we probably would be best positioned if we implement alternative C—go with an   increase of 25 basis points in the funds rate and make only those changes in paragraph 3 that are   essential to bring it up to date  Therefore, I would recommend alternative C with the statement as   stipulated for that alternative  President Hoenig     President Moskow     President Stern     President Poole     Governor Bernanke     First Vice President Holcomb     Governor Olson   December 14, 2004 65 of 118             Governor Bies, raise your hand, please  [Laughter]   [Secretary’s note  Governor Bies indicated her support of the recommendation]     President Guynn     President Santomero     President Pianalto     President Lacker     President Minehan     Could I interpose here?  I would just note that we do have   one slightly negative statistic—one that historically has always been exceptionally useful—and that   is the initial claims for unemployment insurance  They’ve gone up in the last couple of weeks  We   think it’s a Thanksgiving seasonal-adjustment problem  But in the past when data series have   moved and we have tried to say “Well, it’s a statistical aberration of this form or that form,” we   have often found in retrospect that it wasn’t  So that’s one minor cloud sitting out there, which we   ought to keep in mind  I would hope, and I presume, that it’s going to reverse  But that has not   always been our experience     Governor Kohn     I acknowledge your superior strategy  [Laughter]       I was referring mainly to the possibility that we might look   back in retrospect and find that real underlying inflation had been moving faster than we had   expected  I’m merely suggesting to you that if our paradigm—which specifies that slowed   productivity does not affect prices until it takes its full cut out of profit margins—is wrong and we   end up with rising unit labor costs and rising inflation, we will be very pleased that we did, in fact,   move the rate structure up  But I agree with you  I don’t believe we want to move the rate structure   up in order to move it down  That doesn’t strike me as a very plausible scenario     Governor Gramlich     I rule that the Vice Chair is out of order!  [Laughter]     I’m sorry I raised the analogy  [Laughter]  Governor   Ferguson     Vice Chair     President Yellen     The Secretary will read the appropriate language   December 14, 2004 68 of 118             The press statement clearly is the statement referenced in the   table under alternative C  I won’t distribute these copies unless somebody needs to check the   wording  Would you call the roll, please?    Good morning, everybody  We used to start off these   meetings with a vote to approve the minutes of the previous meeting  I thought there was a   mistake when that was not on the agenda for today, but we have a new regime [laughter] and   we’re not required to do that That will cut the time of the meeting by 37 seconds  Dino Kos    Go over again what is in the CRB index This is the spot   index 	What’s in there?     That’s a big number     What else is in there?     Agricultural commodities  But grain prices have come    down in the most recent data  I assume iron ore is in there?    That couldn’t have done that much  Steel, for example, is   actually down    It’s a very unusual index The reason I raise the issue is   because it doesn’t look like any commodity index I’m used to watching—unless oil is a very big   component  Do we know that?  We can factor out the oil part of this   March 22, 2005 6 of 116                                                        But if you take it as a meaningful index, that’s a very   impressive move  And the point is that it’s the first time I’ve seen anything like that in the   commodities area  I’ve always looked at the CRB futures, which does look something like this,   but I assumed it was a third-order matter  Anyway, enough of that    There’s no weighting?     Then how does oil get to be 25 percent?     It takes all of them and they’re unweighted     So you have several gasoline contracts    Could you just take a look at that and let us know what is   involved?    March 22, 2005 7 of 116                                            Yes, iron ore is up over 70 percent Copper is up and   aluminum is up; steel is not    And the weight of steel is much larger than copper and   aluminum combined  So it’s an odd sort of commodity index    That’s the chart I remember  Thank you Other   questions? Would someone like to move approval of the Desk’s transactions?     Without objection, they are approved  Let’s turn now to   Dave Stockton and Karen Johnson              March 22, 2005 8 of 116   Call the roll     The Federal Open Market Committee will be in recess until   the Board of Governors meets and returns with its response to discount rate requests   [Recess]    By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Board accepted all   requests for discount rate changes    Yes, I’m terribly sorry  The Board approved all requests for   changes of 25 basis points There was a maverick there     The last agenda item is to confirm that our next meeting is scheduled for May 3  More   importantly, I will confirm that lunch is being served   END OF MEETING           There has been considerable discussion, David, as you   know better than I, about the failure of firms to capitalize a lot of what is currently expensed,   especially in conjunction with the installation of a lot of high-tech capital equipment  Is there   any way of looking at the data to see to what extent, if at all, they correlate with multifactor   productivity as currently estimated?    Well, one would expect to be able to pick it up from the   capital expenditures for high-tech equipment, on the presumption that the amount of expensed   items would be somehow related to that  But you already do that implicitly in creating a capital   services measure, and it would theoretically just show up in the coefficient on the capital   services measures  So could one assume that maybe it’s already in there in that respect?    Meaning, in other words, it’s already being captured to   some extent  But that can’t be, because that’s not the way those numbers are put together  The                                               March 22, 2005 17 of 116  question I’m really asking is this Is there a correlation between outlays on capital expenditures   for high-tech equipment and what we now measure as multifactor productivity?    But theoretically, if multifactor productivity were zero,   you would be capturing all of the impact of capital investment on measured productivity      So, to the extent that there’s a gap, it’s unexplained I   vaguely recall what you are saying, Steve, namely, that multifactor productivity does expand,   and, indeed, it has started to expand again now    That suggests not a close correlation, obviously, but some   relationship So there may be something to this proposition which, if true, may enable you to   improve your estimates  Instead of guessing at multifactor productivity, which has ranged from   ½ percent to 2 percent, you may be able to narrow it down quite significantly and actually have   input data directly estimating longer-term productivity—if it works  I have no idea whether it   works                                                  March 22, 2005 18 of 116   Well, have a distributed lag  [Laughter] Your imagination   is without limit!    It’s not the ones that use the equipment but the ones that   produce it    It’s the other way around That’s interesting You still   have the floor, Governor Gramlich    I see President Poole    Vice Chair    That in itself is enough to bring the German deficit well   down    The labor reform expenditures were also allowed to be   taken out    Yes    The basic purpose was to get them beyond the election    The presumption that everything is going to be fine beyond the election has no basis, because the   next set of pressures will create different effects  What it demonstrates is that the general view   that the system would hold together and work for the big countries is flawed  It worked for the   small countries, because the big countries insisted; they essentially have the capacity to give the   smaller countries an either/or ultimatum, so to speak  With Luxembourg in the Chair—and they   were very strongly against any changes—it took a couple of months to erode a lot of that   language and finally get everybody on board, which tells you that this is a very flawed system    They’re probably going to try to implement a new version   of the Lisbon Agenda    Can we borrow from the Greeks?  [Laughter]    President Minehan    President Lacker    President Stern    Who would like to start the Committee discussion?  President   Moskow    President Hoenig    President Guynn    President Santomero    President Pianalto                             March 22, 2005 36 of 116   President Lacker    President Yellen                                March 22, 2005 41 of 116   President Minehan    President Poole    President Stern    First Vice President Holcomb    Well, we’d like you both to be here to give us the answer!     Helen, it has been a real pleasure having you here    Vice Chair    Your straightforward remarks are very humorous  [Laughter]    Thank you very much  Let’s break for coffee                                March 22, 2005 56 of 116  [Coffee break]    Governor Bernanke    Governor Gramlich    Governor Ferguson                                   March 22, 2005 61 of 116   Governor Kohn    Governor Bies    Governor Olson    Thank you Vincent     Thank you Questions for Vincent?    The critical word is “notably”—that the rise in energy prices   has not notably fed through to core consumer prices  It’s not saying that the pass-through is zero    If you actually trace through the cost structure, energy prices   can impact on core prices in only two ways—in unit labor costs or in petrochemical feedstock prices   spreading out through various constituent elements in the production processes it affects  The latter   is actually a very small part of GDP    Well, there’s another reason it’s in there  The fact is that we   need to put something like that in the statement today because of the current energy price   environment  If we have only a marginal statement about the impact of energy prices on GDP, it’s   going to raise the question In what cave have they been operating?    I think Mike is next    How would you—    You would just say “The Committee perceives the upside   and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability…”    That’s a tough one We’ve gotten away with that wording as   we’ve raised the funds rate, on the grounds that we are removing accommodation  So it has had no   real significant impact  But in terms of that statement being true, the truth of the matter is that as we   continue to move up, it’s less credible  I happen to think it makes a good deal of sense to put that   phrase in there, but I believe what Ned Gramlich says is quite correct  We’re not going to be able to   use that again and we probably will not want to   Basically, there is an inherent contradiction in saying that the risks are balanced but we’re   tightening Now, we can say we’re not tightening if we’re removing accommodation, but we can do   that for just so long And I think we’re getting to the point where we have a problem with that   language We’ve gotten away with it, but I don’t think we’re going to get away with it very much   longer This particular phrase we put in is, in my judgment, a way to work our way out of that  But   I’m not sure how long we can use it    Oh, absolutely    That may be  But as I said to one of my colleagues earlier, if   we use that language, I hope you’re not standing next to the market when that comes out, because I   think it raises too many issues that we don’t need to raise at this stage  Your arguments are, in my   judgment, generally valid, but I would hold off on them  I think we can correct this problem at the   May meeting  In my view, that wording is a little too edgy and risk-laden to try it at this stage; it’s   too soon   SPEAKER(?)  Just so I’m clear, how would you suggest we correct it at the May meeting?    Basically, by the May meeting, we’re going to know a good   deal more about how this particular issue is emerging  We may find that the staff’s productivity   numbers, which move growth in unit labor costs down, are beginning to show up in the marketplace   and it will make a lot of this discussion moot  Or we may find that we don’t have data fully through   the first quarter and only have approximations for the numerator of output per hour  And we don’t   know that we’re not going to get a significant revision coming from BLS [Bureau of Labor   Statistics], which would alter the employment data for November, December, January, and February   on the upside And all of a sudden that 3¼ or 3½ percent productivity increase will disappear, and   we have higher unit labor costs and we have other things going on                                   March 22, 2005 80 of 116  My impression is that we’ve had a good deal of change from the last meeting, but I suspect   that going into May 3 there will be a lot more change in the pace than we have now  We can project   out, but our ability to forecast where we’re going to be on May 3 is not all that terrific President   Guynn    Try that again That is not a bad idea    Vice Chair    May I suggest something?  I think you’re addressing an issue   for the May meeting We have to be careful about how far we move at this particular stage  All the   issues that have been raised with respect to this question are valid ones, and what we’re doing is   struggling to find the best way to handle it To date, I think we have been remarkably fortunate in                                March 22, 2005 82 of 116  our phraseology and our expectations, and we have not run into something that came out of left field   of which we weren’t aware But if we reach too far at this stage, we may find that we’re pressing    And as Roger indicated, we have degrees of volatility with respect to the future  Indeed, what   Vincent also showed is that the markets are adjusting to Federal Reserve policy in a way that cannot   continue In other words, we don’t have the omniscience to be able to look out sufficiently far to   continue what we have been trying to do—and have been able to do more successfully than we have   any right to expect So, I think we have to be a little careful about this  Quickly, because we have   other colleagues who want to speak to this    SPEAKER (?) I have one concern with “measured,” and that is that it means 25 basis   points    It does and it does not And I hope that in the minutes—   because I’m going to say something about it—we try to take away that notion that “measured”   means 25 basis points  President Santomero    One possibility—I’m not necessarily arguing for this—is   instead of the “appropriate policy” to say “with current policy actions” But I think this is a   discussion for the May meeting  The reason I say that is not that the arguments essentially are                                               March 22, 2005 83 of 116  wrong, but because this is such a fundamental shift that to try to do it in this type of environment is   probably not wise    I know, but the problem is that if we don’t shift—if we retain   the same statement on upside and downside risks as the last time—I think we’ll run into trouble    President Lacker    Let me ask one thing about all of this discussion  This draft   language was in the Bluebook originally Why haven’t you communicated all of your concerns?   That’s precisely the purpose of having that in the Bluebook    Did they all convey this to you, Vincent?    Well, you obviously didn’t convince him  [Laughter]                                            March 22, 2005 84 of 116   Why don’t we handle this by replicating part of this argument   in the minutes to convey what the issues are rather than argue it now?  Well, we should argue it now   [Laughter]    That we can do    That is a valid issue to put on the table President Poole    Right, and that we’re keeping for the moment what we have   there, because to go back to the original is worse    To go back to the original is worse    Can we all agree on that particular phraseology?  We will try   to represent in the minutes the substance of this discussion to telegraph where we are, going forward,   including our discussion of all the various alternatives And we’ll leave it for the May meeting to   work this out My recollection is that, when we started off with these statements, it was always the   view that they would have to evolve as we moved from one stage to the next  We knew we would   have to decide how to do that, because to try to fix the format didn’t work  We’re demonstrating   that the fixed formats don’t work  We’ve evolved it into a different form of communication, and so   far we’ve been successful in doing that But let’s agree, as I assume we’re saying, to leave the   statement as it is and proceed to qualify this however we wish to in the minutes, which, obviously,   you will all have a chance to evaluate And then we can open up the issue in some detail in May                                                  March 22, 2005 86 of 116   There’s no reason why we can’t    Yes, that’s easy enough [Laughter]    Finally, I hope, President Minehan    Correct    Well, that’s on the table  And I think we should not be   fixated on any past structure of the statement    I think that’s a valid request, and I see no reason why we   can’t separate that from the Bluebook generally, because it really doesn’t rest all that much on either   the Greenbook material or the rest of the Bluebook  Unless something extraordinary happens in the   period from now until late April, it doesn’t strike me that how we come out on this issue is going to   be dependent on either the Greenbook or the Bluebook  Okay, are there any further questions?   [Laughter]   SPEAKER(?)  What do you think we ought to do?  [Laughter]    Well, I had an hour and 27 minutes worth of comments   prepared, but basically let me just say this I think the reason we’re having these sorts of difficulties   is because we’re running into what I suspect may well be the tail end of the stimulus that has   occurred in the world economy from extraordinary changes in globalization in the past 10 years    The best way to see that is to look at how the pattern of the propensity to invest domestic saving in   domestic investments has changed  That’s because one of the best measures of globalization is   essentially the correlation coefficient between pairs of domestic saving and domestic investment by   country One way of stating it is to use the terminology of home bias—to look at the extent of home   bias that exists in the world Starting in the early 1990s, home bias began to break down  We’ve   seen a broadening effect, which arguably has been the major factor in creating a disinflationary   environment  And that essentially has enabled us to have this extraordinary period of economic   growth, productivity increase, and remarkably low rates of inflation  Coupled with that, obviously,   has been a partially, but not wholly, independent change in technologies that has allowed unit costs   to move lower                       March 22, 2005 88 of 116  I suspect, but do not know, that we may be nearing the end of that process  We are now   looking at a different model, at least for the United States, given the fiscal policy problems that we   will have as we get into the next decade And remember that the latter tranches of the 10-year   Treasury note are moving into that decade enough to impact on rates currently  My suspicion is that   we’re going to see real long-term rates and real mortgage rates begin to move up and that the capital   gains we have seen in both the stock market and in housing values will become a lesser source of   funds for borrowing There will be less financing using realized capital gains—or, indeed, even   unrealized gains—and that will have a significant impact on consumption expenditures     Remember, 15 to 20 percent of personal consumption expenditures do not relate to income;   they are the consequence, at least econometrically, of the wealth effect  Therefore, a significant   amount of personal consumption expenditures has been financed; and it looks from the way the   balance sheets are coming out, that these expenditures have been financed largely from mortgage   debt The big rise in mortgage debt has essentially been the source for putting into cash for   consumption purposes a fairly significant part of capital gains     Real long-term rates may go up  It’s hard to forecast, but looking at the long-term fiscal   situation, I’m not exactly optimistic, especially in light of what happened last week  The likelihood   that the fiscal problems will be addressed has weakened  I believe Governor Gramlich characterized   it quite appropriately So I think the longer-term issues essentially are beginning to guide us now   with respect to the shorter term   In my judgment, the median forecast for the United States is reasonably well captured in the   Greenbook; and it may indeed be the mean forecast  I would even venture the possibility, although   it’s arguable, that the probability distribution of these outcomes may, in fact, be roughly   symmetrical  But what is not symmetrical is the loss function  As I think Cathy Minehan mentioned                          March 22, 2005 89 of 116  earlier, if we were to become a bit more aggressive in tightening policy in this context and it turned   out to be wrong—in other words, if actual unit costs and price inflation simmer down a bit so far as   core inflation is concerned—the damage to the economy and to policy would not be all that great  It   is obviously negative in the sense that the outcome is different from what one expected—but not   compared to the policy problem we’d run into if we maintain a posture that presupposes the median   outlook, namely, the Greenbook outlook, and we are wrong  In the latter case, I think the costs   would be great and the damage very difficult to recover from   For those of us who remember how we struggled in 1994 with the pattern of adjustment and   how we were trying to get ahead of the curve—and eventually had to move 75 basis points in one   month—I trust the memory is such that we don’t want to go there again  We were very fortunate   that we got a soft landing in 1995, but it was fortune, not great policy  We may have thought that we   tried in advance to communicate to the market that we were going to move in February 1994  They   were not listening, and we ran into all sorts of difficulties   Therefore, I conclude at this particular stage that we have to start moving in the direction   where our previous conversation left us So I would recommend a move in the funds rate of 25 basis   points and the alternative B language that is in this vector    I agree with that Governor Kohn                                March 22, 2005 90 of 116   The critical issue is  Do we know something?  There’s going   to come a time when we can’t forecast and we have no idea what our next policy move will be  And   to be forward-looking in that context is, obviously, inappropriate    Governor Gramlich    President Moskow    President Poole    President Santomero    Governor Olson    Vincent Reinhart    Any objection to putting “monetary” in there to qualify that?   Hearing no objection, so ordered Governor Bies    President Stern    Governor Ferguson                                   March 22, 2005 96 of 116   President Guynn    President Pianalto    Governor Bernanke    President Lacker    President Yellen                                      March 22, 2005 99 of 116   Vice Chair    We do have an inherent contradiction in having the minutes   discuss how the minutes are going to be phrased!  [Laughter] President Minehan    Thank you Helen, did you want to say anything?                                      March 22, 2005 102 of 116   You’ve had the final word    Good morning, everyone  I’d like to welcome Richard   Fisher    Your colleague, Helen Holcomb, did an exceptionally good   job here, and I wish you’d convey that to her Even though we’ve done that before, third parties   sound so much more credible    As you know, Governor Bernanke is not attending our   meeting today  He has recused himself for reasons that are obvious  We wish him well, and I think   he is on his way to being a colleague of a different sort We are going to miss him    Let’s get started with Dino Kos    It’s sort of sad to look at the composition of the Lehman   Brothers high-yield index I’m looking at some of the names in the context of 30 years ago—   General Motors, AT&T, and Georgia Pacific The world is telling us that there is creative   destruction out there   To what extent do the GM, Ford, and collateral issues, as they move out of investment-grade   into high-yield, impact the average yields of, say, BBBs?  Clearly, we are getting a huge increase in                                    May 3, 2005 7 of 116  the supply of marginally non-investment-grade bonds  We can see the impact all over the place,   because auto debt is so much larger than the debt of other issuers in that market  But I’ve heard very   little about the measurement impact, for example, on the BBB or the Baa indexes  Are they affected   materially by this shift?    I’m thinking more in terms of the effect on the averages of   these indexes    When Argentina came out, it was a huge effect    The very process itself would produce an effect  As soon as   these issues begin to move off what would be a sort of constant BBB yield, it automatically drops   out—                                                   May 3, 2005 8 of 116   You’re weighting with respect to the position on the spread?    As the paper moves from BBB to BB, for example, the   weights fall and then they rise again as they cross the border?    That’s really quite interesting I didn’t know we did it that   way Other questions for Dino?  If not, would someone move to ratify the domestic operations?   SPEAKER(?)  So moved    Without objection, they are approved  You wanted to discuss   the swaps issue next?    I didn’t want to ask for a quick, routine vote without allowing   time for at least a defensive comment    The arguments in favor remain as valid as they have been    [Laughter]    I refuse to comment further  [Laughter] Would somebody   like to move to renew these?                                             May 3, 2005 9 of 116  SPEAKER(?)  So moved    Mr Reinhart     I’d like to call a recess and ask the Board of Governors to   convene in my office   [Meeting recessed]    The Board of Governors accepted the requests of all twelve   Reserve Banks for an increase in the discount rate   Our next meeting is June 29 and 30   But before we adjourn, Dave Stockton would like to   make a few remarks     Thank you very much  Luncheon is served   END OF MEETING        Without objection  You have another year of grace  Let’s   move on to Dave Stockton      It strikes me that if we’re going to get that significant a   slowdown in imports, we should be seeing it in some upward pressure on US industrial production,   provided the composition of the import change is industrial materials, which theoretically would be   shifted to domestic sources—that is, the share from domestic sources would be higher  Do you have   any insight into the details at all? Or is it just that the extraordinarily outsized surge in the first   quarter—beyond anything reasonable—requires a reversion to the mean?     It has to affect domestic GDP because, obviously, the imports   of capital goods will have an impact on the producers’ durable equipment purchases, which   theoretically are split into domestic and foreign producers    It really depends on what the monthly pattern is  It could   very well be, for example, that January was up sharply, February was down, and March was down,   and the average is still up 15 percent And you keep going down, so you can’t really see the   difference    On the spread that’s opening up between average hourly   compensation of employees and the ECI [Employment Cost Index], theoretically that is supposed to                                       May 3, 2005 17 of 116  mean that the mix is changing  It implies that the mix is changing toward higher-skilled   components, presumably  We can check that, I would assume, by looking at least at the ratio of   supervisory workers to production workers Are the numbers moving in line with that ratio?    Well, the interesting point is that it should  Otherwise, the   question is whether labor income is calculated correctly    So the compensation per hour may be overestimated in that   respect, if that’s true    Those are the workers who live in that country called   “discrepancy” in our world balance of payments accounts!  [Laughter]    Any other questions?    President Moskow                                 May 3, 2005 20 of 116   Vice Chair                                    May 3, 2005 21 of 116   President Santomero    The flattening of industrial production in March in that flow­  of-goods system seems to reflect a rather large liquidation, seasonally adjusted, of motor vehicle   inventories I was curious whether there was any awareness of that on the part of BEA, because   clearly those data were available at the time when BEA made the GDP forecast  Do they show a   separate inventory for motor vehicles?                                    May 3, 2005 24 of 116   So they’re either missing that, or they’re showing a   significantly larger increase in non-automotive inventories than we have    President Fisher    Any further questions for our economists?    If there are no further questions, who would like to start off   the Committee discussion?  President Moskow    President Lacker    President Minehan    President Guynn    President Stern    President Fisher    President Yellen    President Pianalto                                    May 3, 2005 45 of 116   President Hoenig    President Santomero    President Poole    Coffee is available, so why don’t we take a break?   [Coffee break]    Vice Chair    Governor Kohn    Governor Gramlich    Governor Olson    Governor Bies    Governor Ferguson    Questions for Mr Reinhart?    Further questions?    Certainly some progress can be made in that direction, but   let’s be careful not to bring it to the table at this point in the meeting, because the length of the   discussion is indeterminate, and we still have our 215 deadline  Therefore, I think it’s critical that   whatever we do with respect to enhancing the interaction on the wording of the statement be done   before the meeting  And the Internet, especially e-mail appropriately encrypted, is a rather   significant vehicle that can readily be employed if the members perceive that there is inadequate   interaction on the statement itself  In my view, that can fairly easily be improved upon, if necessary,   and I think Vincent is the central point here So I would suggest that those of you who agree with                                 May 3, 2005 78 of 116  President Lacker communicate that, or indicate to Vincent that you think the current process is   perfectly adequate, which I always find a difficult position to support    You know, there’s a difference from five years ago  The   difference basically is that the general notion that we can all come here, sit down and have a   discussion in a limited number of hours, and in that period come up with a consensus on the best   wording for our statement, has proven false  It’s a much more detailed deliberation; there’s far more   involved than merely a statement of where the funds rate is going to be  What we are learning is that   the process requires a great deal of deliberation prior to the meeting  So, even though we officially   meet only on fixed days, the amount of interaction in the intermeeting period is increasing  It’s   largely, of course, as a consequence of a statement that is ever more elaborate  I think we’re finding   that the old notion about not discussing in advance what our views are—that we should just come to   the table and work them out—would be fine if we had an open-ended time frame, which we don’t    We issue a statement at 215 pm on the day of our meeting  So, unless we want to change that,   which has a lot of consequences, we have to recognize that a goodly part of what we discuss and   conclude has to result from our pre-meeting discussions                                   May 3, 2005 79 of 116  Now, to the extent that you wish to enhance the amount of interaction among members, there   clearly are vehicles to do that which we do not at this stage employ  There has to be an ultimate   arbiter, and it still has to be Vincent in one way or another, because it is conceivable, if we are all   interacting and not taking votes, that we could have a stalemate  And a stalemate is not permissible   in this Committee, because we have to come to conclusions  So, we can move to a greater degree of   interaction, if you choose And I think that can be done very readily, especially with the marvelous   advances in technology that have emerged in the last five years    If a large enough proportion of this membership agrees with   that statement, it’s an obvious topic for one of our upcoming two-day meetings  The fact that the                                 May 3, 2005 80 of 116  Bank of England does it is not, in and of itself, a recommendation  [Laughter] Further questions for   Vincent?   If not, let me get started  President Lacker raised an interesting point, which I have been   meaning to raise, and I’d just like to repeat it  One of the things we have succeeded in doing through   all of this confusion is to communicate to the marketplace what our relative priorities are  The   market now pretty much anticipates how we’re going to respond to various events or developments   in advance of their occurrence, and the market has been relatively accurate  In other words, we   come to this table and we find that, lo and behold, expectations of the federal funds rate going   forward are not all that different from the general judgment of this group, even though that judgment   may have changed significantly from the previous period     So, while there are problems—and in fact, we have an eight-week spread between meetings   in a period of increasing uncertainty—I’m not sure I care all that much  I think the markets will do   our work for us until we come and sit at this table and formalize it  So, that takes away one of the   problems that I think we have had  And I believe we would be well advised, if we can somehow   manage to do so, to continue to convey to the marketplace where our priorities are and what is likely   to cause them to change  I say that because to me there is certainly an underlying value to   maintaining as little reaction to our post-meeting statement as possible, with the exception of when   we very deliberately want to change market sentiment  Indeed, last meeting we did wish to do that   We actually wanted to confront the issues that spreads were getting too narrow and that there was a   degree of complacency in the market  So the statement was changed in a manner that pretty much   indicated that we were slightly more concerned than the market had anticipated  And we got a fairly   significant reaction, as exhibited by the very big blue spike in Vincent’s chart But that’s the   exception                                    May 3, 2005 81 of 116  We should endeavor whenever we can to make the 215 pm announcement subsequent to   these meetings as uneventful as possible in most cases  In this context, I think we need to consider   the fact that the markets are essentially saying that we are going to pause in some of our subsequent   meetings  Now, it’s one thing to forecast that we’re going to pause, but it’s quite another to actually   do so The pause can arise in two ways One, we can literally stipulate that we are not going to act   in the current meeting but are likely to act at the next meeting  We’ve never tried that  I think we’ll   have considerable difficulty formulating language that essentially says “We know enough at this   moment not to move the funds rate, but we know something that suggests that we are going to move   it six weeks from now, or whenever the next meeting is”  I would find it very difficult to craft such a   statement with credibility    As a consequence, I think what is likely to happen is that we will continue to increase rates   until we actually come to what we perceive to be the end  However, it may very well be that it is not   the end and that in later periods we will move  Hence, that will validate what the markets are   saying—that we will pause only because we didn’t get it right and not because a pause was part of   our policy program  That, to me, will almost surely be the case, because, as history tells us—in fact,   it’s a cliché around this Committee—at the end of a process of either tightening or easing, the last   move is a mistake  The challenge basically is to put ourselves into a position, when we make that   mistake, where the probability of our creating a significant disruption is minimized   This leads us to the question that we nearly always confront, which Governor Ferguson   raised indirectly earlier Most of the time we have to ask ourselves  If we take a particular action   and it proves to be a mistake, is it more costly than taking the presumed alternative action and   having that turn out to be a mistake?                                          May 3, 2005 82 of 116  For example, we’re confronted currently with the issue of choosing to pause or make a   significant change in the statement on the one hand, or of continuing with a move of 25 basis points   and keeping the word “measured” without significantly changing the statement on the other  If we   choose the first—either pausing or making a significant change in the statement—and that proves   wrong, in my judgment that will create a more significant problem for us than if we presume that   inflation is the more critical ongoing problem, go 25 basis points, and maintain the language from   our last meeting  If we do the latter and we are wrong, it will be far easier to recover from that than   to recover from having made a statement which presupposes that inflation is under control and have   that prove to be wrong So, I think we’re getting ever closer to where we’re eventually going to   stop, and we’ll be making decisions of this nature until we come to the conclusion that the argument   for moving another 25 basis points cannot be sustained   I happen to think that the current situation is again likely to prove to be a soft patch There   are certain aspects of it that are not consistent with an actual turning point in the business cycle   Indeed, if it is the beginning of a cyclical downturn, it will be one of the most extraordinarily rare   events in business history, basically because profit margins are still rising  I don’t recall a situation   in which the economy literally turns down, unless there is a financial crash, with profit margins at   their peak In fact, I don’t recall a financial crash with profit margins at their peak  There are   usually long lags and deterioration, but we haven’t started to see that yet   The deterioration that I think is out there involves a slowdown in productivity and, by   implication, a rise in unit labor costs  But we’re assuming that to be muted, largely because wages   are considered to be growing at a fairly stable pace—indeed, if anything, a slower pace  If NAIRU   [non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment] means anything, it suggests that the current   unemployment rate has to imply some level of market tightness that, at the end of the day, either has                                     May 3, 2005 83 of 116  to stabilize the rate of increase in compensation or—in my view very much more likely—induce it   to rise This suggests to me that the Greenbook forecast of profit margins flattening out and starting   down seems the most credible scenario in terms of how market forces are likely to run But if that is   indeed the case, then this is a pause This is not something that suggests economic activity is going   down   I think we’re being helped by recent developments in the oil market  As best I can judge,   that is the major factor for the pause here, as it was last year  And I gather that most of the people   around this table also believe that is the case We had a very unusual situation going into what is   normally the second-quarter slowdown in oil consumption in the northern hemisphere and,   therefore, in world oil consumption  The Saudis increased production, which created a significant   but temporary glut largely in the lower-gravity, more sulfurous crude oils that come out of Saudi   Arabia The effect essentially was to throw a lot of crude oil on the market for which there was no   immediate demand or need  The Saudis kept saying, “We’re producing this oil, but we don’t have   any customers”  There were customers for the light sweet crudes  That’s where the real demand   was   In any event, this oil came on the market and pressed the spot price down below the forward   prices And because a futures market essentially spreads the supply/demand pattern not only for the   spot market but throughout the whole spectrum of forward markets, we ended up going from   “backwardation” in the forward market to effectively a “contango”  In other words, the forward   prices were at higher levels than the spot prices, which meant that for the first time in a very long   time you could accumulate oil inventories profitably  You could buy crude at spot, sell it for   delivery six weeks later at the futures market price then existing, and guarantee a spread and a profit                                     May 3, 2005 84 of 116  Judging from the pattern, a lot of that has been going on because crude inventories are rising    This suggests that it is profitable for people to accumulate oil inventories, which was very obviously   not the case earlier But as inventories rise, the spot price falls relative to the futures price, making it   even more profitable to hold more inventories  This brings the price down even further, and that   process usually doesn’t come to an end unless there is a significant pullback in production or an   acceleration of demand—or obviously some form of geopolitical problem that creates very grave   concerns in the marketplace   If this pattern continues—and so far it appears to be working—gasoline prices will be   coming off reasonably soon  Work that has been done by the staff here suggests that gasoline prices   are essentially a function of the weighted average crude, which is 60 percent light sweet crude and   40 percent the heavier, more sulfurous crude  The pattern suggests that we are close to where the   margins ought to be, and, therefore, declining crude prices get reflected fairly quickly in gasoline   prices We’re going to learn quickly enough whether or not that is indeed undercutting grave   concerns about the outlook We’ll know whether or not oil—or the energy issue more generally—is   indeed a fundamental problem that has created difficulties over the last six weeks   I doubt that monetary policy is all that big an issue, because as far as the markets are   concerned monetary policy hasn’t changed in any measurable way for months  To be sure, we have   been tightening, but the markets have been tightening for us  As far as the two-year note is   concerned, the market has tightened well in advance of anything that we’ve been doing  5   So, I think it’s hard to make the argument that it’s monetary policy here  Where this leaves   us is that essentially we’re going to have time to watch what the implications of declining gasoline   prices are going to be for the outlook If this is indeed a soft patch, then continuing with 25 basis   points, as in alternative B, and keeping the wording as close as we can to the previous statement, will                                 May 3, 2005 85 of 116  turn out in retrospect to have been exactly the right policy If, however, we choose to make some   adjustments, I think we’ll have some backtracking to do in the language     If we begin to soften the language now and this economy starts to pick up again, we’ll have   to tighten our language, whereas if we keep what we have in alternative B and the economy softens,   the markets will soften for us  We will have the ability to change the language, which we may well   choose to do eight weeks from now, and we will have had one move from where we have been to   where we will be in June, rather than confront the possibility of one move and then another move    And as far as maintaining a stable monetary policy is concerned, usually the fewer moves we make   to correct earlier moves, the better  As a consequence, I think the evidence at this point suggests that   we should go with alternative B—moving the funds rate up 25 basis points and using the language   stipulated in Vincent’s presentation on page 6 President Poole    That will appear in the minutes    Remember, the statement is actually determined after the   events that are described in the minutes  So that issue always exists It existed the last time; it will   exist in the future The point I’ve tried to make to a number of members of the press is that they   should always remember that what is in the minutes, even though they are released later, reflects   what occurred before we voted on the statement  So, whatever the Committee votes is the   Committee’s view at that point  And to stipulate that it is other than that implies that people are   saying one thing in the meeting and voting differently at the end  I guess that could happen, but not   very often                                 May 3, 2005 87 of 116   I understand what you’re saying, Bill I must admit that I   don’t think what you’re suggesting is possible I think that is the dilemma that we are confronted   with We have the advantage of having brought forward the release of the minutes  The issue that I   raised at the very beginning of my remarks—namely, that the markets should know where our   preferences are and how we will respond to individual data—I think mitigates the problem that   concerns you I, frankly, don’t think you can achieve what you’re suggesting That’s my opinion  I   don’t know what the rest of the Committee thinks     President Hoenig    President Guynn    We have a lot of time to do that  It’s called “eight weeks”   [Laughter] President Minehan    Cathy, that’s not my view  I’ve said we have alternatives   We can change the language before we stop raising rates  We don’t have the choice to decide at one   point to stop raising rates and with the statement hold open the likelihood that we are going to raise                                 May 3, 2005 89 of 116  rates at the next meeting  That is not the same thing as saying we can’t change the language    Indeed, we have changed it    I apologize; that was not my intent    President Santomero      President Fisher    Governor Ferguson                                    May 3, 2005 91 of 116   President Moskow    Is that the end of your—[laughter]?    President Yellen    Governor Olson    Governor Kohn                                    May 3, 2005 96 of 116   President Lacker    President Pianalto    Governor Gramlich    President Stern    Governor Bies    Vice Chair    Okay I think we have a consensus on 25 basis points and the   wording in alternative B Would you read the appropriate language?    Call the roll     Good morning, everyone  Dino, please start us off    You raised the issue of the questionable efficacy of the   dynamic hedging engaged in by Fannie and Freddie earlier this year or last year—I’ve forgotten   exactly when I don’t recall it being both GSEs, and I wasn’t quite clear whether that was just a   general rumor or what Is that now confirmed?      I understand that  You weren’t referring to something   new; you were referring back to the original problems     Did they ever acknowledge that that was a problem?    No, I realize that  But as far as I know, they have never   acknowledged that dynamic hedging did not work for them at that time    Just because he is running for governor or something like   that, you don’t have to be that diplomatic  [Laughter]    Well, as far as you can judge, in the mortgage market has   there been a significant reduction in the proportion of dynamic relative to passive hedging that   has occurred subsequent to that episode?  And has it stayed down?     Is there much dynamic hedging going on at all?    Going from passive to dynamic hedging, if you do it right,   does enhance the bottom line And it could be significant, so that the attraction is really quite   strong Well, I think I’ve squeezed about as much as I’m going to get out of you on that    [Laughter]   Second, regarding the pickup in mortgage-backed security holdings by foreign central   banks, it’s quite evident that the holdings of the GSE debentures are in lieu of US Treasury   securities and they are held solely because of the extra yield  I know that explicitly  It’s not a   question; they’ve told me that  Indeed, they’ve asked me “Are these guys okay, so I don’t have   to worry about them?”  But how do they view mortgage-backed securities?  Do they view them   as merely Treasuries with a higher yield?  I assume that the MBS they’re holding are Fannie or   Freddie guaranteed, not private conduits    Do we know that?    They don’t hold Ginnies; it doesn’t help that much  Do   you get the impression that the mortgage-backed securities are in lieu of US Treasuries?  Do the   central banks tell you anything?    Well, if you have a GSE guarantee of an MBS, for   example, why does it sell at as much of a spread above debentures of the GSEs?  Is the option to   refinance the whole difference?     So it’s no credit risk differential    All right I noticed you made a particular point of the   solemn statement by the People’s Bank of China that the July 21 move was not the first step in a   series of changes Doesn’t that strike you as what a Finance Minister would say when asked the   question, “Mr Finance Minister, are you about to revalue?”  [Laughter]  There was no other   statement the authorities could make for fear of getting a huge inflow of funds  As you   remember, originally they characterized it as an initial step and they backed away from it    Which do you believe?     But I’m asking  Why does the July 26 statement have any   value whatsoever?  It’s a perfectly obvious thing to say if you’re a central banker, even if you’re   preparing to revalue six months later, or three months later, or any time                                         August 9, 2005 10 of 110   All you’ve got to do is watch the actual transactions     Or the market could do correlations of the dollar against   all other currencies and then presume the basket consists of all those in which the R2 is above   09 [Laughter] Governor Bies     Isn’t that a costly hedge, given the indeterminacy of the   behavior of some new product such as that?  The prepayment pattern is virtually unknown    The big question is who is buying the securitized versions   of these I can understand that there are originators who get the fee and then sell it on to X  I   always wonder Who is X?     President Minehan    Further questions for Dino?    If not, would someone like to   move to ratify the transactions? Vice Chair     Call the roll     Thank you Shall we have a short recess so that the   Board members can convene and address the issue of the discount rate?   [Recess]     The Board of Governors unanimously approved the   requests of all 12 Reserve Banks for an increase in the discount rate of 25 basis points to 4½   percent  Our next meeting is Tuesday the 20 of September  But in the interim we will all meet, I   gather, at Jackson Hole for thoughtful discussion and perhaps some golf and tennis  Luncheon is   served   END OF MEETING         Without objection, they are approved  We’ll turn now to   David Wilcox and Karen Johnson     David, what’s the latest weight for the nonmarket   component of core PCE?     I know in the CPI it’s of the same category or even larger,   so to speak But is there any question about the weight of that?  Is it generally accepted as the   right number?  It’s a very big number                                               August 9, 2005 20 of 110    I was merely referring to the owners’ equivalent rent and   that sort of thing, which is the same type of calculation    The revisions they made are huge     Are they going to revise it again next year?     President Fisher    President Santomero     Yet theory would suggest it has got to exist    It’s the interaction effect between industries  If a couple   of them are starting to squeeze, the interaction picks up  And it becomes a geometric, not an   arithmetic phenomenon, as everybody moves toward capacity    Well, how about a J?  [Laughter]    No, I understand that  But there’s an interesting question   here about policy I think you’re quite obviously correct that it’s very difficult to find because   it’s not a point estimate; it’s obviously some sort of function  But at the end of the day, there has   to be a fixed absolute ceiling at some point  As you approach that, I don’t think it’s an L, but it’s   got to be something of that nature  The fact that we can’t find it in the data is not—     It’s a barometer     President Lacker                                               August 9, 2005 25 of 110   Would you explain to me what “upward bias in a   nonmarket component of the PCE” means?     I wish it were true  It conceivably might be true, but I’m   not sure the evidence is fully consonant with that view  Let me put it this way The concept of   capacity 50 years ago for a lot of industries was an engineering concept  There was just so much   steel you could get out of an open hearth steel furnace without an oxygen lance  It was an   engineering concept Today, it’s like a rubber mat  In other words, you can press it  Although   you have an average expected long-term capacity, you can still go well above that, but it’s more   and more costly to add to production  So, I think what has happened is that the notion of   capacity is more like a rubber mat  As you move up to capacity, the marginal cost doesn’t   change When you hit capacity, you can push it up—indeed, by quite a significant amount—but   the costs rise and, hence, the effective capacity declines    Now, what that says about the relationship between nominal and real is a wholly different   matter  That is a different concept  The issue you’re raising is one possible explanation of why   we could still have this sort of flexibility, but it has little to do with inflation  I don’t think that’s   the case, but it’s conceivable I’d like to believe it’s the case, but—     President Yellen     President Poole     President Minehan     President Hoenig     Any further questions for our colleagues?  If not, would   somebody like to start the general discussion?  President Moskow     President Fisher     President Yellen     President Lacker     President Santomero     President Stern    President Guynn     President Minehan    May I suggest that if you have ideas or notions about how   to change the statement, write a memorandum to the Committee well before the meeting, and the   Secretariat will circulate it    There’s no reason why you have to wait until the last few   days if you have some ideas to suggest     You may galvanize the discussion on the relevant issues    Clearly, there is a limited life expectancy for the particular statement we’re using now  My own   judgment is that we may luck out in the sense that the markets will perceive changes that are   going on in the economy and will move the forward federal funds rate in a manner that will   essentially make our transition to a different status seamless  But we can’t assume that  We   have to be aware of the fact that we may have to make a very specific judgment   Coffee is available Why don’t we break and come back in a reasonable time?   [Coffee break]     President Pianalto                      August 9, 2005 56 of 110    President Hoenig     President Poole     Vice Chair     Governor Olson    Governor Kohn     Governor Bies    Governor Ferguson    Thank you very much  Let’s move on to Brian Madigan      Questions for Brian?    Further questions for Brian?  If not, let me add my   thoughts, wherever they may go  [Laughter]   I thought it was quite interesting to hear the tone of this Committee’s view that the   inflation rate is gradually moving up and that’s not particularly worrisome, except that basis   points keep getting added to basis points and before you know it, the rate of inflation is higher   than we want it to be The undertone of resistance to that I thought was rather impressive and, I   must say, it’s a view that I share as well The rate is being boosted by a thousand little hits   which eventually get you, and suddenly you say, “How in the world did we get here?”   There are general concerns in the sense that the costs of national defense, homeland   security, and the like are really quite substantial  But they don’t seem to have impacted the cost   structure significantly nor resulted in a marked slowing in productivity growth  We did, as you                      August 9, 2005 81 of 110  know, have considerable concern that the rate of productivity growth in the second quarter was   going to slow appreciably and that in the third quarter it wasn’t going to move very much from   that reduced pace  We thought that structural productivity might well be revised down and that,   therefore, structural unit labor costs would increase, suggesting an acceleration in inflation  That   apparently is not happening That is, we are getting upward revisions in productivity on a   month-by-month basis, so that concern is something we can basically put aside for the moment     On the other side, there was a general tone in the comments around the table of concern   about the acceleration in economic activity  But I think we ought to be a little careful in making   a judgment on that, given that the pause in the second quarter was to a very large extent   reflective of inventory investment falling away at a fairly significant pace, though the extent of   that was not something of which we were aware until after the fact  Currently, we’re seeing the   reverse Now, even though industrial production is not all that big a chunk of GDP, it is a   significant aspect of the change in GDP  And the combination of motor vehicle output and non-  motor vehicle inventory change suggests, as David pointed out, an automatic pop in the numbers    And that is what we’re seeing Is it an implication of an acceleration in economic activity?  I   would say “not necessarily”  Were that the case, we would be seeing a tightening in markets    We’d see it in commodity prices, but we do not  We’d see it in delivery lead times, but we’re   seeing only a marginal increase there  In other words, the anecdotal reports and other usual   evidence of markets tightening up are not there  We’re not seeing the consequences of what   inevitably has to be the case—that is, the loss of effective capacity as a result of increasing oil   and natural gas prices That’s going to happen at some point, but it’s not evident anywhere we   can see it So, what we’re dealing with, as best I can judge, are gradual changes that are                             August 9, 2005 82 of 110  increasingly of a tightening nature  But those changes are not showing up in any form that   creates a sense of urgency to address them   There are two areas of the outlook about which I think we know a great deal less than   we’d like One is oil and the other is housing prices  On the oil side, the futures markets, as you   know, show a flattening out of crude prices  But when any commodity price is going up, futures   prices always show a flattening out  The reason is that futures markets, while they may be the   best estimate that exists of the market’s expectation of prices in the future, are nonetheless a   mechanism in which the demand in the immediate period is essentially spread out over the whole   futures spectrum  And it’s reflected in the fact that the upper end of futures prices relative to the   spot price cannot be more than the carrying charges  If it is, what happens is that the spot price   gets pulled up in the process   So, at this stage what we’re looking at is the market’s best forecast of the longer-term   outlook for oil prices But as a quick look at history will tell us, the futures price has a terrible   record as a forecast Therefore, it’s not all that useful, especially when we’re looking at very odd   underlying fundamentals here  If one looks at the production numbers and demand as currently   measured, we’re running into a big increase in inventory accumulation in the second half of the   year And one would presume, as I guess Lee Raymond does, that that implies the markets are   going down   But we also have the other side of this problem where all of the proved reserves are in   areas with nationalized oil industries and, therefore, the ability to bring to bear financing from   the international oil companies is very significantly limited  Indeed, in the case of Mexico, it is   constitutionally prohibited And as the populations in these oil-producing areas are growing   fairly rapidly, an ever-increasing part of the cash flow from oil revenues is going for domestic                   August 9, 2005 83 of 110  welfare needs So even though the prices are going up and the revenues and cash flows are   going up, there appears to be a shortage of cash available to convert the proved reserves into   effective operating capacity, meaning drilling and infrastructure  Even though the numbers look   reasonably good, what we have had in the last few years, after a long period of very small   increases in world oil demand, is that demand has suddenly tilted up as China and India have   come on the scene And after a fairly significant amount of non-OPEC production, which turns   out to have been largely Russian, now we’re getting some evidence of nationalism in the Russian   oil industry, and production growth there has slowed very materially  Hence, the outlook for any   slack we generally might have is questionable  And one of the serious questions is Are we   underestimating long-term demand growth so that even though there may be production out   there, the gap is closing from the demand side?   But most of the concern, as Karen pointed out, is on the supply side because one can list a   number of fragile oil-producing areas and a whole series of possible supply interruptions    Anything can go wrong Indeed, one indication of how sensitive the market is can be seen in the   reaction to every flicker of a potential hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico  That is not the biggest   oil-producing area of the world, but when there’s even a hint of a hurricane in that region, crude   prices pop As a consequence, we may have a sense that we’re looking at a short-term glut, but   the prices are seeing through the glut  That’s, indeed, the convergence of the long-term 6-year   futures price to the spot price  For a long period of time we had a big surge in the spot price and   the 6-year futures dragging along barely, with the gap opening up  In the last year that gap has   closed very dramatically, which suggests that there’s a fundamental concern in the marketplace   that the long-term capabilities of this market are not sufficient and that a price of $60 or $65 a   barrel for crude may not be the low number  Just remember, the price got up to the equivalent in                         August 9, 2005 84 of 110  today’s prices of $90 for WTI back in the 1970s All we can say that’s fortunate about that   comparison is the fact that the amount of oil used per unit of GDP is down very significantly    So, there is no basic long-term concern, but there is a short-term concern here, which I think   raises questions about inflation and about the contractionary characteristics of oil price increases    So it’s a very difficult mixture   On the housing area, the real problem is not actually the boom or how far it’s going or   whether it is a bubble or the like The real issue is this When it diffuses, as it will one way or   the other, what are the implications?  The serious problem that will arise when that happens   relates to the question of what is the marginal propensity to consume out of housing wealth  The   problem that I think we have is that the impact from a slowing or decline in house appreciation—   or more explicitly the effect of housing capital gains on the one hand and of stock capital gains   on the other—would be a far greater contraction in consumption than indicated by a standard   reduced form system, which we currently have in our models—namely, the wealth effect   What bothers me is that we may, in fact, be looking at much higher marginal propensities   to consume from housing capital gains  And, as housing turnover slows, cash-outs will slip and   the amount of equity extraction will fall quite significantly  In fact, implicitly the Greenbook has   a very substantial fall in equity extraction, as you know  Mortgage debt is shown to slow down   very materially  The key question is Is the marginal propensity to consume from equity   extraction actually 03, which is the figure indicated in our surveys of cash-outs and other   surveys?  If one assumes that that’s the impact on consumption, that accounts for virtually all of   the decline in the saving rate, and it would imply a reversal—a very significant rise—in the   saving rate And that is the other side of the question of what kind of consumption pattern we   will see going forward                         August 9, 2005 85 of 110  Implicitly our existing model, which endeavors to differentiate the marginal propensity to   consume from wealth creation from stocks and wealth creation from housing, is incapable of   distinguishing any difference in the marginal propensity to consume from those two sources    And instead of 03, the implicit number is well under 01  As a consequence, even though the   Greenbook forecast has a significant implicit decline in mortgage debt expansion, we do not get   the type of marginal slowdown in personal consumption expenditures—and I might add   modernization expenditures—that is implicit in the survey data  The trouble is that we cannot   know the answer at this stage to the question about the marginal propensity to consume out of   housing wealth   International data are more suggestive of a higher propensity to consume  Australia’s   PCE slowed down very dramatically with the slowing in house price appreciation there  The   same was true in the United Kingdom  And that’s an issue about which I’m fearful we will not   know the answer for the United States until we see it—when we find that equity extraction   suddenly falls with a flattening of house prices and retail sales somehow begin to disappear  I’m   not sure we can make judgments in advance as to how that will come out, but how it comes out   may be the most difficult problem that we will be confronting  It doesn’t seem likely to be   imminent  It’s certainly not the case that housing starts are falling off dramatically  Indeed, the   backlog the large builders have on starts is still very high  It is flattening out a bit but is showing   no signs of weakness Conceivably, in the event of a weakening in prices, a lot of that backlog   will disappear  That may occur without our knowing where it’s coming from, but people will   just pull away from the housing market   So, we do have problems out there, and I don’t think we really have a great deal of   confidence in the outlook implicit in this forecast of an ongoing, very smooth and very                         August 9, 2005 86 of 110  impressive expansion in the economy  I’m certainly not arguing that I wish it were otherwise    This is as good an economy as one can get It’s just that we have to look down the road and see   what’s out there And what I see are a couple of possibilities that should make us want to   exercise some caution, although none of the potential problems, as best I can judge, is imminent,    There’s nothing out there that indicates that something is about to fall apart  But as we get into   2006, I feel that the tranquility we are forced to exhibit—because the forecast is a point estimate   in all of our projections—may be a bit overdone   In summary, I think we’re on the right path  I don’t think there’s any urgency to consider   accelerating the path nor, of course, pulling it back  I share the view expressed by a number of   you around this table in that I’m delighted that the futures markets have jacked up the implicit   longer-term projection of the funds rate quite significantly, and I think certainly to the right   dimension  And as I’ve said here before, my impression basically is that when the economy   starts to change, the markets are going to be moving ahead of us and probably will conclude   pretty much as we would conclude when we meet  If that is indeed the case, as I mentioned   earlier, the most probable outlook is that the markets are going to tell us when we have finally   reached the point where this program of increasing the funds rate is over and a pause is implied    It is conceivable that we may have to change the language abruptly, which will change   the market’s expectations and cause some disruption  I think that probably will not happen    Judging from the way we and the markets have interacted, we’re all looking at essentially the   same play book, and I think we are likely to come out with the same conclusions  If that’s the   case, the period of about six weeks that we’re going to have between one meeting and another at   the point we’re going to change is probably going to be enough time for the markets to adjust   and effectively to tell us “This is what we expect you to do when you walk into your next                                August 9, 2005 87 of 110  FOMC meeting”  And that, indeed, is likely to be what we’re going to want to do  We’re going   to change the language We’re going to change, in fact, the way we produce our statement  And   hopefully we will have phased into the next stage of monetary policymaking in a less disruptive   way than we probably fear—or at least that I fear  But that’s for the future   For now, I think the appropriate action is a move of 25 basis points and pretty much the   alternative B statement that is shown in Brian’s table  So I’d like to put that proposal on this   table and get your reactions  President Poole     We may not be able to  President Yellen                                        August 9, 2005 88 of 110    President Minehan     President Hoenig     President Santomero    Governor Kohn    I think Bill Poole’s caveat is right here  Even if you’re   technically correct, it’s questionable how much we want to change the statement language if we   don’t have to    You know, initial claims have not moved all that much   since the last meeting, so it’s a little hard to make the case  And any word that we change now,   since we’re changing so little, is going to be made more of than I think we’d want because there   are so many people out there who are being paid to read this statement and interpret our   meaning  So, I think we have to be a little careful of that  Unless something in the statement is   obviously getting to be incorrect—clearly, we can’t have that—it’s probably better not to make a   change     President Pianalto     President Stern     President Moskow     President Fisher                                              August 9, 2005 91 of 110    President Lacker    President Guynn     Governor Olson    Governor Ferguson    Leaving it at the end?     Governor Bies     Vice Chair     I must say that I was also pushing toward somewhat better   syntax and a little better use of the English language  The trouble, unfortunately, is that the only   way to do that is to move the last phrase up, and that creates policy issues in my judgment  So   I’d prefer to have poor but clear language [laughter] because we certainly don’t want to convey a   message that will bring the long-term forward rates down  Everyone in the marketplace has   agreed that we are going to move 25 basis points  If we move the longer-term forward rates in a   significant way, we’re going to have to adjust that, and that will be troublesome   Would you read the appropriate directive?    Good morning, everyone  We’ll start with Mr Kos     There is obviously some perceived advantage in taking   delivery of the securities rather than just going into the market and purchasing them  The sort of   non-conspiratorial view is that a lot of people think something is going on and, therefore, they   might as well sit and accept delivery even though that was not their intention when they bought   the futures What do you know is going on?  We certainly know who the participants are—or at   least the Exchange knows What have you learned?                             September 20, 2005 7 of 117   Is this Fannie and Freddie disproportionately by any   chance?  Obviously, they do use the securities    Instead of a scheduled close-out     Yes I’m rather fascinated by the open interest being   higher, as you get close to the end of the contract, than the total stock of the issue  That’s the   counterpart of what used to be the old corn squeeze  The same guys are doing it—    They did that all the time  [Laughter]    Further questions?  If not, would someone like to move the   ratification of the transactions by the Desk?     Call the roll, please     Okay I request a recess and ask the members of the   Federal Reserve Board to join me   [Recess]    The Federal Reserve Board voted unanimously to approve   the requests of the individual Reserve Banks for increases in the discount rate   Our next meeting is November 1  We are now well overdue for luncheon with Governor   Bernanke, and I suggest we adjourn to Dining Room E   END OF MEETING         Without objection, they are approved  We now move on   to the economic situation  Karen Johnson and David Stockton     Questions?  President Lacker       President Moskow     I know we use the various measures of inflation   expectations as a critical variable, which presupposes that the market has a superior capability of   anticipating change than normal forecasting procedures  The mechanism, as you point out,   through which we think inflation expectations largely reflect themselves in higher prices is the   wage bargaining process Have we done much work in the area of using various measures of   inflation expectations directly as a forecast indicator of inflation by just creating a reduced form   evaluation?  What is the record on that, if we in fact have looked at that?    Do you mean on their long-term inflation forecast?     No I wasn’t referring to only the Michigan survey, but to   all of the various measures we have of inflation expectations, including basically just the level of   interest rates as such What I’m trying to get at is that we make presumptions about the insight                                   September 20, 2005 21 of 117  of markets into the future that none of us personally has  I’m raising the question Is there really   information there?  In other words, can we take the level of inflation expectations, however   defined, as of today and read into it with some degree of accuracy what the actual inflation   outlook is likely to be?     Several years ago I recall that we ran a correlation with the   gold price against levels of inflation  We actually came out with some forecasting capability    Has that been rerun in recent years?     The problem is that it kept coming out, for reasons I can’t   understand, with some information capability  The reason I raise it, as you know, is that we have   a big, fat spike here, and I don’t know what to make of it    Provided that you don’t tell anybody you’re doing it!    Governor Ferguson     I think the ECI is a very interesting issue  Each March, as   I recall, we get data on actual dollar amounts of compensation of the various types that are in the   ECI And I believe we used to take the March data year-on-year and try to determine what part   of the ECI was a mix change   In view of the quite extraordinary divergence of the ECI and the compensation per hour   data, have we looked at those March data recently to see whether the aggregate dollar   compensation per hour number that they pick up for the month of March, which is conceptually   consistent with the ECI, moves with aggregate compensation per hour that we pick up from the   P&C measure or others?     It is conceivable, for example, that the March   compensation data in this series actually show the same pattern as the total, which would imply a   very significant internal shift change  And that would be a fully comprehensible explanation   because in the past they have not been all that close             September 20, 2005 25 of 117   So we didn’t learn anything from there  President Fisher    We do know something  We know that subsequent to   Katrina the noncommercial interests are net long and the commercial interests have turned net   short    That in a sense gives you some speculative suppression   because they’re already out And the question is the big surges which, as you know quite well,                September 20, 2005 27 of 117  occur when somebody is short and they cover it and they go long  Currently they’re already   long So it may be that part of the pressure is out of this market, although the market behavior   yesterday had a tone of “we’ve been burned once, we’re not going to be burned twice”  It’s   correcting in part today, but I’ve never seen a response that quickly on something that could be   quite speculative There’s a reasonably good chance that Rita won’t turn into a category 3   hurricane, or if it does that it will end up in northern Mexico  It’s really quite surprising the way   that market functions     Today the gasoline price I last saw on the spot market,   after being up over 20 cents yesterday, was down 10 cents  Today it’s fairly stable     Vice Chair     President Santomero     Other questions? If not, who would like to start?   President Moskow    President Guynn     President Santomero     President Fisher     President Yellen     President Minehan     Okay  Shall we break for coffee?   [Coffee break]     President Lacker     President Stern                            September 20, 2005 64 of 117    President Hoenig     President Poole     President Pianalto     Vice Chair     Governor Kohn    Governor Ferguson     Governor Olson     Governor Bies     Mr Reinhart     Questions for Vincent?  If not, I’ll start   I think the interesting question we have to answer is this  If Katrina had done the   destruction that it did without affecting energy prices, how would we view it?  We’ve had over                September 20, 2005 90 of 117  the post-World War II period innumerable supply-side shocks  I remember the very prolonged   steel strike of 1959, which had a profoundly debilitating effect on the economy overall, and that   affected business confidence When the strike was over, the economy came back with a surge    Theoretically, one can argue that the decline in economic activity as a consequence of a supply-  side shock lowers wages, lowers compensation, and hence lowers expenditures  And one could   theorize that a supply-side shock could bring on a recession   I have never seen that happen And I suspect the reason is that the underlying   psychology associated with the replenishment that invariably follows a supply-side shock leads   to expectations for the future that create forward momentum  I think this current situation is   exactly that—a very large supply-side shock which, ex the energy price effect, in my judgment   would have gone the way of all such scenarios There would be a significant short-term   retrenchment in activity, perhaps for a number of quarters  We would have the impact on the oil   structure and on production and refining  But I submit to you that the price effect would not   have been very high in earlier periods in our history when the crude price was $20 a barrel and   when the excess supply in OPEC was several million barrels  In other words, we would have   had the cutback in production at refineries and presumably in crude oil production, but the price   effect would have been severely muted   What is different today is something that has been mentioned several times around the   table, namely, that the surplus has been depleted and, therefore, any little variation in supply hits   the price It’s not the crude price that is causing a problem, in my judgment  It’s the gasoline   price The higher price for gasoline does, of course, contract purchasing power  But more   importantly, it has a very visual impact in that gasoline is one of the very few commodities—                   September 20, 2005 91 of 117  milk may be another one—consumers look at for which they have continuous price comparisons    So this particular surge has been very evident as we’ve watched consumer attitudes and   consumer expenditures over the course of the gasoline price run-up and especially in the   acceleration that occurred after August 29   One fascinating thing about this is that we used to talk about the crude price as though it   were a substitute for the gasoline price, and that is dramatically different this time  What we   have found is that the best way of viewing the markup from crude prices to gasoline prices is to   weight WTI 60 percent and the heavier crude, Maya, 40 percent  This traces the gasoline price   reasonably well, with a relatively stable markup from the weighted crude price through the   refining margin, through the marketing margin, and into the retail price   What has happened since the big surge and the presumed shortfall in production is that   the price for regular unleaded gasoline has gone up, as you know, to over $3 a gallon and the   weighted crude price has gone up to $150 a gallon, which is the equivalent of about a $60 per   barrel average weighted price After accounting for taxes, this is a $110 spread per gallon  The   fairly narrow, normal spread is 50 cents  So we have a 60 cent surge here, and it’s showing up   partly in refinery margins, but in truly spectacular marketing margins  And it’s clear that this is   utterly unsustainable because if there is an industry in this country that is highly competitive, it is   the neighborhood service station  The people running those stations are looking at their   competitors across the street and down the block, and they are continuously adjusting their   prices   So the question here is What has happened?  Well, what has happened is obviously   refinery breakdown in two forms  One, we’ve clearly squeezed out any excess capacity in the             September 20, 2005 92 of 117  United States And two, in the process, we’ve had very considerable difficulty as well in   refining the heavier crude oils  That gives us a worldwide mismatch between the type of crude   oils we produce, which are more sour and heavier, and the growing needs for petroleum products   that are increasingly for transportation, which of course include gasoline, diesel, and a lot of the   lighter products And essentially the production of those lighter products requires a very   substantial transformation of the heavier crudes   While we’re in better shape than Europe with respect to the balance of catalytic cracking   and coking operations, we don’t have enough  As a consequence, we’re running into very severe   pressures where the price margins are opening up considerably, especially for those refiners who   have the capacity to refine heavier and heavily discounted crudes   By the end of the year we’ll have the capacity back on line that, as Karen mentioned, is   currently off line It will gradually creep up There is at this particular stage a very significant   number of tankers moving in our direction that are loaded with motor gasoline produced in   Europe, which under EPA regulations would not be able to be sold here  We import a little over   a million barrels a day of gasoline, and a lot of it is reformulated basically into a form which   meets EPA requirements but just barely  Having dropped the EPA requirements has opened up a   substantial amount of the less stylized gasolines for the United States, and those products are   going to hit our shores in a matter of weeks  In fact, that should start relatively soon   So we should have those products shortly unless Rita turns out to be a really serious   problem, and it may  But if you take a look at the probability distribution on the path of Rita, a   goodly chunk of it is in northern Mexico and even east of New Orleans  They don’t need that, of   course It’s not as if they’ve missed the chaos and they need more of it  It will be a real mess                September 20, 2005 93 of 117  But the point here is that the worst on the gasoline price is close to being over unless   there is significant further damage to the refineries in the Houston area and below, which at this   stage is conjectural First of all, we’re making the assumption that the waters of the Gulf of   Mexico are somewhat warmer and that, therefore, that can turn just a plain storm into a   hurricane Right now they’re talking a category 1, 2, or possibly 3 hurricane, but they’re   guessing They don’t really know; and the reason they’re guessing is that it’s not possible to   know because there are too many variables  It reminds me a little of the Kenneth Arrow   anecdote; it’s not quite the same but there’s a lot of that involved     The markets are very sensitive  Having seen what happened with Katrina, they’re trying   to discount—probably well over discount—the possibilities associated with Rita  As you know,   prices have come down today; the last time I looked, the crude price was down over a dollar and   gasoline was down 7 to 10 cents a gallon after a big run-up yesterday   At some point reasonably soon we’re going to see gasoline prices move down  Ex Rita,   they will go from over $300 a gallon at the pump down to probably $260  That is a very big   move, and that will take out a significant amount of the consumer confidence erosion and   conceivably the business confidence erosion—which I can see out there, and I think several of   you have mentioned it—which, in turn, is a consequence of the erosion in consumer confidence   So I think that, short of the caveat of Rita, the scenario is not all that uncertain  There is no   historical precedent to suggest that we can keep margins at the refining and marketing levels   anywhere near where they are We know why they are there; there was a supply-side shutdown    But the supply will be coming back, and indeed, imports from Europe are going to be quite   substantial             September 20, 2005 94 of 117  If that occurs, then clearly what we will have is a situation where the outlook is still very   significantly restrained  Consumer outlays will be constrained because gasoline at $260 per   gallon is not something that will galvanize a great deal of consumption  So, over the next   number of months the economy will be fairly weak, but it’s going to be difficult to differentiate   what part is the supply side and what part is not  As a consequence, there’s going to be   considerable confusion and much, much less certainty than has been exhibited in financial   markets over the last year or so   So we’re going into a period where the one thing we can say for certain is that the level   of uncertainty is going to be rising, and it’s going to be rising on two sides  It’s going to be   rising presumably on the output side—and we’re going to be uncertain whether it’s related to   supply or demand—and almost assuredly on the price side  The reason I say that is because   we’ve been seeing a gradual upward creep in financial expectations, and none of us has   experienced anything like this in 20 years  I guess I remember more of the pre-1980 period than   most anyone around this table, and this has that very peculiar feel to it  It starts very slowly  It’s   ambiguous  It’s disputable and unforecastable, but it grows and grows and grows  If you just   look at the pattern, the change is usually too small in any short-term period to jolt you until you   look back and say “This has been growing for quite a while”  And then it starts to accelerate,   largely because inflation expectations begin to erode  That’s what the history is It’s very tough   to forecast, but we have been through an exceptionally long period of disinflation, which has   brought actual inflation expectations down and term premiums down  Everything is at its   bottom  There is nowhere for them to go except up                September 20, 2005 95 of 117  And one of the characteristics of these types of markets is that when things are going   down there is an expectational variable that says they are going to go down further  In other   words, the first difference matters  But when they get down as low as they are, the first   difference goes to zero no matter what one can say about it because they can’t go any lower    And that starts to change the pattern   I don’t know what the probabilities of this are  Anybody who makes a confident forecast   of a turn like I’ve just been discussing is really reaching, and I am reaching  All I’m basically   reaching to say is that I think the possibilities out there are a lot wider than we’re envisaging in   the Greenbook The fiscal situation in this country has gotten to be scary  There is nobody who   wants to forgo a free lunch There are big discussions about whether we ought to cut taxes or   raise spending There are very few who think in terms of whether we should worry about the   deficit Indeed, all one has to do is go out there and suggest, as I rather foolishly do on occasion,   how Congress could curtail expenditures in a very reasonable way  Do you think everyone   applauds?  Not exactly   We’ve lost our moorings  These budgets are out of control  The reason I say that is   because ever since the surpluses—which did more damage to fiscal discipline than I could   conceivably have believed—nobody finds any political purpose in showing restraint  That   means inflation premiums are going to build into long-term interest rates at some point  I don’t   know when, but it’s out there somewhere   In any event, one of the things that we know with some reasonable certainty is that,   unlike in previous periods, this sharp rise in prices is running into a degree of short-term   elasticity, especially for gasoline, that I don’t think we were anticipating  Seasonally adjusted,             September 20, 2005 96 of 117  weekly domestic demand for gasoline is off very sharply in recent weeks  Now, that’s not to say   gasoline consumption necessarily is going down  It only means that primary shipments   including imports are down 600,000 to 800,000 barrels a day  What may be happening is that   gasoline stations are essentially running down their inventories—which incidentally are not   small—and the tanks in motor vehicles that consume gasoline are being run down  The primary   published data on gasoline inventories—that would mean at primary terminals—is 200 million   barrels now That has come down significantly   On average, gasoline service station inventories are about 80 million barrels  Taking the   average capacity of fuel tanks and figuring the probable level of gasoline in those tanks, that’s   another 60 million  It’s conceivable that those numbers went down a great deal and hence the   actual consumption of gasoline has not gone down anywhere near as much as the domestic   demand  That strikes me as highly unlikely because if one is dealing with shortages, there is a   tendency, if anything, for service stations to get more rather than less gasoline  It’s only in areas   where there has been some form of rationing—even though they call it something else—that   some stations have run out of gasoline    But, in general, there’s very little question in my mind that we’ve run into something   different—namely, a significant drop in gasoline consumption  That means that people are   driving less, since the stock of cars hasn’t changed  Indeed, if you look at the overall unit use of   energy, including oil, in the nonfinancial, non-energy corporate sector—as David mentioned—   the actual per unit weighted amount of fuel per dollar of gross nonfinancial, non-energy   corporate product has been going down fairly quickly  And I might add that a big chunk of it is   in natural gas, which is natural gas demand destruction, not just conservation  So, the implied                September 20, 2005 97 of 117  efficiency numbers are not as great as they have been  But one of the reasons why the profit   margins have held up and the energy costs have not been pushed through just yet is that there is a   significant amount of productivity going on, which means that oil has less of an effect than it   used to   So we’re not seeing great damage as yet to margins  Indeed, on a monthly basis we find   that margins of nonfinancial, non-energy corporations—doing data calculations obviously quite   roughly—flattened out from March to June  Now, it’s hard to know what was going on in July   and August There has to be some compression I don’t see how it could be otherwise, but we   don’t have any data on that   Basically, I come down to the obvious question, which is of a twofold nature  If we   choose to pause today, one obvious thing that is going to happen is that the federal funds futures   curve, which now still gradually goes up even though it eventually flattens out, is going to flatten   sharply Then there’s the point that President Santomero made about the fact that the economy is   going to be showing poor data over the next number of months  So, the statement that we are   going to resume raising rates at some point soon is just not credible  The markets won’t believe   it, and for very good reason—because the data, at least in the short run, are not going to give a   rationale for raising rates largely because it’s not going to be clear what is the supply-side effect   and what is the demand-side effect  That confusion is going to stay with us for a while   So I agree that if we want to restore the path of further interest rate increases, it’s going to   be next year, but it’s going to be next year in the face of what in my judgment is going to be a set   of heightened inflationary forces  And if that is the case, we will be way behind the curve   because what we are looking at for sure is less economic output and more inflation, though the                      September 20, 2005 98 of 117  precise combination is not easy to determine  But if you have a measure of stagflation about   which we could say we had virtually none of it a year ago, we’re beginning to get some of it    We’re trading off increased nominal GDP for real GDP  And this sort of process is going to   continue for a while   I think that pausing at this stage is highly risky, but not so much because of the issue of   our technical capability to come back to our path and explain why we’re raising rates  We could   do it We’re an independent agency  If we saw very poor data but saw inflationary forces, we   could raise rates I think we’d run into very serious explanatory problems, and I think at the end   of the day we wouldn’t do it I fear that we wouldn’t, even though we probably should   The question, therefore, gets down not so much to the notion of perception and our ability   to move, but to what is the right thing to do  And the right thing to do in my judgment is to   recognize, as several of you have mentioned, that the real risk imbalance is on the inflation side    If it turns out that we raise the funds rate today—I don’t know what we’re going to do   thereafter—and the economy actually shows a weakening beyond the supply-side or gasoline­  price-induced weakness, we have the capacity to move the rate back down sharply  For example,   after 9/11, we opened up the faucets  On October 19, 1987, we just opened everything up    Nobody is going to complain if we suddenly reverse and start to pump money into the system,   because the reasons for our doing that will be self-evident   If, however, we pause here and the outcome I fear materializes, we could run into   problems  I want to emphasize that I’m not pretending I know what the probabilities of that are    All I’m stipulating is that, on the basis of my experience, I sense that they are larger than we’re   projecting, mainly because our projections are based on the experience of the last 20 years  And                September 20, 2005 99 of 117  the period of the last 20 years has been the most extraordinary period of beneficence in economic   policy that I can imagine, helped a good deal by globalization and the excess of intended saving   over intended investment   This period is going to end at some point  I think it’s just too risky to try to guess when   that is going to be And we ought to have a sufficient buffer out there when we start to run into   some troubles because we don’t seem to be able in this country to have buffers on anything  For   example, we allowed our excess electric capacity to run down in California, as it did a few years   ago We’ve allowed our oil refinery capacity to run down  I can name a number of other   examples in non-energy related areas  But what we definitely need at this stage is a buffer in the   monetary policy area to be sure we’re well positioned if it turns out that we’re running into the   early stages of stagflation If it turns out that is not the case, all to the better  We may have put   in more insurance than was necessary, but that insurance, in my judgment, is very well worth the   cost So I would opt for a 25 basis point increase in the funds rate with the language in the   statement essentially that of alternative B in its most recently revised form   Comments?  President Lacker     President Hoenig    Governor Ferguson             September 20, 2005 100 of 117   Governor Kohn     President Moskow     Governor Olson     Governor Bies     President Pianalto    President Guynn     Well, it will be reflected in the minutes, which are now   coming out three weeks after the meeting     President Santomero                September 20, 2005 102 of 117   Thank you President Stern    I certainly hope so  [Laughter]     President Fisher     President Minehan     Vice Chair    Would you read the appropriate language?    Good morning, everyone  Before we get started, I just want to   thank you for what was an extraordinary evening for me and also a big surprise  I appreciate not    only that all of you showed up but, as best I can judge, that  virtually everyone else who was   physically able to do so also showed up  So, it was great   On to official business  Mr Kos, please    Thank you  I notice that we still don’t endeavor to calculate   the implicit 2- or 5-year break-even inflation rates—subtracting out the implicit CPI forecast from   what the futures markets are telling us about energy prices to get inferentially what the CPI ex food   and energy would be if one presumes that the energy futures markets are arbitraged against the   TIPS     I don’t recall seeing any calculations recently      Yes, but I never saw the result    That still doesn’t answer my question!  [Laughter]     Well, can you just give me a hint as to what I’m going to learn?    Okay Thank you  On page 2 in the upper left-hand chart, I   notice that the relationship among these sovereign debt yields, which we’ve been looking at for a   long time, have gradually morphed from fairly low correlation to extremely high correlation   Do we have any rolling correlation coefficients that suggest when that happened and the   presumptive hypotheses as to why?  Are we looking at the same issues that I inadvertently called a   conundrum early this year?  Or is this going back well before then?     For a while     You know, the rolling coefficient is a measure of the degree of   globalization     I’ve had the vague impression that it’s been exceptionally tight   over the most recent period, more so than I recall  This chart doesn’t suggest spikes of any type, but   it suggests just plain old-fashioned arbitrage   On the Brazilian and Colombian issuances you referred to, I presume these were issued in   their local currencies?     Yes     Why are they doing that?  Why not just pay off in reals?    Do you mean the principal is guaranteed in dollars?    You mean it’s guaranteed in—    Okay    Wait a second    For the old Brady bonds the principal was guaranteed in   dollars That is not what this is    Well, it’s not clear to me why they are doing that  If you have   a freely floating exchange rate—if I understand what you’re telling me—the holder can just as   easily get the payment in reals and convert it to dollars    But isn’t the only difference that should exist the transaction   cost of the conversion of the currency?                                   November 1, 2005 10 of 114    Yes     You really begin to get a multiple exchange rate type of thing    So that would explain part of it  If that’s the case, however, does the investor know which particular   exchange rate he will be hit with?  It doesn’t strike me that that’s a great defense    Is the Colombian issue the same?     This is not the status of the Mexican peso issue of several years   ago, which was just a pure local currency for the first time ever     On the bottom of page 3, are these brokerage sector CDS?  Is   this the mix of their individual portfolios or their estimates of the total market?    Oh, this is the actual credit default swap on Lehman Brothers   or on—    This tells you a good deal about the individual firms  That’s   interesting     I’m going back in the private sector  I’ve got to know who’s   risky! [Laughter]  That was off the record  [Laughter]     Vice Chair     President Lacker     Obviously, we’ve created a full array of insights, which has    evoked no questions  [Laughter] We’re going to run out of time    You do need a vote  Vice Chair     Let’s have a recess, and the Board of Governors will convene    in my office   [Recess]     The Board passed unanimously the requests of all 12 Reserve    Banks for an increase in the discount rate to 5 percent     Our next meeting is Tuesday, December 13, 2005  Shall we go to lunch?    END OF MEETING        Without objection, the transactions of the Desk are approved    We’ll turn now to Mr Stockton and Ms Johnson     Are any commentators looking at the movement of the real   trade deficit and raising the issue of J-curve possibilities?     I’ve seen almost none of it  That’s all    But this downturn is somewhat unusual    It is the import price data which really undercut it     President Lacker     President Moskow    President Poole    President Fisher                                               November 1, 2005 26 of 114    Governor Kohn     President Lacker     David, have you learned anything more in the last 24 hours on   the issue of the miss on producers’ durable equipment?                              November 1, 2005 28 of 114    All right  Are there any further questions for our colleagues?   If not, would somebody like to start?  President Moskow    President Fisher    President Yellen     President Lacker     President Minehan     President Guynn     President Santomero    President Hoenig    President Pianalto    President Stern    President Poole     All right  Shall we break for coffee?  Let’s come back in a   reasonable period of time   [Coffee break]     Vice Chair     Governor Kohn     Governor Olson     Governor Bies    Governor Ferguson     I knew him well  [Laughter]    Thank you  Mr Reinhart    Questions for Vincent?     If you put in an inflation forecast, you’ve just targeted inflation   to a point, not a range That’s what will happen  We’ll be locked in to explaining why we didn’t   move on either side of the forecast  I think it’s very tricky     I think we’re missing an opportunity as fiscal agent for the   federal government to have an audience for this meeting and collect revenues, which could probably   balance the budget!  [Laughter]  President Fisher     President Guynn     I think that’s precisely the direction in which Vincent is going   at this point     Further questions?  To quote somebody from last night, why   don’t I proceed?  [Laughter]   Something very unusual is occurring both in the economy and, as a consequence, in monetary   policy deliberations  Essentially, this surprisingly long—and I must say in retrospect rather   successful—interval of incremental measured changes over a protracted period of time, has turned   out a lot better than I think we could conceivably have imagined  But it’s clearly coming to an end    And I think the reason it’s coming to an end is that our grasp on what’s going on in the world is a   little more tenuous than it was when we started  You may recall that we had a general view of the   way we thought the world was going to work in the spring of 2004 when we started to indicate that   we were going to tighten  The markets all began to respond  The duration measures, the convexity   measures, and all the various forward-looking measures were adjusting the whole structure of   interest rates in the context of how we and the rest of the world thought the world was working    Then suddenly the whole thing crumbled  It crumbled because there was essentially an X   factor out there which we had not anticipated—a disinflationary force  And we worried about that    It resurfaced this year, and I think we finally concluded that it reflected essentially the significant   increase in the active workforce in the market economy  That increase was a result of over 100                                       November 1, 2005 89 of 114  million people from the former Soviet Union coming from a centrally planned, isolated economy   and being added into the world market economy  Even larger, but a little later was the addition of  a   workforce of 750 million in China, as that country began moving in the direction of market forces    And more lately, India—although India is a bit laggard in this respect     The consequence, of course, was to double the number of workers in the labor force who are   participating in world markets  They are not necessarily wholly involved in tradable goods, but   there has been a definite shift in the structure in the world labor force  These are educated, but not   highly productive workers; and obviously, they are producing a much smaller fraction of world   output in these emerging nations than is coming from the developed world  But what we are   observing is this phenomenon where unit labor costs are undergoing for the world as a whole a   significant but one-time change    If we had the data, which we would have only very crudely, we could make a judgment as to   what bringing all of these people into the workforce does to world unit labor costs  Indeed, we have   all sorts of examples of what’s happening at the margin, not the least of which is in the United   States In Germany the impact of workers from the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Poland is very   pronounced  It’s very pronounced in the United States and in a lot of countries as a result of   China’s workforce   What we are clearly seeing are disinflationary forces that are reflected in inflation premiums   in the longer tranches of the interest rate market  So, the tenth-year tranche of the 10-year note has   been really quite suppressed and only very recently has moved up   We know without actual data that the shift, which politically occurred in a very short period of   time, cannot occur that rapidly economically  There has been a gradual absorption of all of these   people into the labor force  And we know that it is, indeed, a one-time event  When you’re                             November 1, 2005 90 of 114  experiencing gradualism from a one-time event, the rate of change at which the transition is   occurring has a very significant impact  I would argue—looking at world inflationary patterns and   the high correlations between core inflation worldwide and the remarkable decline in inflation in the   emerging world—that this is a global process  Even in earlier periods when we had low inflation in   the developed world, we had huge problems in the developed world  We do not even have that   anymore   We have, as we were discussing very early in the meeting, this convergence of interest rates,   so that what we are looking at is quite evidently a global phenomenon  And when we try to   reconcile, as we are trying to do, the anecdotal evidence of these inflation pressures that we’re   seeing with what’s coming out of our models, there is a dissonance  In other words, the models are   not consistent with an anecdotal example of the kind President Fisher was talking about in terms of   the surge in prices in Texas  A lot of you have noted similar examples  It goes beyond the issue of   a mere pass-through of energy costs  Energy costs are being passed through, we know, and because   profit margins generally are not being squeezed by it, we’re essentially seeing a full pass-through    But because the productivity in the use of energy is clearly improving, the pass-through is in fact   partial   There’s more to this story, though, than we’re observing because energy is a much less   significant factor than it used to be  Indeed, we’ve just had a decline in the last two months of 57   cents a gallon at the pump for regular gasoline  Now, that is clearly going to have effects, though   we’re not quite sure what they will be  But it strikes me that our real policy problems involve how   to make a judgment as to what phase we’re in of this disinflationary set of pressures  When does it   eventually come to an end—or more exactly, when do we get enough of the adjustment so that the   adjustments thereafter slow down?   What that means is that the disinflationary effect on just the                                November 1, 2005 91 of 114  normal rise in structural unit labor costs worldwide is easing  In other words, if there’s a lot of   pressure, that pressure will keep the inflation rate down  But the deflationary pressure eases as we   complete the process, and we begin to get—and would expect to get—a gradual rise in core   inflation  And that is what we’re getting  That’s not to say that we’re getting a rise in core inflation    What we have to do, I think, is come to grips with a very large element of uncertainty regarding   how this process is emerging and how it’s going to come out  I do think that the indications of the   rise in core inflation, as modest as it is, may be—and I underline the word “may”— a sign that the   first difference of that adjustment process is changing  Yet we’re not getting it in the inflation   compensation  To be sure, as I said, the 10-year tranche has moved up 20 to 25 basis points  It’s   not a big deal; indeed, a good part of that could be real and probably is   So we’re really delving into areas where our past experience is not all that helpful  If in the   spring of 2004 the big surge in expectations in terms of where the 10-year note was going to end up   and where the mortgage rate was going to end up had actually materialized, we’d be in a different   world today  And that world would be based a lot on the way our old models worked and the way   certain relationships have worked in history  But there is something new here with which we have   to come to grips  And strangely enough, the most beneficial way to address this particular subject in   our communication, in my judgment, is through the statement  In the statement, we are, indeed,   recognizing the elements of uncertainty with which we are confronted  The surety we had and went   forward on starting in the spring of 2004—in terms of how we were viewing developments and the   appropriate policy to follow—has proceeded literally almost unchanged  That’s really quite a   remarkable stretch But it’s over  Or I should say it’s about on the edge of being over because we   can no longer be as sure as we were about the intermediate-term outlook                                     November 1, 2005 92 of 114  I feel a little queasy about using the word “accommodative” for a 4 percent federal funds rate   largely because, as you may recall, we didn’t get to “accommodative” until we went from 2 percent   to 1¾ percent in the earlier period  So I find that Don has the obvious solution to all of this    “Accommodative” is the state we wanted to leave for whatever reason and, therefore, raised the   rate [Laughter]   In any event, yes, I do think that we need to move today  I wouldn’t worry about the   statement being stale  It has been stale for a very long time  [Laughter]  And it’s not going to   change that much  I think at the December meeting we’ve got to make some fundamental choices,   and it would certainly be helpful if we could come together and essentially complete the structure of   what we are going to do—if not in actuality at least the conceptual underpinnings of it—so that we   will be on a new path with new wording  And depending on how Vincent decides he wants to read   your responses to his questionnaire, perhaps we will have a new statement  [Laughter]  So that’s the   direction I would suggest we take     Now, the actual wording of the proposed statement, I think, is slightly different from what we   have here, isn’t it?     But I thought there was a semicolon somewhere     My apologies  So everyone has actually seen this  If it is   acceptable, this is the statement we will be going with  I would, therefore, put it as a suggestion that   we move 25 basis points and use the alternative B statement as is  Governor Kohn                            November 1, 2005 93 of 114   When we try to be original!    President Hoenig    President Pianalto     President Minehan     We want to be reasonably clear in which direction we may   change it rather than leave the question open  Just to say we’re going to change but we’re not going   to tell you how, I think will create substantial unnecessary uncertainty     That’s what I did say  That’s what I believe    I can’t speak for the rest of the Committee in that respect, but   we’ll all be vetting the minutes so we can try to do our best in conveying our thoughts  My only   concern is not to introduce a new uncertainty in the process since we’ve done exceptionally well for   so long  Being innovative has less value than I think we’ve realized    The term is “ongoing discussion”  That will clarify it  That’s   basically saying Don’t take this as some dramatic change     Yes  President Santomero     Yes     We might want to get involved in that as we proceed with the   minutes and see where, in fact, everybody is  Perhaps we can give, implicitly at least, some   guidance as to what we all ought to be doing when the minutes come out  President Lacker    President Fisher     President Moskow    President Stern     Governor Olson                               November 1, 2005 98 of 114    President Guynn    President Yellen     Governor Bies     He can find agreement where none exists!  [Laughter]    Governor Ferguson                                                            November 1, 2005 99 of 114   President Poole     Vice Chair    Let the record show that I had an enigmatic expression    [Laughter]                                                      November 1, 2005 101 of 114  Ms Danker, would you read the appropriate language?     Call the roll, please    Good morning, everyone  Mr Kos, will you start us off,   please?     With respect to your yield curves on page 2, implicit there are    three observations from which you could presumably get what you’re trying to get at, namely, some    form of weighted interest rate differential for the three observations  These do move the exchange   rate What happens if you take this back in time?  Is there any explanatory power in this relationship?     I thought we found approximately zero    Well, this is a very interesting chart, and I like the colors  But   what does it tell us?  [Laughter]    I do suspect that the price of pork bellies on occasion—    [Laughter]       Then there’s a question of whether the theory has any fact   behind it    Anyway, let me move on to my second question  You   mentioned with regard to the performance of equity markets that on the bottom of page 3, if you took   the S&P exchange-rate-adjusted, it would look more like the rest  But you already do that when   you’re showing everything in US dollar terms    Okay  President Poole     Further questions?  If not, Vice Chair, would you kindly make   the appropriate motion?     Okay Let’s move to recess  I’d like to ask the Federal    Reserve Board members to come to my office to respond to requests for changes in the discount rate    [Recess]       The Board voted to approve the requests of all twelve Reserve   Banks to increase the discount rate to 5¼ percent    The last item on the agenda is to confirm that our next meeting, and my last, is January 31st   See you all for lunch   END OF MEETING        Without objection, the transactions of the Desk are approved    Mr Stockton    This is Comedy Central!  [Laughter]    I have the impression, and I don’t know whether the hard data actually confirm it, that the   emerging countries, adjusting for policy, politics, history, whatever, seem to be doing a good deal   better than one ordinarily projects  The EMBI spread has continued to come down through all sorts of   developments  We have the spectacle of the Mexicans a couple of years ago or so being able to sell   for the first time a long-term peso-denominated debt instrument  Brazil just sold one denominated in   its domestic currency, and Colombia did as well  The Argentinean debacle never resulted in the really   awful consequences that were supposed to occur there, and industrial production is up sharply in   Argentina despite all of their other problems  Venezuela should be shutting its doors by now, granted   what they’re doing there, but it’s not doing all that badly  Is something fundamental happening that   explains all of this?    Is there considerably more exchange rate flexibility now?     Yes, that’s what I’m saying    Well, that’s actually a fairly encompassing explanation  It   implies that the lessons from 1998, when they were trying to fund in dollars and lend in the domestic   currency—trying to unwind the rules of accounting, which got them all into very serious trouble—   have been learned, essentially     President Santomero    President Poole    President Fisher     President Minehan     President Lacker     Any further questions?  If not, before we do the roundtable, let   me reiterate something that I think has been communicated—namely, that Brian is going to discuss in   some detail some of the back and forth that has been occurring here in recent days on the language of   the statement So please abstain from commenting on the statement in the first round until Brian has   made his comments  Given that, have I discouraged anybody?  [Laughter]  President Moskow     Thank you  President Hoenig                            December 13, 2005 29 of 100    President Guynn    President Fisher    President Yellen     President Minehan     President Lacker     President Santomero                            December 13, 2005 43 of 100   President Pianalto    Okay  President Poole                                  December 13, 2005 48 of 100    Why don’t we break for coffee at this time and come back in   fifteen minutes   [Coffee break]    President Stern     Vice Chair     Governor Kohn     Governor Ferguson     Governor Olson     Governor Bies     Mr Madigan    Questions for Brian?   If there are no questions, it   implies that everyone agrees with everything you just said  [Laughter]      It’s interesting to listen to the discussion around this table   today because the underlying facts are really somewhat different from what we had perceived at our   last meeting There is evidence that the economy is moving at a pace and in a direction that I don’t   think we would have anticipated six weeks or two months ago, especially in the context of the   hurricanes  The underlying real rate of growth is really powerful     We can see it in the United States but just as importantly, if not more so, we are beginning to   see it abroad  Japan is finally getting its act together, as best I can judge  For a long period of time   Japan had very poor financial results within its banking system; and while they had a nonperforming   loan statistic, it certainly wasn’t anything like the type that we would calculate  Therefore it looked as   though the economy was a fragile one, with a banking system that was largely reliant on real estate   collateral whose prices continuously plummeted  Moreover, the state of financial intermediation in   Japan was highly dubious because banking is the only vehicle they have for intermediation; there   really isn’t an alternate means of moving savings into investment  However, the Japanese banking   system has finally gotten to a point where it looks like a regular, old-fashioned banking system    Intermediation is now going on  A lot of the pieces are beginning to come together  And the reason   this is important is that for a very long time we’ve been disregarding Japan as an international force,                             December 13, 2005 66 of 100  even though it’s the second largest economy in the world  That’s because it just never moved  As a   consequence, the Japanese economy wasn’t an important factor in the global outlook but it now seems   to be moving in a favorable direction    And we’re even getting stirrings in Europe, where Germany, though still in very serious   trouble, is clearly showing some signs of improvement  Obviously, their unit labor costs have   stabilized, and the impact of their very serious structural problems seems not to be getting worse   When one looks around the world, most economies are improving  In the United States, some   of the old-fashioned data, as I was mentioning to David yesterday, are showing some very strong   signs One example is that moribund industry which used to be the cutting edge fifty years ago, the   steel industry  Durable goods, no matter how you cut it, are still largely made of steel, and those   markets are quite strong  Scrap prices are up  US Steel is booking its orders significantly far out   into the future There is buoyancy there and also in the nonferrous metals markets—markets we   never used to worry about, but they still do matter    The reason it is tough to get similar information out of, say, the high-tech industries is that   while they are growing very rapidly, the dispersion from one company to the other is dramatic  In   other words, if you get an industry growth rate of 15 percent, say, you might find that one company   grows 30 percent for two years and then its growth goes down to 2 percent and vice versa for some   other firm  So, with the technology changing so rapidly, you can’t get the anecdotal readings from a   lot of those companies the way you do on the old-fashioned industries where nothing changes all that   much and you have a reasonably good base for making judgments   It’s hard to imagine an American economy that is as balanced as this one is  But most   importantly, through all of this, we are literally seeing some resistance to the upside pressures on   inflation  I find the most credible evidence on this in the forward tranches of the 10-year Treasury                           December 13, 2005 67 of 100  note  Every time pressures begin to move up the implicit rate on the 1-year maturity being issued nine   years out, when the rate gets to somewhat over 5 percent it runs into resistance     What I think is happening relates to the discussion that I put on the table last meeting about   the significant move of educated workforces into market economies from centrally planned   economies—specifically the old Soviet Union, and now far more importantly China, and to a limited   extent India, which still has characteristics of central planning as well  At the meeting six weeks ago,   we had no data at all about the rate of change at which that transition is occurring but it’s clearly a   level adjustment  And the rate at which it is happening is a determinant of changes in unit labor costs   and, therefore, price changes or inflation   Some additional work has been done by Karen’s group, especially on China, in trying to get a   judgment about the movement of workers from the centrally planned sector of the economy to the   competitive free market sector  That work indicates in rough proxies—granted, these are extremely   crude data—that the rate of change has been rising for a number of years and that there does not yet   seem to be any evidence that it has peaked  Now, ordinarily that would not be a great insight because   the data are so poor But if you’re looking for explanations of why we’re running into upside   resistance on prices—every time we get strong demand and increased short-term rates, long-term rates   don’t want to move—this globalization of the workforce seems to be a factor     If you look at the charts on longer-term rates today, they go up, they run into trouble, they   come down There’s a ceiling out there apparently, which suggests that at least for the time being   inflation expectations are clearly contained  But judging from the real-time price data, they’re also   soft  And they are soft around the world, not just in the United States  We’re now getting price   pressures in some places  In a couple of countries that are unbelievably expansionary and have   irresponsible policies, we’re seeing inflation rates getting up to 6 or 7 percent  The reason I raised the                             December 13, 2005 68 of 100  issue before is that twenty years ago those rates would have been 20 percent  We’re not getting any   of that  So this is not a US issue  It has to be a global one   This suggests to me that we have a very unusual situation where conventional analysis tells us   very concretely the following We’re running out of spare capacity; things are tightening up; and   wage rates are under pressure, though not so much in the skilled area in the United States as in the   lesser skilled area where we’re beginning to see wage rates rise  Indeed, that is evident in the series   we run using the wage and salary data in the NIPA [national income and product accounts]   accounts—which of course are tied to virtually full coverage for the unemployment insurance   system—and the employment and implicit hours data that come out of the establishment labor market   survey That survey reports data on average hourly earnings for production or non-supervisory   workers  Using those data and the totals from the NIPAs, one can infer the average hourly wage for   supervisory workers or skilled workers—that is, the 20 percent of the workforce not included in the   average hourly earnings data  In the last several months, after having run well above 10 percent, the   supervisory hourly wage rate has come down quite significantly, so that the ratio of wages for   supervisory or skilled work to that for lesser skilled work is beginning to stabilize  And that suggests   that we’re beginning to get a little more pressure on lesser skilled wages and somewhat less pressure   on skilled wages  These data are very interesting in the sense that they’re based essentially on   aggregated data, and they are something we never really looked at previously  But I think they tell us   a great deal about what’s going on in the labor markets, and these data involve developments that we   don’t ordinarily look at   This leads us to a very interesting question as to where policy should go from here  Let’s say   we knew for certain that inflationary expectations were held down and that core inflation was   reasonably well suppressed  The issue would still arise as to whether, with this global phenomenon,                                                  December 13, 2005 69 of 100  we are constructing a situation in which interest rates are so low that we are encouraging, or indeed   causing, underlying speculative activity that will create really serious imbalances in the overall   system   So we’re dealing with a little more than the question of where inflation is going because, as I   have mentioned previously, something that has become very evident in recent years is that overall   asset prices worldwide, both equity and debt, are rising a good deal faster than product prices  And   they are picking up because of—indeed, the rise in asset prices is being engendered by—the fact that   interest rates are getting ever lower  Interest rates in emerging-market economies are as low as one   can remember  And aside from the surprisingly high equity premium in the United States, we have   very significant upward momentum in asset values  This is where the very important question of   whether monetary policy should target asset prices comes in  The current situation is a very   interesting case because I would say that we ought to be tightening at this particular point but not   targeting the asset price increases  But it is clearly the potential for speculative activity—and its effect   on asset prices—which is generating an assessment that we need to move, as far as evaluating the   outlook for the overall economy   So where I come out on all of this is that unless we move a little to tighten up a bit further, I   think we’re taking a risk of the system beginning to run faster than we would like  I conclude, as a   consequence, that we need to move today  I think we have to indicate, as the statement for alternative   B suggests, that we’ll move again in January  I would hope that after the statement comes out today   the March futures for the federal funds rate do not come down  I would prefer that futures rates move   up a bit, even if it’s our expectation—and it’s a plausible expectation—that the January increase will   be the end of our tightening  I can conceive of that occurring, but I think we have more here to be   concerned about than just the balance of risks in the United States and the issue of whether we are                               December 13, 2005 70 of 100  getting product price inflation or not, and I think the odds are that we are not  But we are running into   the question of whether we are opening up a very significant potential for a major increase in asset   expansion Remember that when we talk about liquidity, we’re talking about an increase in overall   purchasing power; and common stocks as well as bonds are, in a sense, currency  And if prices of   bonds and stocks go up, that will result in a very high degree of liquidity in the system, which may or   may not hit on product prices  Frankly, I think it’s unlikely to do so   We have a global market and a global environment here, which I don’t think we yet fully   understand In fact, I know we don’t fully understand  Nevertheless, I think we need to tighten to be   sure that we’re safe from these speculative incursions  I believe the risks of not doing so are far   greater than tightening a little bit more than probably in retrospect we would have had to do  So I   think we ought to move forward    My own personal view is that we should not drop the word “measured” from the statement   because that would imply that we’re really beginning to see developments out there that are moving   very rapidly, and I think it’s too soon to conclude that  My arguments, I think, are largely   precautionary in the sense that there is something significant happening around the world that we   cannot as yet fully explain, but it is one of the possible scenarios that has a high element of risk in it    And I think we have to address ourselves to that just from a risk management point of view   So I conclude that we ought to move the funds rate target up 25 basis points, which I think is   the general consensus around here, and I believe the statement that we have in “B” fulfills our   objectives with regard to communicating that  I would be cautious about indicating at any time that   we are about to end the increases in the funds rate, even though we may well be doing that, because   that will bring mortgage rates down through the usual effect on the 10-year note  I think whatever   froth there is in the housing market is becoming contained at this stage, and it’s getting contained                                   December 13, 2005 71 of 100  largely because mortgage rates have moved up and are beginning to have an impact  Remember, it’s   not only the 30-year fixed rate but adjustable rates as well  And short-term rates have moved up quite   significantly and are impacting the market   If we can contain the presumptive housing bubble, then we have a really remarkable run out   there But the real danger, in my judgment—where I think the risks lie—is in moving rates down too   soon When I say moving down, I mean that when we stop tightening, the long-term rates are going   to come down  And in my view we have to be careful about how that happens and what the impact is   on the economy  Indeed, our actions are going to have an impact on the world at large because they   will affect what everybody does  When I sit in the G-7 meetings, it’s very evident that what the   Federal Reserve does with respect to policy has a quite significant impact on the ECB and the Bank of   England The reason I know that is they tell me that  So, what we do is going to be quite important    So, my proposal is a 25 basis point increase in the funds rate target and the statement language of   alternative B  Who would like to open up the discussion?    Let me just respond  We have a problem if we move too   quickly in changes that we make  This statement is a very significant change                                       December 13, 2005 72 of 100    President Lacker     President Minehan     President Moskow     If I could, I’d like to respond to that just to give you the other   side of the argument  The fact that we are making a significant change in the statement is the reason   why they might conclude that we’re also changing the 25 to 50, and I think that we want to keep   ourselves flexible in that regard  In my judgment, the risk of that interpretation getting into the   marketplace and causing a much stronger response than we’d ever expect is high  And I’m not sure   why we can’t remove “measured” in January, for example  In other words, there’s no rush to phase   out the statement By March this statement will be long since gone, having had—how would you put   it?—a respectable interment or whatever  [Laughter]  But I think we’re underestimating the size of   the change we’re making here; we’re so used to markets not responding at all  I think there’s a little   more tentativeness out there  People are not quite certain, which means that there is a greater chance   of a strong market response  Or perhaps more accurately, there is the chance that the market will   respond in one way first and then 15 minutes later will go wholly in the other direction  We’ve seen   that type of reaction in the past  We haven’t seen that recently                             December 13, 2005 77 of 100  I’m a little uncomfortable about that phenomenon in this context  As you say, our knowledge   at this point is a little sketchy in terms of what the market reaction will be  But I can go either way on   the word “measured” myself  I just think it’s better to keep it in now and then take it out later    If you can guarantee that the market will—[Laughter]    President Stern    President Fisher    President Poole    The only thing I would say in response to that is that if we   change “is likely” to “may” at this meeting, we’re going to get a bond market rally, which we’re not   going to find helpful in containing the speculation in the housing market  So I think it’s more an issue   not of what our intentions are but how the market is likely—I shouldn’t use the word “likely”                                  December 13, 2005 80 of 100  [laughter]—to react  What we’re trying to do essentially is to get a soft landing coming in from the   top Markets tend to over-respond, as we’ve seen too often  Saying “may” implies that we may not   move in January, and that will bring the structure of the yield curve down quite measurably  And I   think that will open up house price speculation, which will create problems for us  In my view, it is   perfectly credible that we may choose to make January our last increase  And if we do, as Brian said,   we have the sentence in row 5 there  That’s its purpose   Look, if this economy slows down significantly, the markets will adjust before our next   meeting, and whatever we say will be almost irrelevant  That’s what we’re dealing with  It’s   essentially playing the short-term game and trying to guess what the 10-year note is going to do   relative to what we’re doing  I happen to think it’s a risky activity, even though it’s perfectly credible   that January could be our last boost in the funds rate     Well, I think we’re all in agreement that we want to get out   from under this language as soon as feasible and with as little disruption as feasible  And we’re   guessing in a lot of areas We just have no way of anticipating certain things  We’re all going in the   same direction  The question is how fast we get there  Governor Ferguson     Governor Bies     Governor Olson     President Santomero     Governor Kohn    President Pianalto    President Yellen     President Guynn     Vice Chair     We are going to be voting only on the directive and the   assessment of risks; therefore, we needed a second view of the Committee on the statement itself  It   turns out that the critical word there that has been in dispute, and which Brian was unable to resolve,   was the word “measured”  And it had the advantage of not changing the rest of the statement either   way—whether it was in or it was out  In the event, a significant majority seems to be in favor of   leaving “measured” in Hence, we will vote on the directive and the assessment of risks, and if that   gets an affirmative vote, we will presume that the language for the statement shown under alternative   B is acceptable as well  So, why don’t you read “B” and the assessment of risks    Call the roll     Thank you all very much  I’ll try to say more later, but I’m   not sure I can make it  [Laughter]  Item 1 on the agenda is just basically for me to turn it over to   Roger Ferguson to do as he sees fit  [Laughter]     For the day     Why don’t you continue on with the staff while you’re in full   swing?     Why don’t you read that?     We also have to designate the Chief FOIA Officer  Thanks   to a recent executive order, the FOMC is required to appoint a Chief FOIA Officer  The consensus   January 31, 2006 4 of 106    candidate appears to be the Committee’s Deputy Secretary  Accordingly, a vote is needed, indeed   mandatory, to designate Debbie Danker, or her successor, as the FOMC’s Chief FOIA Officer, with   authority to “subdelegate” duties as appropriate  And we stipulate that the addition of that word,   which is not legally required, be expunged from the record!  [Laughter]  Without objection   The next item is the proposed revisions to the Program for Security of FOMC Information    Proposed additions to the Program for Security of FOMC Information reflect  (1) incorporation of   the Board’s new rules on access to confidential information by noncitizens, (2) a minor adjustment   to align the program with the clause in the foreign currency authorization, and (3) a statement of the   Chairman’s powers to make exceptions, which had been inadvertently trimmed in last year’s   rewriting  Would somebody like to move?   PARTICIPANT  So moved     Without exception  Our next item is the selection of a   Federal Reserve Bank to execute transactions for the System Open Market Account  My notes say   that New York is again the odds-on favorite  [Laughter]  I’m always going with the odds-on   favorite  I would suggest that, unless somebody moves, I will do so and assume it’s effectively   implemented  Without objection, so ordered   Next, selection of a Manager of the System Open Market Account  Dino Kos is the   incumbent  And on the presumption that he is acceptable to the New York Bank, he then becomes   the candidate for Manager of the System Open Market Account  Would somebody like to move the   nomination?     Without objection  Now, as to the authorization for Desk   operations—why don’t you take over and propose it?   January 31, 2006 5 of 106      Without objection     Yes  President Lacker has expressed his intention to uphold   the Richmond tradition of voting against both the foreign currency authorization and the directive    [Laughter]  But he remains in favor of the procedural instructions  So lacking Lacker, are there any   objections?  [Laughter]  Would you like time to—     Any further discussion on this issue?  Would you like to—   PARTICIPANT  So moved     Without other objection—noting, of course, that the   Richmond Bank is dissenting  Dino Kos      I’d like to go back to the British experience, which I think is   intriguing in a number of different respects  The United Kingdom has TIPS-type issues going out   fifty years  What do they index the fifty-year maturity to, incidentally?     So it’s not terribly dissimilar to ours  But what I think is   really quite fascinating is that these relationships are largely demographically driven  In other   words, the question is essentially that, if we’re heading into a society in which an ever-increasing   proportion of the people are retired, then you have some real pressure to fund—which we don’t do   but everyone else should  Let’s put it this way  Every pension theoretician will tell you there is no   problem with pensions  All you have to do is make the appropriate maturity matches  And if you   get a big surge in potential retirees, the demand for longer-term issues goes up, which we take as a   given   But this is the first evidence—at least that I’ve been able to see—that this is an   overwhelming force because, irrespective of the other forces that drive the long-term rates, the   spread between the thirty-year and the fifty-year is really quite pronounced  And it is suggesting   that it cannot be an economic forecast  We have enough trouble forecasting nine months    January 31, 2006 11 of 106    [Laughter]  But to draw the distinction between thirty years out and fifty years out, I submit, is a   wholly random variable  And so it has to be the demographics  And what the demographics are   telling us is that the issue is large enough to essentially dominate the longer end of the markets    This suggests to me that the thirty-year, which we struggled to get rid of and is now coming back,   may not turn out to be the longest maturity we’re eventually going to sell because the evidence   suggests that there is a very heavy demand in thirty-year forwards, all of which will tend to depress   the thirty-year yield if we don’t have a greater maturity  And there will be market pressures to de-  link that whole thirty-year plus back onto the issue   I was wondering whether or not this subject is engaging the Street because I’ve been   puzzled by the tranches of the thirty-year issue, which mature from 2020 on, when the fiscal   problems in the United States seemingly mount potential instability—which is another way of   saying that these pressures may overwhelm the economics  At least they are doing so in Britain    And the question is, do you think we’re going to be replicating Britain’s experience?     But if we know that there has always been this presumption,   well, it can’t be large enough to have an effect     What was the date of that?     Well, what happened to the term premium?     It gets overwhelmed by the arithmetic   January 31, 2006 13 of 106      When we were doing the analysis of the change in the term   premium, since we know the convexity characteristics and we know what the longer-term rates are,   were we able to infer part of our analysis from the longer-term elements?  That’s the only thing we   really add     President Fisher     President Minehan     The legislation really is irrelevant  The problem here is that a   set of liabilities is being created by the steepness of the retirement curve, and there is an obvious   requirement to fund that set  But the bill in the Congress is trying to play games with the type of   discount rate that companies can use  The only real discount factor that fund managers can use, if   they seriously believe that what they are promising is to be guaranteed, is to put pension funds in   US Treasuries and to tranch them in a manner that exactly meets the maturity requirements  That   situation, therefore, has nothing to do with what the piece of legislation is and everything to do with   the rate of change of the population over 65   January 31, 2006 15 of 106      In other words, whether that bill passes or not, the pressures   to fund these liabilities are going to increase, especially after the baby-boom generation starts to   retire and fund managers look at the size of it     Vice Chair, would you move to ratify?     I request the Federal Reserve Board to engage in addressing   the requests for changes in the discount rate   [Recess]     The Federal Reserve Board voted unanimously to accept the   discount rate requests of eleven Banks  As to the date of the next meeting, Vincent will send notice     The meeting is adjourned   END OF MEETING   January 31, 2006 78 of 106        Thank you  Would you like to make an economic   presentation, Dave?     In exhibit 6, the average workweek is something of a   puzzlement  I’m curious to get a sense of what is our now retrospective explanation of the sharp fall   in the year 2000-01 and the failure to start back up as the economy picked up  Are we looking at an   age or a demographic mix?   January 31, 2006 25 of 106      So, really, we never had such a drop  The series is just   discontinuous     We know labor force participation changes as people move   into different age brackets  So if we have data of average hours by age, do we have any judgment   as to whether their average workweek hours change as well?     Individuals also may be more affluent so that they have an   ability to actually—     I object to that!  [Laughter]  I mean, there are data by age    Certainly in the household survey we pick up something     I’m just curious  President Santomero   January 31, 2006 26 of 106      Vice Chair     Any further questions for our colleagues?  If not, before we   go to the general discussion, because of the unusual nature of this particular one-day session with   various timing problems, I just calculated that, in the eighteen years I’ve been here, we’ve gone   from an average presentation of three minutes to one of six minutes  [Laughter]  The drift has been   inexorably upward  And I will suggest to you that, unless we are somewhat unusually restrained   today, we’re going to run way over what our luncheon plans are, and we will be forced to call them   dinner  [Laughter]  So may I suggest, if at all possible, that you try to restrain the time that you’re   employing on this particular occasion  With those restrictions, who would like to start off?    [Laughter]     Thank you  President Yellen     Thank you  President Santomero     I should point out that a luncheon in the President’s honor is   planned at the March meeting  And I guess you and I will be looking from the sidelines, but neither   one of us will know what happened at that March meeting until we get to it  [Laughter]  Thank you   for your nice remarks  President Minehan     President Fisher     Thank you very much  And the last time I spoke to Henry V   [laughter] I got a view of his notions of strategy  President Lacker     Thank you very much  President Pianalto     President Guynn     President Hoenig     Let’s break for coffee  Since our time is really quite   restricted, I would request that we come back in seven minutes  [Laughter]   [Coffee break]     David Stockton     Thank you  President Poole     “How to Be a Joyous Central Banker, Even Though We   Don’t Have Hearts”  [Laughter]  Can we end the speculation on the title?  [Laughter]  Thanks very   much, Bill  President Stern     Vice Chair     I am most appreciative  [Laughter]     Governor Olson     Thank you very much, Governor  Governor Ferguson     Thank you  Governor Kohn     Governor Bies     Thank you so much  Vincent     Questions for Vincent?     Anybody else?  Do we have copies of the statement?  Could   you circulate them, please?  I will be rather brief for a number of reasons, not the least of which is I   mostly agree with what has been said around this table and I just don’t want to duplicate it  I do   think that this is an extraordinary economy  If you look at the world data, the balances out there in   Europe and Asia and Japan—remember Japan is the second largest economy in the world, and we   used to forget that because it never moved and hence did not contribute to either expansion or   contraction  But it’s clearly now moved beyond its very serious difficulties and is likely to be a   positive force, as indeed much of Asia and now, more recently, Europe is beginning to be  So the   outlook out there is benevolent, but benevolence is not something that goes on forever   So far I think it’s fairly clear that there’s consensus around the table that we’ll move 25 basis   points today  And I think that there is an awareness that we’re probably not all that far from where   we want to be, considering that our major focus was the removal of accommodation, which we had   purposefully put in place to bring the funds rate down to 1 percent over a protracted period  I think   that, at this particular point, whatever the Federal Reserve does henceforth, it is going to become   increasingly dependent on the data because we’re not in the position in which we had been for quite   a period of time of essentially saying what it is we plan to do and then proceeding to do it  We have   run the string  We have gotten to where we wanted to be, and now the data are going to determine   what largely is going to happen   I don’t think there’s much debate on this particular statement relevant to what the March   actual action is going to be  I suspect that whatever the Committee does in March will depend very   January 31, 2006 70 of 106    marginally on what we say today and very significantly on the whole series of events that have to   work their way through over the next six weeks  And since we’re not very far from where we   would like to be, there’s no real problem here   Therefore, I would venture that we move 25 basis points and that we adopt the language, the   critical part being “further policy firming may be needed”  This language in my judgment is   essentially consistent with the outlook as we can best evaluate it, and I would move, in the context   of what Vincent has been saying, both the statement and the action and would request that our   Secretary read the appropriate language     I’m sorry  I’m trying to cut the discussion short [Laughter]     No, but I’m looking at the clock     Actually I thought it was elegantly done  [Laughter]     Governor Kohn     President Santomero     President Poole     President Fisher     Governor Ferguson     President Hoenig     President Stern     President Minehan     President Pianalto     President Guynn     President Yellen     Governor Bies     President Moskow     Thank you  Governor Olson     President Lacker     I gather correctly there’s been no real interest in reversing the   paragraphs  So I think that we can go forward and, as I said before, you may read—[Laughter]
