  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I was advised to speak of things I know, so all   of my comments will have to do with commercial banks and the traditional banking operations   within those banks  Also, they are limited to the market area that I operated in  I was in a large   community bank  The primary competitors were 2 of the top 5 banks and 4 of the top 20 banks    I hope to expand that on the supervision committee   I guess the major observation I would have is that I can’t see lending growth ever   resuming until the market for financial stocks improves  That market is not going to improve   until it is clear that the credit risk is manageable  I haven’t seen the confidence in banking and   banking institutions this low since we were well into the S&L crisis back in the early 1990s  At   the same time, the credit numbers—or at least the commercial banks’ part of the credit   numbers—don’t look all that bad  At this point, we are sharing those credit losses with a number   of other types of institutions, and I think the banks got the better slice of that pie  So I do believe   that the banks will be able to manage through this   On the equity side of things, you have had equity destroyed through credit losses, and so   those banks are certainly reducing their lending  I don’t think there is enough capital in the   system  I don’t think earnings are strong enough  There is certainly no external capital available   to pick up that slack  So while you hear smaller banks say, “We are getting great business now   because the larger banks have cut back on their lending,” they just don’t have the capacity to take   in that business  No matter why they are trying to raise capital, capital issuance is viewed as a   sign of weakness  It is scarce  It is expensive  The short selling has been just amazing  It has   really driven down the prices  For some of the larger banks, it is running anywhere from 10 to   15 percent of total float  It has even gotten down into banks smaller than $5 billion  I was   looking at one, and the short interest on July 15 was 10 times that of April 15  It was running   August 5, 2008 93 of 145    about 7 percent of float on a very thinly traded stock  I can’t believe that it has anything to do   with the fundamentals of the institution  It is just all being painted with the same brush   For institutions that must raise capital or fail, my concern is that the capital that is being   raised or being offered comes with an exit strategy  I don’t think that the capital is going to have   the patience to wait for a longer-term resumption of lending  Those that do have capital cushions   seem to be spending them on small buybacks or dividend increases in an effort to demonstrate   some confidence in the future   On the liquidity side, central core funding is very tight and incredibly uncertain  CD   rates do remain high, and as one institution after another desperately needs money, they raise the   rates  As one falls out of that situation, somebody else picks it up again  After the full weekend   of IndyMac coverage in the press, the phones just lit up everywhere asking about FDIC   insurance  Now there is a renewed interest in the CDARS program  I didn’t realize that these   deposits are classified as brokered deposits  It will be interesting to see if we have a big jump in   brokered deposits in the next couple of quarters  The Home Loan Banks are tightening their   collateral requirements  They are introducing risk rating systems, so that source of funding is not   as available as it was  Nonconforming mortgages are impossible to place     On the asset side, I talked to several correspondent bankers, and they have been told to   cut their overall fed funds lines sometimes in half  It doesn’t matter who it is, just cut them in   half  A number of the banks are cutting home equity lines across the board and freezing those   lines  The full-relationship lending is prized, but even in that it is only to the extent that lending   is in some ways self funding  Transaction deals are like hot potatoes; nobody wants to touch   them   August 5, 2008 94 of 145    We had some calls from other bankers who were asking what liquidity premium we were   adding to our pricing, so there is clearly a change in the pricing, which may actually improve   profitability  However, I think a lot of it is in order not to turn down the credit but simply to   price out the credit, so that the borrower makes the decision not to borrow rather than the bank   making the decision not to lend   On the credit side, the reserve additions have been incredibly dramatic, but a lot of that is   because reserve levels were so low going into this  Capital was strong, earnings were strong, but   reserve levels were down at 70 or 80 basis points  I had not ever seen them below 1 percent until   two or three years ago  That is because of the change in the accounting for reserves as well as 10   years of no demonstrable losses  Oddly enough, the charge-off and delinquency rates really   don’t look all that bad  When I looked at first-quarter rates, they didn’t look a whole lot different   from what used to be the norm, at least in terms of commercial loans  Then, on the consumer   side, in this case it was mortgage loans versus consumer loans, but still a 75 basis point loss on   consumer loans historically was actually normal   It is really difficult to follow any discussion of what is going on in terms of credit losses   because you get confused between what is mark-to-market loss, what is actual credit loss, what   are charge-offs, what are reserves, and then who owns those losses  I am not quite sure what the   rate of deterioration or the rate of resolution is  In terms of collection, it takes an awful lot of   time to ramp up collection and recovery efforts, and I don’t know where we are in that cycle, but   I think we have a long way to go   The last cycle was all about commercial real estate, and nobody could work up much   sympathy for commercial real estate developers  [Laughter]  In this situation, there is so much   political sensitivity around foreclosures that I think it is going to be much elongated  When a   August 5, 2008 95 of 145    borrower cannot or will not pay and you can’t restructure it to create capacity or willingness to   pay, then some form of forced sale is the only thing that gets you off go  I think that has been   pushed out and pushed out  It is also the only way to clear any junior liens  This process is   expensive and time-consuming, and owning the property is even more expensive  So as the   lender-owned properties become a larger and larger segment of the properties for sale, I do think   price declines are going to accelerate significantly     I will be watching the IndyMac resolution particularly closely  In the last cycle, if you   will remember, the properties that were sold by the RTC brought the biggest discounts of all  So   it will be interesting to see what this theory of holding off on foreclosures and then at some later   point having to move the assets actually does to prices  The good news is that once lenders start   selling, they do tend to move units at whatever price it takes  Lenders are going to have to do   that  There is no justification for wasting precious capital or liquidity on dead assets  But there   is also no justification for selling the portfolios at fire sale prices if the net realizable value of   collecting them is higher, and I think it definitely is for the banks   Finally, if I could take one more minute, I did do some very in-depth personal research on   the housing decisions of a relocating worker  [Laughter]  I purchased a residence in January ’06   for a May ’06 closing and hit the peak  The current value, I am told, is 80 to 85 percent of the   purchase price, marketing time 6 to 12 months  The purchase in the new location—I did do the   calculation—it was 15 to 20 times annual rent, but that didn’t matter  I had already had all the   thrill of ownership that I could stand and will be renting  [Laughter]  The second thing is that, if   I had financed this property at 80 percent, I would have had no equity to roll into a new purchase   anyway, so there would have been no decision involved  The good news is that as long as there   is no need to sell, the price doesn’t matter, and I could have waited it out very easily  So the   August 5, 2008 96 of 145    conclusion that I came to is that this current elevated inventory we have of housing includes only   those who absolutely have to sell because nobody in this market would choose to sell  So once   that begins to turn around, again, there just have to be a whole lot of pent-up houses for sale    Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you  I support alternative B  I don’t think that the “severe financial   stress” scenario is out of the question right now     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I continue to focus on the traditional commercial   bank structure  I looked at two large retail banks, three regional banks, and three community banks,   and two things came out of this  First, capital is driving everything, and the amount of capital that   the banks need is now being driven more by the analysts and the rating agencies than it is anything   that the regulators are doing  The banks feel as though they have done everything they can do in   terms of capital management  They’ve quit buying back stock  They’ve cut their dividends    They’ve reduced expenses  There is no more capital available in external markets—not common   stock, not preferred, not anything  One bank did issue some preferred stock through its own   networks and a common stock issue—interestingly sort of snuck it into the market  They dribbled it   out in small amounts because they found that, as soon as the markets determined that they were   going to need to issue capital, they started to short the stock, figuring they could buy it back  So   they did almost a reverse stock buyback   The markets are fragile to dead  So what are they going to do?  The only thing they can do   is contract the balance sheet and not lend  Before I get to that, there was again discussion in several   of the conversations about naked short selling  One bank reportedly had 103 percent of total   outstandings in short interest, and that seemed odd to me  So I went and checked it this morning,   and it turns out that it was not 103 percent  It was only 93 percent  But if you subtract out the stock   that was owned by the officers and the directors, then it was over 100 percent  Another bank said   that the rules in the disclosure that surround long positions have to be replicated somehow in short   September 16, 2008 67 of 108    positions because they’re having just as much control over what happens in the fate and the   management of the firm    So what are they doing in terms of credit?  Any heavy uses of credit or predominant uses of   credit are just not being done  This eliminates all commercial real estate  They’re actively trying to   move that off their books  Participation loans, in which the participants get only the credit piece, are   drying up  Those aren’t available  No bank has any interest in going back into residential   construction lending  One large bank said they were approving only one-third of the consumer   credit that they would have approved a year ago  The secondary market for jumbos for takeouts on   commercial are nonexistent, and one bank told me that, with the current cost of capital and cost of   funding, the breakeven spread for a loan was 400 basis points over LIBOR  That’s the new lending   market, and I don’t see it getting any better until some capital is available     The credit quality side is actually a better story  First, except for residential real estate, it’s   really still pretty good  C&I lending is holding up extremely well  In commercial real estate, again,   outside of residential development, things are really looking pretty good  Some small retail centers   are showing softness with the small storefronts; and in areas like Michigan, they’re worried about   losing the anchor tenants  Other than that, everything is okay  The other consumer credit feels like   a mild recession but, again, is normally cyclical  Home equity is awful  The bank-originated loans   range from good—one institution had 39,000 loans with 44 past due—to performing similar to   unsecured credit  The broker-originated loans, especially the later vintages, are 100 percent loss    Within the mortgages, the rate of acceleration in new past-dues has slowed down  About rejections,   I asked them to project when the new delinquencies would be offset by the resolution of existing   delinquencies, and they said somewhere between year-end 2008 and mid-2009  So we are moving   through that process  The severity, however, continues to grow as housing prices decline  It does   September 16, 2008 68 of 108    appear that the portfolio lenders are getting their arms around the collection and the loss-mitigation   effort  They’re assigning resources, accountability, and priority  It looks as though they are finally   set up to do a pretty good job on that, managing it on several fronts—the analysis of the issue, the   early stage collection, contact, and loss mitigation—and actually assigning a permitted spend, if you   will, to resolve the loan  Foreclosures are going to take a lot longer and are particularly affected by   state law  Apparently in Florida it takes a year to get a property in foreclosure  So those   foreclosures are going to happen over a fairly long period of time   I asked about a bottom, and they said they do feel as though they’re seeing bottoms in some   markets—Ohio and coastal areas in California, although not inland  Las Vegas and Atlanta are   overbuilding, but the in-migration will absorb it  Florida is a bottomless hole—speculation   combined with insurance problems  In Arizona so much land was available that they can’t find a   bottom there  Regarding lot inventory, a community banker in Omaha said they had seven years of   inventory in terms of lots, which I thought was pretty startling until I read in the American Banker   the same story in Atlanta and the same story in Orlando  So I think when residential development   does resume, it will be to work out the lot inventory  Also, the phantom inventory is at least as large   as the current inventory—phantom inventory being defined as people who want to sell but don’t   want to sell in the current market  Asked to compare current credit metrics with those in the 1980s   and 1990s, one contact said they peaked in 1988 at 58 percent nonperforming  Now they are at   166  I found a chart, and for the entire industry, nonperformers were 4 percent in 1991  They’re   12 percent right now  So the credit metrics are just nowhere near what they were in the S&L crisis   for the industry     I came out of that really believing that, if we are going to do something, we need to address   the availability of capital to commercial banks but we should leave the bad loans in the banks   September 16, 2008 69 of 108    because they’re getting to the point where the portfolio lenders are doing a good job of working   through these loans  To try to take them out and put them into another structure, we would just have   to replicate that whole gearing-up process  I don’t necessarily think that’s the case with the   servicers, particularly the servicers of private-label mortgages  That’s something on which I know   we’ve done some research here, and I want to investigate that a bit more to see if there’s something   to be known there   In terms of the policy, I, too, would favor alternative B with some change in the language to   paragraph 2  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I don’t have an awful lot to add to what has   already been said  I’m not optimistic that this will necessarily increase financial institutions’   confidence in lending to each other, but I think the coordinated action at least will be something that   maybe helps to give some confidence in the certainty of future actions  I think a lot of it has been   the unpredictability of what government is going to do  So that may help on that score, and I   support the action   October 7, 2008 28 of 30      I’m in favor    Mr Chairman, if I could    As part of my preparation when I talked to the banks, I asked them specifically   this question about interest on reserves, and every single one of them said, “We haven’t had time to   even focus on it  We don’t even know what’s going on with that  We’re not changing anything”    There’s so much going on right now  So I think we’re really going to have to wait until some of the   other decisionmaking has worked through before we can draw any conclusions as to what behavior   this might drive    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I focused on the “more rapid financial   recovery” scenario, not so much because I thought it was the most likely but just trying to think   what it would take to bring that about  I’m not sure that the policy changes we have done   recently will do that, but I am fairly certain that we are going to keep at it until we find   something that restores confidence   I was shocked when I was looking at the Bluebook at how short a time has passed since   the meltdown of all these major financial institutions—Fannie, Freddie, Lehman, AIG, WaMu,   and Wachovia  There is a sense among those who were affected, who lost from it, that they just   really didn’t see it coming, at least not at this speed, and that all of them had adequate regulatory   capital, and the bankers at least were used to watching a sort of gradual burndown of that capital   October 28–29, 2008 107 of 206    before institutions failed  They had a sense of being unable to predict who was going to be   saved, who was going to get whacked, and who would be the winners and the losers  So   subsequently both the banks and their customers froze, and there has been very little activity   since then  All the banks I talked to reported having stopped doing business with one or more   counterparties and that one or more counterparties had stopped doing business with them, and   they were shocked by both of those things   So, first and foremost, it is clear that we need to restore confidence and predictability  In   this sense, the recent moves to increase deposit insurance, to guarantee interbank short-term debt,   and to provide capital on the same terms to banks of all sizes should be helpful—but only as long   as we can do this without creating new uncertainty about who is going to benefit and who is not    Without being too subjective or too cute, we need at this point just to create confidence in our   entire system  The demonstrable and preemptive support of the nine largest financial   institutions; our public support of AIG; similar support of globally important banks by their   home countries; and the resolution of Wachovia and National City, the two largest troubled   institutions, without loss should help us avoid shocking surprises while everybody calms down     In this light, my conversation with the banks centered mostly on their reactions to the   recent policy changes  All thought the deposit insurance increase was helpful  They varied in   their estimates of the importance of the increase to $250,000, with a lot of them pointing out that   for consumers they had already really restructured deposits to insure fairly large amounts, and   several were using the CDARS (Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service) program for   larger depositors  They were even more enthusiastic about the coverage of transaction accounts,   although one banker felt as though this coverage really hadn’t gotten as much visibility as it   should, particularly with corporate treasurers, and many had already seen corporate and   October 28–29, 2008 108 of 206    institutional deposits move into Treasuries and felt as though it was going to be difficult to get   those back  There was even much more confusion about the guarantee of short-term debt  One   banker questioned how they would know whether the fed funds sold to another bank actually fell   inside the 125 percent cap  Another one thought that the all-or-nothing structure of the guarantee   was a little difficult to work with  Interestingly, and as I pointed out yesterday when I asked   about interest on reserves, nobody had even focused on it  They had bigger fish to fry  So I   wouldn’t read anything into those early results   As for capital injections, most were taking a hard look at it  Two large community banks   had just issued private capital to support growth that had been attracted from competitors, but   they thought that they could profitably deploy the new capital  Other banks were interested in   having the capital just in case they had the opportunity to buy weaker competitors, particularly   deposits or branches in problem resolutions  None was really concerned about the announced   restrictions, but a number of them were somewhat suspicious of the possible restrictions that   might come later  Some small banks with already high levels of capital somehow felt pressured   to apply anyway just to show that they would qualify, although they didn’t think it would give   them much growth  In all cases, capital is only part of the story  They also need reliable funding   if they are going to expand lending  This will have to come either from reliable deposit growth   or from the reopening of secondary markets because all of them were reluctant to increase   borrowing from any source  The loan-to-deposit ratio is growing new fans  In terms of lending,   all reported that they were still lending to their relationship customers, and they were cutting   back on credit to credit-only customers  As one defined it, if 90 percent of the revenue is coming   from credit, then that was a customer relationship they wanted to exit   October 28–29, 2008 109 of 206    They still report no significant deterioration in the C&I book  I asked about drawdowns   from companies, and across the board they said they had seen it in a couple of instances but   really they had not seen an awful lot of that, so that might be some posturing rather than actual   drawdowns on the credit  They are, however, exercising strong pricing discipline, and the   pricing decisions, more than credit decisions, are being escalated up the approval chain, actively   outreaching to customers that they want to keep and assuring them of credit availability  But   because they have no pricing power on the funding side and pricing became very skinny on loans   in recent years, there is a high level of sticker shock going on, which might explain some of the   complaints about unreasonable terms  They also report very high levels of caution from their   customers, with the descriptions ranging from “hunkering down” to “wait and see”  There were   more anecdotal reports of companies riding trade credit by trying to accelerate receivables or   extend payables  Now, whether this is due to the actual or to the perceived unavailability of   credit from banks is not yet clear   Real pressure is on commercial real estate lending  They are very selective in new   projects  They are processing renewals for only one year, using the opportunity to shore up   pricing and underwriting, and no longer writing mini-perms  Nobody is doing those  So far, the   performance is holding up on commercial properties, with strong performance on apartments and   weakness showing up in retail  Residential construction and land development continues to be a   problem  In visiting the San Francisco and the Kansas City Banks, I was shocked to hear the   same story from large builders about land sales  One builder had a 300-acre parcel with a cost of   $75,000 an acre, listed it for $15,000 an acre, and sold it for $10,700  Another reported a   property with a cost basis of $120 million selling for $12 million  Apparently, the impetus for   both of these transactions was a judgment that the cash received from tax refunds was more   October 28–29, 2008 110 of 206    advantageous than holding out for better pricing  So the outlook for lending in residential   construction or commercial real estate is dim far into the future, and I would say the same thing   for syndicated or participated lending  However, to the extent that banks can exit those   segments, it should free up funds for normal lending for businesses and consumers  Thank you,   Mr Chairman    Actually, I have heard a couple of reports that, when we did that last   50 basis point cut, banks did not lower their prime  A lot of banks still have prime-related   credits  As we lower the rates, whether it makes a difference on anything else, it affects the   prime, and there are still an awful lot of 5 percent CDs out there  So as we lower rates, we are   cutting into those margins, and it is likely to turn some of them negative    Well, I don’t know  But just as soon as they get them switched over there,   maybe we’ll be successful at bringing LIBOR down     Thank you  I confess I find myself torn between the position of President   Plosser and the equally compelling arguments of Governor Kohn, and that makes alternative B quite   attractive as a way, not because of any optimism about the economic outcome, but I really do   question the effectiveness of any move in the fed funds target given the actual trading of the fed   funds rate right now  When we set the interest rate on reserves, at that point I was concerned that   our interest on reserves would disrupt the market for fed funds between banks because of the risk   premium  With the FDIC insurance, I think that goes away, and so probably President Lacker’s   suggestion deserves some strong consideration  I am also painfully aware of the operational and   October 28–29, 2008 143 of 206    financial difficulties that banks experience at a 1 percent fed funds rate and the likely difficulties of   other intermediaries as the absolute level of rates falls further   As I stated in my earlier remarks, I’m also most concerned about the importance of   predictability in returning confidence to the markets, and in that light, I am concerned about market   expectations  But having recently been an expecter rather than a decider, I’m going to suggest that   most of those doing the expecting don’t understand at all the issues that we’ve discussed here today    There’s a thought that, if the fed funds rate just comes down, it would maybe make this pain go   away  So I agree with Governor Warsh that the public statements in the intermeeting period and as   we approach the point where we simply can’t meet market expectations anymore are critically   important to shape market expectations  So I do think it’s important that the markets focus on the   other efforts, and with that I would support alternative A     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’d like to make it unanimous in thanking the staff    For me, particularly, you have extended the process by which every hour that I’ve been here has   been deeply educational and have helped put the things I’ve been doing since I got here in some sort   of a context  Along those lines, the one thing I thought I might address is the economics of the   world from whence I came—and that is the economics that bank managers are facing today—  because I think that’s an important part of this discussion  I’m sure most of you have heard from   December 15–16, 2008 95 of 284    bankers really pleading not to lower the rates, and there’s a very good reason for that  I actually   expanded the number of banks that I normally talk to—in addition to Federal Advisory Committee,   the North Carolina bankers and some of the Texas bankers—and the plea was unanimous  Please   don’t lower the rates  The reason for that really goes to the prime rate, not the fed funds rate  If the   prime rate moves down, I do believe that dollar for dollar it’s going to reduce bank profitability  If   we were to go to zero, if prime were to go to 3 percent, I think it would take our entire banking   system on an operating basis to an unprofitable level   To give you an idea, the non-interest operating costs of banks have not changed an awful lot   over the last seven or eight years  They fluctuate about 5 basis points, but it’s a little over 3 percent   of assets in non-interest operating costs  The non-interest income that offsets that may be 60 basis   points  So you are looking at a 240 basis point hurdle that margins have to get over  The interest   yields right now are 40 basis points lower than they were in 2002, going into the 1 percent fed funds   rate  Credit costs are certainly higher  They’re higher by 10 to 18 basis points  Fee income is lower   by 10 to 16 basis points  If you put all of that together, profitability is already lower by 60 to 75   basis points  On a marginal basis, deposit competition is fierce  CD rates are in the 3½ to 4½   percent range  Money market accounts are around 3 percent  New entrants into the insured deposit   arena are intensifying this competition still further, and the banks are incredibly bitter about   nonbanks coming into that arena  Lower-cost funding is available from some nondeposit sources,   but the banks are feeling pressure from their examiners to limit usage of noncore funds, including   discount window borrowings  A bank issued the FDIC-guaranteed debt last week, three years at a   cost of 2 percent plus the 100 basis points that they pay the FDIC  So that cost is 3 percent  All of   these costs are in excess of the prime rate   December 15–16, 2008 96 of 284    On the asset side, the banks are shying away from purchases of securities because of mark-  to-market concerns  The new loans that are being booked are being tied to prime, but they’re tied to   prime with floors, with those floors generally in the 5 to 5½ percent range  Some existing loans   have floors, although many do not  Home equity loans, credit card loans, and smaller bank   commercial loans are typically tied to prime  Prime might reference that bank’s own prime—and   some banks did not lower their prime or were slower to lower their prime the last time we changed   the fed funds target—but more commonly it will reference New York or Wall Street prime  Larger   loans and mortgages are more likely to be tied to LIBOR, although I understand that competition in   recent years has moved toward contracts that give the borrower the option at any time of using a   prime-based rate or a LIBOR-based rate   With pressure on both sides of the interest margin, credit costs are sure to rise, and with the   prospects for fee income down, the banks are uniformly begging for no change  When asked how   they might manage with lower rates, most said that the only choice they would have at this point   would be to shrink their balance sheets rather than compete for business at a negative spread   The other rates that affect bank profitability have not moved with the fed funds rate, and so   in this case it is about spreads, not rates  Now, it’s certainly possible that individual banks are   exaggerating the effects that lower rates will have on their institutions and that their reactions will   not be as strong as they claim  However, my question is, What if they are right?  If we get down to   a 25 basis point regime and we find out that it simply puts our banking system out of business, how   do we then reverse that and move back up, and how do we explain that change?   I’m not as familiar with the economics of money market funds, but I have to assume that   their pressures are similar, and the note indicates that they might be willing to operate at a loss for a   time  But the more we communicate that this would be an extended amount of time, how long   December 15–16, 2008 97 of 284    would they be willing to operate at a loss?  No matter where we set our fed funds target, there’s   really very little that we can do differently, as in starting tomorrow  The current actual rate reflects   a broken market  There are much lower volumes in the fed funds market right now, and a much   higher percentage of those are with institutions that can’t earn interest on reserves     So, Bill, I still see some hope for the fed funds market coming back  Over time, as banks   get more comfortable with each other, the opportunities to get a little higher yield as well as to open   up an unsecured borrowing source will lead banks back into the fed funds market  But if that   market did start to revive a bit, I would hate for us to be in a regime in which, at that point, we had   to pressure it again to bring the rates back down  For this reason I think suspending the fed funds   target as a  policy tool rather than lowering it might be the safer course because it would let prime   find its own level and the banks might not necessarily feel pushed to lower prime if we did not   change our target   I had a number of notes on communication, most of which have been said  But the one   point I’d like to make is that, when I think of communication, I think of it on a retail level  I think   about our communication to consumers and to business owners rather than to the more sophisticated   audiences that the notes tend to refer to  I think we have to be sure that we do communicate on a   retail level—that we communicate on the nightly news, local newspaper level  Many of you have   backgrounds in education, and I think at this point it’s our job to teach and explain what we’re doing   and how it might affect individual consumers and individual businesses  In that sense, it’s   important that we stay on message and that we have very clear terminology that we use over and   over again  Even in the conversation today, the term “quantitative easing” was used differently by   different speakers   December 15–16, 2008 98 of 284    I do think we have to be careful, again, on the fed funds rate target  I noticed the same thing   that President Fisher did as far as the Chairman’s December 1 speech  Any time we talk about the   fed funds rate, it is the only thing that’s going to be reported  Finally, I also think we have to be   careful about references to the experience in Japan  We should emphasize the differences and the   reasons that we expect to be successful because, in many places, references to the experience in   Japan lead people to believe that we’re in for a very, very dismal future, and I don’t think that’s   what we want to communicate  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Yesterday I talked about the income statement   of the banks  I would like to talk a bit about the balance sheets now  Up to this point, for the   small and medium-sized community banks, it has been pretty much business as usual  But now   even those banks are finding it increasingly difficult to lend  Community banks and regional   banks are trying, but it is tough  Funding is tight and expensive  It costs 3½ percent to keep a   CD and 4 percent and up to attract one  The smaller banks are especially bitter about pricing   against Citi and those nonbanks that have recently converted to bank holding company and thrift   holding company charters   For a bank to qualify for TARP funding, the examiners are raising the bar on noncore   funding  One bank reported a meeting with both the OCC and the Fed in which the OCC   criticized, and the Fed defended, the bank’s use of the discount window  Examiners are raising   the bar on capital  12 is the new 10 on risk-based capital  Borrowers are not in nearly as good   shape as they were  The best credits are choosing not to borrow, and they are adjusting their   plans so that they get through on their own cash flow  So the requests coming into the banks are   more and more likely to be desperation requests—loans to cover operating losses or to meet   payroll  Cracks are appearing in C&I loans  Some banks are exiting loans to entire industries,   especially auto dealers, marine and construction trades, and retail  The performance of   commercial real estate, especially retail properties, is deteriorating  Hospitality is falling off   rapidly, and office buildings are expected to be next  Apartments are still okay, and all of this is   December 15–16, 2008 155 of 284    in addition to problems with construction loans  Lower mortgage rates are helping refinance, but   it is not the best time of the year to judge what it is going to happen with purchase activity    There are still issues with jumbos, with down payments, and with requirements for very high   credit scores   As we have talked here, it occurs to me that perhaps the traditional tools of monetary   policy are all directed at bank credit, and the strongest nontraditional tools that we have are   addressed more to the securitization markets—the TALF and the purchase of GSEs  In this   instance, most of the problems are not really caused by a cutback in bank lending but a complete   collapse of the securitization markets, and so that is why these tools may be more necessary   I asked questions also about the TARP capital and got different reactions  Several   bankers said that they didn’t need it, they were scared off by the ability of the Congress to   change the terms at any time, and they had elected not to take it  Some took it because they   thought they could leverage it into good business  Some took it as cheap insurance  Some took   it to be in a position to acquire in what they see as the necessary weeding out of weaker players,   and they think that should happen sooner rather than later  Several complained about delays in   providing terms for smaller banks  Every single bank was adamant about the evils of mark-to-  market accounting and other-than-temporary impairment  There is a big diversion between   market losses and credit losses, so that leads to bankers who are afraid to buy securities because   they are worried about further marks as the markets go down  But they are also unwilling to sell   securities because they don’t believe that the current market price adequately reflects the   potential credit losses  There is some speculation that the mark-to-market losses will absorb all   of the TARP capital that was just injected, and I think that is something we might want to   December 15–16, 2008 156 of 284    calculate as fourth-quarter reports come out  Then, the next big writedown is on servicing   portfolios as lower rates spur refinancing activities  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Mr Chairman, just one response to President Lacker’s and President   Plosser’s observations, which I think are related  If you set the rate that we are going to pay for   interest on reserves the same as the target rate for fed funds and the market does repair itself and   resume, then you would expect there to be some risk spread over the rate that we are paying on   interest on reserves  So if we don’t set a target or we set the target something higher than the   rate that we are paying, at least if the markets do start to resume, then the Desk isn’t in a position   of then having to try to drive the rate back down again    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I do favor alternative A  In terms of what will   happen with the prime rate, I frankly don’t know, but I think it will leave the banks to determine   their own prime rate and floors as they wish  I would not minimize the fact that we are actually still   setting a rate for the interest on excess reserves as well as the discount rate  This experience with   interest on reserves is brand new for us, and I don’t think we’ve had enough experience to know   how it is actually going to work  It does leave room for the spread to establish itself as the fed funds   market regenerates, and I think it gives us some room to have some experience with that regime  I   think this communicates the regime change better than any of the other alternatives, and at the end   of the day, this is a communication document  I would strongly echo President Pianalto’s   comments that, in this new regime, we really need to stay on the same page to avoid total confusion   in the marketplace  I know that independence of thought is one of the strengths of this body, but if   we could for a time set that aside at least in public and all speak from the same talking points, it   would make all of our policies more effective   In terms of the specifics of the statement, I would defer to another day the language in   brackets in paragraph 2 of alternative A  The conditional language I would keep in  About the   phrase “to continue” and really all of paragraph 4, to my mind, although we are continuing some of   the things that the Board has done, it has not necessarily been clear that all of these have been   considered by the FOMC  To me this takes everything we are doing and puts it in the middle of this   table and gives us time to discuss which of them we like, what we might use or not use, and how we   December 15–16, 2008 203 of 284    might express the degree to which we would use all of these tools  We’ve made a lot of progress in   a very short time in coming to the broad outlines of the things that we might do going forward, and   in coming meetings we’ll actually contour those more and make them more specific  I would   include that as well  As to whether or not we “use” our balance sheet or “expand” our balance   sheet, I would leave it at this point as “use our balance sheet” and have further discussion on that    Thank you, Mr Chairman    Would that say “the Committee”?    Would that say the “Committee will” or “the Federal Reserve will”?  Perhaps   “the Committee will continue to consider ways to use the Federal Reserve balance sheet”    I’d like to ask one question just, again, about going forward  We talked about   what you would do differently tomorrow under alternatives A and B and determined that it was   nothing  What would you do going forward if federal funds started to trade above 25 basis points   under alternative B?    But you would be able to pull it back down    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Let me say, first, that I have not been thinking   about or discussing these topics since 1995  [Laughter]  Nevertheless, before I got here I could have                        January 16, 2009 53 of 69  guessed pretty accurately what the intention of the Committee was and what the targets of the   Committee were From that standpoint, I am not sure that articulating a specific objective is going   to do much more to inform the general public as to how this Committee might act  After hearing   the discussion, I could, frankly, support in normal times almost any consensus opinion as to what   that target should be—how it should be expressed, whether it should be a point or a range, and what   measure should be used  However, these are not normal times, and all of the discussion assumes   communication and credibility   On the communication front, I never thought I would see a time when it was almost   impossible to articulate the role of capital in the financial system or even the role of the financial   system in our overall economy  So I think this makes it a very difficult time to try to inform the   public about something like an inflation target  The second piece would be credibility  First of all,   we are in a situation with a fairly high level of uncertainty and a low level of confidence in our   forecasts, and we are responding to those forecasts with untested tools  So I think it is really   difficult to be precise in what we think the outcomes are going to be  Second, we have already   strained our credibility a bit in our inability to meet the fed funds target for a period of time, and   then we moved the target down to where the actuality was  So I think that those two would make it   very difficult right now  Finally, in the political environment, my concern is that, in our efforts to   support the markets and individual firms, we are running very close to the political independence   line Any political capital that we use in that sense is political capital that we need, and I do not   think this is a time to use up a lot of political energy on the subject of inflation targeting  Thank   you   Mr Chairman, as we have a number of different programs, all of which have   different life cycles, I wonder if we might look at managing our balance sheet in the same way our   financial institutions do  That would be that we would communicate in terms of expectations and in   terms of a strategy so that we would have a starting point, which would be wherever our balance   sheet was at our meeting  Then we might also adopt or at least discuss an expectation as to where   that balance sheet is headed in the different subcategories  For instance, in a bank you tend to talk   of increasing or decreasing the loan portfolio at various levels  In some of the programs, it might be   an expectation of demand, and in others, it might be a specific decision as to supply  But rather than   discussing each proposal separately, we might actually take a look at the full balance sheet, if you   will, and say in an intermeeting period that we would expect our balance sheet to move in this   direction in terms of components   And longer horizons as well  But it would give some indication as to what we   thought was going on with each type of program and the conditions that surrounded it    I will speak for myself  When bankers talk about credit terms, that is   typically going to be something like the credit score, the debt-to-income ratio, or some metric of   underwriting with the most obvious example being GMAC’s announcement right after becoming   a bank holding company that they were going to reduce their minimum credit score from   somewhere in the low 700s to somewhere in the mid-600s, which would obviously mean that   they would approve a larger number of applications  Sometimes a change in terms is done to   reduce the number of accounts or the volume; sometimes it’s done to increase the quality   A couple of things are going on Right now you have the same consumers’ credit metrics   deteriorating very rapidly So even if you did not change the metrics you were using, you would   still approve a much smaller proportion of the applications  So that is going on  The other thing   I will be interested to see the next time we do this survey is that the banks are feeling a   tremendous amount of political pressure on their lending  I am not sure that they want to report   that they have tightened their terms for consumer lending or even particularly that they are going   to change those terms  So I think we might see some pretty drastic reports of at least not   tightening terms on consumer lending in the next survey    Thank you, Mr Chairman  In looking at the banks and talking to the   bankers, I started with the fourth-quarter earnings announcements  The first part is what they   consider to be real, which is the higher loan-loss provisions  In this, unemployment has led to an   acceleration in delinquencies that goes across all consumer products  The reduced activity in the   cash flow of businesses has resulted in higher C&I delinquencies   Vacancy rates and the lack of takeout financing are creating problems in commercial real   estate, but I am still not sure that is as big a problem as maybe it looks, certainly not as much as   in residential, with the ability to renegotiate those loans and to continue the cash flow on them   being better than it has been in residential  Appraisals took another leg down, which has   heightened loss severities When you combine that with lengthening real estate marketing times,   particularly for home equity loans, there is less willingness to buy through the first mortgage,   and so the junior liens are becoming total loss rather than partial recoveries  I would point out   that the same pessimism about future conditions that drives the reserving also drives the   underwriting conditions for future loans, and that is why they are continuing to tighten   Not so real in terms of the numbers that showed up in the fourth-quarter loss are the   model losses and goodwill impairment in other than temporary impairment, particularly on trust   preferred securities; there is something just deep in the DNA of bankers that they do not believe    They are used to marks on credit, and they believe in marks on credit, but they do not believe in   the marks based on market conditions  So if you look at these securities, if they were accounted     January 27–28, 2009 158 of 267  for as a troubled debt, they would be written down to 90  If they are accounted for under market   conditions, they are written down to somewhere between 30 and 50  In the minds of the bankers,   this is a portion of their capital that will return when ultimately their projections of future cash   flows are proved to be correct, if they can live that long   The loan charge-offs would be tax deductible, but the security write-downs are not tax   deductible So when asking them about whether or not they would sell these securities at their   current marks, only those who thought they might get some tax advantage would be willing to   sell them at the current marks  In terms of goodwill and these write-downs, I really had not   focused on how the goodwill-impairment process works  It is a two-step process, and it appears   that now, if the current fair value of an acquisition does not equal the goodwill amount—which   means that the market conditions for bank equities are causing the goodwill to be written   down—they are not really concerned about analysts because the analysts are, as we all know,   focusing on tangible capital But they are concerned about the headline risk as their customers   and potential customers read about huge losses in the institutions  Finally, mortgage-servicing   rights—the one negative consequence of lower rates is that the expected refinance then reduces   the value of mortgage-servicing rights   A number of you have mentioned the TARP money  In this case, there were several who   were approved for capital but elected not to take it, much to the annoyance of the Treasury    Their reasons were that their capital levels were high or adequate already  They could not see   the loan demand in the future and were concerned about additional conditions that might be   imposed by the Congress  Many of these had time to actually see the introduction of the Frank   bill before they had to make a final decision, and that definitely informed the decision  Their   concerns are what you would expect—that lending quotas would be imposed and that would              January 27–28, 2009 159 of 267  actually increase their risk; that the dividend restrictions would make it more difficult for them   ultimately to raise private equity; and that compensation restrictions would affect what they view   as strategically important incentive plans  So I do not think that any of them would be   particularly inclined to take another voluntary program   With the smaller banks, the mutual and the subchapter S banks just saw a posting of the   terms for them for CPP  This process is taking a lot longer to work through all the different parts   of the system than we might have realized  Some have been approved but haven’t yet received   their money  Even on the TLGP, the FDIC temporary liquidity guarantee program, many of   them are reporting that they are getting slow to no response from FDIC  They were planning to   use these guarantees for lines from upstream correspondents, and they are just not getting any   answer In terms of liquidity, all the banks are seeing good deposit growth  However, some of   this growth has to be viewed as temporary, given that there is a year-end expiration of the   unlimited demand deposit insurance  In normal times, you have a parking of risk-averse assets   in bank deposits, and those can move out just as quickly as they came in  Some are still   concerned about additional funding, as well as the examiner expectations or the FDIC additional   charges based on expanding nondeposit sources, such as Home Loan Bank advances or brokered   funds Some are holding large amounts of excess reserves as an actual or perceived cushion   against funding sources pulling away, as well as a demonstration of both liquidity and capital   strength   In lending, most of them do report weak loan demand, and those that are reporting   stronger loan demand seem to be in markets in which the larger players are pulling back or are   involved in mergers  Those that are seeing loan growth don’t initially even see the income boost   from that as they have to establish initial reserves on the net growth  To counteract the angry     January 27–28, 2009 160 of 267  political climate, banks are actively highlighting in their press releases all of their new loan   fundings, even the gross fundings  Advertising for consumer and small business loans has   improved application volume, but the quality is low, which leads to lower approval rates on all   types of credit In terms of construction lending, the projects that aren’t in trouble are simply   finishing out the current phase and stopping, and this applies even vertically  One banker   reported a high-rise condo project that the builder just capped off at ten stories and decided that   was the end of the project There is a bit of lending to take over distressed projects of others    There is significant deterioration in the creditworthiness of businesses and consumers, with at   least one banker expressing concern about the predictive capability and the stability of credit   scores in the current environment  Businesses that are being affected by rapidly changing asset   prices go from positive earnings through the third quarter to chapter 11 by the end of the fourth   quarter   All new loans are priced to higher spreads with floors in them  The range that I heard is   4 to 6 percent So as we look at what is happening to prime, I don’t think that is necessarily what   is happening to rates at which anyone is actually borrowing  The big exception to weak demand   is in mortgage applications, which are at record levels  There aren’t as many competitors out   there, and as with other credit types, the approval rates are lower  Appraisals may be a problem,   and it is mostly refinance, but there is a trickle of purchase activity  They tend to believe that the   purchase activity is currently being deterred by a fear of job loss and expectations for more   government incentives down the road  The rate drop also came at a seasonally low time for   purchasers Then the last piece is the need to sell an existing home, and they may be upside   down in the existing mortgage  There are reports of contracts sometimes five deep, of the                    January 27–28, 2009 161 of 267  contract waiting for sale of an existing home that is waiting for sale that is waiting for sale  So if   at some point the first sale can occur, it will actually multiply itself in many cases   Finally, banks are actually getting quite creative in growing or strengthening their loan   portfolios There is a network of banks in Nebraska that are actually co-underwriting as well as   participating in larger credits  There was a bank that had offered a 7-year or 10-year fully   amortizing mortgage, trying to take advantage of the new propensity to save, and actually has   seen great take-up on it from borrowers who want to use the lower rates to pay off their   mortgages sooner rather than to lower their payments  Another one is using the sales force to go   out and offer proactively to restructure business and commercial real estate loans, say, for twelve   to twenty-four months of interest only to improve the cash flow and at the same time increase the   rate on the loan Another bank is using half of its production teams to go out and sell problem   assets to private-market investors who are in their market and familiar with the projects   The bottom line—the community and regional banks are finding ways to survive; in fact,   three of the banks had record years on the upside for 2008  But it is really ugly out there  So   while there are some signs of recovery in markets, they are outside the banking system  I think   that it is going to be incredibly difficult to stimulate the economy through the programs that   involve bank lending It is going to take more-direct programs, such as mortgage-backed   security purchases or the TALF to act as stand-ins for the securitization markets  In fact, I   believe this is the time to expand the range of mortgages that are eligible for GSE guarantees to   include jumbo and higher loan-to-value mortgages as a way to replace the currently closed   private-label markets  Even if the government takes the problem loans off bank balance sheets,   we will still ultimately need to liquidate much of the underlying collateral, and that is going to   require more lending than the banks can currently fund  We could also find ourselves at some           January 27–28, 2009 162 of 267  point using the discount window in more and more of a Home Loan Bank way for core funding   rather than as a lender of last resort to fund the nonmortgage lending   I know that all of these suggestions go against the grain of almost everyone here, but   frankly, capital alone just will not restart bank lending  I think the banks are going to pull back,   repair as best they can, and create the earnings to rebuild their own capital until they can begin to   attract private equity  President Bullard yesterday used a phrase  He said that people do the best   they can given the constraints they face, and that is how I would title my remarks  Thank you,   Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I think I am marginally favoring A with B4 or   B with A2 and 3 [Laughter]    Marginally I could be perfectly happy with B  I think the difference is that   it is not so much that we don’t know yet that we are going to have to do something more  It is   that we don’t know yet what that something more is likely to be  The uncertainties that are in my   mind and those that have been expressed are likely to be resolved by the time of our next   meeting, such as the shape and the effect of the fiscal stimulus; the strategy for dealing with   weaknesses in the banking system, including whether it is going to be additional capital   injections, an aggregator bank, or nationalization; the pace of bank closures; and the strategy for   dealing with distressed mortgages and foreclosures and, more important, our role in whatever   that strategy is likely to be  If our balance sheet is not required to take problem assets from the   bank balance sheets, it may very well be required to provide loans for the subsequent purchases   of either those assets or the underlying collateral  Finally, with respect to commercial real estate,   I think that we still need to investigate the structure of the commercial MBS and their   relationship with servicers to see if we are going to have the same modification issues that we   have had with residential mortgages  So with all of those unknowns that are likely to be resolved   in the short term, again, I am marginally happier with conveying the rationale for greater action   but not yet identifying that action Thank you     Mr Chairman, let me make sure I understand on the TALF  Is this going to   be contingent on the ability to sterilize the expansion of the TALF?    Okay, and then a second question  I worry that this announcement might   have actually the opposite effect on the banks Do we have any contingency plan if this doesn’t        February 7, 2009 28 of 65  go well and there start being runs on uninsured liabilities at the banks?  Do we have any   contingency plan for what we’ll do then?    I can foresee a circumstance where this is interpreted as a change in the   regulatory requirements for capital, a judgment that the values in the bank’s equity are not there,   a judgment that there is a plan to go in and close large numbers of banks, and I can see it being a   particular vulnerability for those that are large but not as large—for instance, anything smaller   than WaMu  And I can see those banks having a very violent reaction or their counterparties              February 7, 2009 29 of 65  having a violent reaction, something that would force us into action in a large number of good-  sized banks I just think we ought to think about what we would do in that case    We might think it’s four of them, but the markets might think it’s a lot more   than four of them  That would be one concern here  The second concern I would have is that   given the experience with the TARP capital and in many cases the buyer’s remorse of having   taken that capital, I can see a scenario where the banks would immediately start to dump assets   and sell business lines in order to fortress up their liquidity as well as create additional capital in   ways that don’t involve the government And I think those outcomes would be very different   than what we expect to happen or what we would like to have happen here    Yes The experience of the messaging in the last round is not encouraging           February 7, 2009 30 of 65   One other follow-up on the scrubbing process  I think there’s a risk that   this gets interpreted as an admission of regulatory failure, as if we have not already supervised   them adequately and have let them report assets at the wrong values  That further erodes the   credibility of both the supervisors as well as the financials of banks that are doing fine  And I   would worry that we would get caught up in a conversation about whether or not the supervisory   process had done its job, rather than being able to convey the message that we’re looking at a   more stressed scenario than would be required by regular accounting   President Pianalto is assuming that this means that the others will do the job   as well as we did  You may have all of the supervisory agencies thinking that this means that   everybody else will do things as well as they did and the general public thinking that nobody had   done the job properly before this                   February 7, 2009 35 of 65   The capital that we normally want them to hold is private capital  Now we   not only want them to hold that, but we want them to hold ours, because ours is the only capital   that they can get     I would just challenge the assumption that the equity prices don’t matter,   because when the vast majority of the public sees those stock prices going down, particularly to   the very low levels that they’ve reached recently, that triggers some concern about the institution                    February 7, 2009 43 of 65  They don’t have anything else to look at—the only thing they can see is what’s happening to the   stock prices, and that’s how they judge    Yes, Mr Chairman  We talk about the analysis that we’ve done in terms of   the TALF, and we’re really establishing the capital that we think we need to hold on these assets,   and it’s presumably based on a loss estimate—not on any estimate of potential market value loss,   but of credit loss   The first question is Are those being done on a stress scenario in the same way that we   would apply it to the bank capital needs?  And my second question is  From an actual and a   communication standpoint, when we go in to scrub the banks, might we be looking to scrub the   banks particularly from a credit loss standpoint, not necessarily from a market loss standpoint?   Based on an estimate of their credit losses, some assets may actually be, in this analysis, worth   more than they’re marked on the balance sheet today, and others would be worth less  Or are we   planning to go in there and focus on the worst of both possible worlds, both market value losses   as well as credit losses?    Sentence?  [Laughter]            February 7, 2009 65 of 65    Now I’m the one standing in the way of dinner  I just want to talk a bit   about expansion of the TALF and then also about asset purchases  In terms of expanding the   TALF, my concern is about some of the asset classes, for instance, commercial-mortgage-backed   securities I don’t know a lot about how those are put together, but I do know a lot about   commercial mortgages, and they’re much closer to business loans than they are to real estate   loans They’re entirely dependent on cash flows of different types of businesses  So if we get   into those kinds of purchases and we start to determine the haircuts, we’re going to be looking at   credit allocation, because we’re going to be looking at differences in conditions in different   industries and the real estate that supports those industries   The second thing is that I don’t think you can make a bad asset into a good one by taking   a larger haircut If we’re going to be taking assets not from banks, but from anybody who wants   to disgorge them, then what would keep us from simply moving assets from one hedge fund to   another? And I really get concerned that the Fed ends up getting stuck trying to digest every   hairball that’s out there in the marketplace  [Laughter]  That’s a technical term, “hairball”   I also worry that when we originally talked about expanding the TALF up to $1 trillion, it   was with the understanding that that was conditional upon our getting the ability to issue either   Fed bills or the supplemental Treasury securities  That has gotten lost in the discussion of it, and   I worry that with a quick announcement on this other facility, the notion would again get lost,   namely, that it’s dependent upon other things happening   Finally, I don’t see this as a good bank–bad bank situation, and I worry whether we’d   have enough left to deal with emergencies if they came up  I’ll talk more about this tomorrow,   but the more I keep going around and around considering all the things we’re trying to do to fix   the banking system—while I think it’s important—I’m not nearly as confident as everyone else        March 17–18, 2009 110 of 266  that it’s something that we can do So I keep coming back to thinking that the only thing we can   do is to put a floor under house prices  If we could put a floor under house prices, that would   also put a floor under bank losses, and I think it’s our best chance to get moving in the right   direction   Before I move to asset purchases, I’d like to start with the story of an elderly wealthy   gentleman who had taken a young bride and begun to spend money like crazy  His friends got   very concerned that he was going to go through his entire fortune, and they elected one of their   number to go and talk to him about it  He said, “Sam, we’re really concerned  We want to make   sure that you know that you can’t buy love” Sam said, “I know you can’t buy love, but if you   spend enough money, you can buy something that looks so close you can hardly tell the   difference” [Laughter] So I think if we spent enough money, got enough of a hit right now, it   would look like a floor on house prices, and we might have something every bit as good as a   floor on house prices It seems like the best time, when we have the synergies with the housing   program, which should reduce foreclosures and should increase the ability to refinance  Both   borrowers and purchasers are so incredibly hair-trigger sensitive to what goes on with mortgage   interest rates Mortgage interest rates went down when we made the announcement before, but   that was in November, and that was not the season when people buy houses  If we do this in the   spring, when there are other programs that would support it and when it’s pretty obvious that   there’s not going to be any fiscal stimulus coming along that would also further support house   purchases, then maybe we’ve got a window of opportunity where we can go in there and put a   floor under house prices, and that will start to move some of these other things  And with that,   Mr Chairman, I believe I’m the last one           March 17–18, 2009 111 of 266   Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’m going to talk again about the banks, and as   a reminder, these are the traditional commercial banks, and it’s a variety of them just below the   top four across the country in varying conditions and of different sizes  Of that group, four are   subject to the stress test, and in talking to them this time, I’d note that I’ve never, ever talked to   bankers where the conversation was so much about government and so little about the banking   business, particularly given what they’re facing right now   With the four banks that are subject to the stress test, I first asked them what the process   was, and I got three different answers—so they didn’t even quite understand what it was they   were being asked to do Two of them were convinced that it’s a Trojan horse for nationalization    Several of them questioned whether this test is even going to have credibility in the marketplace           March 17–18, 2009 154 of 266  once it gets done, thinking it’s possible that those who are shown to be weak will simply have   confirmed suspicions, but those who are shown to be strong will not get any boost in confidence   from that  Also, there’s a concern that they’ll be at a standstill for the six months that have been   given in order to raise private capital, because, even if they pass—even if they’re not to get any   government capital—if they go out to get private capital, then it looks like they are doing that   only to avoid getting the public capital, so basically they cannot go to the capital market  Private   capital is absolutely unwilling to come in until their status is assured and is not willing at this   point to be a minority partner with the United States government  We’ve talked a lot about   confidence, and one issue is that we have no confidence in our banks ourselves as a government,   so it’s very hard to engender public confidence in those banks   Politics and bonuses, particularly with respect to the original TARP I capital  That   capital now feels completely stigmatized  Banks thought it would be a sign of strength The   public perception is that they’ve been bailed out  The nondeductible dividend, the political   strings attached, and the unknown future combine to make many of them, as President Plosser   said, want to give it back Given the events of this week, I think AIG first nearly took out the   financial system and now may make it impossible for us to do any form of financial rescue    There was a letter from the Special Inspector General for TARP that went to all of the banks  It   was a prosecutorial-sounding letter demanding to know exactly what they had done with every   dollar that they had received from the government  They found that almost impossible to   respond to, but all of them are working on it   The executive compensation restrictions  The CEOs are not concerned about their own   pay, and they’re not concerned about that of their top lieutenants  What they are concerned   about is their top revenue-producers who are being actively recruited by nonbanks and in some              March 17–18, 2009 155 of 266  cases larger banks; these people might be in the top 25 in a small bank, but if they go to a larger   bank, they would no longer be part of the top 25  At another bank, the chief of credit is retiring   and the CEO does not think that he can find a replacement under the executive compensation   restrictions The rules are unclear  They’re still waiting for the Treasury to publish the   regulations, and they don’t know, for example, what the effective date is  Some of them wonder   whether they’re going to have to take back the 2008 bonuses already paid  There are questions   about vesting If the vesting cannot occur until the TARP money is paid back, does that mean   they cannot vest 100 percent, or does that mean they can only partially vest?  If they vest 100   percent once the capital is paid out, what is that going to do to the income statements?  Two of   them were deferring their stockholders meeting until the proxy rules became clearer   The removal of requirements for paying the TARP capital back, which was part of the   last fiscal recovery plan Investors already viewed this as temporary, and therefore they were   treating it as a loan rather than capital—hence the focus on tangible common equity  Now it’s   clearly temporary, clearly a loan, and clearly not capital  One of the banks said that they were   getting calls from numerous private equity firms, which they originally would never have talked   to, saying, “Once you get through the stress test, if you want to give the TARP capital back, we   will come in”  Ordinarily they would not have taken it, but now they’re looking at that as an   option The Chairman said in his interview on 60 Minutes that a sign of the economy recovering   would be a major institution getting private capital—you may get that wish  All but one   expressed the absolute desire to repay, and that is what they’re focused on  The one that was not   going to repay is going to put itself in a position to repay and just simply not pay it back until, as   he said, “the clouds part and the sun shines”  So no banks are willing to leverage it further and           March 17–18, 2009 156 of 266  get into a position of needing to keep it So it’s not doing any good  It is not performing any   function except sitting there as a standby   Capital stories One bank was contacted by another—both were fairly good-sized banks   and they talked for a good amount of time  It was a good strategic fit  There was no issue with   price There were no social issues  However, it required additional capital, and they turned it   down Another one had been in detailed talks with the FDIC about taking over a problem bank    The deal included taking additional TARP in order to make the deal work  They notified the   FDIC that they were standing down; they no longer wanted to have anything to do with that    And finally, a bank that had not taken any of the government capital had sold trust preferred and   common with just a few phone calls last year This year, the only buyers are the nonpublic   investors, because they’re worried about mark to market and OTTI, and they will not invest if   TARP capital is present  Now the trust preferred will be priced at 11 to 12 percent fixed with   warrants; last year that price was LIBOR plus 375   The bottom line is that the political and public perception right now precludes the use of   government capital for healthy banks, and the presence of public capital has put private capital   further out of reach All of that being said, I still believe, when we look back on this episode, we   will determine that the injection of capital into the banks kept us from a meltdown  But we’ll   also conclude that the public outcry forced the capital back out again  My most optimistic   projection is that it will be replaced sooner than anticipated with internal and private sources and   that banks will then learn to work with the capital that’s available to them   In terms of the FDIC, the restriction and higher fees for issuance of the TLGP are causing   banks to speed up issuance They originally thought they had a period of time, and the   investment bankers were feeding these issues out in sort of a measured way  Now they all feel                  March 17–18, 2009 157 of 266  like they have to issue before April 1, before the price goes up  Banks did not see the FDIC   increase in the premiums and the special assessment coming  Most of them, of course, believe   that they’re paying for the bailouts of large banks in some way, and it wipes out a significant   portion, if not all, of quarterly earnings   Now to the bankruptcy cram-down for prime, jumbo, and all types of securitizations    The bankruptcy cram-down will alter the order of payments, so that the losses are then shared   equally by all tranches rather than in order This is going to further reduce the value of triple-A   tranches of those, and the staff estimates that’s a market of about $600 billion in securities   The Federal Home Loan Banks  The Seattle bank became the first to exhaust its retained   earnings They’re primarily mark-to-market losses, and it’s making the case that they’re not real   losses But the question is What does this mean for valuation of the stock that the banks hold?   Stock ownership is a requirement for borrowing, so anybody who’s borrowing from Federal   Home Loan Banks also owns that stock  The advances are getting significantly more expensive    This is not an issue just for small banks—the top 10 banks have 20 percent of the advances from   Federal Home Loan Banks  Bankers’ banks and corporate credit unions, I think, pose similar   risks for smaller institutions   Fair value accounting is still the number one concern in the industry  I would look to see   what happens with the impact of the revised standards on the first quarter  That could be very   helpful, although banks that took big losses in the fourth quarter don’t get to reverse them   Let’s switch just a minute now and talk about what’s actually going on in the banking   book Deposits are growing, in some cases significantly  Transactions, as consumers change   their behavior, are down significantly, as are overdrafts  In the loan area, demand is down   sharply Consumer and small business applications are up a bit, but the approval rates are down           March 17–18, 2009 158 of 266  about 10 percent, as you said In terms of home equity loans, the reasons for the denials are   primarily issues with debt-to-income ratios and appraisals  One thing that consumer groups in   here in last week reminded me of—which I had forgotten and shouldn’t have—is that home   equity is a primary funding source for small businesses, not SBA loans  We tend to look at home   equity as a consumer loan, but it is really small business financing  In terms of business loans,   they are down from lack of income and in many cases actually outright losses   In the construction loan area, they are still working through the existing residential   construction loans and dealing with lots and lots of lots  There’s not much new commercial   construction—it’s primarily medical or educational facilities  And there is no takeout for   completed construction  Some banks are pulling away from loan products, segments, industries,   or geographic areas Others are taking the best of the deals and underwriting them individually    For example, if somebody says, “I’m getting out of all deals to a given segment,” a smaller bank   will come in and underwrite them individually and take the best of those deals  Those are the   ones that are growing their loans   Student loans They were already low margin due to a mismatch in reference rates  The   banks are currently doing more volume than they want, and they seem delighted to hear that the   federal budget is taking them out of the student loan business   Mortgages The application volume slowed when rates picked up, and it’s still primarily   refinancings   Loan modifications  The GSE and service portfolios were modified, but they are   concerned about the long-term effect of the very low rates with the ceiling for their own book   Credit quality Delinquencies continue to rise  They’re starting to sell properties at the   same rate they’re bringing in new ones  The growth in loans that are ninety days past due are           March 17–18, 2009 159 of 266  primarily loans that are in the process of modification  The commercial loans are the ones   showing real trouble right now, and as I said yesterday, commercial real estate loans are really   just business loans The repayment and the collateral value of those loans depend on the   business cash flows, and the appraisals right now are stunningly low  Many retail stores are   closing Others are on percentage rent, so that cash flows do drop with sales  Some centers are   one tenant away from disaster  Hospitality is suffering from not only the recession but the   stigma  In Hawaii they are having $10 million a week in cancellations   The banks, though, are not foreclosing In this case, they are modifying, offering reduced   payments, and putting on nonaccrual as long as the operator will continue to operate, because   they don’t want those properties back Some banks are actually incentivizing their loan officers   to move loans out rather than to bring loans in  Some banks are offering to settle performing   loans at a discount in order to get them off the books  One bank is considering making jumbo   loans at conforming rates on its own books to diversify its borrower risk and reduce the   inventory of construction loans With the residential construction loans, you almost get an   impression of a store that’s getting ready to go out of business and hasn’t been able to buy new   inventory The inventory they have is not the inventory that’s selling, and it’s just sitting there   on the shelves   In terms of auto loans, there are lower losses on cars that are coming off lease  The   wholesale inventories are firming up, and I think that would show through to new cars by the   third quarter Rental agencies are trimming their fleets by about 20 percent  Dealers can’t sell,   so they are looking to manufacturers to repurchase the inventory  A Lexus dealer said he has   customers who normally would buy on a regular basis and can afford to buy, but are worried   about the appearance of buying in a situation where people are losing their jobs           March 17–18, 2009 160 of 266  The boat inventory is aging It’s now three years old, and GE Capital is the only   company financing boats   Borrowers do not expect to have to pay  One CEO was at his neighbor’s house, which   she had just purchased for $16 million  The neighbor showed the improvements that she was   making and then asked who the modification officer at the bank was because she wanted to   modify the mortgage on her vacation home  Another CEO had a private banking client come in   who had purchased a home with a private banking loan for $2 million in 2005  The loan was   interest only for a million and a half  At one point, the client got a $3 million offer and turned it   down Now the property is for sale at $1 million, and the client said he would continue to make   the payments if they reduced the loan to $750,000   There’s a huge increase in fraud  Floor plan and wire transfer were the two that were   mentioned   In summary, right now I’m really not hearing much about bank-specific issues that are   impediments to lending  Deposits are high Government liquidity is cheap and plentiful  The   primary reasons for not lending are related to creditworthiness and concern about economic   conditions and collateral values Banks are reducing credit line availability, but it is due to   concerns about credit and collateral  Loans are difficult for larger amounts, for credit-only   customers, for those with high debt-to-income ratios or weak credit histories, for those who have   little equity, and for any construction loan  Finally, there’s sticker shock  I don’t think the banks   will ever go back to lending at the spreads typical before this episode, so many of those who   think that they can’t get credit are concerned more about the cost of credit, and I think those high   loan spreads are here to stay    I just want to make sure my math is correct and my understanding is   correct When we do the additional $500 billion in mortgage-backed securities, does that   increase the pace at which we buy them, or does it extend the time from June until the end of the   year?    Under alternative A, by my count it’s $500 billion in MBS, $300 billion in   Treasuries, and $100 billion in agencies, for a total of $900 billion  Would we expect that to   have a similar result as in the note on $1 trillion in a combination of mortgage-backed securities   and Treasuries?  Is that the result we would be looking for from alternative A?    For alternative B—which is $750 billion plus $100 billion, I get   $850 billion Would we also expect that to have similar impact?  In other words, would the fact   that there’s no Treasury component matter?    Okay Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I am actually in favor of the largest amount that   we can all agree on My objective, as I stated yesterday, is to have the biggest effect on housing   that we possibly can In terms of how we explain that, I do like the prime version, because it   puts the action first Having spent more of my time reading the statements than issuing them, it   seems to me the first paragraph was always the action paragraph  And I think for a good time to   come this will be our action  In addition, I think the easier we can make this to report, the better   off we are If you get reporters, particularly third- and fourth-level reporters, on a deadline and   all they read is the first part and skim through the rest, they may not necessarily pick up the size   of this action So I have a pretty strong preference for the prime version  Also, while I find it   interesting to put it on a percent-growth basis, we’ve already started down the path with the   dollar amounts, and I think continuing with the way we’ve been communicating it already has   some certainty and some simplicity  To me it feels like announcing a stock repurchase in the   private sector In that case, you size your stock repurchase in relation to the amount of   outstanding shares that you have, and it’s perceived that way and tends to impact your price that   way   Finally, on measuring effectiveness, I think the questions at this point would be  How   big an effect does it have immediately on housing, on the stock market, and on things that create   wealth, and how quickly do we see whether or not it has spillover effects?   The last piece is this sentence that says we “will be assessing whether a faster pace of   asset purchases would be helpful in improving credit market conditions”  I originally liked that,   because it implied that we were willing to do even more  On thinking about it, though, there’s   something to be said for creating a little bit of fear in the housing markets that this is a window                    March 17–18, 2009 213 of 266  of opportunity to refinance or purchase So if it doesn’t look like rates may go down further if   you wait, then I think that’s got some real value  So I suppose ultimately I come down in favor   of A plus′ [Laughter]     Thank you, Mr Chairman  In looking at the false dawn scenario, I was   sobered by the degree to which the Greenbook forecast depends on the reduction in financial   sector turmoil  And I share President Rosengren’s concern about the potential destabilization   resulting from the announcement of the stress-test results  I am, similarly, skeptical that   government capital would spur any additional lending  Instead, it seems that lending is going to   be constrained by the private capital positions, which will then be evaluated in light of capital   standards that have been implied by the stress tests  I suspect that the most important   confidence-building aspect of the stress tests may be actually the degree to which government   stands ready to provide absolute support in terms of both capital and liquidity to firms in case   there is a destabilizing event   In my talking to the banks that were subject to the stress test and were awaiting their   results, they reported that they were surrounded by lawyers and that they had developed   communication plans A, B, and C for all of their expected scenarios in terms of the results  I   emphasize communication plans—no capital plans  The reason for this is that they simply did     April 28–29, 2009 90 of 201  not believe that they had any ability to raise private capital alongside government capital, and so   that exercise seemed futile  I was struck by one banker to whom I talked who went on at length   about his preparations for his stress-test results, to the point that, when I hung up, I went back   and checked and determined that, no, he was not covered by the stress test  [Laughter] So I   called him back and said, “You know you are not covered by this”  And he said, “I know, but   we will be” He was absolutely convinced and had been encouraged in that belief by his   regulators   I did talk to one who was not going to need additional capital, who was getting a strong   amount of interest from private equity to repay his government capital but felt as though he   would really prefer to wait about six months to separate the stress-test results from the original   TARP capital injections  Also, there were some concerns as to what might unfold in the next six   months I don’t think that is unique to him  I think that a number of companies, although they   may have talked about wanting to get out of the original capital, are going to be a little less   anxious than they might appear  One bank that did give back the TARP capital has seen no   improvement in its stock price and no discernible improvement anywhere else  However, I heard   from a smaller bank that did give back the capital, and the contact reported much rejoicing in his   community, a surge in new customers, and congratulations all around  But the scariest part is   that his mother cried in joy and pride when he returned his government capital  I swear   [Laughter]   The amount of uncertainty about the rules and the changing of the rules are certainly   limiting the effectiveness of the TARP, the TLGP, and the PPIP  A number of firms reported   that they were trying to work down their government funding but that private funding is still   scarce, and no matter who their primary regulator is right now, they are dealing with multiple     April 28–29, 2009 91 of 201  regulators for multiple programs, all with differing priorities and requirements—the FDIC for the   TLGP, the Fed for the TAF, and the Treasury for the TARP  They also said that they can’t rely   on traditional correspondents  They have been jerked around by the Home Loan Banks  As one   bank put it, at least the Fed won’t redline Michigan  [Laughter]   OTTI rules have made a difference for some of the banks  One of them reported 44 basis   points on tier 1 capital, 17 basis points for first-quarter write-downs that would have occurred,   and 27 basis points in the true-ups  So the OTTI has really made a substantial difference   Earnings, obviously, were better than expected  There are record mortgage originations   that are primarily refinance, but some reports of increasing purchase activity  Interestingly,   Florida was reported to be 50/50 between refi and purchase, with the reason that the prices have   dropped too much for refis to be able to take place and the low prices on foreclosures are actually   attracting buyers Mortgage income is probably sustainable through the year  Good trust and   investment income  Loan pricing is much better than it has been historically; the deposit pricing   pressure, which had been very strong in the fall, is easing a bit; and prices seem a bit more   rational   For smaller banks, the margins are down 100 to 160 basis points since the start of the   easing, and all banks are worried about the special FDIC assessment  Demand is weak for new   lending They are pricing for risk Term tightening is primarily in the higher loan-to-value    There is a big demand for floor plan lending  In fact, the SBA is trying to figure out how to be   helpful, but the problem is that nobody has any expertise anymore  As the captives took over   that business, the expertise atrophied in the other banks  The smaller banks are still seeing   demand from large bank customers, but their ability to meet that demand is becoming more and   more strained by their liquidity and capital availability  Deposit growth continues, although the        April 28–29, 2009 92 of 201  rate of growth seems to be slowing  Transaction accounts within deposits are down almost   10 percent, and overdraft income is down more than 12 percent   Regarding credit quality, delinquencies are still growing, but they are actually more   predictable and are coming up as models are predicting  The states that are heavily affected by   the auto business are seeing bigger deterioration  The loans that are coming into collection at   least now have something to work with  Severity is growing, although some report that home   prices are stabilizing In terms of nonperforming-loan levels, a couple of banks pointed out that   the nonperforming level is not necessarily the best indicator of losses because consumer loans go   from delinquent or even not delinquent to charge-off  Only the real estate loans go through the   non-accrual process Nonperformers are increasing even at those banks with low levels of   problems  As one bank president put it, if the loan officer had actually looked at the property, he   would never have made the loan  The traditional workout activity is going on, deciding which   ones they can work with and which ones they need to dispose of  Non-accruals also are growing   because of the length of time for judicial foreclosures  It now apparently takes 24 months to   complete a foreclosure in the State of Florida because they are so backed up on judicial  It used   to take 12 months; now it is up to 24  Then, some banks are holding their ORE for a better   market   I will focus a bit on commercial real estate and the extent to which the use of CMBS and   the TALF might be helpful Eighty percent of maturities in commercial real estate are held in   banks, and the CMBS targeted by the TALF actually won’t take out the construction loans and is   likely to affect about 20 percent of the rest As the Vice Chairman pointed out, vacancies are up,   rents are down, and cap rates are up  Multifamily is holding up the best, then office  Retail is   very weak, and hospitality properties are a disaster  Take-out commitments are being honored,     April 28–29, 2009 93 of 201  but there are no new commitments  So they are converting the maturities to a three-to-five-year   mini-perm, but the appraisals are running 50 to 55 percent of those appraisals done even a year   or two years ago Once the appraisal comes in that low, it breaks the covenants, and then they   have to request a paydown and actually put the loans on non-accrual  They are not necessarily   moving to foreclosure They said the Street will worry about the increase in the level of non-  accruals, which makes it optically expensive  But they feel that over the long term they are   much better served by waiting through this cycle in the real estate market and that the reduction   in value in this cycle is not necessarily due to overbuilding but is actually due just to issues going   on in the regular economy The medium-risk properties are the ones that really need to come out   of the system One bank reported that 40 percent of non-accruals are SBA 504 program loans,   which means that they are only 50 percent loan-to-value, because the next 40 percent is actually   protected by SBA guarantees, but they still have to show them in non-accrual  They are also   getting mixed signals from regulators on loans in process of collection  So as we look at issues   with commercial real estate, we may be able to address some of this in the supervision and   examination standards rather than necessarily trying to do anything specifically with those loans    And that is my report, Mr Chairman    Thank you I am going to support alternative B  Although I agree with   President Yellen that the forecast outcome is not desirable, I also agree with a number of others   that I am not sure I understand right now the effectiveness of which programs  We are also in a   situation where we are dealing with numerous programs, some of which we control the size and   others of which we do not control the size, particularly if we look at the TALF and the   expectation of the TALF going anywhere from $100 billion to $1 trillion, depending on what the   take-up is Right now, as we add the CMBS and we put it out there at five-year terms, we are   going to limit the five-year terms to $100 billion  It is not clear whether we would get additional   growth on the three-year terms, so I would rather wait and see how that works out   On the language, I think it is very difficult to come up with language that indicates a   steady set of purchases for very different programs  If you look at the lumpiness that Trish   pointed out in the mortgage markets—but even if you look at our statements—the $300 billion   purchases going to autumn versus the mortgage-backed securities going to the end of the year   don’t translate into even purchases from now until the end of the year  The mix would change    So, for those reasons, I would prefer the language in alternative B     Thank you On the question of extensions and modifications on liquidity   facilities, I’m generally in favor of the proposal, but I wonder if one option might be to raise the   minimum rate for TAF at the same time we increase the spread on the primary credit, so that   we’d be treating the two different types of borrowers the same way   On the exit strategies, it strikes me that the whole discussion is incredibly similar to a   normal exercise in asset-liability management that goes on in banks all the time and that we   should probably be paying attention to the same kind of tools that are used in banks to simulate   various possibilities Regarding these tools, I don’t think they’re mutually exclusive, so some   modeling of an optimum mix—a funding mix if you will—of all of the various tools, taking into   account some of the different barriers that we might run into in different markets, might make   some sense                 June 23–24, 2009 91 of 261  Also, I’d be interested in some sort of regular reporting, whether it is in Notes or the   Bluebook or one of the other books, so that we keep an eye on the potential costs of the exit   strategies in a number of different environments  As a banker, I have been in a situation where I   have looked into the future and have seen losses that would arise from unwinding positions that I   had taken Of course, at that time, I was never able to adjust my cost of funds absolutely    [Laughter] So it occurs to me this could involve an incredibly magnified political risk  There’s a   huge temptation not to take those losses when the risk associated with taking the losses is very   high So we need to make sure that we’re paying attention to those costs, particularly if they   would bring us under political pressure at the same time that we’re doing something that’s   politically unpopular to begin with  So, again, I think modeling those out is important     I guess the statement that struck me the most is that the banking organizations have not   discussed with System staff the possible effects of increased Systemwide reserves  I haven’t   seen any indication that anybody anywhere in the banking industry has thought about the   implications of these very high reserves in the system  I’ve been trying to think what that effect   might be, and, frankly, I don’t know  But it strikes me that this level of reserves is going to have   some sort of effect, so we should start to think about that, too  Hopefully, some of our   researchers can come up with some possible impacts   Finally, on flexibility, I’m probably, again, headed dangerously close to the policy round   discussion When we first started these programs, I wasn’t entirely sure how much we would   need, so it strikes me that, if a given purchase amount is beginning to impair functioning in any   market that we are in, we have to wonder if that purchase amount minus one is also doing   anything positive in that market  That would seem to indicate that certainly we’re getting close        June 23–24, 2009 92 of 261  to an exit for agency debt And I wonder, as originations go down, whether we end up in the   same place with the MBS  Those are my comments, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  The banks have settled down a little bit since   the stress test They report the stress tests were not all that terrible, and they were as surprised as   I was at the ease of the capital raise  They’re looking for opportunities now to raise debt    There’s no trust preferred available, and a couple were issuing investment units; one had a   common equity and a convertible bond component, and another reported having to add warrants   to debt in order to attract investors              June 23–24, 2009 153 of 261  All would like to pay back the TARP, and they’re divided into those who most likely will   not be able to soon and those who can For those who will not soon, they’re not sure that they’re   out of the woods, and they acknowledge that they wouldn’t survive being wrong  Those who   have or will soon pay back cite worries about losing their top revenue producers, the cost of the   government capital, the fact that new investors who are providing capital want them to get out,   and—probably the most honest response—“Because everybody else is getting out”   In terms of liquidity, they are moving down to or up to 100 percent loan-deposit ratios—   those with higher ratios are shedding credit and those with lower ratios are the beneficiaries of   that Deposits are still growing, but at a much slower rate, and, interestingly, in discussing their   liquidity, they all pointed to their excess funds on deposit with the Federal Reserve  So, again, I   don’t see any indication that bankers are concerned about excess reserves right now  In fact,   they think they’re creating them   In terms of profitability, margins are finally improving  Reserves are still growing   Expenses are down except for FDIC assessments Fee income is flat  Mortgage income was   huge in the first two quarters, but refinance activity, in particular, has slowed dramatically with   the higher rates   In terms of credit management, the long process of working through residential problems   continues Construction lending has plateaued or a little bit better  OREO properties are   moving, although there are still problem areas, such as lots in Arizona and condos in Florida    C&I is actually holding up A few banks mention noticeable problems with small businesses and   said that mom-and-pop stores are simply giving up  Their classifications are growing as the   financial statements come in and show the expected lower profitability, but they’re still not   showing up in delinquencies In terms of commercial real estate, it’s getting worse, but it still                 June 23–24, 2009 154 of 261  seems manageable  The bottom is not falling out  Loans are classified, but not yet charging off   In terms of office buildings, as the leases renew, rents are being negotiated down, and one banker   who had just worked through his residential construction was dismayed to find that the offices he   had financed were full of real estate companies [Laughter] In terms of retail, there’s a lot of   fallout among the smaller tenants, and there are problems with the anchors; the anchor tenants   can renegotiate because there’s a clause that gives all of the smaller tenants an out if they lose the   anchor tenants So the anchor tenants are absolutely taking advantage of the ability to negotiate   down And then finally we asked about the auto dealers, and they are, I think, pretty successful   at moving the inventory, but they are left with debt on special use properties   In terms of new lending, high-quality credits are paying down, and demand is all from   low-quality credits One banker said he was willing to battle the examiners over his own weaker   credits, but he was not willing to take on someone else’s, so if someone is turned down at their   primary bank, they’re unlike to find a home anywhere else  There are lots of problems with   appraisals In particular, there are not enough recent comparables  Many banks are exiting some   products, some geographies, some industries, as well as credit-only relationships, although risk   pricing is the best in ten years     So I’m left to wonder how we finance this recovery  Staff recently helped me use the   flow-of-funds data to look for the drop in credit so far, and we found that the drop in credit up to   this point has not been nearly what you might have expected and has actually been in the middle   to the upper range of past credit crunch recessions  I believe that the support provided to the   financial system kept it from dropping, but that support is now steadily being withdrawn, if not   intentionally, then through stigmatization  So I believe the credit crunch is still to come  Many,   many bank balance sheets are still supported by government capital and liquidity  This credit               June 23–24, 2009 155 of 261  cycle also will leave plenty of credit impairment wreckage behind  The bankers and their   examiners are very, very risk-averse  I think business credit is going to hold up better as   profitability will probably come back with the improvement of sales as well as the fallout of   competitors, but consumer credit is going to be impaired for a long while  The number of   bankruptcies, delinquencies, foreclosures, and charge-offs, the fact that the same credit score   now equates to a much higher risk, and the fact that collateral values are significantly lower will   all contribute to less credit available to consumers   Most importantly, there are a number of broken business models  While I do believe that   we need new business models in these times, the transition is likely to be much more painful than   we currently anticipate, and I see it in two areas  The first area is mortgage lending, where   there’s no visibility on what is going to happen with the GSE system, and there is yet no   securitization 20 on the horizon—so I don’t see what happens in terms of housing finance  The   second area is credit cards This may be a second, smaller wave of problems similar to the   subprime mortgage crisis  As I hear anecdotes of people who are in trouble on their mortgages, I   am struck by the number of stories that include phenomenal amounts of credit card debt—   $30,000, $50,000, $100,000—built up by taking on more and more cards with increasing lines,   then reloading by refinancing a first mortgage or an equity line and starting again  Just as the   subprime market failed when refinance stopped, credit charge-offs are going to grow as the   availability of larger lines, additional cards, and debt consolidation loans disappears  This is fed   by the current business model for credit cards, which was a land grant model  The issuers would   cast a wide net, trolling for new customers using teaser rates and additional lines, and then they   would underwrite and price after acquisition of those customers, pricing for profitability by   testing price increases on a sample of customers with similar characteristics and then increasing              June 23–24, 2009 156 of 261  the profit by balancing the higher interest income with lost customers and write-offs  Line   management included a discovery that the highest limit becomes the primary card, so line   increases were based primarily on propensity to spend and propensity to carry balances, offset by   the higher credit risk   New restrictions both in our regulations and in legislation now will require that they   underwrite in advance, and I’m not quite sure whether this means underwrite the ability to carry   the interest or the ability to pay off in the traditional three- to five-year time frame  I don’t know   what “capacity to repay” will do  Combined with record charge-off levels, estimates are for a   reduction of 25 to 30 percent in availability If we have nearly $1 trillion in outstanding, this   could be a reduction in credit available of $200 to $250 billion, combined with an inability to   reload through equity loans or home refinance  Indeed, the second most cited reason for home   equity was to refinance credit card debt   So what does this do to the saving rate if those most likely to finance deficit spending can   no longer do so?  I had written down here that I don’t know yet, but fortunately, Governor Kohn,   President Yellen, and the Vice Chairman have all suggested the possible impact of this reduction   in credit Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’m going to be quite repetitive, so I’ll be very   brief I, too, am troubled by the projections not being consistent with our dual mandate    However, with Treasuries as the only option for expansion, I’m not at all convinced that a   modest increase in our Treasury purchases brings us that much closer to our objective  And I am   concerned about the difficulties with exiting an even larger balance sheet  So I support   alternative B, and I would omit the final sentence in light of the risk that the interpretation would   be that our exit is imminent  Finally, I would echo President Rosengren’s and Governor Kohn’s   support of option ARMs Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I am going to echo and maybe expand upon some   of Governor Kohn’s comments about credit  First of all, the current situation  In the overall lending   environment, demand is extremely low, although bankers are very happy with the quality and the   spreads on the new credit that they are originating and they continue to shift resources to work   through problem credits In C&I lending, credit quality is actually holding up better than they   expected, but line utilization is at very low rates, in some cases 30 percent, maybe 50 percent on the   high side, and again, new demand is weak  In consumer credit, they did cite early-stage   delinquencies as being improved, but nobody seemed particularly comfortable with calling that a   trend   In residential real estate, the low-end product is beginning to move  Sellers are lowering   their price expectations, in some cases being forced by the banks that will no longer extend interest   carry to get through this, and the buyers seems to be less fearful of further price declines  Most of   the buyers are either first-time homebuyers or investors who now see that the rental cash flow on   these makes sense  The inventory is actually fairly tight in the 3-to-6-months’ supply for the low   end and in the 30-to-40-months’ supply for the higher, larger properties  Some of the inventory is   just plain bad product  It is bad construction; it is poor design, poor location, or too big  The new   construction is generally smaller with fewer extras but still with quality finishes because that is what   is being demanded at the moment   On the commercial real estate side, they are working down construction loans—some   through payout, some through charge-off, some through sales, and much through mini perm   financing  There is very little demand for new CRE (commercial real estate loans)—a reminder that   commercial real estate loans are still just business loans and their performance is dependent upon   the industry and the local economic conditions  So the deterioration depends on the type of           August 11–12, 2009 106 of 165  property Condos are awful Hospitality properties are extremely weak  Retail is still suffering   from rent renegotiation and vacancy rates, with rural areas and small towns being hit particularly   hard by big box closures  Office and multifamily properties are weak but are still holding up   reasonably well   When I look at credit availability, I am struck by the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey   results, particularly the part that shows reductions in the number of respondents that have tightened   terms while, when weighted by balances outstanding, more than 75 percent of the respondents   expect the standards for prime borrowers to remain tighter than normal for the foreseeable future   and the fraction for tighter terms for the foreseeable future for subprime is even higher  In addition   to having tighter terms for approval, banks are unlikely to engage in the aggressive acquisition   strategies that they had—from the credit card mailings, the teaser rates, and that sort of thing—   because of the inability to reprice post-acquisition  Those are unlikely to resume, and I did hear   reports of 40 percent to completely eliminating those types of promotions   On mortgage and home equity, as the indirect channels have performed so poorly, again,   they are unlikely to resume indirect acquisition  The existing credit card and home equity line   availability is still being reduced  I heard a lot about the credit card regulations, and my sense is that   they are going to affect availability, pricing, and terms for maybe a couple of years but ultimately a   new equilibrium will be found and a new business model will take hold  Most actually expect C&I   lending to return with improving business performance as banks look for income  This is the place   to which they all seem to be looking for additional income, but this may not translate into improved   availability for small businesses  Charge-offs are running very high on small business credit, and   small businesses are, frankly, very thinly capitalized  Many of them are just giving up, no longer   willing to advance the funds to keep the businesses running  SBA eligibility is a very, very tiny                        August 11–12, 2009 107 of 165  slice of this market  The majority of these loans are not even in C&I  Some are in CRE—if you   think about hotels, gas stations, and that sort of thing, where the property is the business  Some are   in consumer, in mortgages, in home equity, and in credit cards   Then I have a hard time even envisioning what the future of mortgage finance is going to   look like The originate-to-distribute model is still broken, and there is no new model in sight  The   future of the GSEs is murky  The FHA volume is growing amid rumors of credit problems and   potential fraud  The private label is closed and unlikely to return without changes to originator   compensation and examination, rating agencies, contracts with servicers, payment priorities, loss   distribution and trust agreements, and transparencies of the loans underlying the securitizations  So   it is difficult to determine how dependent even the GSE market is on the Fed purchases   Finally, bankers are making loans regarding credit in light of a number of uncertainties in   addition to uncertainties about economic outcomes  The first one is capital requirements  Will all   banks be stress-tested?  Is that the new norm?  There is limited understanding of what the capital-  assessment process is designed to do and what it might mean  Community banks insist that   12 percent is the new 10 percent in terms of risk-based capital, and many note statements regarding   higher capital requirements for systemically important institutions     In terms of treatment on commercial real estate loans, while all of the anecdotes are   certainly not applicable to all banks and may not be applicable even to some banks, all banks   believe that they could be true  They discuss the revival of the performing nonperformer  I heard   reports of the entire construction portfolio being classified  If a property is not sold through two   sales cycles, although nobody seemed to know what that meant, it must be converted to a 10-year   amortization Examiners are requiring new appraisals, and these are being affected by both reduced   cash flow and higher cap rates and also by the fact that either there are no comparables or there are                                August 11–12, 2009 108 of 165  distress sales on the comparables  The CRE loans are creating large classifications due to the   reduced cash flows and lower appraisals, even if no loss is ultimately expected, followed by MOUs   and C&Ds if the classified loans are over 100 percent of capital, and then a requirement of dollar­  for-dollar capital for classified assets   Accounting issues are also of concern because they actually affect the measurement of   capital FASB is getting ready to propose fair value accounting for all loans  Securitizations,   participations, and loan sales are moving back on the balance sheet  We found in the stress test the   issues in understanding acquisition accounting and what that means for reserve measures, capital   measures, and loan book measures, and then loan loss reserve accounting, consumer protection   rules, the credit card rules, the proposed CFPA, the proposal for plain vanilla products, the loss of   preemption, and the prospect of a duty of care and fiduciary responsibility  All of these are   weighing on banks as they make their decisions   Given all of these issues, I cannot take my eyes off the alternative scenarios in the   Greenbook for financial fragility or higher saving rates and their unwelcome outcomes  Thank you,   Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Given my pessimism about credit availability   and concern about the likelihood of alternative scenarios, I started thinking about, well, if they   came to pass, what policy action might we take My thoughts are probably further colored by the   time that I have spent with the TALF and with the staff working on the TALF  But as I look at        August 11–12, 2009 142 of 165  the experience with the commercial paper facilities and the ABS markets, I do see signs that the   markets outside of our purchases have improved   Then as we looked at the RMBS for the TALF, it became clear that the problems in the   private mortgage market were probably beyond our tools to repair  So although we have talked   about a lot of market improvement, the only mortgage market now and for the foreseeable future   is the government-supported market  And I see the very likely need to support the mortgage   market at least through visibility of how the GSEs might be resolved and perhaps even through   that transition, and I hope that we would see some signs of how the private mortgage market   might actually reemerge before we withdraw support to that market   So the MBS purchases in relation to the total outstanding and the originations right now   are large, but it seems quite likely to me that we will need to extend the support, at least in time   if not in total, well past March 2010  I don’t see a similar need to expand Treasury purchases,   and the tapering certainly prepares the way for a much bigger tapering job ahead with the MBS   purchases But I think we really do need to look at what we might need to do longer term on the   mortgage market and when we announce what we are going to do on that  And I do support   alternative B (revised)    My question revolves around how your analysis and your conclusions would have   been different if the banks had expressed a stronger willingness to lend some time in the near future  It   seems to me that when we started down this path, we did expect the rate we were paying to be a floor on   the fed funds rate, and it turned out not to be  But if the banks were strongly interested in lending and   chasing loan funds, it seems as if that would be the point where it would turn out to be a floor  Am I   thinking about that correctly or not?    There is a reason why we don’t mark them to market, and I’ve read it, and I   can’t remember what it was    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Before I start, I’d like to go back to the question   I missed yesterday, which was on the accounting  I did find out that we actually take exception   to GAAP with the evaluation of the SOMA portfolio on the rationale that our purchases and sales   are driven by monetary policy considerations rather than valuation  As we go forward with the   MBS purchases, this rationale could get pretty stressed, especially if we choose the securities that   we sell for their valuation rather than for some monetary policy reason  I point that out just so   that we’re aware that the accounting issues we face may ultimately have some political costs, at   least when we start to exit, so we can’t entirely ignore the losses in those securities   Turning to observations from the banking sector, most of the banks report little change in   their current or expected condition since the last meeting  In terms of new lending, there’s very   low demand across the board, but pricing is still significantly better  I asked “Why is it with very           September 22–23, 2009 118 of 212  low demand that your pricing is still so strong?”  They said they’re only lending to the   highest-quality credits with relationships, with profitability, and borrowers are actually happy to   have the lending relationships intact  There’s very little shopping and very little competition—   banks aren’t chasing someone else’s customers and customers aren’t looking for a new bank    Line usage is at historic lows, even by the borrowers who already have approved credit at very   favorable pricing, and borrowers whose banks have closed or been acquired are actually   orphaned and unable to get the best terms   I’ve been trying to understand the difference between the credit availability in this cycle   and the one that followed the last banking crisis The staff used the flow of funds data to try to   estimate the difference between forecast and actual levels of credit and found that at this point in   the cycle about 46 percent of the difference can be explained by credit factors rather than   economic factors, compared to 62 percent in the 1990–91 cycle   In terms of loan quality, interestingly, one member of the FAC noted that, when they met   here a week or two ago, they had dinner with the Chairman and not one of the bankers had an   outlook as positive as the Chairman expressed  They were quite amazed at the Chairman’s   cheerfulness [Laughter] Most see the next six quarters as stable, at best  In terms of consumer   credit charge-offs, they think they’re at or close to the worst, at least in dollar terms, if not in   percentages, on credit card and auto loans But they don’t see any dramatic improvement from   there, rather just a gradual pull back from current levels that are at historic highs   The same holds true for early-stage delinquencies on residential mortgages, which are   now displaying their historic correlations with new claims rather than with overall   unemployment, but the picture is a lot murkier for later-stage delinquencies  Frankly, the   systems were never designed to track modifications, foreclosure moratoriums, partial     September 22–23, 2009 119 of 212  payments—all of the things that are going on in the already delinquent loans  So nobody seems   quite sure, but most expect that the picture will be clearer by mid- to late 2010 and no sooner, as   the bankers and servicers improve their processes for modifications and short sales, while   foreclosure and real estate liquidation backlogs clear   Commercial real estate is still the big wild card, and at this point the losses on residential   construction and land development loans are beginning at least to track the carrying values, and   the book value of the remaining assets is very low  There was, interestingly, some reported   interest from the large national builders in finished lots in selected geographies, particularly   Southern California and Texas and even a little bit in Las Vegas, and stated interest in land for   development in 2011, but all at very low prices  The weakest areas for construction loans are   Florida, Arizona, and Nevada, with Florida reported as having the longest probable time for   recovery Income-producing properties are showing signs of stress, with rising vacancies and   rent renegotiations, but most still view this stress as primarily driven by economic fundamentals   rather than widespread overbuilding  Hospitality is faring the worst, followed by retail and then   industrial Office properties are holding up remarkably well, as are multifamily residences   Losses on owner-occupied properties are tracking at fractions of the loss levels that were   assumed in the stress test, and every single banker asserts that credit decisions for new and   troubled credit are being driven over concern on regulatory classifications, regulatory   classifications to capital, and examiner pressure  Bankers are reluctant to take any action that’s   going to require them to raise additional capital, which is available to them in varying degrees,   but uniformly expensive   In terms of forecasting, I have difficulty determining the degree to which the level of   credit restraint that’s baked into the Greenbook forecast matches the current banker mindset  But           September 22–23, 2009 120 of 212  I have a hard time constructing a scenario where consumer spending returns with any vigor,   given the weak appetite for risk and the high level of credit impairment   Bankers are talking about their desire to lend only to prime borrowers, but the population   of subprime borrowers continues to grow  Households with credit scores considered to be   subprime has increased from 28 percent of the population at the peak in 2006 to nearly 36   percent  In terms of absolute numbers, the number of subprime borrowers grew from 63 million   to 80 million at the end of 2008, and this is before factoring in changes in income, wealth, or   collateral values, which don’t necessarily track where the population of subprime is found    Banks report total unused commitments are down $1½ trillion from the peak, with $1 trillion of   that in credit card availability  New credit card solicitations are down from a peak of 800,000   per month to 150,000 per month, with subprime down 85 percent     The same credit impairment factors are also likely to influence the housing rebound    Given the expectation that high losses in the construction portfolio are going to continue into   next year, as will the intense regulatory scrutiny, banks’ willingness to lend for residential   construction is especially low Most of the sales in new construction are reportedly in low-end   products, and banks forecast that they won’t work through their backlog until mid-2010   We’ve talked about improvement in financial markets, but nothing has been done to   reconstruct the housing finance system or residential mortgage securitization outside of   extraordinary government support  As yet, there is not even the beginning of a consensus around   the requirements for new private securitizations, while accounting changes seem to be creating   new barriers The first-time homebuyer credit is set to expire, and support for renewing it so far   appears tepid The Administration has announced that it will not have a proposal about the   future of the GSEs until early next year, and it is apparently approaching this as a full discussion              September 22–23, 2009 121 of 212  of the proper role of government in housing finance  The FHA is reportedly coming close to its   minimum reserve level  Its loan volume has spiked as private subprime retreated  So it wouldn’t   be unreasonable to expect higher losses with that increase in volume  Finally, our purchase of   agency MBS is likely going to come to an end at least by the end of the first quarter   With all of these headwinds coming into play, I can envision a good case for actually   extending our purchases and even expanding the size to get into the second quarter, as all of   these supports are removed from the housing market  At the same time, I’m concerned that   neither we nor the banks know yet how big an impact the addition of another $600 to $800   billion in reserves is likely to have The big run-up in reserves actually occurred last fall when   banks were scrambling for liquidity, and they really viewed it as their own decision to take on   additional liquidity, not our decision to put the liquidity there  Since then, the aggregate reserves   have fluctuated in a fairly narrow band as new asset purchases were offset with reduced   borrowing So discussions with smaller banks paint a picture similar to what was found by staff   in consultation with the larger institutions—they haven’t focused on the reserves, but they report   that they have more deposits than they can profitably invest and, therefore, are reducing their   managed liabilities  Rates paid on deposits are being reduced, and deposit competition appears   benign I would also point out that, at 25 basis points, reserves are the most attractive short-term   risk-free asset for banks to hold   With the Treasury’s planned SFP drawdown, settlements of prior purchases as well as   new purchases, banks are going to see substantial and unexpected increases in their reserve   balances very soon, and most bankers are not focused on the aggregate reserves in the system    To bankers, this is just going to look like excess liquidity, and the only way to deal with excess   liquidity is either to buy riskier assets or reduce liabilities  Given the credit situation, I expect     September 22–23, 2009 122 of 212  the bankers to shed liabilities, likely leading to shrinkage similar to that described by President   Rosengren in the Japanese banks Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Everybody around this table has more   experience with these issues than I do—     —but I’m struck as I look at the statements and as I listen to the discussion   that it sounds like we’re doing one smooth maneuver that has been the same over a period of   time when the underlying dynamics are really very different  I would agree with President   Lacker that the purchases of the MBS and the support of the housing markets has been smooth,   has acted as a substitute for the financial markets that haven’t yet restarted  But, on the other   hand, the waxing and waning of programs on the asset side of the balance sheet are going to   result in bursts of quantitative easing in the form of reserves, and we’re just beginning to see   that Given my impression that reserves are currently at desired levels, I think that it will result   in some lowering of interest rates  I would disagree with Governor Kohn on that, and then   disagree with President Lacker and agree with President Yellen that this is not necessarily a bad   thing, that it’s probably warranted by the conditions that we are facing  Also, I would point out   that while the TALF is supporting lending, on the one hand, our regulatory policies are generally   acting to restrict credit, on the other, so those two things are working at cross-purposes, perhaps     September 22–23, 2009 170 of 212  With all of these different things going on, I have difficulty weighing the relative impact   of each one on the final outcomes, but I do remain concerned that on balance we’re going to see   too little credit availability leading to too much saving and a slower recovery than we would like    So I do support alternative B I think through tapering we actually are likely to learn a little bit   more about the effects of stock versus flow, as well as about the bank response to this second big   tranch of reserves coming in, so it certainly would be possible in the future to argue for an   extension into the second quarter, but I’m not sure whether that would be through more gradual   tapering or through an increase in the purchases I think it just depends on how those develop   In keeping with my banker roots, I do find paragraph 1 awfully rosy compared with the   reservations that were expressed in the policy round, but I don’t have any changes to offer   I would delete the “up to” language, but, again, I’m not sure I’m terribly strongly in favor   of that; I would probably also use the first quarter, again, saying that in the future I may prefer   the second quarter Thank you     Just a response to President Plosser  I think from the standpoint that the   smaller banks would be the ones that would tend to use these term deposits the most, and they        November 3–4, 2009 46 of 201  would be unlikely to use them if there were no way to get out of them in an emergency situation    So they just need some way to reverse it  It wouldn’t necessarily be a pricing piece—in other   words, there is a penalty to do it But as long as they know they could reverse, then they would   be likely to use it    Yes I think the difference is the decisionmaking of an individual   institution versus the aggregate, and so you have to set up something whereby the individual   institution can make that choice   Thank you, Mr Chairman  None of the bankers that I talked with were   particularly optimistic, but as I went back and looked at all of the responses together, I was actually   a bit more optimistic [Laughter]  Buried in these bleak third-quarter earnings were actually a   couple of positives The margins are higher because of lower deposit rates and better loan spreads,   they’re earning record mortgage-loan originations, and expense-reduction efforts are beginning to   pay off All of these positives are being offset by high credit costs and reserve levels that are   overshadowing their positive nature  They describe their credit cost as approaching a plateau rather   than a peak Auto loans are actually looking quite a bit stronger  Credit card losses are stabilizing   but will remain at high levels  They believe they are three to six months away from a slowdown in   new mortgage and home equity delinquencies with four to six months after that to begin actually   working the levels down  But they are cautiously optimistic that the ultimate losses will not be as   high as the more stressed scenarios had indicated, and most of the built-in nonaccruals are now   coming from income-producing real estate, which take longer to work out but tend to have less   severity of loss   The residential real estate market is actually showing real signs of firming  Inventories are   in better shape, approaching the six-month level, which indicates balance, the existing home   inventories at 7¼ months’ supply, and new home inventories at 7½ months  Supplies are probably   even more sharply stratified by price point  One bank had looked at it in its market  Houses over   $1 million had a 5-year supply; from $500,000 to $1 million, a 30-month supply; and under                     November 3–4, 2009 110 of 201  $500,000, a 5-month supply  And while the price points will be different in different markets, I   think the fundamentals are conceptually the same   Property is moving when it comes into OREO  Current buyers are both investors and   owner–occupiers with an estimate of first-time homebuyers making up about 20 percent  The   investors who are buying judge the bottom of the market by time on the market, number of offers,   and the sales price to the asking price, and all of these are currently signaling a bottom  I heard   some complaints when I was in California that the banks were taking cash offers at less than offers   from owner–occupiers who needed financing  One large servicer said that loan investors did   originally have a preference for cash offers because of concerns about the loans closing; but this is   changing, and now they’re looking for the best offer     The Greenbook forecast for house prices includes more price softening in anticipation of a   spike in foreclosure inventories, but there is at least the possibility that we won’t see a spike, just a   steady supply  The pace of foreclosure activity actually varies by firms, given their modification   strategies and their capabilities  It also varies based on the foreclosure laws in various geographies,   with judicial foreclosure states lagging, and it varies based on market  Some of the hardest-hit   markets are actually seeing the most firming, with Florida being the clear outlier and likely to be a   black hole for some time to come   Even residential construction is improving  The large regionals have worked their balances   down 70 to 80 percent  Properties that had no buyers before are now moving  There are some   reports of better pricing and other reports of stable pricing but more buyers  And whereas the last   time there were a couple of reports of lot sales, now there are widespread reports of lot sales for   entry-level product                             November 3–4, 2009 111 of 201  The income-producing property front is still deteriorating, with a notable recent   deterioration in multifamily  They expect higher nonperformers but lower loss severity and point   out that, when you have cash flow, you at least have options for workout  Also, the distress is due   to economic fundamentals rather than overbuilding  The new CRE guidance will help, but in my   opinion it does not go far enough  The classification analysis does start with determination of debt-  service capability rather than collateral value; requires a write-down of the loan to the collateral   value less selling expenses whenever the debt service is insufficient, but only when it is insufficient;   and recognizes that cash flow from income-producing properties might fully support some portion   of the loan  But it permits the portion to be graded as a pass only if the bank has formally   restructured the loan into two parts, a good loan and a bad loan  I believe that banks would be more   willing to make new loans and renew or extend existing loans if the classification system were   driven by underlying economics rather than the contractual terms of the loans   I asked all the banks about their excess reserve positions  All were net positive cash, and   most were happy with the current level and proud of their efforts to get there  When asked what   actions they might take if they wanted to reduce the position, they said that they would bid less for   deposits, and several would reduce public funds  Some would buy agency and agency MBS,   although several expressed concern about what happens when we exit, and none would grow loans    Several expressed uncertainty about the level of demand deposits when the FDIC unlimited   guaranty expires, and most are intentionally shrinking the bank in the face of uncertainty about   capital   Capital is available, but expensive, with larger banks generally available, midsize banks on   and off, and small banks very difficult  One bank had raised part of the money needed for TARP   repayment and elected to keep the rest of their TARP funds rather than take the extreme level of                       November 3–4, 2009 112 of 201  dilution it would require to fully repay  They are uncertain about what future capital requirements   might look like and uncertain about what will be likely to count as capital  And while they are   concerned about credit risk, their willingness to make new loans is driven at least in part by   regulatory considerations  They’ll take only pristine credits, customers that they want for the long   term, not solving immediate problems  They’re looking for relationships, and they’re particularly   concerned about examiner downgrades  You could have an argument about whether the examiners   are being overly tough or the bankers are being overly optimistic, but there does appear to be a   disconnect in their view of the appropriate loan grades  In the SNC portfolio, the staff reported that   the banks and examiners generally identified the same loans as having weaknesses, but the   examiners graded those loans lower than the banks  The investment banks had much higher   downgrades, with the examiners feeling that they could estimate credit agency ratings much more   accurately than exam ratings   Faced with the new credit card law, they had a sharp decline in solicitations  The “go to”   rate on new solicitations is 300 basis points in relation to prime, higher than it was before the new   law, although the reduction in available credit may be misleading  One bank insisted that most were   inactive cards  Smaller banks are concerned about the new HOEPA rules, with 6½ percent now a   high-priced loan, which means they can’t do balloon payments and they have no capability of   escrowing taxes and insurance  So they are reporting that they’re going to have to quit making   those loans  In summary, we could see improvement in loan performance next year, but we are a   very long way off from a recovery in bank lending  Thank you, Mr Chairman   Thank you, Mr Chairman  I would like first to pile a little onto Governor   Warsh’s comments about the mortgage-backed securities market  The financial improvement does   not extend to mortgage instruments  As recently as the last meeting I was concerned that the lack of   a housing finance system would require our continued purchase of the MBS even beyond the first   quarter of next year  I’ve thought about this a lot in the intermeeting period, and I’ve come to the   conclusion that, just as we found with the TALF, there are some markets that our tools can’t fix  I   don’t see how our economy fully recovers without the true resolution of Fannie and Freddie and   clarity in the role of government in housing finance and the structure of private-label loan   securitizations  In my opinion, it is much more important than homebuyer tax credits, but I don’t   think either our continued purchase or holding of these securities can substitute for such a policy    With that, I would like to agree with President Evans in his comments, particularly his agreement   with President Yellen and Governor Kohn, and support alternative B     Thank you, Mr Chairman  In general, the bankers are looking for some   sign of the top in their credit deterioration, and, with the exception of CRE, everybody seems to   feel like it is just around the corner, that they are very close, but nobody can support it yet with   any real evidence They expect that the nonperformers will peak in 2010 and charge-offs will   peak in late 2010 or early 2011   Every banker I spoke with—probably because they were just coming out of or still   wrestling with their 2010 profit planning—was focused on the need to find loans in order to   generate income  They said that the loans that they’re currently booking are of high quality    Pricing actually has gone from being great to being simply good  There’s widespread use of   interest rate floors, and they’re beginning to see some competition both in rates and in terms    Most are reluctant to add any mortgage-backed securities to their investment portfolios because   they’re afraid of what happens when we stop buying or when we sell  And a number of them are   actually harvesting gains in their existing portfolio, because those gains are a significant part of   their capital and they need to lock them up Transaction volume is shifting heavily from credit   cards to debit cards, and total transaction volume is up, while the average ticket is down,   indicating that consumers are spending from money that they have rather than money that they’re   borrowing   On the regulatory front, a number of them reported examiners not willing to follow the   new CRE guidance The reports to me were all about FDIC and OCC examiners, and they’re   singularly unwilling to use any appeals process or ombudsman to talk about this with those   regulators None of them mentioned Federal Reserve examiners, and we could assume from that   that there were no Federal Reserve examiners who were unwilling to follow the guidance, but I           December 15–16, 2009 86 of 247  think it would probably be better if we were vigilant with our own troops as well  On the new   overdraft rules, I talked to one bank that has estimated a 15 to 20 percent hit to earnings per share   and has calculated that in the past the cost of providing checking accounts has been increasingly   covered by overdraft fees, which led to a proliferation of free checking  In order to reverse this   to accommodate the new overdraft rules, the breakeven for checking accounts is likely to be   somewhere around $10 per month per account   I’ve been struck by the sharp decline in cost and the increase in availability of credit in   the debt markets while the opposite seems to be happening in credit provided through banks  So   I took a look at loan volumes and found a very different story for the large versus the small   banks The larger banks typically have mortgage, credit card, large business, middle-market   lending The top 25 banks have 70 percent of the C&I loans, 73 percent of the mortgages, and   80 percent of the card debt  They have made extensive use of Fed facilities, Federal Home Loan   Bank, and FDIC guaranteed debt, and they’re much further along in emerging from the financial   crisis They do have access to capital markets and have repaid or are planning to repay their   TARP   In contrast, the problems for small banks started later and are still building  They have   big construction and CRE portfolios In fact, 60 percent of the total CRE loans outstanding are   in the smaller banks  They have 30 percent of the C&I loans, although those loans are   predominantly to small businesses  They fund through deposits, Federal Home Loan Banks,   CDARS, and brokered deposits  They have limited access to capital, and many of those who did   not get TARP, either because they were not allowed to or because they elected not to, now wish   they had it as they work through this CRE cycle and are finding problems        December 15–16, 2009 87 of 247  Given the sharp reduction in bank lending, I took a look at loan balances in the third   quarter of 2009 compared with year-end 2007  While banks of all sizes have reduced loans, the   big reduction has been in the top 20 banks that are just below the top five For the top five, loans   are down just under 2 percent For the next 20, loans are down more than 10 percent, and for all   others, loans are down about 2½ percent So there’s a real concentration in those 20  Inside of   commercial real estate, the construction land development, where the portfolios have been hit the   hardest, are down 25 percent in banks below the top five, while loans on existing nonresidential   real estate are actually up across the board   Finally, I decided to focus on the two politically hot categories, mortgage modifications   and small business  To size the mortgage modification problem, 57 million mortgages are now   60 days past due with 23 million in the process of foreclosure, roughly equivalent to a year’s   sales of existing homes  I talked to one large lender servicer who was able to give me some   breakdown in the HAMP He said 20 percent are not owner-occupied, 20 percent have less than   31 percent DTI, and 20 percent don’t qualify for other reasons; 10 percent are underemployed or   unemployed  Of the remaining 30 percent, half don’t accept the offer  Banks were encouraged   to get the numbers up by putting people in trial modifications and then gathering the   documentation during the trial period  Of those who have made their payments, one-third have   submitted all of their documents, one-third have presented partial documents, and one-third have   submitted no documents   The banks are still modifying many loans outside of HAMP, but the loans previously   modified are re-defaulting, and rising unemployment is working against them  The clock is still   ticking Banks are now formalizing and streamlining short-sale processes and investing in   staffing systems and training, but we’re still likely to see three to four million foreclosures               December 15–16, 2009 88 of 247  However, they will be spaced out over two to three years due to all of the foreclosure prevention   efforts, the timing of re-defaults, judicial foreclosure processes, and staffing issues   On the new loan front, Fannie Mae has now raised cutoff FICO scores for even 80   percent mortgages, which would potentially affect as many as 30 million borrowers  The FHA is   studying both FICO and downpayment requirements  So even in the government-supported   space, term tightening continues   Turning to small business lending, in the NFIB survey, 15 percent said credit was more   difficult to obtain, which compares with a 12 percent level in 1990  But only 5 percent ranked   credit as their most important problem—it is well behind weak sales at 33 percent, taxes at 20   percent, government regulations and red tape at 13 percent, and even the cost and availability of   insurance at 8 percent   Our data on small businesses was last done in 2003, but at that point we estimated that   only 1 percent of small business borrowing comes from the SBA  With the SBA, the expanded   loan guarantee program is now out of money  Changes were made to increase the guarantee to   90 percent with a maximum loan size of 1½ percent and allow refinancing of existing credit    There is a House bill that would extend the program and increase loan sizes  As you might   expect, commercial banks are the primary providers of credit, supplying two-thirds of the total   credit, but, of that, approximately 40 percent are borrowed under a commercial mortgage  The   smaller banks usually underwrite them individually, but they take some form of collateral,   preferably real estate, to compensate for less reliable financial statements, the mixing of personal   and business assets, and low capitalization So I would estimate that at least half of the   commercial real estate and more than 90 percent of the C&I loans in the smaller banks are small   business loans Larger banks are underwriting centrally using credit-scoring models and moving           December 15–16, 2009 89 of 247  to limit local overrides  They’re reporting losses similar to unsecured consumer credit, and the   larger credit card issuers have now designed business card products to work like a traditional line   of credit, but they’re concerned about the prospect of business lines coming under the same   restrictions as consumer credit   We hear so much about businesses failing due to lack of credit  I tried to find data on the   rate of business failure One bank had researched its own experience and found, to its surprise,   that the rate of business failure was not substantially different from earlier cycles  They have   hypothesized that low rates have allowed businesses to hang on longer  So the small business   job formation problem appears likely to be a new business formation, with new businesses   usually funded with personal borrowing and funds from family and friends rather than bank   credit Given widespread balance sheet impairment, I suspect new business formation to be quite   low While SBA programs might help on the margin, I concluded that the best assistance for   small businesses comes from low interest rates, enforcement of CRE guidelines, and improving   consumer wealth  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I, too, support alternative B  I am worried that   the backup in mortgage rates as the purchases wind down could be on the high side of   projections, primarily because I’m concerned about who might emerge as the substitute buyer    The Treasury programs and the GSEs are approaching the point where they need to reduce their   portfolio holdings  My conversations with bankers indicate that they’re completely unwilling to   purchase mortgage-backed securities without knowing exactly what’s going to happen with our   purchases and with potential sales So considering President Kocherlakota’s—I can say it, too—   suggestion in that light, I think we should talk a little bit about what we might do on sales and the           December 15–16, 2009 130 of 247  composition of the portfolio  But I wonder if changing it without any further clarity on that   might not cause even more concern over purchasing MBS   Second, even if we find ourselves in a position where we’d like to provide more stimulus,   it’s not clear to me that the last couple hundred billion reserves have really made an awful lot of   difference At the same time, if we resume purchasing the mortgage-backed securities, it would   make it even easier politically to push resolution of the GSEs even further into the future  And I   firmly believe that the emergence of the GSEs from conservatorship, just as many of the larger   financial institutions are coming out of government assistance, and determining what future they   might have are going to be prerequisites for the restart of private mortgage markets  I don’t see   how housing markets return to normal without the full spectrum of housing finance   Third, the role of TALF in CMBS—it seems to me that, with the newly issued CMBS,   the first new deal that came to market was so conservatively underwritten and had so much   investor protection in order to be able to qualify for TALF that that was the very reason that it   attracted the investor interest that it did  And I would hope that that process would actually be   able to continue through the next six months, and I’m uncertain that we could do more past June    So I’m not as worried about that one ending in June  And I fervently wish we had been able to   do the same thing for residential mortgage-backed securities  Thank you, Mr Chairman     I run the risk here of demonstrating that I’m totally confused on this, but we   weren’t paying interest on reserves when we started lowering these spreads, were we?    How did those two go together, and when did the interbank fed funds   market begin to disappear?  My question is, Is there a possibility that some rate will be necessary   to induce banks to lend to each other?  In other words, the 25 basis points are certainly not at this   point enough to induce banks to lend to each other  So it may not be an incentive to leave the   market so much as an incentive for somebody else to enter the market and offer to lend those   funds at a cheaper rate    Well, I am talking about the spread on it  For instance, if a bank can sell   unlimited funds to us at 25 basis points, at what rate are they willing to sell them to another   bank?  Where do they have to bid it to be able to borrow from other banks?  At this point, the   banks are not lending to each other, correct?  They are borrowing from us, and they are lending   to us, but not to each other    Okay  Thank you    Yes  The only condition I can see where we actually have a fed funds rate   is when they are actively lending to one another  Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Like everybody else here, I look forward to the   day we can normalize operations  In fact, having joined this Committee in August 2008, I have a   personal objective of experiencing normal here at the Federal Reserve  [Laughter]  So with that,   I think returning the primary credit rate to normal and the communication strategy that has been   outlined is the way to go  It’s important that we tie the primary credit rate to closing the liquidity   January 26–27, 2010 85 of 260    facilities and make raising this rate effectively closing that as an emergency tool as well  When I   was a banker, I always likened borrowing from the Federal Reserve as borrowing from my   father  And I think we need to return to that sort of a stance  So whether that is a 50 basis point   spread or a 100 basis point spread, I think we need to decide before we make that move, because   if we make a quarter move and then a month or two later we decide, no, we want another quarter   and we want to spread that, it becomes much more difficult to communicate that it is a liquidity   action rather than an interest rate action   When I think about normalizing,—I moved to question 7—I think we need to think about   our longer-run operating strategy sooner rather than later  As we have talked about long-run and   temporary draining tools and what those really mean, I look at these projections, and they show   us with a very large balance sheet for a very long time  So it seems to me that the long run is that   time period when we are showing right now a projection of a large balance sheet   On question 6, I am concerned about the federal funds rate as an operating target  It’s not   clear to me yet what set of conditions leads to a restart of the federal funds market beyond this   GSE market  And I think we need to have some thoughts about or be prepared for at least a   temporary state where there really is no fed funds market  So we need some way to   communicate what our targets are that don’t depend on there being such a market, although I was   encouraged to hear Governor Kohn say that the market would come back  For all of those   reasons, I am in favor of the least disruptive ways to reduce our balance sheet as quickly as   possible   As for question 2, I would start with redeeming all agency debt, MBS, and Treasury   securities  I think we need to communicate our intention for this large MBS and agency   portfolio that we have, and we need to start that communication with the end of the purchases    January 26–27, 2010 86 of 260    At some point—maybe not immediately—we need to make a commitment to exit the MBS and   agency portfolio through both maturities payments and gradual sales  This leads me to question   5, where my preference is for all Treasuries  Finally, I would favor the use of draining tools   prior to raising the rate of interest on excess reserves  Thank you, Mr Chairman    You’re going to have to hustle  [Laughter]    Thank you, Mr Chairman  The best news I have to report is that, in the   banking community, the managers are increasingly talking about how to put more loans on their   books rather than collection prospects for the loans that they already have  But I’ll talk first   about credit quality   I expect credit costs in 2010 to be just about the same as in 2009  Consumer and credit   card delinquencies and charge-offs have peaked but remain elevated  Peaks in the first mortgage   and home equity portfolios are a few quarters away but definitely in sight, and commercial real   estate problems will grow but still appear manageable  Construction and land development   portfolios, where the biggest losses have been, are sharply reduced as loans have been sold off,   paid off, or charged off; and virtually all of the reduction in commercial real estate portfolios has   come in construction and land development loans  The market for problem assets continues to   improve as the prospects for massive fire sales fade  There are more bidders—going from one or   January 26–27, 2010 156 of 260    two to eight to ten—and the bidders are strategic and crowding out the speculative funds and the   flippers  Prices are firming, and the banks report that their marks are holding up   Foreclosure-mitigation efforts continue  The HAMP permanent modifications are still   very low as fewer and fewer borrowers remain after each step in the process, but the picture is   better than the headline, as many of those who fall out of the HAMP process still get some kind   of modification from the institutions  A number of banks are now offering their own principal-  reduction plans  Increasingly, though, borrowers go delinquent because they have lost their jobs    Modifications are nearly impossible without income  In such cases, the banks are formalizing   programs for short sales that include deeds in lieu of foreclosure if the short sale doesn’t   materialize as part of the agreement  But none of these programs works if there are junior liens    Finally, banks report no problem managing the flow of OREO  In fact, OREO inventories are   down a bit  So the bankers seem increasingly confident that they have the programs in place to   ultimately work through loan problems, and now they realize that they need to produce some   earning assets in order to maintain income   But even as they claim to be focused on loan production, it’s hard to come up with a   plausible story for how lending starts to grow again  I first tried to build the story from the   bottom up by looking at individual loan categories  Commercial real estate lending and, in   particular, construction lending will be limited by regulatory guidance and the banks’ own very   dire loss experience  Residential construction loans have been worked down 43 percent from   their peak at the end of 2007  In residential construction, the builders who survived are very   conservative  The lenders who survived are still using highly restrictive terms  Products are   being reengineered to a much lower price point, and the smaller builders have been financed by   smaller banks  Many of those have not survived or have sharply curtailed their construction   January 26–27, 2010 157 of 260    lending  So I would bet on CRE being flat or down for the next two years, and I don’t see any   willingness to fund the level of housing starts that is forecast in the Greenbook   Regarding consumer lending, which is more concentrated in the larger banks, subprime   borrowers are an increasing fraction of the population, and they have very few borrowing   options  Right now no mortgages and no unsecured loans are being offered; some auto  There is   no outlet for private mortgage securitization  Fannie, Freddie, and FHA are all tightening their   terms  Revolving home equity lending is flat, and amortizing junior lien balances are falling    The credit card business model has been completely changed  New card competition, if you look   in your mailboxes, has moved from teaser rates to point bonuses and airline cards in an effort to   attract transactors, those who create interchange income but tend not to carry balances    Portfolios are shrinking because of discontinued business lines and products, charge-offs, and   voluntary attrition, and pricing is moving to more up-front APR and higher fees  Auto lending is   the only sector of consumer lending that is really recovering and the only place where the   subprime borrower can still get credit  So consumer lending does not seem the place to look for   growth to resume   The only real bright spot is in C&I lending, where much of the drop in funded volume   has come from demand rather than supply  Every banker says that utilization rates of existing   credit lines are at record lows and still falling, and these are loans that are already approved and   attractively priced  Banks are chasing C&I loans primarily at the high end of the credit-quality   spectrum and in segments and sectors of the economy that have improving outlooks  They are   trying to improve small business credit availability despite higher charge-off rates  Some of this   is due to political optics, if nothing else, but they are using balance sheet goals, second-look   programs, beefing up guaranteed lending through the SBA  In addition, as the economy   January 26–27, 2010 158 of 260    improves, the larger company credit availability will in some measure pass through to smaller   companies in the form of trade credit to assist suppliers or those who sell the company’s   products  But it is going to take an awful lot of C&I volume to fill the hole left by real estate and   consumer   So I tried to look from the top down to see where the push might be, and here I will echo   both of my last two colleagues  On a more macro level, banks are shrinking assets generally and   the loan book in particular in the context of their uncertainty about capital requirements, capital   costs and availability, liquidity requirements, and accounting changes  The cost of funding   continues to grow, with FDIC assessments and the proposed financial crisis responsibility fee    The proposal is for a 15 basis point fee on total assets less tier 1 capital and the deposit subject to   FDIC assessment  For comparison, the FDIC assessment base rate is 12 to 16 basis points, and   there is still an old FICO bond assessment left over from the S&L crisis that is a little over   1 basis point  There is the transaction guarantee fee for demand deposit accounts  Risk   category 1 banks pay 15 basis points, although many large banks—Chase, Bank of America,   Wells, Goldman, Bank of New York, Sun Trust, and BB&T, for example—opted out  Whenever   a fee is assessed on assets or liabilities, based on my experience from the 23 basis point FDIC   assessment, it does increase your cost of funds  It will be included in the pricing formulas for   both assets and liabilities, and it will affect the minimum required spread for transactions at the   margin  If it applies to the liabilities that are created when securitizations come back on the   balance sheet under FAS 166 and 167, it will increase the cost of securitization; and if passed,   the new fee seems likely to accelerate asset shrinkage, but it could also reduce risk as nondeposit   funding is not advantaged over deposit funding   January 26–27, 2010 159 of 260    All in all, I think the best case would be very slow growth, but the more likely outcome is   continued decline in traditional bank credit for some time  Accounting changes, FDIC proposals   regarding securitized assets, and legislative proposals to haircut secured lending will continue to   weigh on securitizations  There is still no sign of clarity for the future of the GSEs, private   mortgage securitizations, or the mortgage insurance market  So I think credit availability is   going to weigh especially heavily on housing markets and consumer spending  I opted for the   Greenbook forecast, but I was sobered by the results from the “weaker aggregate demand’   scenario which incorporated restrictive credit availability  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I also am in favor of alternative B with the   “purchases” rather than the “holdings” language  Once we have completed our purchases, I do   think it’s going to be important to communicate our intention regarding our holdings, but I think   changing the language now would be confusing  And I prefer the final auction alternative in   paragraph 4  I think that will make our explanation of changes to primary credit easier to   explain  Thank you      Thank you, Mr Chairman  The banker outlook remains pretty much the   same, with credit losses reaching a plateau and loan demand weak  One banker summed it up by   saying, “2010 won’t look better, but it will feel better”  There is a lot of concern about   March 16, 2010 73 of 146    regulatory and supervisory issues, and most are worried about the fragility of the recovery  A   number of them mentioned a double-dip recession as a possibility, but I suspect they may also be   talking about a double peak, because most of them are mainly worried about the unemployment   rate   Given the time frame, I’m going to skip to the residential lending market  Mortgage loan   volume is down  The mortgage bankers speculate that most of the borrowers who can qualify for   a refinance have already done so, and they’re concerned that much of the purchase volume is   driven by the tax credit   In the construction lending area, the builders that remain are still selling off their   inventory at a loss  The new product that’s going up is smaller, with fewer extras but quality   finishes, and at entry-level price points  In some markets, recently built resales and foreclosures   are coming to market at prices lower than the cost to construct them  Most markets have multi-  year inventory of unsold lots, and higher-end new homes and condos are not selling at all, as   they’re very difficult to mortgage  Supply and demand for construction loans is weak, with the   remaining builders and lenders very skittish  Most lending is for contract homes, as lending for   speculative construction requires strong cash investment by the builder, and even model homes   are being financed on an amortizing basis  Given the lending conditions, the price levels, the   mortgage availability, and competition from existing home inventory, I continue to be   pessimistic about any significant pickup in residential construction   In the existing home market, I could not find a single lender that was having any   difficulty moving foreclosed inventory or even one that was deliberately slowing foreclosures to   avoid building inventory  The banks that are selling their REO are seeing strong demand from   investors and foreign buyers and a high proportion of cash sales  So the bottleneck seems to be   March 16, 2010 74 of 146    in the foreclosure process  We’re now two years into various iterations of mortgage   modifications, foreclosure moratoriums, and state legislatures lengthening the legal foreclosure   process  The results for the HAMP are likely to be disappointing  At this point, it looks as if   modifications will be in the hundreds of thousands rather than in the millions  Lenders,   borrowers, and most recently the Administration, are now focused on principal write-downs,   short sales, and deeds in lieu of foreclosure     From the borrower’s perspective, many are now tired of struggling to make payments on   houses that they cannot afford or that have negative equity  So even those who have received a   modification, made all their trial modification payments, and completed all the documentation to   make those modifications permanent, are now hesitating as the prospect of a short sale with the   ability to walk away, rent for a while, and reenter the housing market later, seems to be an   attractive option   For the lenders and servicers, short-sale agreements provide a quicker, less expensive   resolution than foreclosure  Short-sale programs are becoming more formulaic regarding the   price the lender agrees to accept and the fixed time period after which the borrower must turn   over the home through a deed in lieu of foreclosure  Some lenders require income   documentation and perform asset searches to determine whether or not the borrower can actually   pay the loan or a deficiency balance; others do not  Some agreements extinguish the debt   entirely; others don’t  Some provide relocation assistance or cash for keys  I think these   programs have the potential to move us through the problem faster, but probably with more   inventory coming to market and correspondingly lower prices  However, to the extent that   hardship is not documented and deficiencies are not pursued, moral hazard is going to be   exacerbated   March 16, 2010 75 of 146    Finally, home equity loan and other junior claims make all modifications, short sales, and   other foreclosure avoidance programs much more difficult  Those with a strong interest in   modifying first mortgages charge that the junior lienholders are just being selfish and ignoring   their losses  There do seem to be two categories of second liens  First, those that were   originated through indirect channels or as piggyback loans have had very high default rates and   have been written off for the most part  But just because they were written off does not mean the   liens have been released, and those liens become worthless only in foreclosure  So if foreclosure   is taken off the table, those lienholders seem likely to hold out for some payment  The second   group, banks with large portfolios of home equity loans generated through branch offices, report   that approximately 30 percent of their loans are underwater with combined loan-to-value ratios   greater than 100 percent  But of those underwater loans, more than 95 percent are current   A startling number of borrowers are delinquent on their first mortgages but still paying on   their home equity loans  If these loans are modified, the accounting and regulatory rules require   them to be written down to the same value that would be received in foreclosure, and in a short   sale their position is partially or totally wiped out  So these lenders have very little incentive to   come to the table unless foreclosure is imminent   Programs are now being developed to make payments to junior lienholders  Fannie Mae   has a program  The Administration’s HAMP effort has a companion program  Various private   lenders have programs to offer small payments to second lienholders  But getting the holders of   performing loans to accept pennies on the dollar seems unlikely to generate any big participation    None of the current modification programs address unemployed borrowers  Programs are in   development that will include six to nine months of payment forbearance, followed by a   March 16, 2010 76 of 146    modification or a short sale depending on reemployment, but accounting and regulatory rules   again require that these loans be written down to foreclosure value   All in all, it seems likely that the roughly five million loans that are seriously delinquent   or in the process of foreclosure will take at least two to three more years to resolve, and that there   is still a large dollar amount of mortgage debt to be extinguished  Going forward, if mortgages   are to be booked at lower loan-to-value ratios, and those ratios are applied to lower home values   or new homes at lower price points, and lower home ownership rates result in fewer homes being   financed, it seems likely that the volume of mortgage debt outstanding would continue to   contract  Adding to that a debate about the future of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac that won’t   start until next year, a private securitization market that seems unlikely to restart until the role of   government in housing finance is resolved, and the effect on securitization of the interaction of   accounting, skin in the game, and capital proposals, I don’t expect a normal housing market   anywhere in our planning horizon   So while consumer credit is beginning to rebuild slowly—and I do believe C&I lending   will recover with the economy, and nonfarm, nonresidential real estate volumes are likely to be   flat but with better quality— I expect overall lending to stay down as residential construction and   mortgage volumes continue to fall  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  When I look at the Greenbook and the   Bluebook, I can’t find anything that even gives me line of sight to the day when we need to   tighten policy  And so for that reason, I favor alternative B  Nevertheless, I remember the   conversations we had in December of 2008 about the potential for disruptions and dislocations   caused by the near-zero interest rates  If there were a way to somehow get back to that floor of   1 percent and stay there for an extended period, I could be happy with that  But we just don’t   have any framework right now to communicate that   I’m afraid that, with the number of levers we have at our disposal—the reserve-draining   tools, asset sales, interest rates—and the timing and the calibration of each one of those levers,   there are thousands of possible approaches  So it does seem to me pretty critical that we   converge on a plan with the timing and calibration then to be debated inside this room and   announced as part of our statement  And I would be in favor of including the kind of language in   C′ to indicate our consensus once we’ve actually reached a consensus  But it’s difficult to   communicate one that we don’t have   There’s so much uncertainty gripping markets, business people, and consumers right now   that I believe the contour of our policy may be less important than the resolve and the clarity   with which we pursue it  And I think the quality of our communication is more important than   the precision of our calculations  I’m not just talking about the nuances of the statement or what   the phrase “extended period” means to a very sophisticated investor  In fact, I’m afraid we might   March 16, 2010 114 of 146    actually need a plan to communicate how we are going to change our communications    [Laughter]  I’m talking about stating as clearly as possible in our statement our expectations for   the sequencing of exit tools, where we are in that sequencing, and how we will communicate if   those expectations change  Then, I would hope that we could all dedicate ourselves between the   statements to focus on explaining that strategy to the world, what we’re doing, why we’re doing   it, and how we think it will work  Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I favor option 2 for reasons that have already   been pretty well articulated here  I also appreciate, more than I can say, the staff memos  They   were not only helpful, but I don’t know what I would have done to entertain myself this weekend   without them  [Laughter]   April 27–28, 2010 53 of 206                   I did come down to option 2, but I was attracted by option 3  My problem with option 3   was that there seemed to be so much conditionality that it implied that we were going to use two   tools  So it seemed to me a little difficult for both us and for markets to keep up with when we   were using which tool and what we were using it to do  So I came down to option 2   I do think that we should make a movement in the short-term rate first before we start the   asset sales  And I favor redemption of Treasuries, as they reduce the balance sheet size and   would put less pressure on reverse repos and term deposits  I would probably agree with   Governor Kohn that it might make sense to begin or to announce them when we are getting   ready to raise rates  I’m not sure that it is necessary to do it right now versus sometime in the   near future   I would also be interested in a strategy that replaced it with Treasury bills  I thought we   had discussed that six months ago or so, and there were operational difficulties with that  The   reason I particularly liked the redemption of the Treasuries is that we got to a point where we   needed to buy additional Treasuries sooner, and they could have been bills    Finally, on communications, I think we should be absolutely clear to markets about what   our overall intentions are, and then make our own future decisions within those frameworks in   the same way that market participants will make theirs  When we started buying the assets, we   announced that we were going to purchase X assets by Y date  In terms of sales, I think also   announcing that we were going to sell that same body of assets by a date certain would give   everybody something to mark off of  Thank you    Well, I got worried about it from the other direction  If all of these   homeowners are not making payments on their mortgage, then they’re spending that money, and   sooner or later they’re going to have to come to grips with either paying for rent or resuming   payments on their mortgages  Again, someone on your staff calculated that for me, and it was a   very small amount in relation to total spending    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I would remind everybody that my reference   group of bankers includes those that primarily lend directly to people and businesses rather than   those that trade debt, and for that group it is really springtime in the banking business  The   banks’ optimism about the current state of their credit risk showed through in first-quarter   earnings reports  Most did show higher than expected earnings or lower than expected losses,   and, in the banking part of their businesses, higher net interest margins and reserve releases   accounted for the improvement  Even the banks that reported a loss seemed pretty confident   about their path to profitability, as their credit costs are projected to fall below their pre-provision   net revenues generally sometime this year  While most seem pretty confident about their own   April 27–28, 2010 124 of 206                   portfolios, quite a few expressed skepticism about the justification of reserve releases by others    Even the smaller banks reported progress on existing known problem credits  However, they did   report new unexpected problems popping up  Looking ahead, the biggest concerns were   regulatory reform, loan growth, and interest rates rising ahead of economic improvement, putting   new pressure on struggling borrowers   Bank loan balances continue to fall, but the SLOOS data indicate improvement on the   horizon for credit availability  In trying to reconcile my conversations with bankers with the data   in the still falling bank loan balances and measured improvements, I think the banks that reported   easing standards generally cited an improved economic outlook  That optimistic tilt feeds my   belief that credit is going to be available to meet whatever demand develops in the consumer and   the commercial credit space  The limiting condition to this would be the population of   creditworthy borrowers, as that term is normally defined, and credit for real estate loans will lag   significantly behind   Auto loans generally have an average life of 18 to 24 months, so those portfolios are now   dominated by recently underwritten credits with high quality and good spreads  Pricing for used   cars is firm, so the loss severities have declined, and loans are available even to subprime   borrowers  Spreads are declining, and the ABS market seems healthy   In the credit card market, the divergence between responses on credit cards and other   consumer loans seems likely to reflect level re-setting in response to the CARD act  Solicitations   for new cards are up from the low seen in 2009, and this holds true for all income levels and to a   lesser extent even to those with lower credit scores  However, the response rates to those   solicitations are down, and the issuers report low attrition rates and continued paydowns, so that   there is likely less movement between card issuers  Terms offered in the solicitations are likely   April 27–28, 2010 125 of 206                   to be somewhat jumpy as issuers experiment with new offers and new business models  Charge-  off rates react very quickly in credit cards, because there’s no collateral to liquidate and the   regulations require charge-offs at specific stages of delinquency  So I would expect competition   for high-quality customers with high profit behavior to pick up quite rapidly  And funding is still   very available   Turning to commercial loans, the story seems driven entirely by demand from   creditworthy customers  With the exception of some loans to small businesses, loss rates on   these loans did not climb, so ongoing losses are not a factor  About half of the banks report that   the customers they talk to are very cautious and waiting for signs of revenue durability before   they will make moves  Others report a lot of conversation about spending plans but complain   that so far there has been no actual movement of money  All expect to see a reduction in the   unusually high deposit balances before a return of loan demand, and almost every bank continues   to complain about very low and declining line utilization  They point out that a substantial   amount of bank debt has been refinanced in credit markets or paid down from internal cash, and   competition is driving down spreads and easing terms  This phenomenon is moving down the   size spectrum as firms see competition from debt markets in very weak demand  Second look   programs are common for small businesses and slightly larger companies  Banks are competing   for customers and looking for the balances to come later, with credit still expensive for weaker   companies  And credit is quite scarce in the lower end of the asset base, as many lenders failed   and others pulled back   All conversations about mortgage lending get muddled up with political considerations,   from loan modifications to principal write-downs to GSEs  A fair number of loans were   refinanced last year, but that seems to be coming to a halt, as most borrowers who are eligible   April 27–28, 2010 126 of 206                   and for whom refinance was advantageous have now already refinanced  Purchase mortgage   originations are at very low levels  Originations of home equity loans are only about a half to a   third of what they were at the peak, depending on the bank, and there are still no signs of loans   exiting the delinquency pipeline  New discussions on principal reductions on underwater   mortgages actually have the potential to attract more defaults   Commercial real estate, which generally gets the worst rap of all, seems to me likely to   cycle through before the residential piece, as it remains out of the political spotlight and sensitive   to an improving economy  While delinquencies continue to increase, unlike the case of the   residential pipeline, bankers report that this is due to new delinquencies coming in as older   delinquencies are resolved  A significant amount of debt has been reduced through loan sales,   foreclosures, refinances, and some paydowns, and the loss severities are stabilizing as the real   estate fundamentals, such as sales, prices, rents, and vacancies show signs of stability at weak   levels  Very little new supply is coming on line, which should benefit existing properties as   economic conditions strengthen and absorption improves   The outlier here is residential construction  With the exception of entry-level housing   and some deeply discounted lots, inventory is not moving  New lending is scarce and made to   strong capitalized builders with cash equity at more expensive terms  The builders are anxious to   continue to make interest-only payments in hope that prices will recover, and their lenders are   equally anxious to let them  However, regulators have been unwilling to play along  While   credit is likely to be scarce in this market for some time, the demand for new houses at a price   that exceeds the cost of construction may also lag  Meanwhile banks with large homebuilder   portfolios will continue to fail  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I also favor alternative B  I have to say I am   sad to note that this is the last time I can shorten my remarks by piggybacking onto the reasons   that were cited by Governor Kohn, and I’ll have to come up with my own reasons in the future   April 27–28, 2010 165 of 206                   My banking experience has taught me that execution does matter and that strong   execution of an okay plan is actually better than weak execution of a great plan  So I would   reiterate rather than repeat my comments from the last meeting and join Governor Warsh in   saying that the clarity and consistency of our communication is, in my mind, every bit as   important as the ultimate policy path that we choose  I would also agree with President   Kocherlakota that once we’ve reached a consensus, we should put it in our statement very   clearly  But I don’t think we should put it in there until we’ve reached a consensus, so I don’t   think we should do it now   Finally, with the situation in Europe, markets have plenty to wonder about and speculate   about, so this is certainly not a time for us to add something else for them to chew on  Governor   Tarullo has now taught me to count the red words on the page, so in order to get down to the   appropriate number of red words, I would leave out paragraph 4  Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I fully support giving you the authority to open   the swap lines, subject to the conditions you outlined  I think we have to take the right actions   for the economy, and, frankly, the fact that we have to discuss the political risk underscores the   seriousness of the GAO audit provision  I do have a little bit of a faint hope—there are some   lawmakers that were supporting the GAO audit issue, not so much because they thought it was a   great idea but because they didn’t see the harm in it  And, while it can’t go in Michelle’s   statement, I think that this is an opportunity for some one-on-one conversations to use this as an   illustration of how important it is that we be able to take the right action and to take it quickly,   without concern about political interference  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  First of all, I think we run the risk of getting a   little too cute in what we’re trying to do  It’s my belief that, in execution, consistency is a   strength  Given the communication challenges that we face, I think consistency is even more   important for us than would normally be the case   Starting with asset sales, I think we should have a reason to revisit the conversation we   had last time rather than having this constant tug of war with one side or the other making   marginal progress at any given meeting   With that said, in terms of the swap, I think our policy decision was to purchase MBS  It   wasn’t to purchase specific coupons, and risking a communication problem for $9 billion just   doesn’t make any sense to me   On the Treasury redemptions, I strongly favor option 2, with the caveat that there be   enough time for it to be well communicated  We have said that we want to return to a more   normal portfolio composition, and I think that should also apply to the maturity structure and the   duration within the Treasury portfolio  Option 1 basically never exits from the $300 billion   Treasury LSAP—it mainly exits from our old position  Option 3 presented challenges of   execution in the secondary market  So I particularly like option 2  I view option 2 as sort of the   equivalent of gradually letting MBS roll off, in that it’s a gradual and incremental type of   strategy  It would give us future flexibility at a time when we might really need it, and it would   reduce the political risk of large, unrealized, or potentially realized losses as rates increase  I   don’t think this is a sudden decision  We’ve had the discussion of what to do about Treasuries at   least three times, by my count, and we’ve been talking about it just as long as we’ve been talking   about the exit  I think if we wait for the perfect time to address the duration in the portfolio, then   the actions that are required to do so might be even more disruptive to markets  Option 2 seems   June 22–23, 2010 51 of 213             to me the easiest strategy to communicate, and while markets might not be expecting it now, it   would be easy to change that expectation  As Brian points out, one reason that markets might   not expect options 2 or 3 is that they just haven’t thought about it, so if we gave them a chance to   think about it, it might make sense   Finally, to the independence question, it seems to me that option 1 totally relinquishes our   independence, because we’re buying whatever Treasury wants to sell  Thank you, Mr   Chairman    No—I think we ought to stay with what we did last time    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Interestingly, while conditions in financial   markets deteriorated, conditions in the banking system and, specifically, the outlook for credit   continued to improve  Delinquency rates appear to have peaked in all loan categories except   June 22–23, 2010 110 of 213             commercial real estate, and even there the rate of growth is slowing  The growth in classified   assets is leveling off, both in the shared national credit portfolio and in the top 50 banks  Growth   in the number of banks and of bank assets on the FDIC problem list is also slowing  Banks are   also reporting that credit performance is both better than in the recent past and better than they   expected, and they report fewer questions on asset quality in their investor presentations   There’s still plenty to be done to work through the remaining problem credits, but, at the   highest levels, bank management has moved on to other concerns, specifically, loan growth    Every banker I spoke with talked about the difficulty of finding enough quality credits  They’re   worried about having enough earning assets to sustain their earnings going forward, and a   number reported strong emphasis on developing programs and products to stimulate demand    They’re especially interested in high-quality C&I loans and consumer loans  Most are reporting   that the new lending that they are doing is more likely to be a loan taken from somebody else   than a new credit request  They’re very high quality, but as competition heats up, the spreads are   not as wide as they were, and terms are easing a bit  Indeed, the unusually high spreads for C&I   loans seem to have peaked even for smaller loans   The exception in terms of competition for new loans is in commercial real estate loans    Banks that have room for additional real estate lending report that they are able to cherry-pick   higher-quality deals at good profitability from banks that have pulled back completely from the   product  With respect to real estate lending, I am more and more convinced that we will see   recovery in the commercial mortgage market faster and maybe even sooner than recovery in the   residential mortgage market  Moreover, even though delinquency rates are still rising on   commercial mortgages, I expect that the ultimate charge-off rate will be considerably lower on   commercial mortgages than on residential mortgages   June 22–23, 2010 111 of 213             When talking about CRE credit, it’s important to distinguish between commercial   mortgages (or nonfarm, nonresidential properties for existing owner-occupied or income-  producing real estate) and construction loans  So far, the charge-off rates in 2009 on nonfarm,   nonresidential mortgages ran about 1 percent, which is actually just half of the 2 percent charge-  off rate on residential mortgages or C&I loans and a fraction of the more than 5 percent charge-  off rate on construction loans   Guidance covering CRE workout seems to be helping as restructurings are taking place    Pools of money that were raised in anticipation of an RTC-like dumping of commercial assets   are coming to the point where they have to buy something or return the money So banks report   good liquidity and multiple offers for stressed assets, with pricing at or better than their marks    At the same time, commercial real estate fundamentals are improving as capitalization rates   come down and occupancy and rental rates stabilize  Bankers expect conditions to continue to   improve slowly as long as we don’t have either another leg up in unemployment or a spike in   interest rates    In contrast, after more than two years of trying to modify delinquent residential   mortgages through HOPE NOW, HOPE for Homeowners, and HAMP, we are still faced with a   growing pile of delinquent mortgages  The flow of new mortgages into early-stage buckets is   slowing, but the rate of exit through pure successful modification or foreclosure is painfully   slow  According to the April HAMP report, roughly 6 million mortgages are 60 days or more   past due  Of these, 17 million are estimated to be eligible for HAMP modification, and there are   only 340,000 active mortgage modifications  Furthermore, one large servicer reported a   40 percent re-default rate after four months on permanent modifications  There are only so many   times you can go to the same delinquent borrowers with a new offer, and each offer seems to   June 22–23, 2010 112 of 213             find a lower success rate  Therefore, many are just going to have to be resolved through   foreclosure  Average foreclosure time lines are running a year and a half to get the property and   another six months to sell it  Combining the high loss rates on residential construction loans and   this backlog of delinquent mortgages, it looks like recovery in the housing and mortgage market   could be measured in years, especially in places like Florida and Arizona, where the delinquency   rate is now higher than 20 percent   I asked staff to look at the length of time it took for the level of credit outstanding to   recover after other recessions  They found that this cycle is currently tracking the 1990-1991   recession  In that one, measuring from trough to trough on an inflation-adjusted basis, it took   five and a half years for residential and nearly nine years for commercial to recover   Also on the minds of bankers are regulatory reform, capital and liquidity proposals   coming out of work on the Basel III accord, and the recent FASB exposure draft on mark-to-  market accounting  The FASB proposal is viewed by all as the biggest threat  From the largest   to the smallest banks, they uniformly felt that it spelled the end of commercial banking or, at the   very least, the end of fixed-rate lending and small business lending  One bank likened the FASB   proposal to a terrorist with a nuclear bomb saying, “You knew how bad it would be, but you   didn’t really think he was going to use it”   The Basel III work and the Collins amendment have most banks focused on the allowable   elements of capital as well as on their capital levels  Most of the bankers already believe that   they have more than enough capital to weather the losses in their portfolios, and many of the   smallest banks are unshakable in their belief that capital standards have already been raised    Those that are raising capital are trying to keep as much optionality in it as possible  I asked   bankers what sort of returns they would expect to have in the future and what they would need to   June 22–23, 2010 113 of 213             attract investors  They thought that returns on assets would settle out in the 1 to 12 percent   range, and that 12½ percent was the minimum return on equity it would take to attract capital,   which means they would need leverage of at least 10 to 12 times equity to continue to attract the   capital   All found something to worry about in the regulatory reform bill, but what that was   depended on the bank and the business model  Larger banks talked about operational issues, loss   of income, and service reductions, as they adjusted to new rules, but it was mostly transitional;   over the longer term, they seemed confident they could deal with any of the proposed changes    For many of the smaller banks, the proposals seemed quite overwhelming  Many predicted that   significantly more community banks would disappear as a result of regulatory reform than would   be lost in bank failures  And some were planning to be either buyers or sellers in the eventual   rollout  For the smaller banks, the problem has several dimensions  First of all, some don’t have   enough employees to deal with the sheer complexity of reading and implementing the new   regulations  My memory is that FDICIA had 63 implementing regulations, and at the time I had   64 employees, so that sort of sizes the problem    And that was if the courier did a good job on his side   In addition, there’s complete reliance on vendors to make the changes that are needed for   compliance  Community banks view their advantage as the ability to customize products, while   larger bankers stay inside the box, and the new regulations just seemed to tighten the box  One   fourth generation CEO of a $50 million family-owned bank said she described it to her father as   trying to make it on an 80-acre family farm—just not enough scale or resources   June 22–23, 2010 114 of 213             In summary, we seem to be beyond the point where credit quality concerns will restrict   recovery, but uncertainty about regulation and capital requirements is taking its place  Thank   you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I favor alternative B and the coupon swap  I’d   still like to see us normalize our balance sheet, including the duration of the Treasury portfolio,   but I recognize that this is not the time to do so, and I’m cautioned by the potential that our next   move would be further accommodation I’m actually frightened about the idea of getting memos   from 12 different Reserve Banks  [Laughter]  But the staff’s work has been incredibly helpful    Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Let me elaborate a bit more on Governor   Warsh’s point about credit turning  Banks’ credit quality continues to improve, and the recovery   in credit is far enough along that bank management and bank analysts are now focused much   more on pre-provision net revenue and less on credit costs  But I don’t get the sense that the   regulatory community has made the same shift in focus, so I’ll talk a little bit about real estate   loans before addressing the outlook for loan growth   In residential mortgages, the latest evolution of the government loan modification plan   was a new requirement for completion and documentation of the specific timing and form of   disclosure outreach prior to foreclosure  This means that the timing of foreclosures has been   August 10, 2010 69 of 160             pushed out for another few quarters, but it hasn’t seemed to reduce significantly the number that   will eventually occur  Borrower response to modification, short sale, and “cash for keys” offers   at this point is lackluster at best  And rumors about a large-scale principal forgiveness program   in the works for GSE loans abounds  As all of the delinquent and underwater loans get resolved,   they could easily overwhelm new originations and hold down aggregate residential loans   outstanding for some time   In the commercial real estate space, there are signs that the CRE guidance is working    We’re seeing both restructure and foreclosure activity, indicating that problems in commercial   real estate are being confronted and resolved with a variety of strategies  Since the guidance   came out, we’ve examined more than half the state member banks with average coverage in the   CRE portfolio of 40 percent  This means that we have looked at the actual loan files for   20 percent of the CRE loans in state member banks, in addition to those in the national credit   portfolio  It would seem, then, that we’ve had a good opportunity to weigh in on both loan   classifications and loan reserves, but, still, estimates of the remaining loss in CRE loans would   indicate that banks have recognized only a small fraction of the embedded losses  It’s really hard   for me to square the notion of large unrecognized losses with this kind of exam coverage  I’m   still investigating to see whether this discrepancy has to do with differences in recognition   through reserves or recognition through charge-offs, or whether there’s an anticipation of a   significant unanticipated and unrecognized worsening in conditions   Moving on to new loans, banks are actively seeking loan growth, but they admit that new   originations are not strong enough to offset payout and charge-off activity  Credit card payment   rates continue to climb  Commercial line utilization rates continue to drift down  While bankers   report stronger pipelines, it seems clear that the new activity they’re seeing is due more to taking   August 10, 2010 70 of 160             market share from others, as the competition for loans heats up, and less to borrowers deciding to   increase debt  Both the smallest and the largest bank with whom I spoke reported purchased   mortgage volume at half the level of last year, and the larger bank calculated that refinance   activity was 20 to 30 percent lower than would be expected given current rates   In reviewing the Senior Loan Officer Survey results, I noticed that terms and conditions   are easing more quickly than standards  This supports the banker comments that, in competing   for the limited loan demand, they are competing on rate and terms, rather than lowering   standards, to increase the pool of qualified borrowers  In particular, standards and terms seem to   have improved for jumbo mortgages and for small business loans at large banks, although the   small business improvement at large banks could be indicative of political pressure rather than a   change in their outlook  Indeed, at the capstone small business meeting we had here at the   Board, one large bank reported startlingly good results from its “second look” programs  But, in   private conversations, I can’t find any other bank that is seeing such results, and most now have   an appeals program from their second look program   Finally, the availability of good lending opportunities is so scarce that two CEOs of   sizable banks reported that for the first time in their careers they were actually looking at ways to   run off deposits  And a third CEO reported looking at acquisition of failed banks now as a way   to find assets into which to deploy excess deposits  In fact, deposit repricing is on the minds of   most bankers in the face of new overdraft regulation, reduction in debit card interchange fees,   and interest on demand deposits  There’s a lot of waiting to see what others will do, but I   certainly would look for the end of free checking for small balance, single-service user accounts    On a positive note for deposits, but a negative note for banks’ willingness and ability to hold or   arbitrage reserves, the Dodd–Frank bill changes the assessment base for FDIC insurance from   August 10, 2010 71 of 160             deposits to total-assets-less-capital, thus reducing the cost of deposits and increasing the cost of   all other liabilities   Putting this all together, it seems that loan growth is currently constricted by three   factors  continuing consumer deleveraging and caution on the part of businesses, the repayment   capacity of potential borrowers in the form of either business sales or consumer income as the   primary driver for loan approvals, and, for real estate loans, the combination of fewer units to be   financed, lower valuation of the properties being financed, and lower loan-to-value ratios applied   to those valuations  Loan growth does not appear to be constrained by capital liquidity or the   level of interest rates   Finally, every bank of any size remarked on the number of calls from healthy smaller   banks asking if there was any interest in buying them out  This phenomenon is likely due to the   strain of getting through the credit cycle, the perceived additional regulatory burden of the   Dodd–Frank bill, and questions about the profitability potential of the community banking model   going forward  It is not likely to result in a lot of consolidation yet, as the potential acquirers are   still inwardly focused and waiting for some more clarity on the resolution of problem credits and   profit prospects  But, in the medium term, it would suggest another wave of consolidation and   potential problems in smaller rural markets that are served only by small banks, none of which is   large enough to be successful on its own  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Said his agent    I have a question on the note about replacing the maturities  It looked to me   that there was a dollar amount anticipated of somewhere between $240 and $540 billion, and so   in calculating the basis-point effect on longer-term rates, what sort of stock does that imply?    What total dollar amount of purchases does that imply?  How long does that imply that we   continue to reinvest?  And, finally, how does the market know that that’s the dollar amount that   we’re going to reinvest and the time commitment—if that question makes sense?    Does this mean that when we calculate the 20 basis points, it’s the same as   announcing a $400 billion purchase of Treasuries or roughly the equivalent?  Is that how we   calculated it?    Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I am prepared to support alternative B, but I   have real reservations about the actions in paragraph 4  I don’t think I disagree at all with the   comments about the outlook that have been expressed, but I think my reservation comes   regarding estimates of how well the tools that are available to us will work and the threshold for   using them  I don’t think this action will alter either the outlook or the outcome in any   appreciable way  So my reservation is not a concern about keeping our powder dry, but a   concern that our remaining ammunition is much less effective than we can claim when its use is   only in the potential     In thinking about this, I’m reminded of the old admonition that I heed too infrequently   which is, “it is better to be silent and be thought stupid than to speak and remove all doubt”    [Laughter]  Nevertheless, I’m going to continue  We are currently in a “silent” position, which I   think is stronger, in that we can be perceived as having tools whose effectiveness may be   debatable but that, in any case, we’re reluctant to use, rather than the other position, namely,   using the tools, finding that they’re not effective, and removing all doubt about that   August 10, 2010 129 of 160             In addition, I’m concerned about possible alternative interpretations of our actions  The   rationale section in the Tealbook said that this would lead investors to believe that policymakers   are less focused on exit and more concerned about spurring growth  I’d suggest a few   interpretations that in my mind could be even more harmful to confidence than any positive   result from the actions themselves  First, the press has tied this decision to the unemployment   results, so it could suggest a reaction function that creates an expectation for expanded purchases   to support employment whenever the results are weak  And I think the “to help support”   language that begins paragraph 4 reinforces that  Second, because this announcement is going to   be released without any updated projections, it could suggest a concern about the future that’s   even direr than our projections indicate and fuel suspicions that we now anticipate a double dip    And, finally, as I said, if the tools that we have do turn out to be pretty weak, it will prove them   to be so and could undermine confidence in our ability to fight a more serious weakening in the   outlook  We could yet face conditions that will force us to start using the remaining tools in our   arsenal, but, because I read this more as a commitment to purchase $400 billion in Treasury   securities by the end of 2011, the threshold for making that decision is higher than the conditions   in front of us  All that being said, I am prepared to support it     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The trends in banking continue along the same   lines that I’ve reported before  delinquencies, nonperformers, and charge-offs remain elevated   but, with the exception of commercial real estate, are improving  Within commercial real estate,   construction and land development loans continue to deteriorate as borrowers run out of cash or   simply give up  Loans for income-producing commercial properties and owner-occupied   properties seem to be bumping along a rocky bottom, but losses are still growing   September 21, 2010 63 of 151             All banks are actively seeking loans, but their efforts are directed primarily at taking   market share from other banks rather than adjusting standards to widen the pool of prospective   borrowers  Interestingly, the large banks say that they’re taking market share from the smaller   banks because weakened condition doesn’t allow them to keep lending  The small banks say   they’re taking market share from the large banks with pullback from products or geographies    Uncertainty is high among bankers, their regulators, and their customers  So everyone is willing   to make decisions based only on what they can see   Regulators classify loans that don’t have a documented repayment source  Loans are   downgraded in response to potential trouble, but upgraded only after demonstrated performance   improvement  Bankers, in response, are making loans only when they are supported by current   cash flow or collateral  This makes loans for expansion or to cover cash flow shortfalls hard to   get, and borrowers are only willing to hire or expand to meet sales that they can see  I heard the   same stories others heard about uncertainty about the economy, taxes, regulation, and health care   costs, but I agree with President Evans that they could get over all these concerns if sales were   just strong enough   It is true the consumers are steadily deleveraging, but a fair amount of the deleveraging is   involuntary rather than voluntary  Signs of voluntary deleveraging show up in higher payment   rates on credit cards and a high volume of mortgage refinancing that involves a reduction in the   term or the principal balance  One banker reported that, for the first time in his experience, cash-  in refinances were more prevalent than cash-out refinances  Involuntary deleveraging can be   found in charge-offs, foreclosures, repossessions, higher bankruptcies, and continued credit-line   reductions   September 21, 2010 64 of 151             The rate of decline in overall bank lending is slowing as C&I lending and nonrevolving   consumer credit balances stabilize  While overall commercial real estate loans continue to   contract, the 23 percent annualized decline in the nonfarm, nonresidential category for the   second quarter in 2010 is actually the first noticeable decline in loans on existing properties  All   of the decline so far has come in construction and land development, with residential   construction falling at an annual rate of 60 percent in the second quarter, following declines at an   annual rate of 40 percent in the first quarter and 37 percent for all of 2009  Similarly,   commercial construction loans fell at 23 to 26 percent rates in 2010 after falling 17 percent in   2009, which leads me to my own area of uncertainty, namely, the forecast for residential   construction   Despite all efforts to mitigate foreclosure, there are still five million mortgages more than   90 days past due, significantly more than the four million single-family units currently listed for   sale  There are an estimated 11 million underwater borrowers, and about a million more vacant   houses than the 2000–2007 average  At the same time, mortgage servicers report that acceptance   rates for modification short sales and even principal reductions have plummeted and attendance   at modification events has fallen off sharply  The foreclosure process has become so protracted   that it’s hard to judge what any level of foreclosures actually means, but it seems reasonable to   project that involuntary dispossessions in bank sales of property are likely to climb through the   fall and into most of 2011   With construction lending falling sharply, increases in existing-home inventory on the   horizon, and the price declines that would likely result from higher levels of distress sales, it   seems perfectly plausible to me that residential investment pickup could be postponed well into   2012 or beyond  I’ve noticed that a number of the staff’s write-downs to the forecast over the   September 21, 2010 65 of 151             past year have come from pushing out the recovery in housing starts  So if residential   investment doesn’t materialize in 2011, it looks to me as if that would wipe out much of the   projected improvement in GDP  Housing may be a smaller part of the overall economy, but it’s   still a substantial part of the improvement in our forecast  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I have come around to the opinion that further   purchases of Treasury securities are warranted  I’m concerned that a delay in the recovery of the   housing market beyond what’s assumed in the Tealbook is possible and, perhaps, likely  And   while I’m quite skeptical that lower longer-term rates will have a significant effect on overall   borrowing, lower rates are the key to success for modifications and restructures of residential and   commercial mortgages  So, to the extent that lower rates result in faster, stronger credit   recovery, they could on the margins contribute to easier credit terms  But beyond that, I went   back to the transcript from the last meeting and was persuaded by two arguments made then    first, that missing both parts of our dual mandate on the same side was hard to defend; second,   that the possibility of its not working was not a reason not to try  So, on those points, I concede   Where I don’t concede is on our need to communicate clearly what we’re doing if we’re   establishing a new regime with implied thresholds, reaction functions, and limits  I would be   September 21, 2010 113 of 151             prepared to vote for alternative A1 or A2 today if I had some idea of the framework we were   establishing  But if it’s not clear inside this room, I don’t see any possibility that it will be clear   outside this room  We seem to have ruled out going all-in at once, the “shock and awe”   alternative, but in alternative A we are still expressing ourselves in the same way  purchase of X   dollars in Y time frame  If we need to adjust this, will we adjust the amount, or will we adjust   the time frame?  And what will be the trigger for adjustment?  If the action doesn’t have much   impact and the forecast remains the same, will we add more?  If it does start to work and the   outlook improves for some other reason, will we pull back or will we stop?  Or are we prepared   to use both purchases and sales and target our balance sheet, as President Bullard suggests?  And   where does the $500 billion in alternative A come from, anyway?  If our decision at the last   meeting was roughly equivalent to $400 billion by year-end 2011, how do those two compare?    And do we have too many regimes going on all at once?  Would it make sense to combine all   Treasury purchases into one action and say something like, “We will purchase Treasury   securities in amounts necessary to replace all maturities and principal repayments, plus   $100 billion per month”?   So I favor alternative B  I’m fully prepared to take action at our next meeting if   conditions remain the same or deteriorate, as long as I understand the strategy we’re following  I   hope that we can once again ask staff to do the heavy lifting of further developing a memo   defining the alternative approaches and the methods of communicating them so we can use the   two-day meeting to agree on a regime, if not on the precise thresholds  I understand the concern   about losing the effects of additional purchases in the intermeeting period, but I, frankly, believe   that the accommodation language in paragraph 4, combined with the clarity of our views about   inflation in paragraph 2, will do as much good as the $100 billion or so in securities we might   September 21, 2010 114 of 151             buy between now and the November meeting  The November meeting has the additional benefit   of our published projections, which should tamp down the impression that some had after our   last meeting that we knew something bad about the economy that no one else did  In fact, I   would suggest that, in addition to announcing a new regime, we consider releasing our   projections with the statement rather than waiting for the publication of the minutes   Finally, it’s my hope that we can come out of the November meeting with a common   understanding of the regime we are using and a strong communication of that regime  We might   still disagree over the action, but it will be clear to me, at least, what it is that we disagree about    It’s all well and good to have these geeky conversations as we debate policy, and, in fact, at this   end of the table, the three geeks who are here have demonstrated that there is no dearth of ideas    But if our ultimate goal is to effect the day-to-day decisions of non-geeks and folks like me, then   we must be able to explain it   President Lacker suggested that our actions in August damaged confidence  I believe that   it was not our actions, but, as I feared at the time, it was the bobbling of the communication that   actually damaged confidence  If we are going to get the full potential confidence benefit of a   regime change outside of the mechanics of what we do, I would suggest that we consider   releasing an additional or expanded statement explaining our new regime, along the lines of the   one that President Evans suggested in his memo  I’m not sure that I necessarily prefer his   approach, but I’m pleased to report that I could understand it in my own non-geeky way   Finally, in addition to a statement of regime in our projections, I would suggest that the   Chairman find a way to take questions either on or off the record  In this environment, I think   we’re much better served by having the Chairman and our statements answer the questions than   September 21, 2010 115 of 151             to have our views, objectives, and disagreements channeled through speculation by reporters and   media commentators  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Beginning with the question of how we should   specify our objectives, I favor option 2  I think an interesting case was made for option 3,   price-level targeting, but the communication job is going to be tricky enough without adding that as   a complication  I think the actual outcomes have a good chance of following the trajectory that this   option would imply, but expressing it in this way runs the risk that we will be suspected of inflating   our way to recovery   I do prefer option 2, an explicit inflation objective, along with quantitative information   regarding sustainable rates of unemployment over the longer run  I just don’t see how we can   specify an inflation objective alone and not talk at all about unemployment  I think part of the logic   for choosing a framework depends on what you think you’re trying to accomplish  If I viewed the   low level of inflation as an objective to be tackled directly, and if I were choosing a tool to increase   inflation and inflation expectations, I might choose price-level targeting as the strongest tool   available, as the Cleveland paper indicated  But I actually view the low level of inflation as   reducing the cost of doing everything possible to attack unemployment, so I would choose a   framework that amounts to a limit on how far we’re willing to go in that effort  Therefore, setting   forth numerical objectives should communicate the limits on our willingness to continue to add   stimulus if inflation does emerge, and should be our actual agreement of how far we’re willing to   go   October 15, 2010 53 of 62             Turning to the statement alternatives, I would be reluctant to put these communications into   the postmeeting statement  Having heard the debates over structural versus cyclical unemployment   effects in previous meetings, I can envision a statement with dissents over the unemployment   number alone  And having been taught by Governor Tarullo to pay attention to the words in red, I   took a highlighter and actually highlighted all of the items in each statement that would require   agreement  I found that statement number 1 had the fewest points of potential for disagreement  So   I moved on to the possibility of using the SEP more directly to express both these judgments as well   as opinions about the proper course of policy, and that seemed like a good place for us to be   quantitatively specific about the range of judgments  The SEP would also be a place for everyone,   voters and nonvoters alike, to express their views for the record  And the readers of the minutes   might finally be able to figure out how many “many” or “some” actually means  One alternative to   using the SEP or the statement could be to specify the targets in the semiannual Monetary Policy   Report to the Congress   Finally on the subject of communication, I think the press call on background held by the   Chairman the last time we changed our framework was particularly effective  I’m not in favor of an   open press conference, where the attention is as much on the questioners as on the person answering   the questions, and I’m especially opposed to beginning a tradition of them   Returning to question 2, I could support additional LSAPs, though I’m still skeptical about   their effectiveness, and I would prefer incremental over large announcements  But I was most   intrigued by the interest rate targeting approach and, specifically, the policy-signaling approach, as a   way of calibrating and communicating our purchases  It has the advantage of being completely   different from the way we used the LSAPs the last time, so it doesn’t appear to be a more tepid use   of the same tool  It allows us to target interest rates directly, and it seems to me that certainty on the   October 15, 2010 54 of 62             rate would be more effective than certainty on quantity  And there’s at least the chance that it   requires less in purchases, and, therefore, less additional reserve creation    Targeting the shorter end of the curve would put us in the part of the curve with the most   issuance, so it would have a lower risk of disturbing market functioning, it would shorten the   duration of our portfolio, something we’ve already discussed, and it would provide us with a   smoother exit  It’s not quite so targeted at longer-term rates—and I’ll talk more about this at the   next meeting—but I don’t see lower rates doing much for the housing market, because I think the   forces acting on the housing market are much, much different  Furthermore, longer-term rates are   already low enough to be a danger to the banks that put them on their balance sheets, so further   lowering the rates on new mortgages could actually become a disincentive for one class of lenders   Finally, interest-rate targeting would be something the general public could understand    While markets may be able to interpolate purchase quantities into a rate expectation, ordinary   people cannot  When we used to announce the fed funds rate, it meant something to people, even   people who had no idea what the fed funds rate was  If we have a strategy we can communicate in   terms of interest rates, I believe that ordinary people will react to that as well  Thank you, Mr   Chairman    I do like it, but I would like to work it into the SEP somehow rather than   putting it in the statement     First, I just wanted to echo the comment about speaking about specific   levels or amounts and creating expectations that we then feel compelled to meet; I think   whatever policy agreement we make ought to cover that   On the third issue, I think it’s hard to put into a guideline, but it’s thinking about what it   is we’re really trying to do  I’ve been one of the most vocal over the last two meetings on the   November 2–3, 2010 11 of 238             importance of communicating what our framework is and how we’re thinking about it  During   this intermeeting period, I think it has been explained in probably 16 different ways  If we come   to an agreement that you, Mr Chairman, are going to go out and answer the questions and fill in   the holes, then we should respect that in the same way that we respect some of our other official   communications  I think having one explanation out there would be helpful  Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Banking conditions continue along a path of   improving credit quality and weak demand for new loans  In the face of credit healing and   expectations for us to purchase additional long-term assets, the focus of bank management has   moved from the credit committee to the asset/liability management committee  Under the   watchful eye of stern supervision and suffering from their own post-traumatic shock, bankers say   they’re unwilling to move further down the credit spectrum to generate loan volume or take on   interest rate risk by loading up on longer-term assets  So their plans to improve interest margins   center on repricing and reducing liabilities to make their balance sheet fit the available   acceptable assets  I’m still trying to puzzle out how additional reserves are going to feed through   the economy while bank balance sheet management is working in the opposite direction from   their normal patterns and while loans and balance sheets are shrinking  I wonder if it’s possible   for money creation to work in reverse, and I wonder how depositors will react as deposit rates go   to zero   A banker pointed out to me recently that the credit metrics are improving faster than the   overall economy and, specifically, than unemployment  The reasons given for this phenomenon,   November 2–3, 2010 85 of 238             I think, highlight changes beneath the surface in bank credit  The first reason involves the   portfolio-replacement effect  Banks have now been underwriting new loans under tighter   standards and with an eye toward negative economic conditions for nearly three years  Natural   turnover rates in bank portfolios are actually fairly high, so, with the exception of construction   and commercial real estate portfolios, newly underwritten loans are now a significant fraction of   the total portfolio   Next, bank customers are much more careful about debt  Customers and businesses are   deleveraging, reducing their debt, and building precautionary balances  They’re refinancing to   restructure existing debt and to lock in low-rate financing, but they’re not yet willing to use the   available low-rate financing for new purchases or investment  However, the low rates are   making existing debt burdens less onerous  Lower debt service is giving consumers more cash   for spending, helping fragile small businesses hang on, and enabling property owners to cover   debt service with reduced rents  But I would note the other side  Reduced interest income for   others is now beginning to contribute to lower personal income  On balance, low rates may keep   things from deteriorating again even if they don’t give anyone incentives to add debt  Low rates   are also helping to stabilize real estate prices, and stable prices reduce loss severities when loans   are charged off  They change the incentives for homeowners to walk away or for commercial   real estate sponsors to stop feeding their deals   Finally, consumer loan defaults are driven by the newly unemployed  Once charged off,   they don’t reappear  So charge-offs track initial claims more than unemployment  Given the   high level of long-term unemployed, a reduction in the unemployment rate caused by those   people finding work would not necessarily improve existing credit, but it would be helpful to   new loan demand   November 2–3, 2010 86 of 238             My conclusion is that lowering longer-term rates will help banks repair credit portfolios   and will help nonfinancial businesses and consumers repair their balance sheets, but, unless it   makes a big difference getting people into jobs, it won’t support new borrowing   One last topic that I want to touch on is the foreclosure documentation issue  I talked   pretty extensively at our last meeting about my belief that the enormous extended foreclosure   pipeline would stifle the housing market recovery for years  The problems in individual   foreclosure documentation and the issues raised about establishing the chain of title for   securitized mortgages will only delay recovery further  I believe it’s absolutely critical to   investigate fully and understand all the different documentation problems and to find ways to   solve them in a timely manner  We must move forward in clearing the market without allowing   homeowners to be foreclosed upon improperly  “Improperly,” in my mind, means not   foreclosing on those who are still making their payments  One large servicer reported that loans   going to final foreclosure have, on average, not had a payment for 560 days  In nonjudicial   foreclosure states, 80 percent have not made a payment in more than one year; 30 percent have   not paid in two years  The number is even worse in judicial foreclosure states, where 95 percent   have not made a payment in more than one year and 45 percent have not made a payment in   more than two years  Vacant properties create real problems for neighborhoods, and different   servicers estimated that between 30 and 40 percent of the properties currently in the foreclosure   pipeline are vacant   To the extent that the problems involve state-established legal processes, they’ll need to   be resolved under state law  To the extent that the issues go to the problem of ignoring   differences in state law when establishing a national credit market, it will be important to address   November 2–3, 2010 87 of 238             the resolution of the specific problems, but even more important to consider those differences in   state laws regarding mortgage finance and securitization in the future   Finally, these problems have highlighted the operational risk and realistic staffing   requirements for the mortgage business  Elevated spreads between retail mortgage rates and   MBS yields demonstrate how reduced origination capacity keeps the lowest rates on MBS from   feeding through to actual mortgage rates  Origination of full-documentation mortgages takes   about twice the time of low-documentation mortgages, and, as more quality control problems   surface, processing is likely to take even longer  The crisis has shown servicers to be woefully   understaffed and behind the curve throughout the cycle, so servicing costs will likely change   dramatically   I bring this up to highlight that, in addition to solving for the role of government in   housing finance, the proper alignment of risks in the securitization process, the appropriate form   and content of disclosure to consumers, the data necessary to track mortgage performance, and   the rights and priorities of lien holders, we need to be sure that the process is adequately and   appropriately staffed through the mortgage life cycle  All of these requirements will put a floor   on mortgage rates, a floor that I suspect we’re already approaching  We continue to talk about   financial markets being healed, but I do not view the mortgage or the MBS market to be   anywhere close to healed  The mortgage market represents a substantial fraction of the long-  term debt market, but dysfunctions in this market go well beyond those that can be addressed   through monetary policy   Finally, because of my concern about the foreclosure impact, I’ve taken any recovery of   residential investment for 2011 and 2012 out of my forecast, which results in a reduction of   November 2–3, 2010 88 of 238             about ½ percentage point in the economic growth rates in the Tealbook for each year  Thank   you, Mr Chairman    Thank you  Brian, just two questions to make sure I understand the   capacity constraints  Are they related to the purchase of Treasuries at the Desk or related to the   maturity distribution that you’re looking to purchase?    Second, I thought I understood you to say that the maturity distribution   might be different if you were ultimately aiming to purchase $1 trillion rather than the   $600 billion  So my question is  If we got to the point where we purchased the $600 billion and   wanted to purchase another $400 billion, would the latter purchase look different from the   former?     Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman, and thank you for taking the time yesterday to   lay out your reasoning so completely  In my time here, I’ve learned to respect and be guided by   your reasoning and your instincts, and I’ve also learned to trust your integrity  So I was pleased   to hear your commitment to the notion that, if at any time the costs of these actions are   unacceptably higher than expected, we will stop  On that basis alone, I would probably be   willing to support alternative B, but I came in here with a few other reasons to support this action   and a few concerns   I don’t disagree with the need for action  I’m just troubled by the limited projected   results from this action  Given the discussion of pace versus level, when I looked at the graphs   in the inset box, it seemed to me that the difference between alternatives was less than one   quarter in terms of time  I may be a little wrong on that because the graphs were small and I   didn’t actually have a ruler, but that’s what it looked like  [Laughter]  Therefore, perhaps the   strongest reason that I can find to proceed with LSAPs is the healing effect of low rates    Understanding that banks and their customers need to heal before they reengage, it may be   enough of a reason  And while I think the benefits are small, I’ve come to view the cost as   equally small  Although still untested on a large scale, our exit tools are at the ready, and   inflation threats seem far away  I’m anxious about the potential for asset bubbles, but I do   believe we have a tight enough clamp on the financial system to limit those risks at the moment   However, given that I expect the benefits to be small, I still question what’s next  It   doesn’t feel really right to choose a strategy because I think it’s unlikely to do much harm if I   also expect it to be unlikely to accomplish the mission  While we’re framing this action as state-  dependent, I don’t see much actual room to maneuver in reaction to different economic   conditions  With total monthly purchases as a constraint, our actual ability to react to incoming   November 2–3, 2010 184 of 238             data going forward seems limited to extending or not extending the time frame and the total   amount  I wholeheartedly endorse President Kocherlakota’s suggestion that we need to   understand how we would define good and bad outcomes and what we might do in response to   them  I’m not sure how much scope we actually have, but it sounds like many around the table   have different expectations about what comes next   Let me end with two reservations, just in case anyone missed them when I wove them   into my comments yesterday  We’ve talked about the difference between LSAPs and   quantitative easing, but the fact is we will be injecting more reserves into the system  The last   time we had large purchases, reserves didn’t grow very much  They had already grown as banks   snapped up much needed liquidity, so, for the most part, our purchases represented a substitution   of assets purchased for liquidity facilities’ repayment  For their size, the LSAPs didn’t really   expand our balance sheet or the reserves very much  But the banking system doesn’t have the   same thirst for additional liquidity at this time, so we need to monitor the response to additional   reserves  My second reservation comes from my concern about the mortgage market  I can’t tell   from the staff projections how much of the benefit of this action is expected to come from   improvements in house prices or the mortgage market, but I still believe that channel is too   broken to work   In summary, I support alternative B with the understanding that we will closely monitor   the costs and benefits as we go along and hope that we will also continue to look for even   stronger actions or uses of our tools to improve the outlook for unemployment   Turning to the statement, I do prefer “disappointingly slow” to “unacceptably slow”    And I don’t like the “up to” language—I think that conditions it too much  As to paragraph A4, I   think markets already expect that timing, so I don’t see that it adds anything in terms of   November 2–3, 2010 185 of 238             expectations, and I thought President Fisher’s suggestion, “while maintaining a firm commitment   to keep inflation within levels consistent” and so on might signal the same thing and in a more   efficient way  Finally, I do sort of prefer the discussion of rate of progress rather than levels    Thank you, Mr Chairman    I don’t see how “in particular” is—     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I have a collection of observations about   lending  Starting with commercial lending, banks are seeing some demand in the upper ranges   of the middle market, but there’s also strong competition in that space  Overall, deposits remain   December 14, 2010 62 of 127             high and line utilizations low, indicating low demand over the short term from corporate   borrowers   The Survey of Terms of Business Lending indicates that interest rates have come down   but that spreads are still unusually wide  I believe this may be due to the use of interest rate   floors  Every community bank I called was using floors on most new and renewed loans, and the   very wide spreads on smaller loans would indicate that the floors are especially prevalent on   small business loans  But even one large bank reported that it used floors and that the larger,   more complex, credits were the most likely to have those floors  So with floors around   5 percent, small business borrowers are likely facing pricing equivalent to a 2 percent fed funds   rate  The reporting of small loans to businesses, which is a proxy for small business lending, has   been changed from annual reporting to quarterly, and we now have the first quarterly results    While overall C&I loans declined 16 percent, loans to small businesses were down at a   71 percent annual rate  Small business loan demand is reported to be weak, but a number of   banks noted that the quality of the applicants is getting a bit stronger  Weak demand is borne out   in the NFIB survey, where the percentage of respondents who reported having credit needs has   drifted down to less than 35 percent, compared with a norm in the low-to-mid 40 percent range   On the supply side, staff research shows that growth in small C&I loans, as well as in   small CRE loans, is significantly lower and, for the most part, negative in banks rated 3, 4, and 5,   compared with banks rated 1 and 2, even after controlling for bank size  Timing related to   government programs is also impacting small business volume  Bankers are rushing to process   SBA loans before the 90 percent guarantee and fee waiver programs end on December 31  In   contrast, I talked to one banker who is gearing up to exchange TARP funds for the small   business capital injection program  He has $80 million in TARP and an $800 million small   December 14, 2010 63 of 127             business loan portfolio  He thinks he can make the $80 million in additional loans it will take to   bring the rate on his capital down to 1 percent, but he knows that he will only get credit for loans   made after he enters the program, so he’s holding back, waiting for the program rules and   definitions   In consumer lending, strength in auto loans and some final student lending contributed to   growth in nonrevolving consumer debt, but credit card debt has fallen for a record   19 consecutive months  According to staff research, contrary to some theories, consumers are   not paying down credit cards any faster than normal during an economic downturn  If anything,   paydown has been slower than would have been expected  About a third of the drop in balances   is due to chargeoffs, and the rest is due to a 10 percent reduction in spending on credit cards, and   much lower new account solicitation and application volume   Overall, mortgage debt is down, but banks seem to be holding more of the origination   volume on their balance sheets  One significant player in the mortgage business reported that   2010 originations were a third of levels at the peak, and his expectations for next year were even   lower  Most of the origination volume is refinance, and almost all is supported by one   government program or another  Refinance volume fell sharply in recent weeks as rates spiked,   but even before then only some of the population that can benefit from refinance can qualify for   the low stated rates  The reasons they fail, in order of frequency, are loan-to-value ratios,   debt-to-income ratios, and credit scores  Ironically, there’s a big group in the middle that can’t   get a lower rate through refinance because of one of these factors, but nobody will talk to them   about a modification because they’re still paying their loans  On the positive side, originations   and capacity seem to be coming into better balance, which should lead to better pricing, but even   December 14, 2010 64 of 127             this is being offset by pricing for higher risk—Freddie Mac recently upped delivery fees for all   loans with loan-to-value ratios over 70 percent   Commercial real estate transactions—that is, sales of properties—have picked up   recently, although a high proportion is at a nominal loss, indicating distressed sales  Bankers   report some slight increase in CRE loan demand, with a few categories actually showing growth,   in particular, loans to strong borrowers to purchase distressed properties, and a pickup in the   market for multifamily and hospitality properties  Fundamentals are stabilizing along a rocky   bottom, with vacancies beginning to plateau in all property types, rental rates still decreasing but   at a declining rate, and cap rates improving  In fact, cap rates are the one area of improvement   that I hear attributed to LSAP2   Investor interest is picking up, as insurance companies are back in the game, and REITs   are accessing equity and debt markets  And CMBS issuance might get back to $10 billion this   year, and three $2 billion deals are already in the pipeline for early next year  So, overall, credit   conditions continue to improve slowly   In light of the continuing declines in bank lending, I did think it would be useful to step   back and look at the way balance sheets have changed since the crisis begin  I asked the staff to   pull data on changes in aggregate balance sheets from the second quarter of 2008 to the second   quarter of 2010  During that time, reserve balances increased $972 billion, but total assets grew   only a little more than $200 million  Over the same time, loans decreased about $11 trillion    But it doesn’t look like the reserves crowded out loans  The drop-off in loans was greater than   the amount of additional reserves; in addition to the reserves, there were increases in security   investments and other assets  Leverage ratios also do not appear to be binding, indicating that   capital would allow for more lending  But what appears to be excess capital could be   December 14, 2010 65 of 127             precautionary, in case losses turn out to be higher than expected or in anticipation of new capital   requirements  Alternatively, it could be capital accumulated for dividends or stock buybacks   once restrictions are lifted  Deposit growth was also strong over the period; indeed, core   deposits rose $12 trillion, indicating plenty of liquidity to fund loan growth  Finally, surveys   and anecdotes indicate banks had very weak demand from creditworthy borrowers  Looking at   the same data on the sources and uses of funds basis is supportive of the story that bankers have   told me over and over  Loan demand is weak, deposits are strong, and the yields on alternative   investments aren’t high enough to make borrowing to fund them attractive   Adding together the $11 trillion in loan runoff and the $12 trillion in core deposit   growth gave banks collectively $23 trillion in funds, a whopping 17½ percent of total assets    They invested $1 trillion in reserves, perhaps involuntarily  Borrowings are also down about   $1 trillion, two-thirds in large time deposits and one-third in other borrowings   It is hard to tell how much of this was borrowing that dried up early in the panic and   never returned and how much was a deliberate effort by banks, who didn’t see enough profitable   asset opportunities to justify the cost of borrowing  The remaining $300 billion was invested in   securities and other assets  However, because reserves now take up 8 percent of bank balance   sheets, they have pushed the fraction of total credit to total bank assets down to levels not seen   since the early 1980s  I think it will be instructive to monitor the impact of reserves as we add   another $600 billion and as loan demand begins to recover  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  It’s very difficult for me to determine what the   effect of the $600 billion purchase announcement has been  I confess I don’t see the success of   the program, but I don’t see evidence of heightened risk either  I never expected big results, but   now I suspect that whatever the actual results of the purchases themselves were has been   swamped by the uncertainty over the size of the program, given the public debate over our   policy, including communications highlighting the differences of opinions on the Committee, as   December 14, 2010 100 of 127             well as a surprisingly, to me, anyway, vocal outcry from economists, politicians, and foreign   officials   Nevertheless, the near-term outlook is slightly stronger now than it was at our last   meeting  I don’t know whether the positive surprises occurred because, as it turns out, we were   just going through a soft patch anyway, or whether the lower rates and higher stock prices we   experienced between Jackson Hole and our last meeting were already having beneficial effects or   whether something else was at work  But I do know that right now our immediate economic   future looks a bit brighter  So I think we should hold very, very still and let whatever is helping   continue to work, and I support alternative B     I’m just curious about the market’s perception that we’d be more likely to   sell Treasuries than the MBS  It seems to me that the last time we talked about this we talked   entirely about selling the MBS  Maybe that was because we had proportionately more of them at   January 25–26, 2011 62 of 282              the time, but we kept talking about getting back to an all-Treasury portfolio  So the market’s   perception seems a little odd to me    My question is partly why, but the other part is whether, at some point,   there is anything we should do about that?  In other words, whenever we start talking about exit,   should we be talking more about getting back to all Treasuries?    I’d like to add to that  I’ve talked to a number of community bankers, and   they tell me that a large proportion of these sales are for cash, so they’re not necessarily   financing them  What they’re afraid of is that the farmers are using their cash in the purchases   today, and that, a couple of years from now, when they have worse years, they’ll be back to   borrow against the cash that they invested    It’s not the financing of the property    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Credit quality continues to improve, with some   banks showing quite dramatic improvement in the fourth quarter and most banks expecting   January 25–26, 2011 133 of 282              continued improvement next year  As credit metrics in the outlook improve, however, some   bankers are already seeing the first signs of conflict between their accountants and their   regulators over the proper level for reserves  Running through major loan types, C&I lending,   with the exception of small business, was never a major credit problem in this cycle  Auto has   returned to normal, with loans available across the credit spectrum  Credit card charge-off rates   are declining, in some cases sharply, and are expected to return to normal levels this year    Residential mortgage lending is the area of greatest concern  Entry into delinquency brackets   has slowed, but exit from delinquency has also slowed, with problems in foreclosure procedures   across all major servicers  In commercial real estate, the outlook is, oddly, brighter  Banks are   beginning to see reductions in the dollar level of problem loans  When loans are restructured or   extended, it takes 6 to 12 months of demonstrated performance under restructured terms before   the loans can be upgraded, and some early restructures are now passing this threshold  In   addition, banks are aggressively selling troubled real estate assets and are finding ready buyers at   or above their marks  Fundamentals such as vacancies and average rents range from stable to   improving  Investors have lowered cap rates in line with interest rates, and more sales   transactions are occurring  Bankers did caution, however, that continued low interest rates hold   the key to the outlook for commercial real estate  Risks to the outlook for credit improvement   more generally are declining house prices, unemployment, and interest rates   Loan demand is still quite weak  Competition continues to heat up for C&I loans and is   gradually moving down from large commercial lending well into middle-market lending, and a   few banks reported seeing a brief but noticeable pickup in small business application flow in   December, but no one was ready to call it a trend  In our aggregate bank data, we have seen   growth in C&I loans and in residential mortgages  Banks are becoming increasingly focused on   January 25–26, 2011 134 of 282              the need to generate assets  The C&I growth is due to some increased demand primarily for   transaction needs, such as the opportunity to buy something—equipment or mineral rights, et   cetera—at a bargain price, or to fund mergers and acquisitions  Bankers have yet to see demand   prompted by business expansion, and, while they’re still adding to approved credit lines, usage   of existing lines remains at historical lows   Mortgages held at banks are increasing, but overall mortgage debt is still declining    Banks are choosing to retain portions of GSE-eligible and non-eligible originations to offset   declining portfolios and weak demand in other areas  Similarly, credit card securitizations are   extremely low, as banks elect to keep the production on their balance sheets  Finally, bankers   caution that they still have significant loan portfolios in liquidation or runoff mode that will mask   new production for some time  All of this leads me to believe that loan supply is not   meaningfully constrained by capital or liquidity but rather by assessments of creditworthiness   and prospects for recovery  Meanwhile demand from creditworthy borrowers continues to be   weak   The Small Business Lending Fund initiative that has been passed by the Congress and   launched by Treasury allows Treasury to purchase preferred stock from banks with total assets   less than $10 billion and is designed to incent them to increase small business lending  The rate   on the stock drops from 5 percent to 1 percent for banks that increase lending by 10 percent   within two years  Conversely, the rate increases to 7 percent for banks that do not increase   lending, and the rate goes to 9 percent after four and a half years for all banks  For healthy small   banks that already have TARP capital under CPP, it would make sense to exchange that for   capital under this program with the potential for lower rates and the elimination of compensation   restrictions  For healthy banks without TARP, it could serve as bridge capital until more   January 25–26, 2011 135 of 282              permanent capital sources become available or in anticipation of the need to replace trust   preferred as a source  Less healthy banks that are in need of capital due to existing losses are not   likely to be approved for the program  As of January 10, Treasury reported 71 applications, of   which 38 were non-TARP and 33 were TARP banks, and we’re working with the other agencies   on approval processes  However, the President doesn’t need to look very far for needless   regulatory burden  Under the legislation, for banks to receive credit for small business loans   made, every small business borrower must certify that he or she is not a sex offender and must   update that certification annually that he or she has not become a sex offender in the previous   year   Finally, banks’ earnings are quite threatened by the loss of revenue from debit card   interchange fees  The industry had drifted into a model where checking account profitability was   largely generated by overdraft fees and debit interchange income  With both of these sources of   revenue sharply curtailed, most banks are looking at restoring checking account fees and charges   for debit cards  In addition, many are rethinking branch networks and looking for ways to lower   deposit delivery costs  None of these measures is likely to offset the revenue loss  Look for a   significant hit to profitability upon implementation, and only slow recovery as new fees are   implemented  Also looming is the threat of credit card interchange restrictions  With interest   margins reduced by lower levels of earning assets and stronger competition for the assets that are   available, as well as severe regulatory hits to noninterest income, banks are likely to struggle for   core operating income  The struggles may be masked for a time by improving credit costs and   reserve releases   Turning now to the economic forecast, I subscribe to the staff forecast as described in the   Tealbook and agree that downside risk is less than the last time we met  I would offer two   January 25–26, 2011 136 of 282              nuances based on my conversations about credit  First, I fear that the outlook for real estate   investment, even at the revised lower levels, might not materialize  As I’ve said in the past, this   concerns me because this investment is a much more significant fraction of the forecast for   improvement of GDP growth than it is of the overall economy  In addition, while employment   in construction was less than 7 percent of overall employment at the peak, through December   2010, net job losses in the construction industry are nearly 30 percent of total jobs lost   Second, as credit availability returns, there appears to be a bifurcation between the haves   and the have-nots  Large companies have credit; small companies have not  Companies in the   health-care or energy sector have credit; companies in businesses related to real estate have not    Consumers with high credit scores have multiple credit card solicitations; subprime borrowers   are likely to be closed out for some time  Homeowners or potential homebuyers with significant   equity or down payments can get mortgages for purchase or refinance, while others cannot   access the best rates even with good income and credit scores  We could be surprised by   continued strength in consumer spending if its recent improvement turns out to be driven by   greater confidence among the haves, because that group may not be as credit-constrained as the   averages would suggest  While I’m seriously concerned about the ugly social consequences of   such a bifurcation, I think it might provide some reason for optimism about growth in consumer   spending  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I favor alternative B  The outlook looks a little   brighter than it did the last time we met, and most around this table seem a bit more confident    Indeed, most of my conversations with bankers started with comments like, “Things look a little   bit better,” and “people have a little more spring in their step”  So there does seem to be a little   more optimism   On the question about reserves, I’ve been paying a lot of attention not only to changes in   our balance sheet, but also to changes in the aggregate balance sheet of banks, and I’ve been   trying to think about what that might cause banks to do  My conclusion right now is that   reserves are unlikely to affect either the price and availability of credit, or financial conditions, or   even the economy, unless there’s a significant change in either loan demand or deposit supply    Right now there is just so much liquidity that I don’t think the change in reserves is having much   effect, so I’m not concerned about that at the moment   January 25–26, 2011 183 of 282              At the same time, the market seems pretty convinced that we’re going to purchase the full   $600 billion in Treasuries, no more and no less  So with all of the potential uncertainty in the   outlook—whether it comes from house prices or commercial real estate or state and local   governments or potential spillover from peripheral Europe—it makes no sense for us to tinker   with the one thing about which there seems to be a little certainty   Turning to the language, I want to make sure that we don’t send a signal that we don’t   intend to send—and I didn’t get the feeling that anybody around the table wanted to send such a   signal  Regarding the first paragraph, I could live with the version from alternative B or C, and   I’m not sure which one I would vote for if you forced us to choose one or the other  In   paragraph 3, I have a strong preference for stopping the sentence at “second quarter of 2011” and   leaving out the discussion about the pace of purchases forever  The reason is that I think if   we’ve given the total amount and we’ve given the time, then that calculation is left to anybody to   figure out, whereas now we’re in a position of having to change from $75 billion to $80 billion,   which might give the impression that we’re doing some tinkering and fine-tuning  I think it   points up the risk of having both the pace and the total amount in the statement  But if we’re   going to have an amount in the statement, I think it has to be the right amount  I don’t think it   makes sense to have an amount that we know to be incorrect   For all of the same reasons, I would go back to the original language and would not use   “continued its practice of”  The change in tense is not conveying any important information that   I can see, and it might give people the erroneous impression that we’re intending to signal that   we’re having more of a conditional discussion than we actually are   On the inflation target language, the problem I have with inserting that, first of all, is that   I think it would be interpreted as much as a political statement about this whole discussion about   January 25–26, 2011 184 of 282              our dual mandate as it would be any statement of our intentions  Inserting ourselves into that   question about our mandate seems to me to raise all kinds of questions about independence  I   think we have the right to independence about how we get to our mandate, but we don’t really   have independence as to what our objectives are, so I’d be very uncomfortable about putting it in   there  Also, if we’re going to put a number on inflation and we have the dual mandate, it seems   to argue for a number on unemployment, and in fact, I had the “2 percent or a little less” in a   speech in January, and the very first question I got from the audience was, “Well, if that’s your   number for inflation, what’s your number for unemployment?”  And I think that’s a little   difficult   Finally, I’m still not certain that we can agree on what that number is, even if we decided   to put the number in the statement  Those are my comments  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you  I have just a couple of thoughts, and going through this process   has opened my eyes to how difficult it actually is  First, a number of people have talked about   judgment, and in information security or control mechanisms, there’s always the basic tenet that   your overall security program is only as good as the weakest link  In this situation, our   reputation is only as good as the weakest judgment among us, so the judgment calls that each of   us makes will affect the reputation of us collectively  I think it’s important to keep that in mind   and continue to discuss it   Second, I think one thing we really are trying to guard against is sort of “synthetic”   confidential information  We all understand what the actual confidential information is—the   written materials, what’s said in this room, and so on  But what about the things that each of us   is thinking, the things we’re talking to each other about not in a formal FOMC meeting, and the   January 25–26, 2011 224 of 282              opinions that we have?  By talking to each of us, somebody could create confidential   information  Given that, I do think we need some coordination mechanism to understand who’s   talking to whom in order to avoid the appearance, if not the reality, of somebody being able to   create synthetic information   Finally, there’s a tendency to think of this communication issue as covering   conversations in formal settings, but, in reality, each of us is always an FOMC participant, and,   just as Governor Raskin gets caught between the tabloids and the gum, I’ve been tackled in bars   and I’ve been tackled on the beach [laughter] by people wanting me to explain what it is we’re   doing  If I felt that the only answer I could give them was something I had already said in a   public setting or in a speech, I would have to start tweeting, I really would  So I think we have to   be careful about prohibiting saying anything that you haven’t said in public  Doing so could   create an awful lot of noise from things being said in public just so that they could then be said in   private   Finally, I come down in favor of formal principles with some suggested guidelines that   go along with them, and I think it does make sense for those to be positively framed rather than   negatively framed  Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  My conversations with bankers were pretty   brief this time  Most reported seeing very little change in credit since the last time we spoke,   with continued gradual improvement in credit quality and weak loan demand as universal   themes   The question I normally ask the CEOs that I speak with is  What are the most important   things that you are worried about, that are on your mind?  Well, due to the timing of the calls, it   didn’t seem appropriate at this point to discuss interchange fees, because the comment period   had closed—or capital plans, because the results have not yet been communicated—or mortgage   servicing, given the ongoing settlement talks with various government entities  After carving out   these three items, there was very little left to report  [Laughter]   As I read through the Tealbook and the staff forecast, I kept noticing the assumption for   easing of credit conditions  And while I do see evidence of easing, I think the improvement is   quite uneven across product types and markets  Unsurprisingly, the products where conditions   are closest to pre-crisis norms, competition for new loans is most vigorous, and volumes are   returning, are also the products where the delinquency and charge-off rates never got very far out   of line  Nonrevolving consumer loans, primarily auto and student loans, are the best example of   this, and Governor Yellen and President Fisher have both already mentioned auto lending  Auto   dealers are attributing stronger sales to the broad availability of credit, and bankers attribute   March 15, 2011 73 of 165              growth in auto loans to stronger demand  Bank and nonbank lenders report terms and conditions   in auto lending are at historical norms, and the pricing, volume, and composition of auto ABS   would similarly indicate a return to normal  So I think it is entirely possible that the auto market   could be a barometer of demand unconstrained by tight credit conditions  Student loans are also   growing at a strong pace, but they show up as a negative on bank balance sheets as the   government has now taken over the guaranteed student loan program  Several factors are   probably interacting to produce the growth  The legislation authorized higher maximum loan   sizes  Lower home prices have resulted in less home equity availability—a historical source of   loans for education  Tuition costs are rising as states and foundations have less capacity, and   reduced job availability could be leading more people to seek additional education  I don’t   worry very much about a credit-funded bubble in autos, but there are growing reports of students   ending up with debt that is much larger than the earning power of their degrees, and the inability   to relieve the debt load as these loans cannot be discharged in bankruptcy   The other bright spot in lending is business credit  Delinquency and loss rates on C&I   lending spiked during the recession but only to levels typical for recessionary periods, and they   are now declining in typical cyclical fashion  C&I lending is the only category of bank lending   that is still showing growth  However, loans made by large banks to large firms appear to be the   primary reason for this growth  Small loans to businesses have been falling for all three quarters   since banks began reporting the data on a quarterly basis  And while C&I loans at banks under   $10 billion are down for the year, they did grow slightly from the third to the fourth quarter,   possibly a sign of a little momentum  Interest rate spreads on C&I loans are coming down for   larger loans, but not for smaller commitments  However, every bank now reports more   competition for C&I loans  Demand still seems to be driven by loans for acquisitions or one-  March 15, 2011 74 of 165              time transactions, and credit line usage remains at historical lows  Unused lines of credit are up,   likely due to new line approvals that are not yet drawn  And the NFIB survey still shows   declining levels of small businesses that sought new credit, indicating weak demand, and fewer   respondents saying credit is more difficult to obtain, indicating improved availability  All in all,   the business credit market appears to me to be ready to fund demand by businesses whenever it   materializes  New issuance of CMBS continues to grow from low levels with some notable but   not yet alarming relaxation of terms from the very tight standards of the early new issuances    And while overall commercial real estate loans in banks are still declining, the decline is driven   primarily by steep drops in construction and land development portfolios  Rents and vacancies   seem to be improving, with particular improvements in multifamily and hotel cash flows    Indeed, if there is an area where I would look for overheating, it would be in multifamily   Credit card delinquencies are approaching normal levels, and charge-off rates are   dropping sharply, but issuers report that their portfolios are increasingly skewed toward   transactors who pay off monthly balances rather than those who fuel their spending through   higher credit card debt  And credit card balances continue to decline, as do available credit lines   Everything related to residential real estate, whether it’s construction lending, mortgage   lending, or home equity, is mired deep in the mud   Completely unrelated to credit, I was a lot more confident that the recovery was on firm   footing before this spike in gas prices  I am much more worried that higher gas prices will cause   skittish consumers to pull back again than I am about the effect on inflation, and I am concerned   that businesses that are unable to pass through price increases will offset risk to their profit   margins with renewed reluctance to hire  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I favor alternative B  I do believe the recovery   is on firmer footing, but that belief is tempered by uncertainty about the effect of higher gas   prices on consumer and business confidence, uncertainty about the effect of unrest in the MENA   region, problems in peripheral Europe, and the horrors unfolding in Japan  And it’s also   tempered by the memory of our belief this time last year that the recovery was gaining   momentum   I would applaud the changes offered by Presidents Kocherlakota and Williams, and I   believe that they are more significant than simple wordsmithing  I think one of the biggest   difficulties we face in our communication and our credibility is the disconnect between a   discussion of headline, underlying, trimmed, core inflation, and pass-throughs that takes place in   this room and the conversations that take place among the general public and business people   about the rising costs of gas, food, and health care  So I think framing our discussion of inflation   in terms of near term and medium term is probably easier for normal people to understand than   any of these other measures   Second, to the pace of $80 billion a month, I think we learned at the last meeting that it   creates confusion to make small changes to the amount often necessitated by technical factors    And we now have evidence that the stock is more important than the flow  I think a consistent   communication of the total stock that we intend to purchase or, when the time comes, to sell   across a definitive time frame will give an indication of the pace of sales without creating   another item that we have to potentially adjust  So I would not be in favor of adding that one    Thank you, Mr Chairman    I would like to respond to Tom’s concerns and to say that I was probably   the person on the subcommittee that was the most reluctant to come around to this idea for a lot   of the concerns that you expressed  I guess what I was struggling with is, we had a statement   that was the Committee’s statement and then later on we had minutes that reflected what   happened in the meeting  So my question was  If the Chairman is out there giving a press   conference, where does that fit?  Is it a restatement of the statement or is it a preview of the   minutes?   And that’s where, I think, using the SEP is a good way not only to draw attention to   them, but to look at it in a little bit different light, so that now I view both the statement and the   minutes as a check on, if you will, a Chairman who wanted to go out and just put forth one point   of view because both of those are going to actually come out as well as statements made by   others  So I think that weighs against the concern that this is out there for all regimes  I mean,   March 15, 2011 140 of 165              future Chairmen can go out and say whatever they want to, but it’s going to be in the context of   these other communications that are still going to be out there    I know we weren’t going to talk about the one-day meetings, but because   the one-day meetings happen a day earlier, and this Friday thing has come up before, if we were   going to end it on Thursday after the two-day meetings, would we also want to end it on   Thursday after the one-day meetings?   March 15, 2011 144 of 165               Richard, you didn’t vote   March 15, 2011 146 of 165                I just had one question  Can you give me a sense of the relative size of the   Treasury GC repo market and the current fed funds market?    Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I would also like to commend the staff for the   work on the memos, and I will confess that I failed to identify this as an underdetermined   optimization problem  [Laughter]   April 26–27, 2011 76 of 244              Over the last several years, I have supported asset purchases as our only option for   easing  But when it comes time to tighten, we can return to the short-term interest rate tool, and I   believe we should  I agree with Brian Sack; it is still the strongest tool in our kit  I can’t quarrel   with the political risk of maintaining a large balance sheet or the credit allocation argument  But,   still, I favor the use of the short-term interest rate tool whenever and as soon as it’s available and   would address our concerns about the balance sheet only when our interest rate tool is fully   functional again  We have experience with it  The public has experience with it  It’s easier to   calibrate and to communicate   In December 2008, when we made the decision to reduce the fed funds target to its   current level, I worried about many of the consequences that we’ve discussed again here today—  the narrow potential for spreads to adjust to preferred levels, pressure on the recovery of   operating costs in money market funds and in banks  I am also concerned about the potential   distortions created by near-zero short-term interest rates  So I favor the strategy that gets   nominal short-term rates back into a normal range the soonest  I say “short-term interest rates”   because I think there is some risk in focusing on the fed funds rate as long as that market is   limited to GSEs and a handful of counterparties  I think the lesson we should take from the   recent experience with the FDIC assessments is that short-term markets may react differently   depending on whether they are dominated by US banks that can earn interest on excess reserves   and must pay FDIC assessments, foreign banks who can earn interest on excess reserves but do   not pay FDIC assessments, or other players who do not have access to excess reserves as an   investment alternative but also do not pay FDIC assessments  Along these lines, I believe we   may observe different results in the use of the reverse repo tool compared with term deposits,   April 26–27, 2011 77 of 244              and I believe banks will bid differently on term deposits when they are offered in size and with   an expectation of increasing rates   I’m a little bit concerned about the airline analogy, because now I am going to talk about   throwing fuel overboard in order to reduce our landing weight  [Laughter]  While I favor the exit   sequence outlined in option 1, I fear that we might have to reduce our balance sheet more than   we think to get reserves down to the point where temporary draining tools can tighten the link   between IOER and other short-term rates   Turning to the specific questions asked, I agree that the first step should be redemption of   agency securities, and I would favor redemption of Treasury securities only if that step was not   anticipated to push back the first use of the interest rate tool  I would put assets on a   predetermined, preannounced path, subject to infrequent adjustments  I would not be in favor of   any asset sales that delayed liftoff of the funds rate  However, once the funds rate was returned   to a level that allowed us to use it for tightening or easing—say, fed funds at 2 percent—then I   might favor asset sales that reduce the balance sheet more rapidly but delay further increases in   the funds rate  I agree with all the statements in question 4, as long as adjustments to asset sales   are not viewed as an active policy adjustment tool  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Bankers and bank analysts are increasingly less   worried about credit quality and much more worried about the ability of banks to generate asset   and revenue growth  Credit metrics are within or rapidly approaching long-term acceptable   standards in commercial lending, auto lending, and now in credit cards  Classified assets are   declining at larger banks and leveling off at smaller banks, and a number of bankers point out   that a significant portion, up to one-third, of CRE assets classified as nonperforming have   continued to pay as agreed  Absorption of commercial space continues but at low rental rates    Still, cash flows support debt services as long as interest rates remain low   Even in residential mortgage portfolios, new entrants into delinquency are slowing    Bankers suspect that this improvement could be seasonal as tax refunds could be helping   borrowers catch up, but they point out that, at least, if borrowers are using the cash from tax   refunds to make mortgage payments rather than something else, that would represent progress    It’s also possible that this is finally a manifestation in mortgages of the credit cycle that we   already saw play out in auto and credit cards, as fewer borrowers are losing their jobs and newer   loans are of much higher quality  I also believe that the sharply lower delinquency rates across   products and across borrowers are indicative of less financial stress among those who still have   access to credit or credit outstanding, possibly a signal that we’re coming to the end of   deleveraging, especially among consumers  However, I would point out that this signal would   not apply to the long-term unemployed, those who have found jobs at much lower wages than   they had previously, or those with severely delinquent or underwater mortgages   April 26–27, 2011 150 of 244              Demand for all types of credit remains weak  There’s some growth in C&I lending   primarily reported by larger banks lending to larger companies, but it is still event driven, such as   for loans to fund mergers and acquisitions  Those who reported lending for working capital or   capital investment cited loans to strong sectors such as manufacturing, energy, and agriculture-  related businesses  There also appears to be some slight pickup in small business lending and   evidence that small businesses perceive loans as slightly easier to get  Banks reported easing of   terms and rates in commercial lending in the SLOOS  Easing is usually prompted by   competition, and, indeed, in my conversations, a few bankers characterized competition for C&I   loans as aggressive  A number of banks reported some demand and some appetite for new CRE   loans, primarily for purchases of existing properties, refinances, and multifamily  Banks also   reported easing standards in consumer credit in the SLOOS  However, the bankers pointed out   that during the recession, credit performance for a given credit score band had deteriorated, so   the cutoff scores were raised  What they now report as easing is really a return to the previous   levels   One of the key assumptions in the Tealbook forecast is that the economic recovery will   be supported by increasing credit availability  Overall, my impression is that credit conditions   are considerably easier than they were at the height of the crisis, but that, with the exception of   residential real estate lending, they’re probably pretty close to as good as they’re going to get   Even as loan demand remains weak, deposits continue to show strong growth  Bankers   are having a tough time finding ways to employ these additional deposits  Most have already   replaced much of their wholesale funding with deposits  Some are actively using lower interest   rates to discourage new deposits and refusing to bid on large deposits, and rates are reportedly   April 26–27, 2011 151 of 244              being quoted in the single digits for large deposits, consistent with the rates we’re seeing in other   short-term markets   Finally, lest we get too complacent about reserve levels, as a final indicator of bank   balance sheet preferences, we could look at banks’ willingness to hold reserves  About two-  thirds of the reserves created since we started the LSAPs in November have been absorbed by   foreign banks, and a few large US banks have substantially reduced their individual holdings of   reserves even as the aggregates have increased  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  We are near the end of a third go-round, and I   have no case to make for a change in policy  So I had planned to fly in the face of FOMC   tradition and stop speaking, but in listening to all of the discussion, I am struck by “core   inflation,” “underlying inflation,” “headline inflation,” “inflation in the medium term,” “inflation   expectations,” “inflation projections,” and even now, “unmodified inflation”  And I think it’s   really important, if we are going to build credibility, if we are going to emphasize our   commitment, that we start to talk about inflation in the same way and what we mean about it    April 26–27, 2011 200 of 244              This debate between President Evans and President Lacker about what is inflation and   rebranding inflation says a lot about where our disagreements are  I think having disagreements   about the level of inflation is one thing, but having disagreements on what we’re talking about   when we talk about inflation actually creates a lot of confusion  And I just don’t think we can   build that credibility until we’re all speaking about the same thing  I was very pleased to hear   the Chairman say yesterday that core inflation is now yesterday’s news and that we’re actually   going to pay attention and talk about the things that real people are actually seeing and help   people understand what that means in terms of inflation  And I think that’s important in all of   our discussions   Moving to the statement, having listened to all of that, I was originally agnostic on   having “generally” before “stable” in paragraph 1, but I think we probably ought to leave it out    It seems like an extra modifier that I wasn’t sure there was a lot of support for   And then, in paragraph 2, I would agree with President Kocherlakota’s suggestion that   we go back to “in a context of price stability” at the end of that sentence and leave out “a   decline,” because I got to thinking—all right, pushed up inflation to where, and a decline from   where, to a level that’s consistent—where’s that level?  It created three questions in my mind,   and I think if we go back to the original language on that last sentence, it would be helpful  I   know you disagree with me, Jeff, but anyway, Mr Chairman, those are my thoughts  I support   alternative B     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support the sequencing with the elimination of   all the time references  My only concern with the document was that, as written, taking step 2   engages the gears for step 3, and taking step 4 engages the gears for steps 5 and 6—it seems like   that would make it difficult to calibrate and maybe even to begin the exit strategy  So without   those, I’m fully in support of it    Thank you, Mr Chairman  My first observation is that the commercial   banking conditions are not nearly as twitchy as financial markets  As Governor Yellen noted,   financing conditions in the dealer space tightened noticeably in recent weeks  Reports covering   bank credit have followed the same contours for months  Bankers are still reporting slow but   steady progress on credit quality, and all are facing weak loan demand  It’s hard to judge, but I   get the sense that those who are seeing their outstandings increase are the ones who had less   significant credit problems originally, and now have less dollars invested in runoff portfolios or   are losing less volume to charge-offs   New production seems about the same everywhere at levels one-fourth to one-third of   pre-crisis levels  In areas where there is volume to be had, competition is ferocious  All banks   characterize the competition, in C&I lending especially, as irrational, and they call out each   other’s names—particularly at the upper ranges of the middle market  For quality credit, banks   are competing on price, terms, and hold amounts, which is the portion of a credit they will hold   in syndicated deals  Competition for small business and lower-middle-market deals seems a bit   more disciplined, at least so far, and several larger banks reported that smaller banks were   entering the market for C&I lending as they were being forced out of commercial real estate   lending, but they warned that the smaller banks lacked the same level of controls, covenants,   infrastructure, and experience in commercial lending that the larger banks have   Auto lending may also be emerging as a battleground  As you might recall, auto lending   was the first product to return to normal  A few banks talked about increasing focus or entering   this market, and another traditional auto lender complained that at any given price point, other   June 21–22, 2011 145 of 282              banks are buying deeper into the credit pool or lending at higher loan-to-values than has been   prudent in the past   All this competition stems from pressure on earnings, as deposits continue to grow and   banks have no place to invest the funds  This became really evident when nearly every CEO,   unprompted, told me exactly how much cash he was carrying  Clearly, the incentive to lend is   there, but the demand is not, and banks do not yet have any stomach for easing credit standards   to get it  In addition to the lack of loan demand, the profit dynamics of checking accounts are   changing radically, with regulatory restrictions on overdraft fees, higher FDIC insurance costs,   interest on commercial accounts, and, of course, the prospect for reduced income from   interchange fees   Finally, anxiety levels are quite high about capital and liquidity requirements, stress tests,   and regulatory burden  On the side of displaying confidence in the future, however, unassisted   M&A heated up in the last week, with the positions of the fifth-, sixth-, and seventh-largest   banks, in terms of deposits, shifting twice in the last week   In reviewing my notes, I started to muse, like Vice Chairman Dudley, and it occurred to   me that there are still significant populations of borrowers that have not been able to take   advantage of lower rates—or, in the language of the DSGE memo, those who are still facing risk   premium shocks  [Laughter]  So I wonder if we might be able to increase the effectiveness of   the actions we have already taken by looking at some ways to reach those who have not yet been   able to refinance or restructure at the lower rates  First, in the mortgage market, as rates fell,   those with good credit, income, and equity refinanced, often more than once, but there is still a   significant number of performing mortgages with higher coupons that for some reason have not   been able to refinance  We should look at them and try to figure out why  Second, although we   June 21–22, 2011 146 of 282              have steadily pressured lenders and servicers to modify residential mortgage loans, when lenders   modify commercial real estate loans, including reducing interest rates or even removing interest   rate floors, they are labeled as troubled-debt restructures, and the banks who do them are subject   to additional examiner pressure  So we should take a look at the incentives or disincentives to   reduce rates on commercial mortgages  Third, guidance recommending increased risk   management as construction and commercial real estate lending approached 100 percent and   300 percent, respectively, of capital are now almost universally regarded as caps  Banks that are   over one or more of the guidelines have reduced CRE loans by more than 11 percent, while those   who are comfortably below the guidance have reduced CRE by less than 2 percent  The   population of banks may not be exactly the same, but more than half of the dollar decrease in   CRE outstanding over the past year is in portfolios held by banks that are at or close to one of the   guidelines  And while losses have been high in construction lending, they have been   significantly lower in loans on existing properties, and lower still on owner-occupied properties    Revisiting these guidelines and the way they are being enforced, especially the overall CRE   limit, could enable some borrowers to refinance commercial properties at lower rates and some   small businesses to access more credit  And it might also allow some smaller banks to lend more   in real-estate-secured credits that they understand and less in some of the C&I space that they   don’t   And because the theme of this meeting has been models, I would like to challenge the   notion of a single representative household making decisions based on rational expectations  In   my experience, most of the households I saw as a banker made spending decisions based on how   much money they could put their hands on  [Laughter]  A lot of that came from debt—from   growing credit card balances, home equity loans, cash-out refinances, and using home equity and   June 21–22, 2011 147 of 282              cash-out refinancing to pay off credit cards and reload for more spending  In those years,   spending grew faster relative to income than we might have expected  Now that mortgage, home   equity, and credit card debt is shrinking and consumer spending is disappointing, it seems likely   to me that housing wealth and the ability to tap into it through debt may be more important to   consumer spending than investment wealth  Finally, the inability of a growing number of credit-  impaired borrowers, combined with additional regulation on mortgages and credit card products,   means that a large population of consumers have no access to credit and can only react to higher   food and energy prices by cutting spending on other things  I guess the model in my head has at   least two households  one that is making rational choices based on preferences and expectations,   and another that is just trying to survive using whatever nominal dollars they can put their hands   on to buy the things they need  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support alternative B and am happy to wait   and see how temporary the temporary factors end up being  I would also support the change in   the language suggested by President Williams  I ran into the same conflict between the Tealbook   box and this sentence  Thank you    Yes    I would like to go back to the comment on the staff policy and say that I   think there was one line that we meant to draw, and that was having a Fed official speculate   publicly about what this Committee might do, might not do, should do, should not do—whether   it’s in a paper, it’s in a speech, it’s in a blog, wherever it is, I think that’s a problem   June 21–22, 2011 211 of 282               I would say, I prefer to have no numbers, but if it meant I didn’t have to   discuss this again, I would take anything  [Laughter]     So moved, because Governor Yellen is in San Francisco    Just one hypothetical question  If they were investing all of this run-up in   deposits in reserves at the Fed, if our balance sheet wasn’t so large, if those reserves weren’t   available, where might they have invested them?  It seems to me that the reserves are an   August 1, 2011 17 of 53              attractive investment because they can be redeemed at par  So would that be something that we   might look at as a tool in the toolkit if this were to happen in a future situation where there   weren’t so many reserves in the system?    I guess my question, though, is if deposits are flowing in everywhere, I can   see who would want to lend reserves  I just can’t see who would want to borrow those reserves    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’m fully in support of items 1 through 5  With   respect to 6 and 7, I’ve said before and I’ll say again here, I think we should consider expanding   the short-term money markets, including the repo markets, that are subject to our rate targets    With the size of our balance sheet and the fact that we’re paying interest on reserves, we’ve   actually taken over the traditional fed funds market  Both of these scenarios contemplate rates in   other short-term funding markets moving outside of the fed funds target, so I think that actions   that are necessary to move those rates back inside the target would be appropriate and could   include the purchases of Treasury bills   August 1, 2011 45 of 53              As to item number 8, I’m very uncomfortable with liquidity provisions that are a   substitute for appropriate regulation on the money market funds, especially those that would   continue to support the fixed-net-asset-value regime  Also, I’m not sure how much the federal   guarantee contributed to stabilizing the money market funds and how much our liquidity   facilities did that, but in a situation where the federal government was already in default, I can’t   imagine that a federal guarantee would be very useful  Again, I would agree with the Vice   Chairman that it probably would make more sense to purchase T-bills than to try to come up   with some sort of facility that targeted money market funds   On numbers 9 and 10, I’m very uncomfortable  I think there’s really a fine line between   market-functioning concerns and reacting to the effects of fiscal policy—or lack of fiscal   policy—overwhelming monetary policy  However, I could envision a situation where it was,   frankly, a reaction to operational problems, where you had some participants who just plain had   no capability to hold defaulted securities  I learned about three weeks after I got here never to   say never, so I will not say that I oppose these, but I would go back to the high-bar caveat    Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I celebrated my third anniversary with the   FOMC with markets once again fluctuating wildly  [Laughter]  So I really had to fight growing   posttraumatic stress disorder stemming from my early experiences here  However, at the risk of   seeming too Pollyanna-ish, there are a few factors that seem better today than they were in 2008   or even last August  The banking system is in much better shape, and indeed, our policies are   August 9, 2011 74 of 162              focused on incenting them to take more risk rather than to de-risk  Corporate balance sheets and   earnings are strong, and banks report that incoming financial statements show notable   strengthening in businesses of all sizes  Consumer balance sheets are also in better shape due to   voluntary and involuntary deleveraging, and the weight of debt has been reduced through   refinancing at lower rates  But their income picture is grim, and the value of their primary asset,   their home, is still drifting downward  And finally, while uncertainty is still shading every   financial decision, a few things have become clearer or will become clear in the near term  The   debt ceiling has been increased  We no longer have to wonder whether and how far S&P is   likely to downgrade US debt, and we will soon know what that downgrade means for markets   Turning to the banks, the same themes that I’ve been reporting continue  Credit metrics   continue to improve  In particular, credit card metrics are approaching, and in some instances   have moved through, expectations for norms going forward  Loan demand is still quite weak,   but the banks are seeing slow, steady improvement from very low levels  Interest in mortgage   refinance picked up recently as rates tipped lower  Credit card response rates are a bit better, and   the Treasury has begun announcing approvals for investment under the small business lending   program  However, many of the banks that applied are under enforcement orders requiring   permission to pay dividends and are therefore not eligible, and it looks now like approval rates   will be disappointing  Further, I did talk to at least one bank that had been approved, but they’re   now concerned that they won’t be able to find the loan growth that they had anticipated  So   they’re not sure they’re going to accept the funds  Deposits are still growing, but with no place   to invest the money, price is ratcheting down   The most discouraging part of my recent discussions is that while banks no longer seem   to be fighting for survival, very few have a clear vision of how they can achieve long-term   August 9, 2011 75 of 162              growth or robust profitability  Bank earnings are somewhat like the economy—modestly   positive, which is better than negative, but still vulnerable to shocks  Problem assets are being   worked out, but there’s no replacement demand to offset liquidating portfolios  Interest margins   are weak and falling as funds from liquidating loans and new deposits are invested at very low   rates, and banks have less room to lower deposit rates as they find themselves facing the zero   lower bound  Noninterest income has taken hits from regulations on overdrafts and interchange   fees, and increases in other fees will only partly mitigate these costs  Compliance costs from   Dodd–Frank are expected to be substantial, and elevated deposit insurance premiums seem likely   to continue for the foreseeable future  This was the first quarter since 2005 in which upgrades in   supervisory ratings outpaced downgrades, but I would characterize this statistic as pointing to   less weakness rather than more strength  One other note of caution  I believe there are a lot of   banks carefully watching the BNY Mellon decision to charge for new deposits  With weak   profitability, nowhere to invest new deposits, and rising FDIC and regulatory costs, the   temptation to charge at least for deposit insurance is high  As asset rates get closer to zero,   negative nominal interest rates on deposits could quickly become a reality  While monetary   economists might cheer this outcome, I’m not sure what kind of market or banking distortions   would ultimately follow   Finally, as we think about what actions we might take to support growth, I think it’s   important to look at how improvements in the various loan segments are evolving  Knowing that   many are loath to allocate credit, I would still argue that our tools are more limited now and that   we should consider targeting our actions to the weakest credit segments to yield better results    Looking at the results of the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey, I find the responses to   questions about the level of tightness to be quite instructive  Business credit seems pretty fully   August 9, 2011 76 of 162              healed, with large fractions of respondents reporting credit standards about in the middle   compared with levels that existed between 2005 and today  Even with commercial real estate,   nearly half report standards in the middle or easier  With a combination of declining past-due   rates, lower corporate leverage, building cash positions, and improving earnings, the corporate   sector does not appear to be credit constrained or likely to respond to lower rates by borrowing   or investing more  In contrast, the charts for consumer credit are a sea of red, the color   indicating tighter conditions  Only auto lending shows some level of neutral and easier lending,   and to be fair, the slightly tighter conditions in credit cards may be more of a reaction to the   CARD Act than anything else  Moreover, the improvement in delinquencies and a resumption of   growth in non-real-estate-secured consumer credit provide some evidence that creditworthy   customers are able to access credit, and those who do still have credit outstanding are not   experiencing as much difficulty paying it  But standards for first mortgages and home equity   loans are extremely tight  Outstandings are steadily declining, and delinquency rates remain   stubbornly high, reflecting both high levels of stress among borrowers and a backlog of   delinquency resolution  So I believe we need to look at problems in the mortgage market as the   area where policy is most likely to result in improvements in the economy  We have a housing   task force at work here at the Board, and we are reaching out to other parts of the government to   try to advance some policies that we think might help  But if, as seems likely, this Committee   considers further monetary policy actions, for me one yardstick for judging potential   effectiveness will be an estimation of the extent to which the action will affect refinancing or   new mortgage lending  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Our position is incredibly uncomfortable    Many around the table have pointed out that the factors contributing to the disappointing results   are not monetary in nature, and that it’s not clear that monetary policy can cure the ills  Well, it   might not be our fault, and it might not be our job, and we might not be in the best position to   act, but I still see our responsibility as taking whatever action we can that we believe will result   in the best outcome, regardless of how it fits with our own preferences or comfort level  But we   have to weigh carefully the costs and benefits of our options  I don’t see the change in our   guidance as high risk  It communicates our best estimate of the future outcomes  And even   August 9, 2011 125 of 162              though the statement might not be different from market expectations today, it could keep   markets from prematurely anticipating our exit if this uneven recovery results in a spurt of good   data as a result of those same temporary factors  And I do see the rewards of this action as not   raising expectations for QE3  As to the clarification proposed by Governor Yellen, I could   support it but would prefer to take more time to think about it  I do support a two-day meeting   and perhaps an intermeeting conference to give us time to assess the relative costs and benefits of   all of our options  As I said in the economic go-round, I believe our remaining ammunition is   limited and therefore must be carefully aimed  Thank you, Mr Chairman    What if it said, “The Committee currently projects,” rather than   “anticipates”?    Yes    No    Yes    Do you have Dan’s change to paragraph 4?     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’d like to start by thanking the staff for making   sure that I didn’t waste another weekend in unproductive activity  [Laughter]  Also, I noticed   September 20–21, 2011 92 of 290              that a number of the comments made by Vice Chairman Dudley are similar to my own, and I   want to assure everyone that I did do my own work   David Wessel observed in a Wall Street Journal article this week that “Federal Reserve   Chairman Ben Bernanke has demonstrated a straightforward approach to his job  If the Fed   forecasts unemployment will be far above normal and inflation is heading below the Fed’s target,   then the central bank should do something—even if no tool seems potent enough to fix the   economy”  I don’t know how the Chairman feels about that characterization, but it pretty well   describes the argument that has persuaded me so far to support QE1, QE2, and the “2013”   guidance language in the August statement  I would add, however, one more factor to   consider—that whatever we do should not have risks that outweigh its most optimistic positive   benefit  This is the context in which I evaluated the alternative policy tools   Turning first to the MEP and the LSAP—which I will call by their more popular names,   the Twist and QE3—while I doubt that either is potent enough to fix the economy, I do think the   risks are manageable  I prefer the Twist, as it is projected to have the same effect as QE3   without further increasing the size of our balance sheet  As to its efficacy, I’m pretty sure that if   we’re willing to buy enough of any security, we can affect its price  I’m less sure how much   impact those lower rates will have on the economy  I’m especially concerned that the sectors of   the economy most sensitive to long-term rates, the real estate sectors, are not responding   normally  In particular, residential real estate is so burdened by the overhang of underwater   homeowners, past-due mortgages, foreclosed properties, and tight credit conditions that recent   declines in mortgage rates resulted in no pickup in purchase volume and only tepid refinance   activity  Moreover, mortgage rates have not come down as much as they might have, because   the current low-coupon securities seem to have a longer duration than existing higher-coupon   September 20–21, 2011 93 of 290              securities and there’s less appetite for them  For this reason, and at the risk of causing President   Lacker’s head to spin around, I would wholeheartedly support Vice Chairman Dudley’s   suggestion that we should also consider purchasing MBS  At a minimum, we could reinvest   maturing MBS into MBS rather than longer-term Treasuries and hopefully have a stronger effect   on residential mortgage rates, which, in my opinion, would then strengthen the impact on the   economy  This should also keep the percentage of total long-term Treasuries that we own lower   than it otherwise might be  And given the evidence that the original Twist had a lesser effect on   corporate rates, using the MBS could help ensure that this does impact the spread on mortgage   rates  Even with minimal reaction in the mortgage market, the Board staff estimates that the   lending–borrowing channel accounts for only about one-third of the projected effect on the   economy, with two-thirds coming through stock market and exchange rate effects  So some   benefits would be realized even given the weak mortgage market  And finally, because we’ve   already engaged this tool, we’ve had some experience with it, and the market has had some   experience with it  Thus, on balance, I can continue to support the use of this tool as the   “something to do” when conditions are such that we should do something   With respect to lowering the IOER, however, I have not heard anyone argue that it would   be very effective, and I think it does carry high risks of disrupting market functioning  Given the   cost of FDIC insurance and the requirement to include all assets in the FDIC assessment base, I   think the FDIC has already gotten our 15 basis points  And now that demand deposits have   unlimited insurance coverage, in a negative-rate environment, substantial funds could flow into   deposits and thus cause leverage ratios to bind  If this happens, I believe that a BONY-like   charge for excess deposits could become the norm  I’ll talk more about this in the next round,   but banks are already reducing nondeposit funding and lowering deposit rates  I would point out   September 20–21, 2011 94 of 290              that because branches of foreign banks don’t pay FDIC insurance, the effect on them is different    I understand the optics, but the differential between US and foreign banks is not of our making    The only room that banks have left to offset the decline in asset yields if we lower the IOER   would be to create negative rates on retail deposits through an FDIC charge  Most banks did   actually charge for FDIC insurance when the insurance rate went to $023 after the S&L crisis—  therefore, I assume that the system capacity still exists—although that did result in the Truth in   Savings Act, so at least this time the banks will have to be truthful about the negative rates that   they might post   The potential for negative rates could also easily disrupt money market funds  I don’t   want anybody to infer that I’m a fan of money market funds, but I’m already worried about their   exposure to Europe, and I believe that destabilizing them would have far more negative effects   than any benefits I can see from reducing IOER  Several of you are skeptical about the   willingness of banks and money market funds to deal with lower IOER  But if some markets can   go to negative nominal rates and others cannot or do not, a large volume of money could move to   the place where returns are not negative and change the economics there  And finally, if we   lower the rate and market disruptions do develop, what would we do about it?   With regard to using explicit, quantitative guidance as a tool, I believe that this tool is   likely to work much better in theory than in practice  I think the reason for this is that   communication, by its very nature, is more difficult to control than an action, such as purchasing   a security or changing a rate  Whatever we say is subject to evaluation, interpretation, and   response by many different listeners  Many of you have spent a good part of your lives thinking   about this, so the communications challenge seems simpler  But we also have to communicate   with the same people who still believe that the Fed doesn’t have an audit   I’m not saying that I   September 20–21, 2011 95 of 290              don’t think we should discuss our preferences in speeches, testimony, and the Chairman’s press   conference  I just think that, however carefully phrased, asking the statement to carry the weight   of this communication might be asking too much of it   What I took from the memo is that to be effective as a monetary policy tool,   communication would have to have two characteristics  First, it would have to communicate a   future path for policy that is significantly different than what market participants currently   expect, and second, it would have to be believed  In the memo’s discussion of market reaction to   the “mid-2013” language, the text states that “market participants generally appear to think that   the Committee would raise the fed funds target before mid-2013 if necessary to prevent an   increase in inflation to more than 2 percent over the subsequent couple of years, even if the   unemployment rate were projected to remain well above policymakers’ estimates of the longer-  run equilibrium rate”  Truth be told, I thought that was exactly what we were trying to   communicate in discussions about an inflation target of 2 percent  In that sense, we seem to have   already communicated very well  So my first question is, how likely might we be to get broad   agreement on a reaction function that is different from this?  Governor Tarullo makes this point   in his memo  The more specific and numerous the data points included in any communication,   the more difficult it becomes to get broad agreement initially and to maintain that agreement as   conditions evolve and voting composition changes  The less agreement we have, it seems to me,   the less certainty markets would have about the ultimate follow-through  And we don’t make   our statements in a vacuum  While I believe in the independence of our actions, I firmly believe   we would be wrong to take or refrain from taking any action because of the potential political   reaction, but that doesn’t mean that there won’t be a political reaction  When there is such a   reaction, I do think that the strength and tone of it could and would influence market perception   September 20–21, 2011 96 of 290              about the credibility of our statement  As an example of this, I would point to the widely held   belief that blowback from QE2 makes the threshold for QE3 all the higher  I know the use of the   2013 date in the August statement is a less-than-satisfactory way of communicating, but it is now   out there, and we should think very carefully about how and when we modify it and about how   and when we might want to further modify whatever replaces it  Every time we change the   language of the data points, we run the risk of more confusion   Finally, before we jump straight to debating specific quantitative values, I think it’s   important that we make sure we’re actually in agreement about frameworks, triggers, targets, and   tools  Is the intent to change the 2 percent target for inflation or to clarify how it works?  If we   agree on the framework but not the specific values, then the option of communicating through   the SEP makes sense to me  There’s broad agreement on quantitative values that including those   in the statement does make a stronger commitment  But the overall concept of the way we view   our dual mandate needs to be well established before we start hanging values on it   This is a time for everyone to make his or her own suggestions, so let me add mine  I   think I would, once again, agree with Vice Chairman Dudley that we might ask a series of   questions in the SEP phrased in the language of alternative A  For example, we define x, the   inflation rate, and y, the unemployment rate, as they are outlined in alternative A, and then we   ask each participant to write down his or her own preferences for x and y and publish those as   part of the SEP  This would communicate the Committee’s thinking in much the same way, but   with perhaps richer texture than a potential 7–3 vote on individual numbers in the statement    Further, it leaves everyone free to discuss their own opinions without contradicting a statement    Also, as participants’ perceptions, opinions, and forecasts change, or even as the participants   September 20–21, 2011 97 of 290              themselves change, markets would have a way to judge the Committee’s likely reactions in   almost real time   I’ll end where I started  The David Wessel quote and the assessment of the reaction to   the “mid-2013” language in the statement lead me to conclude that the market understands pretty   well what’s been going on in this room  Before we embark on a program to communicate a   change, or even a refinement to that perception, we should be sure that we are broadly and fully   committed to whatever change we plan to communicate, and we should create a communication   framework that has flexibility to continually update markets on how our decision frameworks,   targets, triggers, and forecasts are evolving  Thank you, Mr Chairman     “Credit constraint,” “liquidity constraint”—I’ve got those, too    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Credit metrics continue to improve, and charge-  offs continue to drop  With the exception of residential real estate and construction loans, credit   quality is now back to historic norms, indicating that the credit healing cycle is maturing   In the last round, a number of you discussed the apparent preference of banks for cash   over lending  I reject this notion, and I would further caution that if we could somehow through   September 20–21, 2011 168 of 290              monetary policy force banks to make loans to someone, anyone who was willing to borrow the   money, then we would not likely be happy with the loans that they found to make  But I will   agree with President Fisher that there are likely some adjustments that need to be made to our   supervisory policy that would make it easier for community banks, in particular, to go back to   lending to the small businesses that are in their communities  Governor Raskin and I are   working through a subcommittee of the supervision committee here at the Board, and I would   urge all of you to also work with your Community Depository Institutions Advisory Council for   information on how we can do this   But all of the work on supervisory matters won’t offset the lack of loan demand  Every   banker that I’ve spoken with right now cites their number one problem as nearly nonexistent   demand for new loans, even as loan runoff accelerates  Problem loans are being sold off,   charged off, and paid off  Banks have exited some business lines, and runoff in those lines is no   longer being replaced  And what recent loan growth has been experienced has been in areas   such as auto, where turnover is rapid  So portfolios are shrinking even as new production is too   weak to offset the runoff  Those banks that are expanding loans admit that much of their growth   comes from refinancing loans off the books of other banks, and as competition heats up, they   find a need to watch out for their back door—that is, existing loans going to competitors—as   well as to compete to bring new loans into the front door   Almost every bank noted continued strong deposit growth, but deposits are a mixed   blessing, as the need to invest funds from deposit growth adds to the pressure to find productive   assets for the investment of funds from loan runoff and maturing securities  Right now, asset–  liability management strategies seem focused on running down nondeposit liabilities and buying   securities, primarily agency MBS  Interest margins are shrinking, and the potential for CD   September 20–21, 2011 169 of 290              rollovers to continue to lower interest cost is diminishing  On the positive side, the abundant   liquidity has created a ready appetite for portfolios and businesses being shed by foreign banks    US banks have snapped up businesses offered by RBC, HSBC, and ING and the CRE portfolios   divested by the Irish banks  On the negative side, most banks are steadily working to reduce   their expenses to offset weaker income  Expense reduction is taking the form of closing   branches, reducing head counts, exiting products, and, in some cases, selling businesses   The area where reduced capacity is the most stunning and the most worrisome to me is   mortgage origination  The mortgage servicing business has become quite concentrated and is   now faced with a number of challenges, such as the treatment of mortgage servicing rights in   Basel III capital requirements, as yet unknown servicing standards, litigation risk, and subpar   returns as the cost of servicing past-due loans continues to climb  Much of the profit in loan   origination comes from the sale of servicing rights  So as the attractiveness of servicing   declines, the servicers are less inclined to buy the production of others  Then the wider network   of brokers and correspondent bank originators is finding fewer places to sell production, and   they, in turn, are reluctant to maintain or add to capacity  And as capacity declines, originators   use price to control the flow of volume, which might explain in part why the response to lower   rates is less than might be expected   Capital does not seem to be a problem for most banks, as asset quality improves, earnings   turn positive, and balance sheet growth is sluggish to negative  But the drop in market cap as the   financial sector has gone distinctly out of favor with investors is stunning  Our forecast of weak   economic growth translates into even weaker loan and revenue growth for the banks  So it’s   hard to formulate a story about positive upside potential for bank investors, and the potential for   downside surprises remains high  Even banks with limited exposure to Europe or mortgage   September 20–21, 2011 170 of 290              litigation will have trouble attracting investor interest  Three years ago, we worried about the   financial system collapsing as a result of poor liquidity and steep losses on assets  Now, it seems   more likely to gradually but steadily shrink down to wherever capital and expenses match   revenue and asset generation prospects   All in all, the outlook for banking is no longer scary, but it’s certainly gloomy  However,   to end on a more positive note, banks have the capital, the liquidity, and, importantly, the profit   incentive to lend whenever demand picks up  Businesses, in general, have cash, cash flow, and   credit availability to expand should confidence return or sales prospects look brighter  And   households, notwithstanding the remaining problems with mortgages and home prices, appear to   be under much less financial strain, as evidenced by low delinquency on other consumer debt   and quite reasonable debt-to-income ratios  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I want to particularly thank you for noting   yesterday that I have learned to use the lingo of the FOMC, but I’m not yet able to plug my   assumptions into a Taylor rule so I’m going to have to make up for that by expressing myself in   terms of munitions metaphors   When I look at the forecast, and particularly the inflation forecast, I could support   alternative C  I’m concerned about the trajectory of the revisions to inflation and am mindful of   the comments that President Kocherlakota has been making  But going back to the framework   that I used in making business decisions, I also got used to asking  What is the worst possible   outcome that could occur as a result of taking an action, and if that happened, would we be in a   position to deal with it?  When I looked at the estimate of the inflation effect in the forecast   under the baseline and all the alternative simulations, only the “Greater Supply-Side Damage   with Higher Inflation Expectations” scenario breached 2 percent on total or core PCE, and that   one peaked out at 26 percent, which didn’t seem like an awful outcome  Further, if the forecast   and the estimates of inflation that would be generated by this action were wrong and we did,   indeed, get more inflation than we expect, I think we know what to do about it  It might be   difficult to decide to do that, but we do know what to do about it  And at that point, we would   also know that this balance sheet gun is truly out of bullets and that we wouldn’t be able to use it   anymore   As to the “keeping the powder dry” philosophy, I will admit that the experience of the   last few years has made me more inclined to go ahead and shoot now  But even if I were   inclined toward keeping powder dry, I’m not sure that this is the specific dry powder that would   be helpful in a financial crisis that was precipitated by a European crisis  In that case, our   balance sheet would be likely to grow again as a result of liquidity-providing actions, and I don’t   September 20–21, 2011 240 of 290              think this would necessarily be the tool we would choose in that circumstance  However, if   we’re going to take this action, it’s important to get the maximum effectiveness out of it  For   this reason, I support the first paragraph 3 rather than 3′  We get the full stock effect   immediately, and the reduction of uncertainty offsets the loss of flexibility  Second, it’s   important to aim precisely, and I support the reinvestment in mortgage-backed securities as a   way to make this action, if only marginally, more effective in the housing market where I think   the weakness is a significant impediment to recovery  Finally, President Bullard said that the   Committee would not announce a series of interest rate moves in advance and that that is what   the first characterization of paragraph 3 is, but that’s exactly what we discussed yesterday in   terms of the forward guidance—announcing a series of actions in advance  Again, I think 3 is   more powerful  In paragraph 6, I have some discomfort with the bracketed language because it   seems to leave us in the position of reloading, and I’m not sure exactly what sort of actions might   be expected as a result of that language  Given my strong concerns about reducing the IOER, I   would be really uncomfortable about setting up expectations for additional action that I’m not   sure that we would be able to meet  Thank you, Mr Chairman    “These” rather than “its”     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I, too, want to thank the staff for the quality of   thought and work that went into the memos and for the time they spent with me answering my   questions  I also want to apologize to that same staff because my comments are going to take the   intellectual level of this discussion down a number of notches, but I’ll remind you that the   November 1–2, 2011 82 of 282              intended audience for any communication that we might make includes a lot more people like   me than it does people like you  [Laughter]   I am in no position to question the theory, the assumptions, the thought, the quantitative   analysis, the simulations, or the academic literature that underpin the framework memos  As I   thought about these over the weekend, I was reminded of a story that I first heard when I was in   college, and maybe some of you heard it as well  It’s the story of the physicist and the economist   who were stranded at sea with nothing but a single can of beans to eat, and the physicist took the   can of beans and applied precisely the right amount of force at exactly the right location and still   couldn’t open the can of beans, despite having used the heat of the sun and the coldness of the   water to soften up the metal  So he asked the economist if he thought he could open the can of   beans, and the economist looked at it and said thoughtfully, “Assume we had a can opener”  So I   focused on two aspects of execution, credibility and clarity, because all of the expected results   depend critically on the assumption of a can opener—that is, absolute credibility and clarity   The Federal Reserve already enjoys a high degree of credibility stemming from its   demonstrated commitment to containing inflation  This credibility comes not so much from   what we say, but from what we have done for many years, and the public has learned our ways    For the most part, the public still trusts us to control inflation, and those who pay the most   attention to what we say have come to understand that we will control it at a level of 2 percent or   a bit less  If we’re going to convince the public that we’re going to act differently in the future,   especially far into the future, we will first need unanimous or near unanimous agreement and   steadfast conviction that it’s the right course for us to follow, and we would need to speak with   one voice to communicate clearly how we were changing and why  Without near unanimity and   one voice, the public could focus on the potential for the rotation of voters to change the path or   November 1–2, 2011 83 of 282              the potential for the two open seats and the upcoming term endings on the Board to bring about a   philosophical change or, in the worst case for credibility, the political debate could become   fixated on effecting such a change through legislation or personnel changes   Finally, in order to protect the hard-won credibility that we already have, we must be   absolutely clear about our intentions and our reasoning, and one carefully worded and   unanimously supported statement is a start, but it has to be reinforced through repetition and   explanation  As an example, there’s already much confusion in the public about the difference   between guarding against deflation and inflating our way to growth  To return to the questions   we were asked to address, I’m supportive of an effort to create a document that addresses our   framework as long as it addresses both parts of our dual mandate  I’m not opposed to making a   clear statement about our objectives or even an explicit inflation target as long as we also   articulate the way that the employment level influences our decisions  It would be helpful if we   could also articulate the way that asset purchases fit into our strategy and how the size of our   balance sheet interacts with the federal funds rate and our policy objectives   Moving on to the question about using policy thresholds to explain our strategy, I used   the fed funds rate in the alternative simulations to help me with my fed funds projections in this   round, my understanding being that these are fed funds rates that most closely correspond with   the historical behavior of the Committee if each of these scenarios were to unfold  But when I   tried to find the common thresholds in those simulations, I couldn’t do it, which underlined, for   me at least, the need to think carefully about how we express ourselves  In August we started   down the path of using a date for forward guidance  Then in September, with no one especially   pleased with the idea of using a date, we discussed several alternative ways of providing   guidance  Before we change this again, I hope we’ll work very hard to forge agreement on the   November 1–2, 2011 84 of 282              language, such as date, time, or threshold; the vehicle, such as statement, SEP, or separate   document; the frequency with which we plan to adjust it; and whether we do it as a commitment   or a forecast   As to changing frameworks altogether, such as a move to targeting nominal income or a   price level, I found the discussion of risk in the memo quite persuasive and would hope that we   could keep these weapons in reserve unless we see a recession scenario in which a dramatic   change might better justify the risks  In the meantime, it could help with clarity if we could work   to educate the public about why we might make this choice   Here’s what I would most like to see us do  Rather than each trying to convince the   others that his or her approach is the best, maybe we could think about what it is that we all do   agree on  If President Williams agreed with both President Plosser and President Rosengren, that   proves that this is possible, [laughter] and then we could work to explain that to the world   Thank you, Mr Chairman    My question goes back to the impact on customers of MF Global, and this   question may not make sense because I wasn’t sure I understood the article I read just before I   came in here  But it was something about either clearinghouses or exchanges freezing customer   transactions, customers of MF  And then, I was remembering how some of the people who came   through here were really unhappy in the Lehman bankruptcy about their collateral getting tied up   in pieces  Is there anything in moving derivatives to central counterparties that we should be   aware of in connection with this?    Is there anything in that that would cause potential customers of, say,   Morgan Stanley not to want to be customers of Morgan Stanley for just that reason?   November 1–2, 2011 110 of 282               Thank you, Mr Chairman  I used the “Extended Tealbook Baseline”   forecast in my projections, but unlike the Tealbook and most of you, I see the risks to growth as   balanced—sort of  [Laughter]  I can’t discount the potential for a really bad shock coming from   Europe  If rumors that someone has a plan to make a plan can brighten markets considerably,   then all of the nasty realities that are sure to unfold over time can’t be good for Europe or for us    In fact, even without actual spillover from actual crisis conditions, the headlines so far have been   enough to swamp or at least mask the effects of our own policy actions  So that’s the obvious   downside   November 1–2, 2011 177 of 282              But beyond the risks coming from Europe, I think there’s a good case to be made for the   “Faster Snapback” scenario  Admittedly, the faster snapback results have gotten progressively   less snappy over recent months, but I think there are elements of balance sheet repair,   confidence, and credit conditions that can be viewed optimistically  Beginning with balance   sheet repair, business balance sheets might be in the best shape ever  Debt has been reduced or   refinanced at ever-lower rates  Companies are awash in cash  Continuing and growing cash   mergers and stock repurchases signal that production-related uses of cash are not yet attractive,   but provide evidence of the temptation to employ that cash opportunistically  And banks that   have seen growth in C&I lending report that the borrowers are still keeping high cash balances   rather than using their own cash before tapping bank lending  Finally, commercial deposits at   banks continue to grow at an astonishing pace   Even household balance sheets are in better shape than they appear  With the exception   of mortgage debt, consumer debt has been reduced significantly  Admittedly, much of the   reduction has come through charge-off and bankruptcy, but that’s exactly the point of   bankruptcy—a fresh start  And even though overall debt to income is still high, much of that   debt is in mortgages with long amortization schedules  So the burden of debt, the monthly   payments compared with net income, is at levels not seen since 1994  Delinquency rates on auto   and credit card debt are at the bottoms of their historical ranges, indicating that those who still   have credit are carrying it pretty comfortably  For mortgages, despite repeated calls for principal   write-downs, I don’t see that happening in any meaningful way, but foreclosure represents an   absolute write-down of principal in the same way that charge-offs and bankruptcy wiped out   other consumer debt  Mortgage modifications have leveled off at low but steady rates, and re-  default rates on modified loans are improving  Rates of transition into delinquency status are   November 1–2, 2011 178 of 282              also improving, and the size of the foreclosure pipeline is beginning to gradually decline as   foreclosures in nonjudicial states have resumed and foreclosures in judicial states begin to trickle   through  Policy focus has finally moved from an emphasis on loan modifications to dealing with   the impact on housing values and neighborhood stabilization issues that result from large   numbers of distress sales  Lower mortgage rates, combined with an easing of credit standards   for refinance and purchase mortgages and responsible REO disposition, could actually speed the   final completion of household balance sheet repair  I’m optimistic that there are policy paths that   could accomplish this   Finally, financial institution balance sheets are the mirror image of those of businesses   and households  Loans are down and deposits are up, leading to loan-to-deposit rates that are   lower than they’ve been in decades  Deposits have been used to pay off wholesale funding, and   all measures of liquidity look strong  Problem assets are steadily coming down, and those that   remain seem more heavily weighted toward long-term workouts than losses waiting to happen    Capital levels are strong, and with credit losses posing less of a threat to capital, most banks   returning to positive earnings, and a regulatory lid on payouts of capital, this capital strength   seems more real than it did in 2008   Turning, then, to sentiment, it’s true that measures of business and consumer sentiment   turned sharply negative, but it’s not as clear that the change in sentiment led to equally sharp   changes in behavior  A number of bankers I spoke with noted that from their perspective and the   perspectives expressed by their customers if they hadn’t listened to the news or read a   newspaper, they wouldn’t have noticed that anything had changed  Incoming business financials   still show strong or at least improving results  Businesses are cautious about investing and hiring   but are not necessarily pulling back  Business customers report already being fully prepared for   November 1–2, 2011 179 of 282              weaker or even double-dip conditions  And finally, consumer credit and debit transaction data   didn’t show any change that would correspond to the drop in confidence  It seems to me entirely   plausible that consumers and businesses that hunkered down in the face of the Great Recession   have not yet unhunkered and that they are still ready for the worst  If it comes, if pessimistic   forecasts are correct, it won’t really change anything in their behavior  On the other hand, if   there were somehow to be some sustained good results, such as strength in sales or improvement   in consumer income, I think that could translate into some positive change in behavior, and as   we’ve all experienced in the past few weeks, the good news doesn’t have to be all that good to   surprise you if your expectations are low enough   Let me turn now to the final headwind that I can envision dissipating more quickly and   creating the condition for a faster snapback, and that’s credit conditions  The number one   financial problem faced by banks is a declining net margin  Many of them blame this on us and   the low level of rates, but I believe it’s due to the mix of assets on the balance sheet—  specifically, the dearth of good lending opportunities  Competition is fierce for C&I loans    Banks are chasing them with rates, terms, and calling officers  When they find a good credit,   they’re willing to hold a much bigger piece of it  Appetite for commercial real estate loans now   follows the fundamentals, vacancies and rent levels, which will in turn follow the economy    More banks are entering the auto finance business, where competition is also strong  Credit card   solicitations are picking up, even though the Credit Card Act has likely changed credit terms   permanently in this space  Banks are holding onto more of their mortgage production, even   though most of them are not willing to offer the full spectrum of credit eligible for GSEs or the   FHA  And credit is still tight for small businesses, especially those that have struggled over the   past few years  But there’s room for policy to improve credit conditions in both small business   November 1–2, 2011 180 of 282              and mortgage  Indeed, we have “blue sky” groups here at the Board thinking about both of   these, and if we can figure out a way to improve conditions in these two markets, then I think we   could cause this headwind to dissipate more rapidly   So while I recognize that the economy is vulnerable to shocks and that there are many   potential shocks, including the looming potential in Europe, I think we’re closer than we might   realize to completing the debt burden cycle  And there are some possible policy actions that   could speed us closer to some potential positive shocks as well  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support alternative B with the language “at   least through mid-2013,” not because I think that’s optimal, but because, as I said yesterday, if   we made a change to it this time, it might be considered, given all the discussion about   communication in the intermeeting period, our final choice, and I don’t think we’ve made a final   choice  In making a final choice, I could support one that referenced time, such as the six to   seven quarters  I could support one that was formulated as a prime or a double prime as long as   we all agreed that that’s how we were going to do it going forward  I do have some preference   for referring it to the projections, the SEP, in some way and tying it to those   With regard to the word “significant,” I think the risks are significant, and taking that   word out, it seems to me, would be a standing down from that position  So I would prefer to   leave it in   November 1–2, 2011 225 of 282              As to additional asset purchases, and specifically MBS, I would very much be in favor of   weighting any purchases we were going to do toward MBS, but that goes only part of the way    That affects the spread between Treasuries and the MBS securities  It’s not as effective at this   point in affecting the spread between Treasuries and the rates that are actually offered to   homeowners, and paying more attention to that piece also makes sense  We have within this   System probably the largest collection—certainly of economic research resources that are   available to the government, and I think making our assets available as technical assistance to   parts of the government that can actually make changes that will improve the housing market and   the ability of borrowers to access the low rates that we’re working on is something that we can   do  And certainly, anywhere that our regulatory supervisory policies can be supportive, that’s an   important thing to do as well  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you  President Fisher, I had a lot of the same concerns about what   this said in terms of the difference in the borrowing rates to our banks versus the foreign central   banks  But here is the reason I’ve come out on the side of doing nothing with the primary credit   rate at this point  First of all, I think there would certainly be some risk that in communicating   the reduction in the primary credit rate, you could get some speculation as to what US banks we   were reducing it for and what the reason—changes in financial conditions in US banks—for   that was  To the extent that it actually did encourage usage of our discount window at the same   time, there’s always the speculation as to who’s in there using that rate  Also, we will be   reporting to the Congress who was using the discount window  All of that seemed to me to raise   a lot of questions that might actually be more harmful to US banks than not  Finally, if you   haven’t lowered it yet, you can always lower it  And if there does get to be a very public   November 28, 2011 29 of 40              criticism about the difference in the rates, then you can very specifically respond to that criticism   by changing the rate, and it seems to me that the communication challenge is a little bit easier   then  Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Now I think I finally understand what it must   have been like to be a European central banker in 2008  No wonder they kept calling you and   urging you to act  I would imagine that in those dark days, they were the ones having to consider   the possible spillover from our financial crisis to their financial markets, the threat to their   financial institutions, the reduction in global demand from the loss of our consumer spending     And now I see how frustrating it must have been not to be able to forecast how and when it   might be resolved, much less to have a hand in resolving it, but to know that what we did would   impact their economy more than what they did   I confess to being somewhat surprised and disappointed to see the downgrade in the   Tealbook baseline forecast, driven in large part by increasing pessimism over the situation in   Europe, even while domestic data came in a bit stronger than expected  Given that my   comments at the last meeting were the most optimistic, and maybe even the only optimistic view   at the table, I went back to those observations to see if I wanted to back up on them a bit  But I   don’t  I do think that the balance sheets of households, businesses, and financial institutions   continue to strengthen, and all of my conversations with bankers confirmed a continuation of the   same banking conditions   With the exception of residential mortgage lending, I don’t think spending is being held   back by debt burdens or credit availability  In fact, banks are actually seeing some increases in   commercial lending, including commercial real estate  And even though European lenders are   pulling back in business and commercial real estate lending, those holes are apparently being   December 13, 2011 70 of 198              filled seamlessly by other banks, mostly from the US but some from Japan and Canada  Even   in the mortgage banks, I believe there are things that can be done  New policies that are being   introduced are gaining acceptance that can improve the last area of severe credit problems     Indeed, stronger retail sales, a pickup in auto lending and auto sales, indicators of robust   early holiday spending—including significant growth in credit and debit card transaction   volumes—signs of improvement in employment data, and better readings on consumer   confidence all lead me to believe that it is possible that some pent-up demand from consumers   might finally be showing up just as catch-up business capital expenditures start to fade   My outlook for 2012 and 2013 is for slightly better performance than the baseline in the   Tealbook, closer to the “Faster Snapback” or “Faster European Recovery” scenarios  I do   recognize the risk to this outlook from the situation in Europe  If that goes badly, my forecast   doesn’t matter  I understand that lower readings on personal disposable income and the saving   rate do not support continued improvement in consumer spending   The Congress could certainly fail to extend the payroll tax cuts, extended unemployment,   the Medicare doc fix, spending bills, or gridlock again on something else critical that I can’t even   think of right now  I’ve assumed achingly slow but still measurable progress in the resolution of   housing and mortgage foreclosure issues that may not materialize  The most daunting risk for   me is that my assessment is noticeably brighter than that of all the trained economists and   complex models we use  [Laughter]  However, even in the most optimistic scenario, inflation   barely touches 2 percent  So none of my optimism about the outlook makes me reluctant to take   action that could firm the momentum that I see developing  In fact, I think it is important to   support strengthening where we can find it, so that it can finally break through if we ever catch a   break  Thank you, Mr Chairman   December 13, 2011 71 of 198               Thank you, Mr Chairman  I prefer Alternative B  The assessment of   current economic conditions and the outlook for the future in Alternative B is closer to my own,   but I also think that the darker tone and the unexpected actions contained in Alternative A—  coming on the heels of recent stronger spending and employment readings—could actually   create alarm in markets and spook what little confidence is emerging in households and   businesses  I do believe that additional MBS purchases could be positive for the housing sector   December 13, 2011 104 of 198              and the economy in a number of ways  However, any action we take will be more effective if we   first resolve our communication strategy   With the exception of a potential blowup in Europe that would require its own unique   reaction and perhaps swamp our available tools, I don’t think there’s a large risk in waiting to   act, and by waiting we pick up the additional benefit of perhaps a bit more clarity on the   direction of spending, income, and employment, and there is always the outside chance that   something will resolve more positively in Europe  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I would also like to acknowledge the work of   the subcommittee  This is a difficult task, and I recognize that dealing with me was a big part of   the difficulty  [Laughter]   December 13, 2011 164 of 198              I would like to start at the statement of longer-run goals and policy strategy  With the   addition of the paragraph on employment that President Lacker would not have written, I can   accept the statement  And I agree that if it’s adopted, it should be a living, breathing document,   subject to revision, but that is with recognition of the effort that it took to wrestle this beast to the   ground the first time  [Laughter]  I will not object to its adoption, not in a straw poll, not in an   official vote, and not in a speech  That doesn’t mean, however, that I think it is a great idea  I   still don’t see that it adds real clarity to the public understanding of our framework  It will be   viewed, for all the intricate language of the compromise, as an inflation target at about the level   the public thought it would be   The subcommittee has carefully drafted this statement to eliminate most objections,   including mine  And as heroic as that effort has been, in doing so, I fear they have created a   document that is subject to varying interpretations, both in this room and on the outside  And I   agree with Governor Tarullo that agreement on the statement doesn’t necessarily equate to   agreement on principles  So if I don’t think it adds information, I do think that it has the   potential to stir up political heat on all sides  But as I said, I won’t object   As to the inclusion of the fed funds projections in the SEP, I have similar feelings  I   don’t object to their inclusion  They will confirm, for all to see, that there is definitely a range of   views about the appropriate path of the fed funds rate, and they will provide some clarity about   the degree of that variation  But for those who think that publishing these forecasts might signal   that rates will be low for a long time, what I see from the sample actually goes in the other   direction  Moreover, I think they will limit the effectiveness of any potential statement, such as   the one that was offered in option A  It is hard to make a credible statement that the Committee   now anticipates that economic conditions are likely to warrant this exceptionally low range for   December 13, 2011 165 of 198              the federal funds rate at least through the end of 2014, when in fact only four respondents   expected the first increase to come later than 2014  Similarly, the projections for unemployment   and inflation in those time frames may not line up  As a matter of fact, they did not line up   between the language in option A and the sample in the December 2 memo  I am all for   transparency in communication  But as we add new information, it becomes nearly impossible   to take it back, even if it no longer conveys the message that we want to send   The additional attention to the SEP that has been achieved in the press conferences is a   positive step  But I would caution that as we add more communication devices, such as the   statements on exit and long-run strategy, and as we add more information to the SEP and to the   meeting statement, that we need to pay attention to the consistency of the message across all of   these Committee communications, or we will confuse the public or, worse, lose the credibility of   those communications  It is bad enough when we create cacophony as we each speak in our   individual capacities about our different viewpoints  It will be an even bigger problem if our   Committee communications themselves send conflicting signals  Thus, depending on the   contour of the SEP projections that we publish, I can envision scenarios where we might be   limited in the forward guidance that we can credibly include in the meeting statement   I would urge caution, as President Pianalto and President Kocherlakota have suggested,   that before we move forward with publishing everyone’s individual projections, we also look at   the potential for crafting a Committee projection  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Yes  My preference would be not to, but I don’t object to doing them, as I   said    That’s an abstention  [Laughter]    Could I go back to the straw vote and vote present?
