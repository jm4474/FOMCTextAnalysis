89,1976-06-22,LILLY,  There are many old familiar faces around this table  I’m glad to be with you  all again  
117,1976-07-19,LILLY,"  Before you have a show of hands, could I ask a question?  When you  considered this before, did you consider the [unintelligible] that there is an electronic recording  made of the same and just keep the recording?    That’s not my point  Is a recording made and why not just file the  recording?  I don’t want to ask that question, I want to know if that was considered?  I don’t  want to start a debate  "
187,1976-10-19,LILLY,"  Well, as some of you know, I have been concerned about the uneasiness and  the uncertainty in the economy for the last several months, and I asked Lyle and Jerry if they  would not modify some of their near-term assumptions and construct a new scenario which  would be more consistent with a straight extrapolation of what we’ve been experiencing in the  last--since about last June     Well, their first exercise, they persuaded me, was perhaps a little too strenuous, so they  came up with some modifications of their near-term [unintelligible] assumptions, which may  very well be more consistent with what’s going to happen than what we assume is going to  happen  In this they came up with a saving rate to rise slightly in ’77, business fixed investment  to rise 10-1/2 percent, 6 percent real, rather than the 15-1/2 percent which they have now; net  exports reduced by about $4 billion--1/3 of what we have in ’77; and residential construction  activity in real terms continues to rise early in ’77 but edges back later on     The effect of all of this, and the reason that I had this done, was to give me a downside risk  factor, and the effect of it is a real growth of GNP at about 2-1/2 percent annual rate over the  next five quarters, versus the 5 percent in the Greenbook  And it leaves the unemployment rate  at 7-3/4 percent at the end of ’77, about 1 percentage point above the projected level  This is  closer to my view of what is likely to happen than the staff’s projections    I have a recession scenario if you’d like it    I brought this up at the business council  They were attributing it to the coal  strike    Last week  Last Friday  They were hoping that it was more than that, but at  this point they’re attributing it to the coal strike      I have no quarrel with Ml and M2 of 5 to 9 and 9 to 13  I do feel that a little  more ease is indicated than would come with a midpoint of 4-7/8, so I’d favor the 4-1/4 to 5-1/4      I would join the forces to say make no changes because I am so concerned  about the announcement effect    "
209,1976-11-08,LILLY,"  Well, Mr Chairman, I very much share Governor Partee’s feelings  Before I  do speak, however, I would like to hear what Lyle has to say and what Steve has to say in answer  to Chuck’s questions    I need a piece of paraphernalia    Well, I share the concern regarding the economy, and I also share the  concern about the longer-range implications of allowing M1 to increase at too rapid a rate   However, I do feel at this point that if we bring the upper range of M1 down to 6-1/2, there ought  to be an appropriate adjustment upwardly in M2 and M3  And I’m looking at alternative B, on  page 5 of the Bluebook, which I would have M1 at 4-1/2 to 6[-1/2]--    I’ll be glad to read what I see in front of me    Alternative B as presently in front of you is M1, 4-1/2 to 7; M2, 8-1/2 to  10-1/2; and M3, 10 to 12  I would propose alternative B with one modification  M1, 4-1/2 to  6-1/2; M2, at 8-1/2 to 10-1/2; and M3 at 10 to 12  "
226,1976-11-16,LILLY,"  Well, there’s been a lot of conversation here, and some of the remarks  [indicate] that businessmen think the rate structure is too high  I agree with that, and the reason  that I do is that, in the short-term rates, it’s part of the cost of the product, and it’s too high  It’s  related to cost of sales, and if it came down, it certainly would have some impact on pricing the  product  The long-term rate is related to capital investment  The lower that long-term rate is, the  more likelihood there is of a surge of capital investment  So, on that kind of a basis, I would like  to see the funds rate at 4-3/4  How you get there, I don’t know  I kind of liked Phil Coldwell’s  4-1/4 to 5, and I concur in Henry’s and Chuck’s M1 and M2 numbers  "
252,1976-12-20,LILLY,"  Well, I think the words are reversed, but far be it from me, at this point--    Could I ask if the new subcommittee that will be taking up where these  gentlemen left off will take into consideration what would be the best operation of this  Committee if it’s required that we release--two days or 24 hours after we make a decision--our  objective for the next 30 days?  Making a prediction, in other words, that that’s the next thing  facing us--it may well be that this whole procedure, which seems satisfactory now, will not be  satisfactory in that kind of time [sequence]    [Unintelligible]    Well, I wish I knew more about what is happening this week in the retail  sales area; maybe it is just the time to be jolly  I must say that I am beginning to become a little  more bullish than I was, and I really expect a quickening of capital expenditures in the near  future in spite of the surveys that you have, and I think it is because of the long-term rates and  the emergence of Carter’s image as something less than a wild-eyed spender  I think there is a  confidence factor building up, and I would only hope that we would allow the rates to drift  downward as much as possible without threatening the aggregates    It’s still early in the winter, though; there is time for it to snow    I want to point out to you, though, as an old admirer of snow, the main snow  fall is in February and March, large snowfall--    Unusual circumstances in New England  There may be some implications  for monetary policy in what they did out in Colorado--called in the Indians to do a dance   SPEAKER(?)  Our Indians are busy with lawsuits against the State of Maine    Well, I feel the same way  As you know, I think the long-term rate is very  important, and although an eighth isn’t very much, it does have a leverage effect on longer-term  rates, and I would come out for a 4 to 5 funds rate  "
282,1977-01-17,LILLY,"  Mr Chairman, I hope the record will have your comments written in    It’s almost a repurchase agreement   SPEAKER(?)  Yes,   SPEAKER(?)  It’s what it is    It has the same effect    That will be in a written record?    Would you like a motion?     1/17-18/77 - 9 -            So moved    I use “repurchase agreement,” you don’t criticize that    But what would be the difference between being under Sunshine?  You  make the assumption you’re under it vis à vis the way we’re operating now  Forgetting all of  those [unintelligible], what would be the basic difference?    But those I don’t--the ones that he listed in his opening remarks--    That isn’t my question    My question is, is there some fundamental operating difference--like the  release of the minutes  Assuming that we could close the meetings, either being under the law or  not under it, which I gather, is the fundamental difference, then in the one case we can wait 30  days and in the other case we couldn’t?    Well, as you know, since last summer I have been the bear of the outfit  I  have been quite concerned [about] the course the economy was taking, partly as a result of the  actions of the Committee this last fall and other factors  I’ve now become very bullish, and I feel  that we are about to see a marked improvement in the capital expenditure area  I suspect that  those requests for investment approval are just now moving through the industrial hierarchy, and  in about 60 days you’ll see a substantial improvement  I’m now concerned that the economy  may heat up a little faster than we would like it to    Well, I don’t want to get into a long argument about the future, because it is  too unpredictable, but I do think, when you have a very strong retail sales stream here that we  didn’t have before--it goes back to Thanksgiving--that’s my basis for my feeling on capital  expenditures    In the longer run or shorter run?    Most businessmen, if they think there’s going to be a substantial increase in  the next two quarters, will cover themselves  But you might call that a speculation or you might  also call that hedging    May I ask a question?  In the past construction of the long-term rates, did  you assign a weighting to the three Ms for the longer-terms?    I have no problem with alternative B as far as M1 and M2 are concerned  If  I’m right about the economy having bottomed out, starting out it may well be that we will need a  5-1/4 rate  If I’m wrong, it may well be that we need a 4-1/4 rate  So I would vote 4-1/4 to  5-1/4  "
307,1977-02-15,LILLY,"  What are you going to do with yours?    Well, I have to hasten to get in on the statement about businessmen’s  worries  I think that what you describe has become a kind of a way of life  And they’re used to  this; at this point, I think they’re just going ahead  My own view is the economy is going at a  very fine rate, as Chuck says  I am concerned that perhaps too much liquidity [is] in the  economy  And this bothers me more than anything else at this point     I’m not too worried about the capacity problem  I think there is an international  [unintelligible] that we [unintelligible]--furthermore, I think that all of you are paying too much  attention to manufacturing, which is only 19 million employed even though there is a multiplier   [Unintelligible] the great job [unintelligible] has got to come in other areas    Well, I’m not going to make a big, long speech, either  I’m only going to  echo what Chuck said, except that I want to make one point  I think it’s going to be easier now  to move to 5-1/4 than it will be a month from now, two months from now  It might be prudent  now to go to 4-1/4 to 5-1/4, [with] the midpoint of 5/8 going to 3/4  Otherwise, I’m in perfect  agreement with B     How would you feel if it didn’t violate the spirit?     Just a question of how this would be carried out  As I understand, if this  were adopted in the Committee’s directive and instructed in this form, on page 3 we would show  the weekly average federal funds rate of about 4-5/8--     4-5/8 to 4-3/4    4-1/4 to 5, which gives you the little range within the big range   "
334,1977-03-15,LILLY,"  I would move that the nominations be closed and that the Secretary be  instructed to cast a unanimous ballot for the nominees contained on the slate   SPEAKER(?)  Second the motion    Well, I have a little concern, Jerry, with your projection regarding chemicals  and the primary metals and other industrial materials  I think the last couple of weeks there has  been a substantial pushing up of prices in this area, and I am wondering if we are giving  sufficient attention to it, because this could be the precursor of rather substantial increases in  prices all the way through the manufacturing sector    Well, I am concerned that it may be the beginning of a trend rather than an  episode of it     3/15/77 - 10 -            I think increase in demand    May I ask a technical question?  Wouldn’t that show up if this was being  financed in the funds market?  Wouldn’t that show up in other liabilities?    Well, then, have you had a verification of it?    Well, I’m somewhat more bullish than the staff  However, I agree with your  ranges for M1 and M2  I would like to repeat what I said last month; if I can see the outer limits  [for the federal funds rate] from 4-1/4 to 5-1/4, it’s just that it is easier to get that 5-1/4 in there  now than it will be a month from now  I like the 4-5/8 to 4-3/4 midpoint  "
360,1977-04-19,LILLY,"  You mentioned a couple of times the President’s stated objective of the 4  percent [inflation] rate in ’79  I guess I could have asked the staff a question long before the  meeting, but the [President’s speech] wasn’t available all that time  What should the rate of  growth of M1 and M2 be in 1979 and late in 1978 to have this kind of condition occur at the end  of 1979?  That’s the question I have  Are we taking a step toward achievement of that objective?    I have no quarrel with the recommended course    Well, I’d like to associate myself with alternative B and the 4-1/2 to 5-1/4  range  If we take seriously what we just disposed of not so long ago, I think this is an interim  step, and I would hope that we don’t restrict the growth of M1 by an increase in the funds rate at  a very inappropriate time  "
388,1977-05-17,LILLY,"  Well, I think, John, isn’t this pretty well isolated down around San Diego,  the intensity of this boom?     Even less than Southern California, as I remember your board meeting last  week  They talked about how, really, around San Diego--    Well, if you will remember when you were talking about a speech you were  giving on this subject, I suggested you say that, until we have an energy policy, there’s more  uncertainty than ever  And the minute that all of the proposals have gone to Congress, we have  had some kind of a policy--I guess you’d call it a no-policy policy--on energy  Now we have a  series of proposals for a policy which is adding even more to the confusion, and until the  Congress works through the package, the uncertainty is going to be higher, and that’s why I  thought it was appropriate that you suggest to the Congress that they hustle the thing along     There is a great deal of uncertainty right now  However, people are also feeling very good   I’m a little surprised to find this group feeling as somewhat depressed as it is  All of the  directors meetings that I’ve been to around the country have been uniformly bullish  I went  down to the Business Council meeting last Friday, and other than this squabble with [special  adviser to the President on energy, James] Schlesinger, they were very bullish  I’m concerned     5/17/77 - 18 -           that there may be too much bullishness in the air, and I’m concerned about some lag effects in  what’s happening in the interest rate structure    Well, I’m glad to be almost at the last because, as the meeting started out, I  had kind of a sense of dismay about whether I was going to be able to voice my theory  But then  Frank spoke up, and now I have somebody to speak against  Thank you, Frank  We have moved  70 to 80 basis points since last January, depending on how you figure it  It’s 72 to 84 basis  points, and I think that’s a rather significant movement, particularly when it takes us right back  to where we were [in] June a year ago  And my feeling is that we ought to look for some lag  effects and make sure that we haven’t moved too rapidly before we go any further     And I, therefore, think this  I don’t find that there’s a great deal of difference between any  of what I’ve heard, and I would associate myself with Chuck’s position just because of a little  more flexibility  And that’s zero to 4 [for M1], 5 to 8 [for M2], and the 5 to 5-3/4 [for the federal  funds rate] with the midpoint--one of those wonderful things that this Committee decides a  midpoint is--another range, 5-1/4 to 5-3/8  "
405,1977-05-27,LILLY,  Lilly agrees  
424,1977-06-21,LILLY,"  I think, when you listen to businessmen comment, you forget that they look  at you as “Washington,” and it’s an opportunity for them to sound off on what they think is the  matter with the government and their state of affairs  I think lot of what you hear is being  addressed to trying to correct the situation in Washington rather than reflecting their own state of  affairs  Because business is damn good--     --let’s not kid ourselves    Well, they just hate Washington  All of the regulations are driving them up  the wall  The biggest problem they have is that, instead of having no energy policy, we have a  non-energy policy now  No one has been able to make any plans in terms of where to put a plant  because they just don’t know what’s going to happen in the energy field  And until that energy  policy question is cleared up, I think you are going to have a great deal of hesitancy on  expansion of industrial capacity  [Unintelligible] its business is damn good, and they all will  admit it privately, but they won’t agree that the government is damn good  And that I think is  what you are hearing--    I’m not speaking of any specific government, I’m just saying--    I do, too    Another thing you should also be concerned about--as a concern about the  future--and that’s the farmer  And I do not agree with Jerry in terms of the estimated price  increases  In farm products, I think you got a situation where you are going to have a bumper  crop--that’s certainly the way it looks today--and it’s going to have a downward pressure on  prices, both meat prices and grain prices    SPEAKER(?)  Mr Chairman?    Well, I just wanted to point out that they would be unable to build 1978  models until the legislation that was in front of the Congress to reduce the emission standards  was passed  I’m very much concerned about the 11-1/2 million annual rate of autos that you  have projected, which includes the 25 percent decrease in imports, in view of the fact that  legislation has not yet passed Congress, and the Ford Motor Company in the last couple of days  announced they were going to put a ’77 label on ’78 models  I’m sure that General Motors is  going through the same kind of problem as to what they’re going to do, because the time for  production is here  Now they can, as most of you know--the ’78 models are mainly made in ’77   So they have the balance of ’77, they can build ’77 models and they can call ’78 models ’77, but  once they get to the first of January, they’re in real trouble     It’s still in conference    Well, you know, last May 25 it was expected almost daily, and nothing has  happened, and we’ve all--    Well, I don’t know    Well, here’s Ford, you know--now putting a label of ’77 on a ’78  model--incidentally that has an interesting effect because they’re going to have to sell it at ’77  prices, they think  So it’s actually coming on the market a little cheaper    I was afraid they might see that    Well, we are talking about such a small difference between B and C that I  find it difficult to have an opinion  But I must make a bow toward the longer range, and this is  what we have to do over the coming years  It would seem to me that any slight tightening  possible should be undertaken, so I would be in favor of C on that basis and the funds rate--the  range that you suggested--5-1/4 to 5-3/4, with a 5-3/8 midpoint    Are any of those balances in the funds markets?  "
450,1977-07-19,LILLY,"  Might I interrupt?  There is a great problem connected with going on LIFO   Once you have gone on LIFO, you can’t return periodically  And furthermore, you can’t even  indicate what the difference between LIFO and FIFO is in your annual statement    For reporting purposes    You can only footnote it in your annual statement    You cannot do it on your quarterly report, and on your annual report you can  always footnote it in the appendixes, and this is an Internal Revenue [Service] ruling that came  in the night    To the Census Bureau it’s an entirely different matter, but to the public  stockholders, I have gone through this point personally     The main item in the GAF [general merchandise, apparel, and furniture] area  is a thing that’s happening--decreasing the number of items available    Well, I can’t disagree with the staff  I think they’re somewhat on the bullish  side, but you ask if there are any significant differences  I don’t have any significant differences   I do have something that I want to underscore that you mentioned a couple of times--the fact that  we may be working very hard here to create the conditions that will lead to increased  employment  But whatever we do here can be more than offset by the passage of the minimum  wage law with the indexing feature, which is in it for the first time  I think that, in terms of the  minority groups in this country and the teenagers, this could be one of the most catastrophic  things that could happen    It’s certainly counterproductive to correct the situation--    I have nothing further to add  I think Chuck pretty well stated my feeling,  and I would support your proposal    That was my question  Our normal procedure would be to move deliberately  toward the midpoint, wouldn’t it, unless you were given other instructions?    The staff would create [unintelligible] good reason to move, then I would  support your proposal  "
476,1977-08-16,LILLY,"  Well, Willis Winn and I, last week, had a meeting in Cleveland with a very  representative cross section of the industrial world, and we gained some insights there as to what  their thinking was, and I’d like to hear [Mr Winn] summarize it  Unless you were--    That’s the worst condition--no volume    There’s a great concern about the loss [on the] capital gains tax  There is a  great concern about inflation and the loneliness of the Fed and it’s position  They’re very bullish  as to the rate of capital investment expenditures    You have a good proxy for this capacity abroad, in the sense, when you look  at all the people that are asking for import quotas, you get a pretty good sense as to who is faced  with a [capacity] overhang abroad, to wit, the steel industry being number one, and the TV  people being number two    Now what are our alternatives going to be?    Lower    I’d like to see all the questions     8/16/77 - 22 -            I expect it to continue    While I was very interested in your new M1, I only wish that you had  included in there the nondeposit source of funds, which I think really belong in M1  That’s  where all the corporate treasurers are squirreling away money today that they have raised from  long-term borrowings, and it’s overnight money--it’s a great deal more ready to be spent than  savings accounts     As far as the program presented is concerned, I favor, not terribly strongly, the 0 to 5 [for  M1], the 3 to 8 [for M2], and a 5-3/4 to 6-1/4 [federal funds rate] with the money market  directive  The reason for that--I think 157 basis points since April and 62 basis points [in] July  deserves some stopping and waiting    I have to take the opposite side from Steve  I feel very strongly that we are  making a great deal out of nothing  There’s nothing in the Memoranda, as I understand it, that is  damaging to anybody; it’s all old history  And [denial] just [attributes to] us the same attitude  that we’re accused of--being overly secretive for no real purpose  I would be very much in favor  of giving permission  We’re going to look very strange in court without the Justice Department  representing us    Why wouldn’t--in other words, if we’re forced right up against it, we might  yield    Out of court  But why do we take that position?  What is there damaging  about releasing this now?    We have already changed our facts  We are defending a practice that we no  longer follow    No, but we no longer keep this kind of Memorandum, we no longer do that    I don’t understand the purpose of the Hannaford amendment other than that  it would provide more detail for some future historian    Does five months’ difference make--is it all that much difference?    In the first place, I think, I’ll pick up Phil’s remarks  I think times have  changed since four years [and] seven months ago  We’ve had two very significant pieces of  legislation that both say this is no longer appropriate, this keeping things for five years    Well, we have [the] Sunshine in [the] Government [Act] and we have the  Freedom of Information Act    It is my understanding that the legal opinion now is that if we went to court,  we would not have a good chance of winning this case    Is that correct, Tom?    Could I ask one thing more  I would be concerned if we looked like we  were trying to put this information out on a defensive basis  However, the record is very clear  that we are very reluctant to put this information out and it’s only after [unintelligible]  I don’t  think anybody could accuse us of rushing out there with the minutes to prove--    We said that any segregated portion of the Memoranda would be [so]  fragmented as to be unintelligible and virtually useless to use  "
505,1977-09-20,LILLY,"  You have become converted    You are only reflecting the differences in your crop structures  You have a  very large wheat percentage in total agricultural output, whereas Mark has substantially less    Well, I have little that I can add  I agree that business is good, but I would  point out, in the practice of medicine, that after a certain time in life, doctors are more concerned  with the maintenance of the patient than his growth  And I think that’s a problem we’re faced  with for this patient, which is somewhat beyond the point where you’re worried about its growth   I would agree with Henry that an incomes policy would seem to be appropriate, but I don’t quite  see how the [Federal] Open Market Committee can get into the incomes policy--    But I’m suggesting we consider it--not at this time    I can  A much higher funds rate    I didn’t  Maintenance of the present growth rate    I’m not sure I understood what you both are talking about on the funds  range  You were talking about 6-1/8 and then--    Asymmetrical    Well, as I mentioned earlier, I share with Henry the view that the economy is  not very strong, and the recovery is fragile, in my opinion  And I think that we are attacking a  structural problem [with] a monetary shotgun, if I may create a phrase  The targets that I find at  the high end, if not at the limit of my restriction and tolerance, are the 3 to 8 [M1], 5 to 9 [M2],  and the 6 to 6-1/2 [federal funds rate] with the 6-1/8 asymmetrical midpoint  And I would really  lean more toward Henry’s prescription than that    I’d add one thing, and that would be an asymmetrical 6-1/8    Before you do that, can I explore a little as to why the last proposal of Phillip  Coldwell, which brought me around, picked up a vote, is not closer to the compromise than the  first one?  "
529,1977-10-17,LILLY,"  Not quite yet    Got a few more percentage points    Yes, this is Government in the Sunshine   October 18, 1977    Well, last month, as you remember, I was nervous about the economy, and  I’m a little more nervous this month  I think the growth of the economy is dependent on  consumer expenditures, housing markets, and an increasing rate of capital expenditure, and I  haven’t seen any of those factors improve somewhat  In fact, I think it’s going the other way, if  anything  Beyond that I’m very much concerned about the life of its own of the structural  inflation [unintelligible]  Every time I pick up the paper, I hear of something else that has been  done to add to these hard-core inflation pressures--705 government pay increase, some of the  wage settlements that are coming through, the minimum wage action, the protective trade quota  noises that I hear--all giving me great concern, and I’m wondering if monetary policy--well, I’m  getting a little ahead of myself at this point     10/17-18/77 - 27 -          We are now a legislative body; they do this all the time    You want the time to march forward now  We’ve got this one back here--we  can put the chimes on it    Well, I think that one thing that’s come out quite clear in the discussion  today, is that we really don’t know what’s going on in M1  And until we do know, it seems to  me ill advised to be making any changes whatsoever in our longer-range projections  And I  agree with Phil Jackson in the sense that I think we should [unintelligible] on M2, which I think  is more indicative of what’s going on in the aggregates at the present time  And I feel quite  comfortable in your 7 to 9 on M2 and your 8-1/2 to 10-1/2 for M3 because, given historical  velocity rates, I think that that’s only slightly restrictive  I wouldn’t change M1, simply because  I don’t know what we’re doing    Well, in view of the uncertainty of the market and our trying to find out  where we’re at and whether these bulges are [so out of hand], I certainly like alternative B, but  I’d like very much the money market directive  "
559,1977-11-15,LILLY,"  Well, following up on Henry’s earlier question, just from a pragmatic point  of view, what, in your view, Tom, is the likelihood of the Supreme Court overturning this  appellate court?    Given that situation, what are the probabilities of a congressional action  occurring?    But not before this court’s directive becomes operative?  Given the Supreme  Court denial?    Shouldn’t there be some contingency planning in the interim here as to--?    I’m not really concerned about--this is a 15-day period we’ve got  Well, it’s  going to be 15 days from this event before this directive will be released, if we lose  I don’t  think that that is a terrible state of affairs  But what I’m concerned about is that, on the first of  December, we have contingency plans, [and] that we’re all in thorough agreement that, if we  lose on that date, we’ll follow [those plans]  That’s what’s bothering me--that we wait until the  first of December before we decide what our contingency plans would be    Could I ask a procedural question?  Because, as I understand this, the  [Sub]committee on the Directive is trying to work on a new procedure to be followed in the  event that the courts do not allow our case--    But will a decision have been made by this Committee by December 1 as to  what it’s going to do if the court throws it out, or the Solicitor General--    We’ve got 20 days after December 1 to decide what you’re going to do at  the next meeting    All I’m driving for is that there be in train some very tough contingency  planning for the December 20 meeting    All right  Well, that clarifies my question  We will have alternatives in case  we lose    I had to defend the actions of the Desk in a couple of meetings around the  country in the last week  As a matter of intelligence that I should have ascertained before, when  was the last time we sold against the Treasury auction?    It also was alleged that we had done the same sort of thing as little as a  month or six weeks ago    During the auction    Well, tranquility having been achieved, I certainly am not one to want to  change the pleasant state of affairs  However, I agree with Phil Jackson, [and] I’m guessing that  in the longer run you are going to look at a funds rate that’s going to fluctuate more  I would say     11/15/77 - 37 -         I would like to see the 2 to 7 [percent for M1], just on the basis that, maybe if the funds rate does  have to go down there, it’s not a bad situation  So I’m for alternative B with 2 percent [lower  limit on M1]    I haven’t  I’ll go for the money market  "
584,1977-12-19,LILLY,"  Well, the analysis I think I’ve heard here is very interesting, but I have not  caught what the alternative is  What is the program that we should be following?      Both     12/19-20/77 - 39 -          Any kind of intervention that would be meaningful to us, then, is a long way  down the road      I’m on this program by mistake  I heard you suggest we might get through  early, so I volunteered not to speak, and therefore got put on the agenda  So being here, I will  speak very briefly  I agree with the forecast in general  I am coming around to a tentative  hypothesis that perhaps our business fixed investment forecasts are optimistic  I’m beginning to  think that perhaps the manufacturing side has achieved an efficiency of investment that we  haven’t really gotten hold of and that capacity has been increased substantially without any new  structures of significance     In addition to that, I think there has been a lot of capacity that’s been displaced overseas-- and I think your comments were very interesting--but nevertheless I think some of our raw  materials are permanently going to be coming from overseas  We haven’t had any refineries  built in this country in seven years  You heard the aluminum people a few days ago tell us they  hadn’t any plans to build any aluminum refineries in this country  So it may well be that the  staff is a little on the optimistic side on the business fixed investment, and I hope I’m wrong on  that     I think we’re in a kind of minor boom  We have the highest percentage of our population  employed today that we have had in history as I know it, and we have added 8 million jobs,  roughly, since the trough, and we are going to add 22 million more next year, and that’s just a  fantastic addition to the labor force, and it’s a fantastic performance  We are still going to end  up with an unemployment number that is not going to be satisfactory, and it certainly points up  the need for structural programs of the kind you are talking of  If business fixed investment is  not going to eventuate, we certainly are going to be dependent on the consumer, and he needs a  lot of care  See what you get for putting me on?    Well, factories are being expanded today by the addition of new wings or  rearranged to increase line productivity, rather than the selection of a new site and the  construction of the new 1/2 million square foot facility  And you see some verification of this  when you see that the machine tool figures are pretty good and other short-term things are good   This looks to me like some people are making do with their fixed real estate investments, and  they are really squeezing out additional capacity from those facilities    That’s part of services    What kind of labor settlements have they been making?    I’m fine with your specifications    I can tell you what that is about  That’s when they’re putting the directors of  the banks under 208, making them criminally liable--    We are  "

625,1978-01-17,LILLY,"  You suggested the selling of US bonds in European money markets  I gather   you’re talking about mark-denominated bonds  Or are you talking about--     Before the thunder, could I ask another question?     What is the impact going to be on those money markets of a massive sale of   bonds by the United States?  Isn’t that going to raise hell with their rates?     Doesn’t either one of these operations tend to put upward pressure on their   rates, thereby narrowing the differential between them and us?     1/17/78             10     Tell us how you do that!     [We] can do it in April again      Well, yes  I was going to state it a different way  I think what is occurring is   that plants are being recycled; [we’re seeing] new equipment and rearrangements within plants but  we’re not getting new plants  You have an increase in capacity as well as an increase in  productivity of some kind, but you also have a diminution in the pressure for longer-term  investment  I also think that new plants by and large have been built abroad  This is only a  hypothesis, but I think it’s one worth exploring  It may well be that our capacity figures are not                         1/ Secretary’s note  At this point the Executive Session ended       1/17/78             29  accurate at all and in terms of the total industrial [complex] we may actually have a great deal more  capacity than our capacity measurements indicate  I got ahead of myself      Do you use the peso down there?     Well, just to finish up what I started with in answer to Frank’s question, for the   reasons I gave I don’t expect business fixed investment to spurt in the next year  So we are back  where we’ve been right along and that’s dependent on the consumer  I think I agree with the  general comments I’ve heard here that the next six months are going to be reasonably good because  we do have an inventory building program that’s going to have to go on  But I’m very worried  about the second six months and I’m going to have a great deal of interest in watching from the  outside what happens here, as signals are sent out as to what [the Committee is] going to do about  the economy in the second six months [of the year]      6625 to 7125     I just wanted to be sure we had the third decimal point correct!     Well, as one of the troika who voted not to increase the [funds] rate last time, I     1/17/78             49  thoroughly agree that the last thing we should do is try to retreat to that old rate  I would say,  however, that I am very much concerned about the state of all of these markets  The money market  has certainly been going through some real gyrations; the international market has certainly been  going through a lot  And the stock market is reflecting some uneasiness--all of which says to me  that now is the time to pause and hold our breath and wait for things to cool off a little  I  particularly feel this way because we are so close to a substantial disintermediation point  So I’d  come down for alternative B with a money market directive and a 675 to 7 percent range, with  675 being the middle  I’m not quite sure how that works!  What I’m saying is don’t move from  that 675 percent until you just really have to      Oh, I left a zero out on that!   "
