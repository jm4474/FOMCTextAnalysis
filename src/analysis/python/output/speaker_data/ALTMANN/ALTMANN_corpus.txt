Mr Chairman, this is Murray Altmann If everyone would take the next call in their conference rooms, we can get everybody on the same circuit So I would ask you to be present in the conference room  -11-    7/19/79 -12-   Yes, sir   Yes It's a change in the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations   It can be held until the Policy Record [is released], which will be three days after the next meeting   Yes, it's a change in the foreign currency authorization   Well, we have never done it that way We've always listed the votes by name   On every change in the [authorizations and directives]   Well, it requires a vote It isn't necessarily a roll call vote, but if there are any dissents we would record that   Chairman Volcker Yes President Balles Yes President Black Yes Governor Coldwell Yes President Kimbrel Yes President Mayo Yes Governor Partee Yes Governor Rice Yes Governor Schultz Yes Governor Teeters Yes Governor Wallich Yes First Vice President Timlen Yes  Unanimous   What's your midpoint?   1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, not counting yourself   Four   It's 4 to 8 percent, 7 to 11 percent, a funds rate range of 10-3/4 to 11-1/4 percent with an 11 percent midpoint, and a money market directive  Chairman Volcker Yes President Balles Yes President Black No I agree with half of  it, but I think the ranges are too high with a money market directive   Governor Coldwell Yes President Kimbrel Yes President Mayo Yes Governor Partee Yes Governor Rice No Governor Schultz Yes  -44-    8/14/79  Governor Teeters Yes Governor Wallich Yes First Vice President Timlen Yes  It's 10 for and 2 against   9-1/2 percent    Yes, a week from Tuesday   It seems awfully quick to come     10/6/79 - 3 6 -     Three or four--I'm not sure    It's five    Twelve    1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8      Seven, again not counting you    No I didn't count Nancy    Eight   SPEAKER(?)

Last time the directive said "about" We could say "about" and I suppose that would be good enough   About 7-3/4 percent and then 13 to 20 percent on the federal funds rate range   Chairman Volcker Yes President Guffey Yes President Morris Yes Governor Partee Yes Governor Rice Yes President Roos Yes Governor Schultz Yes  -46-    3/18/80  Governor Teeters Yes First Vice President Timlen Yes Governor Wallich No President Winn Yes  Ten for, one against   There is a housekeeping amendment in one paragraph   There is just one housekeeping amendment In line with the changes in organization that the Committee approved last August, in effect changing the titles of the Managers, in paragraph 6 of the foreign currency authorization where the word "Manager" appears, we would simply change it to "Manager for Foreign Operations"  SPEAKER(?) So moved  SPEAKER(?) Second   [About] 7-3/4 percent   No   This is 4-1/2 percent on M-1A, 5 percent on M-1B, with "or somewhat less" in the case of both, and a federal funds rate range of 13 to 19 percent M2 is 6-3/4 percent; that's the alternative B specification for M2  Chairman Volcker Yes Vice Chairman Solomon Yes President Guffey Yes President Morris Yes Governor Partee Yes Governor Rice Yes President Roos Yes Governor Schultz Yes Governor Teeters Yes Governor Wallich No President Winn Yes  Ten for and one against   Six [members indicated their acceptance of 10 percent]   Chairman Volcker Yes President Guffey No President Mayo Yes President Morris Yes Governor Rice Yes President Roos Yes Governor Schultz Yes President Solomon No Governor Teeters Yes Governor Wallich No   I got Mr Mayo There were seven votes for and three against We only had ten [voting members present]   Yes It should be included in the Selected List of Actions that would be available for inspection [this coming Friday] We don't need to make a public announcement as such It would also be in the Policy Record, and any conditions attached to the increase in the line would presumably appear in the Policy Record, which might be somewhat counterproductive from their point of view May I just add simply that the Procedural Instructions with Respect to Foreign Currency Operations require that there be advance approval by the Subcommittee of any drawing up to a certain amount and by the full Committee beyond that amount So [approval of a drawing] is not automatic under our procedures   We have in the past had some reference [in the Policy Record] to the notion of a consultation but I think if [the understanding] were so specific as to be a checkpoint, it probably ought to be in the Policy Record   We didn't have a figure in the last--   Yes  SPEAKER(?) We did it differently   That has been the practice I think if it gets to be regular, it probably should be a vote   It was April 29th, wasn't it?   The point at which the consultation--   The rules of procedure provide that three members can request that a meeting be called  SPEAKER(?) Three members?   There doesn't need to be a vote   Chairman Volcker Yes Vice Chairman Solomon Yes President Guffey Yes President Morris Yes Governor Partee No Governor Rice Yes President Roos No Governor Schultz Yes Governor Teeters Yes Governor Wallich Yes President Winn Yes  It's 9 for, 2 against   It would be for the period through the 12th of August   That's correct   I can answer that perhaps by telling you what we said at this time last year After citing the ranges for 1979, the directive said "The Committee anticipates that for the period from the fourth quarter of 1979 to the fourth quarter of 1980 growth may be within the same ranges, depending upon emerging economic conditions and appropriate adjustments that may be required by legislation or judicial developments affecting interest bearing transaction accounts" That language was in the directive adopted [in July 1979] and was repeated each month   That's right   That was the decision made at the time that the Committee considered it   Now [the question is] whether we put it in the directive   It's August 12, in five weeks   From May 20  -67-    7/9/80   Chairman Volcker Yes Vice Chairman Solomon Yes Governor Gramley Yes President Morris Yes Governor Partee Yes Governor Rice Yes President Roos Yes Governor Schultz Yes Governor Teeters Yes Governor Wallich Yes President Winn Yes President Balles Yes  Unanimous, Mr Chairman   Chairman Volcker Yes Vice Chairman Solomon Yes Governor Gramley Yes President Morris Yes Governor Partee Yes President Rice Yes President Roos Yes Governor Schultz Yes Governor Teeters Yes Governor Wallich No President Winn Yes President Balles Yes  -71-    7/9/80   It's not the first time This is a reversion to what was the regular practice until the last meeting   No   It was changed at the last meeting because there were no numbers in the directive at the last meeting We simply have reverted to what has been the practice   We need approval for the minutes of March 7 and May 6 and for the regular July 9 meeting   Yes, they were telephone conferences   On June to September?   Voting members, please Five   That's for June to September   Chairman Volcker Yes Vice Chairman Solomon Yes Governor Gramley Yes President Morris Yes Governor Partee Yes Governor Rice Yes President Roos Yes Governor Schultz Yes Governor Teeters Yes Governor Wallich Yes President Winn Yes President Balles Yes  SPEAKER(?) I think you ought to congratulate Henry  -46-    8/12/80 -47-   I don't recall that we have; I'm not sure Steve might know   People could raise their hands   Seven, not counting yourself   Chairman Volcker Yes Vice Chairman Solomon Yes Governor Gramley Yes President Guffey No President Morris Yes Governor Partee Yes Governor Rice Yes President Roos No Governor Schultz Yes Governor Teeters Yes Governor Wallich No President Winn No   Eight for, four against, Mr Chairman   Now that that has been accomplished, I might say that I have just recently denied a request which is likely to provoke an appeal   No, not on these issues   No, the authorization says that the Committee should consider and approve changes in terms What we've done in the past is to have the Committee vote to authorize the Manager to conduct the negotiations toward that particular end   What we've done each year, usually in November, is to approve the renewal of the swap agreements as far as the individual currencies, central banks, the amounts, and the 12-month terms But any other changes in terms have been in the form of an authorization to the Manager to negotiate terms without our being very specific in the Minutes of Actions as to what those terms and conditions were   I'm only saying that there has been a vote   It's $1 billion in any one currency and $1-1/2 billion overall excluding the yen   And his [leeway] recommendation   And "about"?  -52-    10/21/80   Chairman Volcker Yes Vice Chairman Solomon Yes  -55-    10/21/80  Governor Gramley Yes President Guffey Yes President Morris No Governor Partee Yes Governor Rice Yes President Roos No Governor Schultz Yes Governor Teeters Yes Governor Wallich No President Winn No  It's 8 for and 4 against   Seven   Eight   Chairman Volcker Yes Vice Chairman Solomon Yes Governor Gramley Yes President Guffey Yes President Morris Yes Governor Partee Yes Governor Rice Yes President Roos Yes Governor Schultz Yes Governor Teeters No Governor Wallich Yes President Winn No  It's 10 for--   I am told that it is   Thank you If you will all stand by, we are almost ready to go We expect to have all members of the Board and the usual members of the staff Let me give you the phone number to use if you should become disconnected from the network Call us on another instrument at 202-452-3317 and we will try to get you back on the network promptly If you will bear with us for just another minute or two, I hope we can get started   Yes   Well, if there is an objection to this procedure, there really is no way to register a dissent apart from having a vote on the issue of whether to maintain the current directive or modify it in some way, which either raises the limit or provides for a temporary exception   Chairman Volcker Yes Vice Chairman Solomon Yes Governor Gramley Yes President Guffey Yes President Morris Yes Governor Partee Yes Governor Rice Yes President Roos Yes President Solomon Yes Governor Teeters No Governor Wallich No President Winn Yes  SPEAKER(?) Gee, we like these ballots don't we?   10 to 1   Henry is missing   With respect to the minutes for the meeting of November 18, we've put in front of you today the revised minutes I just wanted to call to your attention that there is an addition in the form of a Secretary's note At the November meeting, if you recall, the Committee approved renewal of the swap arrangements subject to final approval of the specific terms by the Foreign Currency Subcommittee The Secretary's note merely states that on December 1 and December 17 the Foreign Currency Subcommittee approved the provisions so that the swap agreements are, in effect, renewed Scott may want to say something about that   We are talking about minutes for three meetings November 26, December 5, and December 12   That's fine; I'll take it as--   Fine   We have the report on operations first   No, they're in the authorization and the procedural instructions   No, they have not been formal votes and thus not recorded   I don't think so   February 6th would be the day, as of now, if we have our regularly scheduled meeting If we call a meeting in between, it's not a regularly scheduled one, and I suppose we can hold this until February 6th   I have reason to believe that we couldn't have [the policy record] prepared in three weeks   February 3rd  -74-    12/18-19/80   It says weekly average   There's about a 3-week lag between when this will be published and your testimony   It's eight, not counting you   That thought could be in the policy record without being in the directive   On this Monday we will publish the directive, which had a range of 13 to 17 percent, along with the subsequent actions which raised the upper end to 18 percent and then allowed in effect for it to be exceeded   That's seven days in the weekly average   Chairman Volcker Yes Vice Chairman Solomon Yes Governor Gramley Yes President Guffey Yes President Morris Yes Governor Partee Yes Governor Rice Yes President Roos Yes Governor Schultz Yes Governor Teeters No Governor Wallich No President Winn Yes   Hold a minute Let's see whether we have any objections to [publishing the 1975 Memoranda of Discussion]   Chairman Volcker Governor Gramley President Guffey President Morris to have any guideline for M1  Yes Yes Yes Yes, with a proviso that I do   Governor Partee Yes Governor Rice Yes President Roos Yes Governor Schultz Yes Vice Chairman Solomon Yes Governor Teeters Yes, if I get a proviso in the  opposite direction that I think the M2 range is unrealistic  not want  -146-    2/2-3/81   Governor Wallich No President Winn Yes The vote is eleven for, one against   $2-1/2 billion   Directive or policy record?

I think we need to run down the list once again, which we can do quickly, to make sure we haven't lost anybody [Secretary's note All Reserve Banks reported that they had been reconnected]   He said "Any indications of institutional stress or strain?"   That's in the policy record for the March meeting, which will come out this Friday   An interpretation of the funds rate range?   You mean reiterate it in this--   Five voting members  SPEAKER(?)

Solomon No President Boehne Yes President Boykin No President Corrigan Yes Governor Gramley Yes President Keehn Yes Governor Partee Yes Governor Rice Yes Governor Schultz Yes Governor Teeters Yes Governor Wallich Yes   Well, as we said in the memo to you, these memoranda for the first three meetings of 1976 are described as unofficial because they have never been presented to the Committee for review or acceptance as we did in the old days We were under a court order to accede to requests for the segregable factual portions of the memoranda and the Committee made the decision in May of 1976 to discontinue the memoranda of discussion after the memorandum for March Those three memoranda were not presented because the drafting of them was given a low priority and they were not completed until some years later and by then the composition of the Committee had changed That is essentially the issue They could be withheld as being unofficial documents They could be withheld, I suppose, even if they were regarded as official memoranda  There is one other issue that I brought to the attention of the Chairman because I thought he should be aware of it before we put these out At both the February and March meetings there was an executive session which concerned the Merrill case--that is, the suit under the Freedom of Information Act And at the February meeting there was a report by the General Counsel on the oral decision that had been handed down by the District Court at that time, which was against the Committee, on release of the directive immediately and on release of the segregable facts in the memoranda of discussion At the February meeting the Committee agreed to the appointment of a subcommittee to consider what to do with the memoranda of discussion in light of this court decision, which was obviously troublesome in many ways At the March meeting, which was after the written decision of the court, the General Counsel again reviewed the options and the  -76-    12/21-22/81  Committee agreed to appeal the decision on the directive, but not on the memoranda of discussion As you all probably know, that case went to the Supreme Court and back to the District Court, and the District Court ruled in June of this year that the Committee or the Board did not have to release the directive immediately That was not appealed, so that is a dead issue at this point But this would probably be the first time that the System has acknowledged the link between the Merrill case and the discontinuance of the memoranda of discussion I think everyone connected with the case assumed that was the fact And in testimony before Congressional committees starting in 1977 with Chairman Burns on new legislation to require some detailed minutes, it was said that the Board would go along with that legislation provided there was an explicit relief from the requirements of the Freedom of Information Act Later testimony of Governor Coldwell and then Vice Chairman Schultz made the same points I think it was generally assumed that there was a link between the Merrill case and the discontinuation   Well, it began as a voluntary act and continued to be so in the sense that the court order only required that we provide the segregable portions of the memoranda that were factual We would have had to provide that on request But we continued to publish the entire memoranda with only those deletions made in accordance with our guidelines   I think that is the case Mr Mannion may have another--   That is correct I should have stated at the outset that in releasing these memoranda for early 1976 we would be following the schedule that we had followed for a number of years The only thing about them that is different is that they are "unofficial"   We have not put out an--   We have a prefatory note which states the situation in terms of their being called "unofficial" because they were prepared after a time lag and had not gone through the [usual review] procedure   We don't issue a press release on this   Yes, lunch is available in the anteroom for Governors and Presidents and those who have been invited to stay  END OF MEETING  -79-
