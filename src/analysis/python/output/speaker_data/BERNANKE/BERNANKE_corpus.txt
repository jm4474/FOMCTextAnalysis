 Thank you, Mr Chairman  As we search for the signal of an   incipient recovery, we have heavy noise coming from two sides  The first source of noise is the   financial markets  Our financial markets usually exhibit controlled hysteria, but lately we   probably could drop the adjective “controlled”  The stock market in particular seems to be   searching for a consensus valuation without too much luck so far  The other source of noise is   the data Of course, revisions in the data show that the recession was worse than we thought    We were always pessimistic about forecasting, and now backcasting seems to be a problem as   well! I have a modest proposal, which is that if the BEA can restate GDP figures and firms can   restate their earnings, the Fed should have the option to go back and restate interest rates from   last time  [Laughter]            August 13, 2002 55 of 92  How should we respond to these noisy conditions?  First, regarding financial markets, I   think the best thing to do is to keep our heads while all about us are losing theirs  Monetary   policy should be directed at the underlying economy and should respond to financial markets   only insofar as they contain information about or affect the underlying economy  I think on net   the effects of financial markets on the current economy are not very large The direct effects of   the stock market are being partly offset by strong house prices, lower interest rates, and a falling   dollar  It’s true that the volatility that we’re currently observing at record levels is feeding   anxiety and caution, but volatility by its nature tends to be temporary  So on net the current   market volatility in my view is an argument for waiting to see where things settle down before   taking action   Second, regarding the other source of noise, the data revisions, we can no longer blame   the shallow recession for the weak recovery  [Laughter] The economy is not booming   obviously; but looking again beyond the financial markets, it seems to be reasonably sound  In   particular, the revision has largely left intact the growth in productivity, which I believe in some   sense is the most crucial element of the recovery and bodes well for both profits and economic   growth I note the comments that Governor Kohn made about financial conditions, but overall I   think the financial headwinds are not very strong  Banks are healthy, consumer and firm balance   sheets are reasonably strong for this stage of the cycle, and a lot of what is happening in the   markets with respect to risk spreads and the like has more to do with volatility and financial   market uncertainty than with fundamental conditions    Third, the policy stances, both monetary and fiscal, remain expansionary  It’s true that   there are some uncertainties as we look forward  Consumers and the government are doing their         August 13, 2002 56 of 92  part, but firms in particular seem relatively hesitant both on the investment side and on the hiring   side   I think it’s worth noting that there’s an awful lot of heterogeneity among industries in   terms of growth potential  Certain industries—telecommunications, aircraft, commercial real   estate, and others—are doing very poorly They are suffering from overhangs, and it’s   questionable whether small changes in interest rates, for example, would substantially affect their   activity On the other hand, residential housing, autos, and consumer goods look very strong,   and other areas like equipment and software seem to be improving   My bottom line here is that there’s a lot of uncertainty and that any of the three responses   suggested in the Bluebook would not be unreasonable  But given the uncertainty that we have   now, my inclination is to wait and see and to get more information  At the same time, I don’t   think we want to appear tone deaf to legitimate concerns among the public about the state of the   economy  And I think we ought to set the stage to respond in case conditions worsen  So I   would indicate my preference to communicate either in the statement or in the balance of risks   sentence that the Fed is vigilant and is willing and able to cut rates in the future if conditions   worsen Thank you    Mr Chairman, I concur with both parts of your recommendation  In   particular, the weakening of the economy is quite evident to the public, and I think it’s important   that we show that the Federal Reserve recognizes that and is prepared to respond to it  I’d like to   add that I also agree with you that if things take a turn for the worse, we should be prepared to   act very aggressively I’m not one who worries about zero bounds, for example  In fact, one   might interpret the expected decline in the future federal funds rate as being not a certainty of a   small decline but a small probability of a larger decline  So to summarize, I do concur with your   proposal     The last time we had a Middle Eastern conflict, in the Gulf War, I   think currency went way up Is that right?        September 24, 2002 8 of 115   Thank you, Mr Chairman  I agree with many speakers today that   the recovery remains disappointingly soft  The reluctance of firms to hire or invest is   particularly discouraging given continued strong spending by consumers and the remarkable   growth of productivity The consumer and business sectors can’t diverge indefinitely  That can   be resolved in one of two ways, and one of them is rather unpleasant     A particularly striking aspect of the Greenbook forecast to me is that it envisions   continuing declines in core inflation  As shown in the table on page 11 of Part 1, the rate of   increase in the core PCE deflator is projected to fall from 19 percent in 2001 to 13 percent in   2004 Over the same period the core CPI inflation is projected to fall from 27 percent to   19 percent and growth in the GDP deflator from 20 percent to 14 percent  Some alternative   Greenbook scenarios have the core PCE deflator falling to below 1 percent by 2004  I think   inflation as low as projected is potentially a serious risk for the economy  To the extent that we   believe the Greenbook projections for inflation as well as the unemployment rate, both of which                                                                September 24, 2002 74 of 115  suggest slack for the foreseeable future, this seems to me to be a prima facie case for easing   policy at this point   I understand, of course, that things are never that simple  There’s an enormous amount of   uncertainty to be reckoned with, and uncertainty suggests caution for central bankers as well as   for businesses One concern I do have about easing now is that it might exacerbate the   imbalances in the economy by further heating up sectors that are already strong, such as   residential construction and autos, while only indirectly benefiting investment and the labor   market  I also appreciate the dangers of excessive fine-tuning, oversteering, and overshooting    For these reasons, I understand that we may want to wait to see how events unfold before taking   further action  I hope, though, that we will not set the threshold for taking action too high  The   strategy of preemptive strikes should apply with at least as great a force to incipient deflation as   it does to incipient inflation  Thank you    Mr Chairman, I can support waiting for more information  I’m a   little uncertain and confused about the role of geopolitical concerns in the statement  We don’t   want to tie ourselves to saying that we would act only if certain geopolitical events occur  In   particular, if the sluggishness continues but the issue of Iraq is unresolved, would that preclude   action?      Mr Chairman, I appreciate your analysis  I’m just wondering how    you’re going to get all of that in the statement!  [Laughter]    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’d like to focus on a simple arithmetic   implication of the unusual productivity growth that we’ve been observing, which is that it creates   a wedge between the rate of output growth and the rate of input growth  As a result, we have a   situation currently in which the recovery, measured in terms of output growth and spending   growth, seems if not robust at least acceptable  But if we look at the economy from the input   growth side or the factor utilization side, we see a very, very weak economy  Indicators of labor   utilization, for example, including payroll employment, the workweek, and production worker   hours, have been basically flat for the year  Indeed, I had a comparison done between these   series for the current period and the 1991-92 jobless recovery, and they seem to be identical   Capital is likewise not being used to its capacity  Capacity utilization has not only been   flat for the past year, but its absolute level is at near-record lows in the aggregate as well as in   many individual industries  In short, the evidence from the input side of the economy suggests   that the gap between output and potential output is, if anything, widening rather than   diminishing  Continued slowing in core inflation, both at the producer and consumer levels—   which I talked about at the last meeting—is consistent with the presumption of a significant   output gap in the current economy   I think there’s agreement around the table that in the language of macro textbooks the   economy is facing a series of IS shocks—various factors that have inhibited the desire of firms to   invest and consumers to buy  The right response to that normally is to stimulate and lower            November 6, 2002 74 of 122  interest rates still further The FOMC has been quite patient  We’ve kept the funds rate   unchanged now for almost a year  So I think it is time to consider taking some action  A   significant rate cut at this point would not be a panacea obviously, but I do think it would help   Also, I’d like to take issue a bit with the view that there’s a generalized capital overhang    One would think that the story would be that certain industries—like the telecom industry, for   example—have so much capital relative to their long-term needs that there is essentially no   interest rate at which they’d be willing to invest  If you thought that was the case and if you   looked at factory utilization or capacity utilization across industries, you would expect to see   most industries close to normal, but with a few sectors at extremely low utilization levels,   suggesting that they have tremendous overhangs of capital  In fact, what we have is a relatively   normal distribution of capacity utilization across industries—that is, slack is generalized rather   than concentrated in only a few sectors  Given the availability of complementary resources,   labor in particular, I’m not sure that there can be such a thing as a generalized capital overhang    In any case, I’m more optimistic than Governor Ferguson that interest rate reductions might   increase investment spending   Another positive factor I think worth mentioning is these very weak inventories, which   suggest that if spending does increase it will be translated more directly into production rather   than into inventory reduction And finally, in contrast to 1991, there do not appear to be   significant financial headwinds in this case, although Governors Kohn and Gramlich mentioned   a few issues, to impede the effects of a rate cut at this juncture     So in short, I don’t know about pumpkins, [laughter] but while the economy hasn’t fallen   down the stairs, I think it could use a push to make it up the next few steps  Thank you    Mr Chairman, I also support both parts of the recommendation  I   think 50 basis points is just right  I would be less concerned about retaining the bias toward   weakness on the grounds that the market survey data suggest that there’s essentially a universal   expectation that we will retain that bias even when people anticipate a 50 basis point decline  So   I don’t think that we would create a shock  Nevertheless, I defer to those who have been in   markets and understand their deep psychology So I do concur with the recommendation    Dino, on the mortgage-backed securities chart on page 2, I wondered   if the sharp declines might reflect a decline in refinancing risks Or do you think they reflect the   same consideration of all the risks that apply to other kinds of debt?    Thank you     May I follow up quickly?  The stochastic shocks you used are drawn   from the whole postwar period?     The volatility of these shocks has been much smaller in the last   decade or so    I guess I’m batting cleanup again  At this point there’s not a great   deal to add, but I’d like to reinforce some of the comments made by President Poole, Governor   Ferguson, and Governor Bies about the upside potential for the recovery     Although the news has not been entirely positive since our last meeting, I think the risk of   a double dip or worse has receded considerably  Consumers seem likely to continue to support   the recovery, and there are also some early signs of spring in investment and in the labor market    No doubt 2002 will go down as having been a very difficult year for the economy, but in every   cloud there’s always a bit of a silver lining  In that regard I think that there’s some evidence that   the US private sector has used the past six months or so very effectively to restructure itself and   to position itself for future growth   On the real side, the productivity numbers we’ve talked so much about indicate a great   deal of cost cutting, restructuring, and consolidation that will provide a basis for further   expansion The weakness in investment we’ve also discussed extensively; the one hypothesis is   that it’s the response to geopolitical uncertainty and other kinds of uncertainty  I think part of the   story may be that companies, particularly those in high-tech industries, are still digesting and   absorbing the investment they did in the late 1990s —learning how to use it better and looking               December 10, 2002 66 of 87  for new directions and new opportunities  There are in fact some  indications of recovery in the   high-tech sector, suggesting that perhaps that adjustment process is at least beginning to wind   down, laying the basis for a recovery in that area   On the financial side, one striking factor is that many firms have engaged in balance sheet   repair—improving liquidity, improving their debt structure, and so on  I think there’s also some   sense that the new corporate governance environment that fell upon us in the summer is   beginning to be absorbed to some extent by markets and firms  My evidence of this is only the   general calming of financial markets, the decline in spreads, and the fact that we are beginning to   see some new issuance in the market     I’ll just mention that, while still in its very early days, the new security environment is   causing both firms and government to begin to adapt, with some adjustments being made along   those lines So, while it has been a weak year, the upside is that a lot of restructuring has   occurred to prepare for the future, which may help to provide a basis for good growth in the next   year   As I mentioned, the consumer continues to hold up his end  If one looks at the details of   the consumer’s position, it is not as bad as those in the media make it out to be  Despite the up   and down movement in the stock market, wealth-to-income ratios appear to be stabilizing around   normal levels  Income continues to rise smartly  And the refinancing wave has supported not   only spending but also the consolidation of debt, with the extraction of equity from homes   helping to reduce and consolidate credit card and other debts, for example  The labor market is   still somewhat of a puzzle, but it doesn’t seem to be deteriorating, and I think there are some   grounds for optimism there                                                                   December 10, 2002 67 of 87  The main risks to the optimistic recovery scenario are largely external to the private   sector We’ve talked about war and terrorism, and there’s a lot of fiscal uncertainty as well as   fiscal possibility And conditions abroad are an issue   I think our easing last time was very well timed  It seemed clearly to have benefits on the   second moments of financial markets as well as the first moments  As we go forward, I   personally will keep a close eye on the risk premiums and other measures of stress in financial   markets that I think reflect a number of these concerns  Also, since our measures of output gaps   at this point are fairly problematic, given the uncertainty about productivity growth and so on, I   think it will be important to keep a close eye on core inflation, which may be our best indicator   of the output gap Overall, I’m quite happy about the outlook  Though the picture is mixed, on   balance I think the information that has become available over the last five weeks or so has been   positive  Thank you    I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman  If your brevity is   going to be a habit, though, I would like to get my tuition back  [Laughter]     That means our value added is 004  [Laughter]     Rational expectations in terms of financial markets, not necessarily   the rest of the economy?     You referred to term structure evidence  This is different from the   fed funds evidence that Glenn was referring to or the same?     I ask because I’m very interested in this basic point that the Fed   should be more predictable in order to use the short-term rate to influence long-term rates and   whether that is an important issue  In particular, your evidence is very interesting, Glenn  I was   wondering if there had been evidence on whether or not the responsiveness of long-term interest   rates to movements in the fed funds rate was consistent with the predictability of the type that   you propose or the type that uses more partial adjustment  That would seem to be a separate test    I was wondering if you had done anything more directly on this hypothesis   January 28-29, 2003 31 of 195      One might argue that Glenn’s interpretation of the Taylor rule is   correct—that there is no inertia in the policy rule and that there should be more in order to get   more effect on long-term rates  I think that’s an open question   January 28-29, 2003 32 of 195      That’s different  That’s the interest rate responding endogenously to   the expected evolution of the economy       Thank you     Governor Ferguson, the coefficients inferred from our behavior are   much lower than the ones that were found to be optimal in the earlier exercise    Yes     Your decomposition of multifactor productivity into permanent and   temporary components is, I guess, largely statistical  I wanted to push you a bit more as to   whether you had direct evidence on the permanence of MFP growth and on technological   dynamism in the US economy more generally  You do have that graph on R&D spending, but   what information do you have, for example, on the stock of R&D investment, patents, and the   diffusion of innovation across industries or from surveys on types of innovation?  I note the   negative impact of venture capital drying up and those sorts of factors  I’m concerned about this   for a couple of reasons  One is the related issue of the extent to which innovation is capital   embodied  To the extent that we want to have an investment-led recovery, we’ll want to see a lot   of these innovations being translated into new investments  So that’s an important question     Another issue—besides, of course, the basic issue of the sustainability of productivity   growth—involves one of the leading alternative hypotheses to the geopolitical risk hypothesis,   which is what I call the real business-cycle theory  That theory says that perhaps the   January 28-29, 2003 88 of 195    technological hype of the new economy was overstated and we might have a less exciting period   now in terms of technological opportunity, which might lead to a slower growth phase in the   near future  These are very important issues  Again, my question is, To what extent do we have   more-direct evidence on the technological development of the economy?     Do you do any kind of sectoral breakdown of your MFP projections?     Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I continue to believe that structurally the   US economy is reasonably healthy, both financially and in real terms  So why is the economy   struggling?  A few stories have circulated  In my view, the various analyses we’ve been hearing   comparing the United States economy to the post-bubble Japanese economy are overwrought to   say the least  There’s little evidence of important remaining capital overhang except in a few   sectors  Moreover, as I’ve said before, I don’t think it’s meaningful to talk about a generalized   January 28-29, 2003 137 of 195    capital overhang  To my mind “generalized capital overhang” is just another name for   insufficient aggregate demand or low general capital utilization  In any case, the main post-  bubble problems in Japan were financial, and there is certainly no comparable set of problems   here  As my earlier question suggested, another possible explanation for the slow recovery is   that there’s a lull in the technological opportunity for growth, a real business cycle  This also   seems somewhat implausible to me, but we’ll have to wait and see  If that is the case, then   there’s not much that monetary policy can do about it     At this juncture the leading hypothesis must still be the geopolitical uncertainty and its   damping effects on hiring and investment decisions  I feel some déjà vu here  My PhD thesis   twenty-five years ago considered the problem of a firm contemplating an irreversible physical   investment in the face of uncertainty  As it happened, the example I used in my paper was   uncertainty about the long-term price of oil  I showed in my dissertation that the firm’s optimal   hurdle rate for investment not only increases with the degree of uncertainty, as might be   expected, but also was higher the nearer the expected resolution of the uncertainty  Intuitively,   uncertainty that is expected to be resolved relatively soon is a strong incentive to delay   commitment   Currently the geopolitical situation is not only one of high uncertainty but also one in   which the uncertainty may be resolved at least partially in a matter of weeks or a few months    The damping forces of uncertainty on the economy are therefore currently at their maximum   level  A reasonably likely scenario, one that we all hope for, is that the geopolitical situation will   be speedily and favorably resolved and that a significant economic recovery will therefore   follow  Frankly, therefore, I don’t think there is much we can do about this now  We’re just   going to have to wait and see what happens   January 28-29, 2003 138 of 195    There is, of course, also the possibility that the economy will continue to move sideways   into the spring either because the geopolitical uncertainties drag on or because the new   investment and hiring that we’re expecting now simply are not forthcoming, perhaps because of   continuing business pessimism  Given the ongoing slack in utilization of labor and capital and   our projection that core PCE inflation may slip to 1 percent or lower, I would hope that in such a   circumstance we would be prepared to ease aggressively earlier rather than later on the grounds   that the risk of inaction at that point would be greater than the risk of action  Thank you     I support both parts of your recommendation, Mr Chairman     Dino, my question is on the Japanese government yield curves   shown on page 1  Would you interpret the decline in the yield curve over the last year as a   change in inflation or deflation expectations, or is it a change in liquidity premiums as a result of   the net supply of bonds and the demand for liquidity?  Can you parse it between those two?     We don’t have any survey data or other information on long-term   deflation expectations?     Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  As many have noted, we’re currently in   a period of maximum uncertainty, with the result that the economy is almost in a state of   suspended animation  Until the world situation clarifies, the hurdle rate for investment or any   major commitment will be very high, as some of my colleagues have noted  By the same token,   any action we would take on rates today would be largely inframarginal   I continue to believe that the economy has substantial fundamental and financial   strengths  There is also a lot of accumulated slack in the economy because we’ve had essentially   no employment gains for about two years  Therefore, I think there’s a good chance that a   reasonably successful resolution of the Iraqi situation will lead to strong growth in the second   half of this year and in 2004  But in deference to President Minehan, I also agree that some   alternative, more negative scenarios are possible  Here are two   The first is what I call the “fear of fear itself” scenario—continuing pessimism  There   might be a less than satisfactory outcome to the war or continuing fear of terrorism, in which   case consumer confidence and self-confirming doubts might lead to slow growth in investment   and consumer spending  I think that’s a real possibility and one that we need to keep in mind    March 18, 2003 67 of 101    A second possibility, which is perhaps complementary to that, would be a weak profits   scenario  Firms could find that their international markets are very weak, and they could   continue to suffer from high energy costs and high costs for insurance and pensions  That   combined with structural issues in a number of major industries and perhaps a lack of   technological opportunities—or opportunities that are less good than hoped for—might result in   profits that are not strong  That in turn would lead to weaker stock market valuations and less   investment than we’re hoping for  So those are two possible scenarios  Given the amount of   slack in the economy, I think either of those situations, if they were to materialize, would be   amenable to continued stimulation from both monetary and fiscal policy   Let me say a word about timing  Over the intermeeting period there is, of course, the   possibility that the current very high level of uncertainty will be resolved one way or the other    On the one hand, we could get very good results in Iraq with strong financial market reactions, a   boost in consumer confidence, strong anecdotal reports, and so on  That would support the case   for waiting and watching with the hope that the strong recovery would commence  On the other   hand, we might get the other tail of the distribution of possible outcomes—bad results in Iraq and   much concern at home, and negative financial market responses to that  But I want to echo what   David Stockton and several others have pointed out—namely that there is a large middle area of   the distribution that we might be facing at the next meeting  There may still be considerable   uncertainty about the state of the economy going forward and whether or not the scenario in the   Greenbook will in fact be realized  I would like to caution against the situation where we are   continually waiting for uncertainty to be resolved before taking action  That situation could go   on indefinitely  If the economy is still struggling and if there is no significant improvement or   March 18, 2003 68 of 101    evidence of increasing strength by our next meeting, I hope we will at least consider the case for   easing policy at that time  Thank you     Mr Chairman, I support both parts of the recommendation     On the other hand, it would affect interest rates, so you wouldn’t   have that effect        Thank you, Mr Chairman  Relative to previous meetings, there has   been considerably more discussion of inflation and disinflation at this meeting  I’m gratified   May 6, 2003 64 of 115    about that because I think these considerations should be central to our policy analysis at this   point  Let me just add a few points to the discussion     Disentangling persistent from temporary changes in the rate of inflation is difficult, and   measurement issues cloud the picture further  Nevertheless, the best guess is that underlying   inflation has been declining recently  Comparing the year ending in March 2003 with the year   ending in March 2002, the Greenbook notes that inflation as measured by the core CPI has fallen   from 24 to 17 percent  In the past six months this measure has been barely above 10 percent at   an annual rate  Inflation as measured by the chain version of core CPI has fallen from   18 percent last year to 12 percent this year  Data for the past six months are not available    Inflation as measured by the core PCE deflator has been stable at 15 percent for the past two   years, but the Greenbook notes that this stability is largely a result of increases in nonmarket   imputed prices  Excluding nonmarket prices, core PCE inflation fell from 13 percent in the year   ending March 2002 to 09 percent in the year ending March 2003, and it has averaged 02 percent   over the past six months  Of course, for a given nominal funds rate, disinflation amounts to a de   facto tightening of monetary policy     Because monetary policy works with a lag, in principle we should be most concerned   about the forecast of future inflation rather than past inflation  Forecasting inflation is tricky,   though it is worth pointing out that several well-known academic studies have found that the   Greenbook’s forecasts of inflation are better than any made in the private sector  The staff   estimates that core PCE inflation will be about 10 percent in 2004, owing largely to the fact that   even with growth of nearly 4 percent in the second half of this year and in all of 2004, the   economy would still have considerable slack well into next year   May 6, 2003 65 of 115    Of course, as always there are both upside and downside risks to the staff forecast    However, our loss function with respect to the inflation forecast error should be asymmetric  A   1 percentage point undershoot of inflation from the forecast, which would bring us to the brink   of outright deflation, would be much more costly than a 1 percentage point overshoot,   undesirable as the latter might be  In short, for the first time in many decades the risks to our   inflation objective are decidedly downward  Given that the risks to employment also seem to be   downward, there appears to be a prima facie case for easing policy  I tend to agree with that   conclusion, and barring an exceptionally strong near-term turnaround in the economy, I hope that   the Committee will adopt a posture of leaning toward ease     I would like to add an important caveat, however  The chance that we will hit the zero   bound constraint at some point, though not large, is certainly not negligible  In response to   President Guynn’s earlier remarks, by the way, I believe a zero bound constraint on policy is the   major risk of a deflationary environment—one that could have real costs because it would inhibit   our ability to stabilize the economy  More generally, as noted by Governors Kohn and Ferguson,   deflation puts a floor on the real interest rate and can therefore destabilize and distort capital   markets  Theoretically the risk of the zero bound only increases the urgency of a preemptive   easing  However, it also seems important that we have a plan for how we might proceed   seamlessly from standard rate-cutting to more nonstandard operations should such operations   become necessary  For me, along the lines suggested by President Hoenig, if there is an   argument for delaying further easing at this point, that is it  A delay would give the Committee a   chance to think about how an easing action fits into a broader strategy that may involve—though   we hope it will not—nonstandard policy operations  Thank you     I can support your recommendation, Mr Chairman  I like the   statement and the decoupling of the references to inflation and growth  I would note that there   are some potential and logical issues regarding the statement that will probably emerge as we get   May 6, 2003 98 of 115    more experienced with it  For example, if the two risks are in opposite directions but one is   severe and one is mild, would that be a balanced risk or would it be—?  [Laughter]  Exactly  At   some point we may have to deal with this—weighting the two objectives, for example  So I   would just point out that we may have to decapitate the swan at some point  [Laughter]     People have suggested that, Governor Ferguson      Thank you, Mr Chairman  I find it useful in thinking about   monetary policy at the zero bound to view it as working in one of three broad ways  First, it   works by affecting expectations of future short-term interest rates, which affect longer-term   interest rates and other asset prices  Second, it works through mechanisms that depend on the   imperfect substitutability of different assets  That would be, for example, the purchases of   individual assets or the asset portfolio substitution effects that were described by Vincent  Third,   it works through fiscal effects, which were not much emphasized in the materials we’ve looked   June 24-25, 2003 44 of 211    at and are a form of last resort action, but which I think in the Japanese case might be called for   at this point     In my view the imperfect substitutability effects and the quantitative easing effects are   there, but they are probably weak and somewhat difficult to identify at this point  As I said, the   fiscal effects probably fall into the last resort category  So for those reasons, at the stage we’re in   now, I think we should be concentrating more on the expectational and commitment effects   looking forward  Besides the weaknesses of the other two approaches, I think the expectational   effects on the term structure, first of all, are best understood  There’s a paper I would   recommend to you, if you haven’t read it, by Eggertson and Woodford that explores the   expectational effects of short-term interest rates and their effects on long-term rates in great   detail  Indeed, that approach is more or less what we’re doing now  Of course, monetary policy   as normally practiced works primarily by affecting expectations about longer-term policy and,   therefore, longer-term interest rates   What I think has been missing from the discussion we have had here today so far is that   working on expectations of future short-term interest rates can be done through a comprehensive   package  There are many different ways to approach expectations management  One is   communications of the type we’ve been doing through our statements  There are various   targeting procedures for inflation or price level targeting  Eggertson and Woodford talk about   some reasons for price level targeting, which is their favorite approach  There is also signaling   through various kinds of market interventions of the kind Dino has talked about—options,   purchases of bonds, discount window lending, and so on  In particular, to those of you who have   argued against trying to “target” long-term interest rates—if by that you mean that we specify a   target for the five-year bond and then try to enforce it by buying  five-year bonds—I must say   June 24-25, 2003 45 of 211    that I agree with you 100 percent that that’s not going to work  But if the policy is one in which   we essentially try to lower the whole path of long-term interest rates and we enforce that with a   package of complementary actions that includes trying to manage expectations along the term   structure and taking a series of other actions such as purchasing long-term bonds and other kinds   of instruments, I think that’s one of the first things we ought to be doing  I believe that would   actually work and would in fact be a good approach     So my answers to Vince’s four questions are, in short, that I agree with Bill Poole and   Don Kohn that short-term nominal interest rates should be brought down quite low  I don’t have   much sympathy or forbearance necessarily for protecting small segments of the financial   markets  I believe our first approach should be the continuation of our current policy of working   on the management of expectations  And then I think we should consider packages of policies   that support each other to try to manage expectations in the market and thereby affect longer-  term interest rates  Thank you     Mr Chairman, the depression-era deflation ended quite smoothly    Inflation was minus 8 percent in 1932 and plus 1 percent in 1933  So there’s one example       Picking up on President Parry’s comment and looking at the central   tendency of the FOMC projections shown in chart 13, we more sage and conservative people   also are predicting something above 4 percent for real GDP next year and about 1 percent   inflation, which historically is a highly unlikely configuration  In a speech a few months ago I   suggested that a relatively easy way to improve the transparency of the FOMC would be to   detach these projections from the Chairman’s testimony and release them in a more timely way,   perhaps with the minutes of the previous meeting  It occurs to me that the numbers that we see   here would be quite useful to release to the public in two senses  One, this combination of   unusually high growth and low inflation would make very clear on what we base our balanced   risks for growth going forward combined with our downward risks to inflation  Second, I think   it would support the financial market configuration that we’re looking for, which is a strong   stock market and a strong bond market  So I think these FOMC member projections, which are   somewhat more muted but nevertheless quite strong, would be quite supportive of our objectives    I’m wondering, is it on the table that we might let those be released a tad earlier?     You could also get self-correcting deflation if you had a monetary   standard like a gold standard, which we don’t have, of course  An increase in the production of   gold—     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The economy seems poised for recovery   in that policy is accommodative and the financial markets are supportive  But on the ground   where it counts we have not yet seen clear evidence of a turnaround in investment or hiring    Moreover, we have more than the usual degree of uncertainty about the amount of slack in the   economy, which implies that we face highly uncertain downward risks to the already low rate of   inflation  For these reasons, it’s extremely important that we do what we can to maintain the   supportive configuration in financial markets  That means continuing our easy monetary policy   and, even more important, using our statement to signal our willingness to keep policy easy so   long as there is a risk of further disinflation and continuing economic weakness     If you will indulge me, I’d like to take my time to add a few words on communication   policy in general  Our discussion yesterday and our experience of the past year have shown that   effective communication is a big part of successful monetary policymaking  It’s becoming   increasingly more important as the inflation risks move from one-sided to symmetric and as the   range in which we can move the funds rate narrows  We can communicate to financial markets   how we expect to manage short-term interest rates in the future  If we then follow through on   our commitments, the power of our interest rate instrument is multiplied many times over    June 24-25, 2003 130 of 211    Contrast the effects on financial markets of our 50 basis point easing of last November with our   no change policy of May 6  The difference lay entirely in the accompanying statements and not   in the decisions themselves  The May 6 statement proves that purely qualitative statements can   be effective when policy intentions are conveyed to the markets  Nevertheless, communication   that is entirely qualitative in nature also risks misunderstanding  For example, I think the May 6   statement left the mistaken impression with some that the Fed was concerned about the threat of   imminent deflation as opposed to what really concerned us—namely, the possibility of a decline   in inflation to a level that, while below the desirable range, would still be greater than zero  This   misperception may have led to unnecessary anxiety among the less sophisticated and to   skepticism about the Fed’s seriousness among the more sophisticated  This misconception can   be cleared up; but as we go forward, the subtleties will multiply, particularly as the recovery   picks up and as we make the inevitable but very tricky transition from deflation-fighting to   inflation-fighting     I expect that the need to make our public statements more precise and less ad hoc will   ultimately lead to the introduction of some elements of quantification  There are different ways   to do that  One approach would be to provide guidance to the markets by issuing a working   definition of price stability expressed as a range of measured core inflation that takes into   account measurement bias and the need for a buffer zone against deflation  In issuing such   guidance, the FOMC would not need to make any explicit commitment, only indicate that this   working definition of price stability would be used as a guidepost in its pursuit of its dual   mandate relating to price stability and sustainable growth     This is not the place to get into details about any specific proposal  I do think, however,   that this measure or similar ones would help us enlist the financial markets, particularly the bond   June 24-25, 2003 131 of 211    markets, in stabilizing the economy  The reason is that any tendency of inflation to move out of   range—either up or down—would tend to move longer-term bond yields in a stabilizing   direction in anticipation of the forthcoming policy response  Ambiguity has its uses but mostly   in noncooperative games like poker  Monetary policy is a cooperative game  The whole point is   to get financial markets on our side and for them to do some of our work for us  In an   environment of low inflation and low interest rates, we need to seek ever greater clarity of   communication to the markets and to the public  Thank you     Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation as well as your   reasoning  I’d like to follow up briefly on your answer to President Poole  I wonder if you   might give some thought to whether or not it would make sense tactically to say publicly that we   are willing to lower the federal funds rate to zero if necessary  I realize there is some cost to   doing that, but I see two advantages  First, it might allow us to defer gracefully for a longer   period the issue of what we might do if we run out of room  That is, if the question comes up,   June 24-25, 2003 155 of 211    we could say, well, we’re still 100 basis points away from that  Second, I think it would have a   beneficial effect on expectations in that there would no longer be a feeling in the market that we   had reached the end of our rope  Obviously, we’re going to have to put some thought into that     But that’s the ten-year compensation noted on the first page     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Like most everybody else, I’m   encouraged by the recent data  The surprisingly good second-quarter GDP number looks even   better when one takes into account the big negative contributions of the foreign sector and   inventory investment, both of which should tend to reverse at least partially over time    Particularly when the normal cyclical inventory rebuilding kicks in we should see a period of   strong growth, and Secretary Snow’s analogy of the economy as a coiled spring may finally   seem apt  Despite the good news, I think it’s premature to conclude that we should not consider   further rate cuts, if not at this meeting then at some time in the near future depending on how the   August 12, 2003 63 of 110    data play out  My concern is focused on the behavior of inflation both in the short term and in   the long term   Regarding the short term, though I can see that output gaps are extremely hard to   measure, the most reasonable guess is that the current gap remains substantial  Moreover,   because of rapid productivity growth, the gap may close very slowly in coming quarters even if   output growth is quite strong  That’s bad news for workers, and it poses some risks to consumer   spending  More to the point, a persistent output gap implies that additional disinflation over the   next year remains a distinct possibility  Even if we consider actual deflation to be too remote to   worry about, further disinflation poses important risks  Disinflation offsets monetary policy ease   already in the system, and very low inflation may limit the ability of monetary policy to respond   by conventional means to future adverse shocks  In short, we should continue to consider   disinflation unwelcome and to be vigilant about its possibility       The longer-term issue can be summarized by the following question  Where do we want   the inflation rate to be when the economy returns to full employment and sustainable growth?  A   good bit of research at the Board and elsewhere has suggested that a positive steady-state   inflation rate improves economic performance by reducing the frequency at which the zero   bound is binding on the policy rate  I surveyed a number of the relevant papers in preparation   for this meeting  Virtually all conclude that zero bound considerations should lead one to choose   a steady-state inflation rate between 1 and 3 percent  Recently, several authors have become   more daring and have given point estimates of the optimal inflation rate, with the choice almost   always being 2 percent  The memo by Elmendorf, Reifschneider, and Wilcox entitled “Deflation   and the Conduct of Monetary Policy,” circulated to this Committee before the June meeting, was   explicit in putting the magic number as 2 percent PCE inflation  I don’t want to take a stand   August 12, 2003 64 of 110    today on what the long-run inflation rate should be, and that’s obviously something we should   decide as a Committee  But I note that the FOMC central tendency forecast for PCE inflation for   2004 was 10 to 15 percent, somewhat more optimistic than the Greenbook forecast of under   1 percent  Is inflation of 10 to 15 percent what we want to be heading for in the long run?  If   so, fine  Otherwise it seems to me that our policy should reflect our long-term objectives     Finally, I have some concerns about our communication  Government bond yields have   risen a good bit lately; and while that rise is unlikely to derail the recovery, it does not help    Some would argue that an increase in bond yields at this stage of the recovery is normal  That   may be historically accurate, but it misses the point  Historically, inflation has typically been   higher than the Fed would like, so the FOMC has responded to strong growth by raising interest   rates to forestall any inflationary impact  This time around is different, or should be  Inflation is   not a threat  Therefore, the FOMC does not need to take away the punch bowl so early in the   party, so by rights interest rates should remain subdued despite the pickup in growth  Judging by   federal funds futures and other indicators, however, the markets have largely missed this point   and have bid up interest rates well beyond where they ought to be in some sense, to the detriment   of the recovery  To the extent that we can sharpen our message that economic growth no longer   implies an immediate and automatic policy tightening, we should make every effort to do so  I   understand, along the lines mentioned by Governor Gramlich, that communicating this subtle   point is a difficult challenge  But the economy would benefit if we could meet that challenge    Thank you     I support both parts of your recommendation, Mr Chairman  Let me   just say a word on the communications issue because we do need to be very careful  We’ve seen   in the last two meetings that our words have been far more powerful than our policy decision in   terms of changing markets  So, indeed, our communications are a very, very powerful tool    Now, the reaction of the Committee has been that it’s so powerful that perhaps we want to stay   away from it completely  [Laughter]  But if we give no information about our future intentions,   then somehow or another the market has to make an assumption or come to some conclusion   about what our policy is going to be  The presumption, therefore, is that we are so bad at giving   information that we better leave it to the market to draw information from nothing  I don’t want   to be that pessimistic  I would hope that in the future we could think of ways that we could fine-  tune our communication to use it productively  Particularly near the zero bound, it could become   an important part of our tool kit  Obviously, bad communication is much worse than no   August 12, 2003 81 of 110    communication, but I wouldn’t want to rule out communication completely as a way of trying to   enhance our arsenal  Thank you     The sentence is very consistent with the Chairman’s testimony     I would appeal to the Committee to retain the sentence because in   my view it makes a very big difference  I think the addition of the sentence will go some way to   bringing policy expectations in the market toward what I heard around the table during the entire   meeting today  It will have a beneficial effect on the United States economy, which is the   ultimate goal of this Committee  I understand that due process and fairness considerations would   militate toward going the bureaucratic way and having this issue on the agenda for September    But given our ultimate objective of helping the economy, I think the right thing to do is to leave   the suppressed, or shortened, version in this statement; and I would appeal to the Committee to   leave it in     I also agree with you on that, Bill  The technical distinction you’re   making, as you mentioned in your remarks, relates to the idea that the economy is in a rational   expectations equilibrium where everyone has the same information  In that case, anything the   Fed says is going to be redundant  On the other hand, as the Chairman said, it would be harmless   as well     There are several reasons that we might not be in a rational expectations equilibrium    One is that the outside world doesn’t have all the information we have  They may not have   information about our objectives  They may not have information about our views on the   economy, which may be relevant even if they’re wrong  For those reasons, what we say might   be instructive to the public  In particular, conditional information that we provide, which   essentially gives insight into our rule, would be useful to the outside world   I might add a further thought here  I attended a very interesting conference at Jack   Guynn’s Atlanta Fed in March about learning, which is a big area of research in macroeconomics   these days  It looks at the way in which an economy gets to a rational expectations equilibrium    As you probably know, one of the most studied questions in that field is whether or not people,   using all the information they have but without being given information by the central bank, can   learn—with, say, least squares or other methodologies—the rational expectations equilibrium    What we often find in those models is that even very sophisticated players will end up in   suboptimal equilibriums—failure of equilibrium to exist, multiple equilibriums  The notion is   that because people do not know the true rule, they will behave in a very volatile way, which will   induce volatile behavior on the part of the central bank, which in turn will make it very difficult   to learn and so on    September 15, 2003 25 of 78    The point is that there are a number of reasons to think that the Fed has useful   information  I’m actually quite in agreement that we shouldn’t be giving unconditional   information about our interest rate setting  We should be trying to guide the market by providing   conditional forecasts about which direction our policy will be going in light of our objectives,   our views, or the nature of our rule     Yes, conditional on how the economy is likely to evolve       Yes, may be going   For example, our “considerable period”   statement was intended to say—and did in fact say as originally written and before it was   amended—that we think inflation will be low for a long period and if inflation remains low, we   should be able to keep interest rates low  That was in fact the way it was in the original draft and   that’s how it should be said—as a conditional statement about the way our policy is likely to be,   not an unconditional statement about policy     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’d like to support the Washington   consensus, option number 4  Broadly speaking, I think the form of the statement is rather good    In particular I think the breaking up of the output and inflation risks was a very useful step,   September 15, 2003 66 of 78    although we can do some fine-tuning there  I agree that we should do some process   improvement via the Bluebook to get everyone’s input a bit earlier and to get the information out   a little earlier   I’m as responsible as anyone for the confusion about the phrase “considerable period,” so   let me just say a word about that  Governor Kohn put it exactly right, I think  The words   “considerable period” were part of a nonstandard monetary policy  When we get close to the   zero bound, we run out of traditional tools, and the only way that we can influence interest rates   is by manipulating expectations  So it’s a very, very nonstandard and unusual way to address   monetary policy  That was certainly what I had in mind when I was advocating that approach    We’re now, I hope—and it seems to be the case—no longer at great risk of deflation with a zero   bound  I certainly hope that’s the case  So I imagine that the reference to those kinds of   considerations will disappear from the statement  But let me warn you that, should we reach the   zero bound again, we would be well advised to consider using statements of that sort again   because they may become our only tool, not just an auxiliary tool   Let me say something on the minutes  I don’t think President Guynn’s comment about   the minutes taking on undue importance was in the context of eliminating the press statement  I   think we would keep the statement as our central means of communication  Then moving up the   minutes would in fact be useful because that document does, as President Moskow suggested,   contain a lot of useful information  That would not require any kind of additional blackout   period  One argument that has been made against moving up the minutes is that their release   would create an unnecessary market impact  But my experience is—and I think a correct view is   —that the market effects of Fed actions, speeches, and so on are more or less continuous    There’s no singular impact  So count me as one who thinks that moving up the minutes would   September 15, 2003 67 of 78    be a relatively effective and easy way to increase our transparency and to provide more   information to the market  Thank you     Is “fostering” used in the sense that we are trying to create a   movement toward an objective, such as in the case of foster parents?     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Sometime soon we’ll be approaching a   critical juncture in this policy cycle  Output appears to be growing rapidly, but employment has   not yet begun to recover and inflation so far is quiescent  The crucial question is, At what point   September 16, 2003 72 of 106    should we begin to tighten?  There are important risks in both directions  We don’t want to   tighten too soon and short-circuit the recovery, risking further disinflation or even deflation  On   the other hand, we certainly don’t want to let inflation and inflation expectations get too high   The key element of our decision will be the view we take about the likely behavior of inflation   over the next year to year and a half  We don’t have much evidence to guide us on this, but let   me offer a little from the only other jobless recovery of recent years—and the recession that   seems broadly most like the recent one—the downturn in 1990-91     It is interesting that initially employment and inflation followed very similar patterns  in   1991 and 2001  Both recessions lasted eight months according to the NBER  Employment kept   falling after the trough in both recessions whereas labor productivity rose sharply  In the earlier   case, twelve-month growth in nonfarm payroll employment hit its minimum value, minus   15 percent, in May 1991, two months after the NBER trough date  In the more recent episode,   employment growth hit its minimum value in February 2002—also at minus 15 percent—three   rather than two months after the trough date  In both cases also, core inflation was virtually flat   during the recession itself    The closely parallel evolutions of the 1990-91 and the 2001 episodes ended, however,   shortly after the recession troughs  In particular, the rebound in employment growth was much   stronger in the earlier episode  In 1990-91, employment growth stabilized eleven months after   the trough date; and by eighteen months after the trough, employment growth had reached   1 percent annualized  In contrast, eighteen months after the trough in the current episode,   employment growth was still negative  By three years after the 1991 trough, in March 1994,   employment growth was 3 percent at an annual rate  In short, the 1990-91 and the 2001 episodes   September 16, 2003 73 of 106    looked very similar initially, but the recovery of the labor market after the trough was   considerably faster in 1991 than it has been recently   What happened to inflation subsequent to the troughs?  This is the critical point  During   the three years following the March 1991 trough, core CPI inflation fell from 52 percent to   30 percent, and core PCE inflation fell from 44 percent to 22 percent  Both inflation measures   declined further subsequently  That is, inflation fell more than 2 percentage points during the   three years following the 1991 trough  Moreover, most of this decline occurred after   employment growth had turned positive  For comparison, in the current episode core CPI   inflation has fallen about 12 percent since the November 2001 trough, and core PCE inflation   has fallen about 05 percent  Because the post-trough recovery in the labor market has been so   much slower this time around, the inflation experience in the earlier episode suggests to me that   further disinflation or at least stable inflation may be on the horizon     I realize this is a crude comparison  Inflation was more volatile in the earlier episode,   reflecting less anchored expectations  Policies were different, and it’s only one data point  But it   is at least a little evidence that a jobless recovery is likely to be associated with very weak   upward pressure on inflation even during the initial period after employment growth turns   positive  All else being equal, that suggests a strategy of vigilant patience for monetary policy    Thank you     I accept the policy recommendation  On the last sentence of the   press statement, my preference would be for this meeting to leave it as it was before—because I   think that’s the safest thing to do—and to change it next time  I’d like to add my voice to   President’s Poole’s suggestion of wording that was something to the effect of remaining   accommodative for the considerable period that we expect the risks to inflation to remain muted    The distinction is that we would be accommodative as long as inflation remains under control as   opposed to as long as inflation is actually falling  You can see the distinction  To contain   disinflationary forces means as long as inflation stops falling President Poole’s wording about   the risks to inflation remaining muted suggests that as long as inflation stays where it is, which is   actually very low, we have no reason to begin to tighten     In any event, I think that might be a good way to go     September 16, 2003 92 of 106      Well, if you start with the first difference then you might get an   expectation in the market that we’re going to begin tightening at some early point, say, just when   the difference changes     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’m happy to wait until January if that’s   what people want to do  I would like to express a mild preference—more than a mild   preference—for Governor Gramlich’s formulation  I think it’s important to have benchmarks    Our current statement and both of the suggested statements have benchmarks in the terms   “sustainable growth,” “unwelcome,” “desirably lower,” or “desirably higher”  So that’s not the   question; all of the versions have benchmarks  I like Governor Gramlich’s formulation better   because his benchmark for output is not whether it is growing above or below the growth rate of   potential but that it has a trajectory that leads eventually toward full employment That is a   different concept, but that’s really what we should be shooting for  I think that’s a better way of   thinking about our objective  I understand Governor Ferguson’s comment about breaking the   forecast and the evaluation into two parts  But in fact the statement suggested by Vincent does   not do that because the forecast for output includes a reference to sustainable growth  There is   explicitly a benchmark for growth, symmetrically, but there should be a benchmark for inflation   in that same paragraph  To make matters more complicated, I might note that I just came from   the Bank of England, and they don’t issue any statement at all immediately after their policy   meeting  They’re very happy releasing the minutes a couple of weeks after the meeting because   they think that document conveys all the subtleties of their discussion much better than a   statement     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I was interested in the likely evolution of   the federal funds rate over the next two years  So I asked the staff to use their best fitting   October 28, 2003 70 of 126    estimated Taylor rules together with both Greenbook and private sector forecasts to project some   sample interest rate paths  The rules the staff chose were a backward-looking Taylor rule   estimated over the 1988-98 period and a forward-looking, or forecast-based, Taylor rule   estimated over the same period using FOMC central tendency forecasts on the right-hand side   plus some additional data assumptions  By the way, this latter rule is the one discussed in some   detail in Dave Lindsey’s magnum opus on communication  Both Taylor rules allowed for error   correction terms—that is, a lagged interest rate in the equation  The projections were run using   actual data plus either Greenbook or Blue Chip forecasts on the right-hand side and then   compared with funds rate forecasts obtained from the fed funds futures markets  Note that this   exercise treats the Greenbook forecast as given  No attempt was made to reconcile the funds rate   projection obtained with the funds rate assumptions used in deriving the forecast   Let me summarize a couple of interesting results from this exercise  First, the backward-  looking rule would have the current funds rate at about 150 percent  The actual current value of   1 percent presumably reflects in part our insurance policy against deflation  Assuming that the   extra 50 basis points are phased out in a linear way over the next two years, the path that is   suggested by the backward-looking rule would go about as follows  It’s currently at 1 percent; it   would be 125 percent by the end of the first quarter of next year, 150 percent at the end of the   second quarter, 225 percent at the end of 2004, and finally 350 percent at the end of 2005  The   backward-looking rule applied to the Blue Chip data gave a fairly similar, though slightly more   aggressive, path through 2004  The Blue Chip data don’t go out far enough to do a projection   through 2005  What I found most interesting about the results using the backward-looking   Taylor rule is that they correspond extremely closely to what comes out of the futures market    The numbers are almost exactly the same  So the main lesson I learned from this exercise is that   October 28, 2003 71 of 126    the market is using historical relationships and backward-looking type Taylor rules to figure out   what we’re going to be doing in the future     There was an interesting contrast to the results when I used the forward-looking rule  In   particular, the forward-looking Taylor rule implies a much slower tightening process  Indeed   according to that projection, the funds rate will reach only 150 percent by the end of 2004 rather   than the 225 percent forecast by both the futures market and the backward-looking rule  The   Greenbook forecast horizon doesn’t permit a projection through 2005, though, so I couldn’t   make that comparison  Why the difference?  Mechanically, the difference arises because the   forward-looking rule puts a high weight on inflation expectations, and of course, using the   Greenbook forecast we have a very low inflation rate expected over the forecast period  So   that’s the mechanical reason     Which of these rules should we take more seriously?  Personally, I see some advantages   in the forward-looking rule for two reasons  One is that it’s a true real-time rule—that is, it   estimates reaction functions given actual forecasts available at the time the policy decision was   taken  Second, as Governor Bies mentioned, we’re now in a period that is very unusual, and   historical relationships may not work  So it’s useful that the forward-looking rule can take into   account explicitly how forecasts affect current policy decisions  The implications of this, I think,   are interesting  To me it says that our policy stance is going to depend very much on what we   think inflation is going to do  Suppose we buy the Greenbook forecast on inflation  I’m not   making a judgment here; I personally think that inflation will remain low and stable over the   forecast period, but not everyone does  But if we do agree with that inflation outlook, then at   least based on this estimated rule our policy tightening should be slower and more gradual than   suggested by historical relationships or by the funds rate futures markets  That leads finally to   October 28, 2003 72 of 126    two conclusions  One is that we should be especially vigilant about the inflation rate and where   we think it’s going to go  Second, we have an ongoing communication issue  If this is the way   that policy proceeds, over time in one way or another we will have to bring expectations in the   market in line with our actual policy     Let me make one brief comment on communication  I just want to say that I very much   appreciate the contributions and thoughts people have had, and I’m very open to the kinds of   modifications that have been suggested  But I would echo Governor Ferguson’s suggestion that   for the time being we go relatively slowly  Thank you     I concur with both parts of your recommendation, Mr Chairman     On page 3 of your charts you juxtapose the declining dollar with the   positive interest rate differentials with our major trading partners  The obvious question is why   hasn’t there been a sharp decline in the dollar followed by an expected appreciation of the dollar   given the interest rate parity condition  How is holding US securities at a lower interest rate   consistent with the expectation of an ongoing depreciation of the dollar?   December 9, 2003 7 of 133      It’s a puzzle     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The economic news since our last   meeting has been heartening  The odds that we have begun a strong and sustainable expansion   have risen significantly  Because of the rise in growth, we’re going to see even more op-ed   articles, wire stories, and editorials opining that the Fed needs to tighten soon to avoid a repeat of   1980s-style inflation  The Wall Street Journal today has an editorial along those lines  I believe   these critics are not particularly well informed and that, as a Committee, we should continue to   remain patient and not choke off growth unnecessarily  In particular, though of course we have   to be vigilant to detect any change in the inflation trend, the odds of inflation rising significantly   any time soon from its current very low level seem small    Let me make a few points  First, those on the Street and elsewhere who lately have been   worrying about inflation have tended to point primarily to raw materials prices, which have been   rising, and to the dollar, which has been falling  Here I will largely reiterate some things that   Dave Stockton said  The Board staff’s Monday briefing, which I believe has been posted   electronically, debunked the importance of the raw materials argument quite convincingly in my   view  The briefing includes a graph of the historical data, which shows that even very large   movements of raw materials prices—which are quite common by the way—appear to have   muted effects on intermediate goods prices and, most important, no discernible effects at all on   final goods inflation  Presumably this lack of inflationary impact reflects the fact that raw   materials are only a small part of total costs  As another figure in the briefing showed, unit labor   costs— which, of course, have been falling rapidly as productivity has surged and wage growth   has slowed—are far more important in inflation determination than are materials prices     An analysis similar to that for raw materials would apply to the dollar  As we’ve been   seeing, large movements of the dollar against major currencies tend to translate into smaller   December 9, 2003 79 of 133    movements against the US trade-weighted basket of currencies and into still smaller effects on   import prices because of imperfect pass-throughs  Nonoil import prices, in turn, are a relatively   modest part of the overall price index  In short, the ultimate effect of the dollar depreciation of   the magnitude we have seen on broad measures of core inflation is likely to be quite small   indeed   I noted the key role of unit labor costs in inflation  Of course, unit labor costs will not   continue to fall at the recent rate  Indeed, as employment picks up, productivity growth in   particular will slow markedly  Critics may point to this decline in productivity growth as another   incipient source of inflationary pressure  I would just note that this prospective productivity   decline is fully incorporated in the Greenbook forecast that we have before us  In particular, the   Greenbook forecast assumes that productivity growth will fall significantly below trend in 2004   and 2005 as employment picks up, specifically to 17 percent in 2004 and to only 05 percent in   2005  Given recent experience, it seems entirely possible that these assumptions are   conservative and that productivity growth, though decelerating, will nevertheless be higher than   what the staff has assumed for the next two years  If so, that would tend to increase the risks of   further disinflation   Finally, although output gaps are of course very hard to measure, the weight of the   evidence continues to support those who believe that considerable slack remains in the economy    Let me give one bit of evidence on this point  The recent New York Times article by Chicago   economist Austan Goolsbee argued that the rise in the unemployment rate in the past two years   understates the degree of labor market weakness  The reason is that today a large percentage of   job losers, a greater fraction than in the past, simply withdraw from the labor force, for example,   to apply for Social Security disability benefits  I looked at data on the ratio of employment to the   December 9, 2003 80 of 133    working age population, which combine information on both unemployment and labor force   participation and found that they confirm this general observation  Between its peak in April   2000 and its trough this past September, the employment-to-population ratio fell 28 percentage   points  With the strong gains in the household survey of the past two months, the net decline in   the employment-to-population ratio since 2000 is still 24 percentage points  For comparison,   the combination of the 1980 and 1981-82 recessions, during which the unemployment rate   peaked near 11 percent, produced a peak-to-trough move in this ratio between September 1979   and February 1983 of 30 percentage points  The decline attributed to the 1981-82 recession   alone from its local peak in April ’81 until February ’83 was 25 percentage points  So on this   particular metric—and of course it’s only one metric—the deterioration of the labor market from   2000 until now is comparable to what occurred during the deep 1981-82 recession  For   comparison, the movement in the employment-to-population ratio from its peak to its trough   during the 1990-91 recession period was 20 percentage points   Possibly the extent of the recent decline is exaggerated because employment was   unsustainably high in 1999 and 2000  However, even relative to a more neutral benchmark of   5 percent unemployment and a participation rate at its long-run trend, current household   employment—the more optimistic of the surveys—remains some 29 million jobs below normal    That number fully incorporates the rise in self-employment about which much has been made    On balance, the large decline in the share of the population that is working suggests that   employment can rise significantly before we see pressure on wages and unit labor costs       To summarize, vigilance on inflation is absolutely essential  I do not disagree with that   one bit  But we should not overreact to purported signs of inflation that are in reality no such   thing  Thank you   December 9, 2003 81 of 133      I think it would be a mistake to drop that language entirely  In my   view making it conditional is the right way to proceed, and I support your recommendation     Thank you  This exercise shows us that achieving clarity and   transparency for a large and diverse committee is quite difficult  But it’s also very important   both in our role as a public institution and for the efficacy of monetary policy  So I hope, even   though it’s a very difficult task, that we don’t let ourselves backslide in this effort   I want to say that I’m actually sympathetic to the view of gradual evolution in the policy   statement  We saw last week a statement by the Bank of Canada that was quite a model of   clarity  In simple English it explained conditions in the economy, and it explained why policy   steps were taken  In that respect I thought it conveyed everything without the need for formulaic   language  But as we go to a simpler and shorter statement, I would hope that we would increase   the information we provide in other dimensions, particularly the minutes and our individual   projections—and we’ll come back to that later   Let me say a word about the statements  Very briefly, I agree with President Stern  My   preference among the three statements would be levels A for two reasons  The first is that I do   think it’s important to describe the outlook in terms of levels relative to benchmarks  The   changes statement requires unspecified preliminary language in order to make it clear, which I   think is a major drawback to that statement   My second point has to do with the conditioning policy assumption  A number of central   banks do use the constant interest rate assumption in making their projections  This assumption   has been very strongly criticized by a number of observers, including Glenn Rudebusch and Lars   Svenson and by Mike Woodford in his book and other places  There are two problems with the   constant interest rate assumption  One is theoretical, and the other is practical, and they’re   related  At the theoretical level, the constant interest rate assumption is usually not well defined   in the sense that many forward-looking rational expectations models simply do not have   January 27-28, 2004 28 of 238    equilibriums or they have multiple equilibriums under that assumption, whereas backward-  looking models tend to diverge and have unstable behavior  In practice, that means showing   paths in the projections that look very unrealistic  As a practical matter, the constant interest rate   assumption is really not well specified because it doesn’t specify what financial markets believe,   for example  Do they believe that interest rates are going to be constant, or do they have the   current market revealed preferences?  How long will the constant interest rate path be   maintained?  What would be the policy after that path has ended?  It’s not really a very useful   conditioning assumption, and therefore, I just warn you that there are some serious reservations   about that approach  Thank you     Thank you, Governor Ferguson  One of the reasons we find it   difficult to issue a policy statement is that there’s such a wide divergence of views around the   January 27-28, 2004 50 of 238    table  The special advantage of the minutes is that they represent the diverse views and give   some perspective and depth to the discussion  They also include a lot of valuable and interesting   information from the staff presentations about the state of the economy  So I would be very   much in favor of moving up the publication of the minutes  I would note, to address Governor   Ferguson’s concerns, that we would not be the first central bank to use the minutes this way    Many central banks around the world do that without problems as far as I’m aware   With respect to the blackout, I think extending the blackout period would be   counterproductive for many reasons  One of them is that it would be like a drum roll up to the   minutes that would in fact exaggerate the impact of the minutes  So I would favor keeping the   blackout as it is  No one has mentioned this—the Chairman might want to weigh in on it—but it   might make sense on the regularly scheduled two-day meetings to hold the minutes until after the   Chairman’s testimony but just in those two instances   Finally, with respect to the idea of dry runs, perhaps one or two might be worthwhile but   it seems to me that, if we are going to make some changes, it would nice to be able to announce   them as a package  Doing dry runs for the whole year would limit in that respect the impact of   the overall change, if there is one, in our transparency policy     Thank you, Governor Ferguson  Basically I’m just going to make a   few suggestions for marginal changes in our current practice that might be useful  But then I   want be the devil’s advocate at the end of my remarks  First, I think we should substitute or add   the core PCE because that probably is, after all, the measure more relevant to policy  Second, I   January 27-28, 2004 75 of 238    think it would be useful to add six months to the January forecast so that it has the same time   horizon as the July forecast  That would not be changing anything substantive  Third, to address   an issue that the Chairman raised, I think we should revise our forecasts as close to the release   date as possible so that they are not dated or stale when they come out  And finally, I do have a   thought on the standard errors  Concerns have been raised in earlier discussions of the   projections that they might be considered objectives or goals, for example, rather than forecasts   or that, by making a forecast, we risk our credibility in some way  Obviously, we can put in   standard errors to make it clear that they are forecasts and are subject to error and so on  One   simple way to put in standard errors would be to ask each forecaster to put a 25-75 bound around   their estimates—the 25th percentile and the 75th percentile  Then we could take the average   width of those bounds across the people whose forecasts are included in the central tendency   forecast  That would give an estimate of the average uncertainty among the forecasts of   members who are making forecasts  There are ways, I think, to add that  I just wanted to raise   that as something to be considered   Let me be the devil’s advocate for just a minute, although I’m not proposing any changes    Statements have been made that these forecasts have no meaning and that they don’t guide our   policy in any way  I think that’s an empirical question, and most of the empirical evidence that   exists goes exactly against that  Work that has done at the St Louis Fed suggests that FOMC   forecasts are better forecasts of inflation than the Blue Chip forecasts, for example, over long   periods of time     So far, and that’s all we can evaluate the forecasts on  There’s also   evidence that suggests that the Taylor rule based on FOMC forecasts is a better descriptor of   January 27-28, 2004 76 of 238    Federal Reserve behavior than other naïve type of Taylor rules  So I think it’s an empirical   question whether or not they’re useful  Again, I’m not suggesting a major change in the way we   use them, but I would ask us to leave open the issue of what information they contain       Thank you, Mr Chairman  I find it amusing that yesterday everyone   denied being in the forecasting business and today there is a round of forecasts  [Laughter]       Seventeen forecasts and one guess!  One of the key issues in the   forecast, of course, is the role of the output gap, and I have a few comments to make about that   topic  The use of the output gap or the Phillips curve relationship in forecasting inflation was a   subject at our two-day meeting in June 2002  At that meeting, Art Rolnick of the Minneapolis   Fed presented research by Andrew Atkeson and Lee Ohanian suggesting that output gap   measures were no better forecasters of inflation than a simple random walk assumption that   inflation next year will equal inflation this year  In particular, Atkeson and Ohanian showed that   the Greenbook forecast of inflation, which makes heavy use of the output gap concept, did no   better than the random walk model for the period 1984 to 1996   Given our current reliance on the output gap concept for projecting inflation, I thought it   would be worthwhile to revisit this discussion briefly  In particular, I would like to call your   attention to recent work by staff members at the Board and at the Federal Reserve Bank of   Boston  Work by Board staff member Deb Lindner summarized in a memo last summer, which   I’m sure she’d be glad to make available, confirms the results regarding the accuracy of   Greenbook forecasts for the period 1984 to 1996 for inflation measured by the GDP deflator    However, she also shows that the Atkeson–Ohanian results regarding the accuracy of Greenbook   forecasts are highly fragile on a number of dimensions, notably with respect to the sample period   employed and the measure of inflation used  Using the GDP deflator to measure inflation and   using real time data only, Lindner shows that when the Atkeson–Ohanian sample period is   extended back to 1980, the Greenbook forecasts are 40 percent better in terms of root mean   squared errors than the random walk alternative  In the more recent 1997-2002 period—for   which we, of course, have the Greenbook data but they are not yet publicly available—  Greenbook forecasts of GDP deflator inflation are 35 percent better than the random walk   January 27-28, 2004 162 of 238    benchmark  Lindner shows that the results are more dramatic still when inflation is measured by   the core CPI rather than by the GDP deflator  Even for the Atkeson–Ohanian sample period,   1984 to 1996, Greenbook forecasts for core CPI inflation are 24 percent better than the random   walk alternative  For the recent period, 1997-2002, real-time Greenbook forecasts of core CPI   inflation are a full 61 percent better than the random walk  These results are consistent with   those of several published papers, including a well-known paper by Christina and David Romer   that showed that the Greenbook forecasts of inflation have outperformed private-sector forecasts   The other recent study to which I’d like to call your attention is an article by Boston Fed   economists Michelle Barnes and Giovanni Olivei in the most recent New England Economic   Review  Barnes and Olivei estimate a piecewise (linear) Phillips curve that allows the effect of   the output gap on inflation to vary depending on how far away the economy is from potential    They find little relationship between unemployment and inflation in a region close to full   employment but a robust relationship when the unemployment rate is relatively far—which they   define as 14 percentage points—away from the natural rate  Barnes and Olivei propose   economic interpretations of this finding, but I would suggest a measurement-error interpretation    Because our measures of the NAIRU are necessarily quite noisy, when the output gap is small,   the measurement noise dominates the signal  Only when the measured output gap is relatively   large can we be reasonably sure that an actual output gap exists and, therefore, that inflation will   respond    These results, by the way, are consistent with my own informal investigations of the   predictive power of the Phillips curve  For the period from 1960 to the present, I find that a very   simple Phillips curve specification does not out-predict the random walk out of sample except at   times when unemployment is at least 1 percentage point above its average for the previous six   January 27-28, 2004 163 of 238    years  In short, output-gap-based forecasts of inflation are probably the most reliable during   periods of recession  And indeed, inflation behaved as the output gap theory would suggest in   2002 and 2003  Looking forward to 2004, the unemployment rate is now less than 1 percentage   point away from the estimated value of the NAIRU and from its recent average  While a   continuing output gap may induce some further disinflation, from a statistical point of view the   random walk model may now be just as good  That is, following President Stern, a good guess is   that inflation in 2004 will be the same as in 2003      With your permission, I’d like to add one thought on the “considerable period” language   that we’ll be discussing later  A good rule of thumb is to try to look as if you know what you’re   doing even if you’re not entirely sure  We properly emphasized that “considerable period” refers   to economic time, not calendar time, and we made our commitment explicitly conditional on low   inflation and resource slack  We can debate whether or not the intermeeting data, including the   December jobs report and very low inflation numbers, suggest improvement on those two   dimensions  However, the bond markets clearly believe that they do not, as yields have fallen   significantly and the expected date of Fed tightening has been pushed further into the future    Hence, as our conditionality is not perceived to have been satisfied, we have no fig leaf for   dropping the “considerable period” language today  I would rather wait until March and the   presumption that we will see at least one good payroll number by then  In short, I’m looking   now more at long-term credibility issues rather than short-term flexibility and tactical issues  Of   course, if we don’t see a strong payroll number by March, then we might be glad that we didn’t   drop the language  Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I agree with the phase-out approach  I   think it would be a mistake to drop this language suddenly  It would risk sending a signal that a   January 27-28, 2004 185 of 238    tightening is imminent and creating an overreaction in the financial markets  So I support both   your rate recommendation and your language recommendation     Am I voting on the statement or the statement and the policy action?     On both  Thank you  Yes     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I will align myself with the Kohn axis—     —which proposes that monetary policy patience is appropriate for   current macroeconomic conditions  However, the issue has been raised by Vice Chairman   March 16, 2004 68 of 107    Geithner and others that our current policy stance may contribute to potential financial   imbalances down the road  The history of using the monetary policy instrument rate for   correcting financial imbalances is a very checkered one, to say the least  So I think the question   arises as to whether there is some other tool or instrument that we might use to approach the   question of potential financial imbalances, and that’s what I’d like to talk about in my few   minutes   Many of the questions and comments we receive as FOMC members have to do with   perceived and actual risks to financial stability  Just to take a few examples, we have all on   occasion been asked whether there’s a bubble in the market for residential housing; whether the   narrowing of risk spreads on corporate bonds is justified by reduced default risk or is instead the   result of investors reaching for yield; whether household and firm balance sheets will remain   strong when interest rates rise; what risks to the financial system are posed by the activities of   the government-sponsored enterprises; and how Basel II and other regulatory developments are   likely to affect the structure and profitability of the domestic banking system  There are, of   course, many others  Such questions are obviously important but are extremely difficult for each   of us as individual FOMC members to respond to, and certainly not in detail  One’s inclination   is to answer by painting a benign picture so as not to cause unnecessary public concern  On the   other hand, financial conditions do change, and it’s our collective responsibility both to monitor   those changes and to communicate truthfully to the public what we see   The central banks of most industrialized countries have responded to this challenge by   issuing regular reports known as financial stability reports, usually on a semiannual or quarterly   basis  Financial stability reports give central banks and related institutions a means to provide   systematic and objective information about financial conditions over a range of sectors  I asked   March 16, 2004 69 of 107    the staff to provide me with examples of such reports, and they quickly came up with copies of   reports from thirteen different institutions  For the record, here is the list of major institutions   whose financial stability reports were provided to me by the staff  The Bank for International   Settlements, the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank, and the Central Banks   of Australia, Austria, Canada, United Kingdom, Finland, France, Germany, Norway, Spain, and   Sweden  All of these reports are on the Web, and I would be happy to provide URLs to anyone   who is interested     These reports are fascinating reading, and I commend them to you highly  Indeed, most   of them discuss the situation in the United States as well as in their own countries  The material   covered by the various reports is diverse, as you may imagine, as is the amount of analytical   detail  Typically, however, the reports begin with a general macroeconomic background and   then present both data and qualitative information on the financial conditions of banks and other   intermediaries, households, and firms  Other sections of the reports discuss developments in   security markets, international finance, and aspects of the financial infrastructure including   regulatory developments  Much of the material in these reports is in the public domain, but the   reports draw the data together and provide an analytic overview  In addition, boxes, research   notes, and even full-length articles on special topics are included  These reports allow central   banks to present their assessments of financial conditions in a way that is both objective and   responsive to the concerns and questions of the public  By calling attention to emerging   financial problems, as well as by focusing policymakers’ attention on them, these reports may   even help diffuse potential risks of financial instability     It seems to me that we might want to consider the possibility of providing the public with   some type of regular financial stability report, perhaps as part of the Monetary Policy Report to   March 16, 2004 70 of 107    the Congress or in some other existing venue or perhaps as a stand-alone document  I suspect   that much of the material in the report would be easily obtainable as a byproduct of regular   briefings in the Greenbook cycle  However, as I think under no circumstances should we impose   an unfunded mandate on the staff, an assessment of the marginal cost of providing such reports   should be a key part of any investigation of the possibility  If there is any interest in the group in   pursuing this idea either now or at some future time, I would personally be more than happy to   work with the staff to develop a more detailed proposal for the FOMC to consider  Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I appreciate the anecdotes regarding   price pressures, but I’m somewhat wary of them  I think many of them reflect the salience of the   commodity and energy price changes we’ve seen  But first, we know that those are a small part   of total costs  Second, there may be some confusion between high costs and rising costs, and of   course, only rising costs contribute to inflation   Also, I want to associate myself with Governor Ferguson’s point that the news since our   last meeting has been primarily of a weakening in the expansion, particularly in terms of the   employment statistics, and of a strengthening in the dollar The latter has not been talked about a   great deal, but the downward trend in the dollar has been arrested  So, Mr Chairman, I would   March 16, 2004 85 of 107    like to support the statement you have proposed, with the bias downward, understanding that we   may well want to come to a balanced assessment on inflation sometime soon     Mr Chairman?     I do have a concern about paragraph 3  It’s not just a question of   hiding or reducing the information available; I think that paragraph actually misrepresents the   substance of the conversation in that it seems to suggest that the reason for not releasing the   minutes earlier is purely logistical, which is certainly not correct  There were arguments of   substance on both sides, and to suggest that the arguments against are purely logistical risks   giving the impression that our convenience is more important than revealing information to the   market     Thank you, Mr Chairman  At our last meeting, I expressed some   wariness about relying too much on anecdotes for assessing the economic situation, particularly the   inflation situation  Well, as somebody once said, the plural of anecdotes is data  The data since the   last meeting do suggest that inflation has stabilized and that the recovery is beginning to take hold  I   concur, therefore, that this Committee should begin preparing the ground for a normalization of the   federal funds rate  Based on current information, however, my sense is that this normalization can   proceed at a deliberate pace for three reasons     First, it’s a mistake to equate the stance of monetary policy with the level of the current   federal funds rate, as some seem to do  In part because of our communication strategy, which has   linked future rate changes to the level of inflation and resource utilization, monetary and financial   conditions relevant to the economy have tightened considerably since our last meeting  For   example, since the day before the March FOMC meeting, both the ten-year Treasury rate and the   high-grade corporate bond rate have risen about 75 basis points, and the thirty-year fixed rate   mortgage has risen about 60 basis points  Judging by the small increase in the TIPS spread, these   increases are largely real increases  In addition, the dollar has appreciated about 2 percent since   March and more than 4 percent since the beginning of the year  Commodity prices appear to be   decelerating  Stock prices have been flat despite strong earnings news  In short, monetary   May 4, 2004 56 of 112       conditions broadly construed have already begun the process of normalizing, and the impetus being   applied to the economy has been correspondingly reduced  Of course, absent major new   developments, we need to follow through with the tightening the market now expects, but we   should not be overly worried about having fallen behind the curve  The monetary tightening   process has begun without us, so to speak, and it will continue to evolve endogenously with   incoming news   A second reason to plan to be deliberate in our tightening is that downside as well as upside   risks to the economy do remain, in my view  We have seen only one month of strong job numbers,   and although an unwelcome disinflation now appears quite unlikely, the labor market remains in an   early stage of recovery, with essentially no increase in the employment-to-population ratio over the   past three quarters despite robust output growth  With productivity growth still strong, a high rate   of output growth as well as a conviction on the part of employers that rapid growth will be sustained   is needed to support new job creation  From a risk-management perspective, as we begin to raise   rates we should weigh the risk of significantly impeding the labor market recovery against the risk   of having to scramble to adjust to unexpectedly adverse inflation developments   Third, it is true that recent inflation has been above the desirable level  I hear what people   are saying around the table; absolutely, I hear the concerns being expressed  The question before us   is whether the situation involves a one-time adjustment or whether the pattern will persist  The data   notwithstanding, the case for believing that core inflation will remain comfortably in the 1 to   2 percent range over the next year still seems strong to me  The arguments for forecasting stable   inflation go well beyond the level of the output gap, which I recognize is impossible to measure   with precision  Besides labor market slack, the arguments for stable inflation also include the   impact of continuing productivity growth on unit labor costs, the unusually high level of price–cost   May 4, 2004 57 of 112       markups, the intensity of domestic–international competition, the likely deceleration of commodity   prices, and the recent endogenous tightening of monetary and financial conditions, which I’ve   already noted     Perhaps the principal area of risk on the inflation front is the possibility that inflation   expectations may ratchet upward  Given our struggle to improve communications and in honor of   Al Broaddus’s last meeting, I cannot resist the temptation to point out how helpful a quantitative   medium-term inflation objective would be at this juncture  [Laughter]  Clarifying our inflation   objective would increase the coherence of our policymaking  It would also help to anchor private-  sector expectations of inflation and perhaps reduce the significant inflation risk premiums now   embedded in long-term interest rates  Most important, if we provided quantitative guidance about   our inflation objective, we would now be able to make a firm, highly visible, and ultimately   verifiable commitment to maintaining price stability at this crucial moment in the expansion   Finally, returning to reality, [laughter] I endorse the Bluebook’s proposal to replace   “patience” with the phrase “can likely be removed at a measured pace”  The proposed new phrase   implies no commitment whatsoever on our part  The word “likely” clearly conveys that the new   wording is intended to be a probabilistic forecast of the evolution of policy conditional on the   currently available information  No further change in language would be necessary before   tightening—or even after the tightening process begins  In particular, with this wording we can   certainly raise the funds rate in June if the incoming data so dictate  The major benefit of this   language is that it will calm fears that the Fed is currently planning to repeat the 1994-95 pattern of   pre-emptive strikes  In communicating that that is not our present intention, the new wording will   serve the very useful function of reducing the chance of an overreaction in the bond market that   would damage both the markets and the economy  Thank you   May 4, 2004 58 of 112         Haven’t you done surveys on the market’s expectations regarding the   language?  I think you have     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support your recommendation  I think the   debate going around the table has less to do with our differences in outlook than that there continues   to be some fundamental confusion about how we’re communicating to the market and what our   mechanisms ought to be  I just raise the point that we really ought to revisit these issues at some   time in the near future  Given where we are today, though, I think that the language being proposed   is both useful guidance to the market and protects against the risk of an overreaction in interest rates   that would be counterproductive both to the markets and to the economy  Our statement is a   forecast; it is not a commitment  And I don’t think that it constrains us unduly, even if it becomes   necessary to make larger moves     Thank you  Joe, in modeling the current account deficit, you have to   explain where it came from  A big part of your story is that US assets and foreign assets are   June 29-30, 2004 39 of 203          imperfect substitutes, and there was a big exogenous increase in the foreign demand for US   assets  I understand why you did that, but that’s a very important assumption  The elasticity of   substitution between our assets and foreign assets is going to affect many aspects of the model    For example, if it’s inelastic, a change in the demand for US assets on the part of, say, foreign   central banks would have a large effect on the value of the dollar  So I guess my question is, Do   you accept that implication?  What would be the effect of assuming a much more elastic   relationship in demands between different assets?  How central is this to your basic story?     Yes     I was also pointing out that this assumption has important   implications for the way the model works  For example, relatively small changes of demands in   June 29-30, 2004 40 of 203          the portfolio can have large effects on relative asset prices  How sensitive are your simulations   to that assumption?     Thank you  It didn’t pass my notice that the first part of the   presentation was in the form of a financial stability report, which I found very useful, and I   commend the staff for that  I have a question about chart 4 for the household sector and about chart   5 for the business sector, where you show the average interest rate on the stock of debt vis-à-vis the   rate on new debt  I just note that that’s an average and, if we’re thinking about financial distress, we   might be concerned about the tails of the distribution  Do we have any information about the 90th   percentile or anything of that sort that would describe whether a significant portion of households   and firms are in a danger zone?     Thank you     President Stern, I asked the staff to calculate for me if we followed   exactly the path of the funds rate that is now built into markets, where the ten-year rate would be a   year from now  And their answer was 30 basis points higher than it is today  So, it is not 50 percent    of the rise in the funds rate      Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’d like to share with you Meyer’s Rules of   Forecasting, as propounded by former FOMC member and current sensationalist author, Larry   Meyer  [Laughter]  Rule 1, stick with your forecast as long as possible  Rule 2, when your forecast   becomes untenable, make a new forecast  Rule 3, know when to switch from rule 1 to rule 2    [Laughter]   There’s nothing much needed in terms of changes to our forecast for the real side of the   economy, which has thus far evolved much as this Committee predicted in both June 2003 and   January 2004  The economy has come a long way in the past year, and as we contemplate new   challenges ahead, we should pause to take some satisfaction in the Federal Reserve’s contribution to   June 29-30, 2004 135 of 203          the turnaround  Our policy actions, reinforced by innovations in our communication strategy,   helped provide crucial support to the economy during a dangerous period    As an aside, there has recently been a bit of revisionism to the effect that our concerns with   deflation a year ago were overstated on the grounds that the official statistics may have in some way   exaggerated the true extent of disinflation  Understanding last year’s inflation behavior is important   but in my view not really relevant to assessing the extent of the policy challenge the FOMC faced in   early 2003  The most salient fact about the first half of 2003 was that the economy continued to   sputter even as our policy rate declined to 1 percent  We thus faced the real possibility, whether   remote or not, that the funds rate would reach or come close to the zero lower bound, a development   that would have greatly complicated our subsequent policymaking  Avoiding those dangerous   waters on the way to robust economic growth was an important achievement indeed    Unlike the growth forecast, the inflation forecast is one to which Meyer’s rules of   forecasting may now apply  I certainly did not anticipate the pickup in inflation we have seen in the   past few months, and I congratulate my colleagues who were more astute than I in appreciating the   early change in the pricing environment  Given what we have seen in the inflation data, the   question now is whether the time has come for me to switch from Meyer’s rule 1 to rule 2  I wish   rule 3 would give more practical guidance on this question!  [Laughter]  The key issue, of course, is   whether the recent increase in inflation portends further increases or whether it was instead at least   partly temporary  Though suitably chastened by my recent forecast misses, I guess I can’t help   myself  I’m still inclined to the view that inflation, both headline and core, is likely to moderate in   the second half of the year  In particular, the stabilization of energy prices—oil prices are now more   than 15 percent off their peak—non-energy commodity prices, and the dollar bode especially well   for the inflation outlook, though it may be some months before we see the full effect     June 29-30, 2004 136 of 203          In this respect, I find the decomposition of the recent increase in inflation provided to me by   staff member Charles Fleischman and similar to the presentation this morning quite interesting    Between the second half of 2003 and the first half of 2004, core PCE inflation increased by a full   percentage point at an annual rate  Of this increase, 04 percentage point was accounted for by a   rapid acceleration in nonmarket prices—ie, made-up prices, notably the infamous deflator for   financial services  With nonmarket prices excluded, more than 100 percent of the acceleration in   core PCE inflation between 2003H2 and 2004H1 can be accounted for by higher inflation or less   deflation in goods prices, particularly durable goods prices  In contrast, the inflation in services   excluding energy, whether inclusive of housing services or not, has actually decelerated in the past   six months  As it seems likely that goods prices would be relatively more affected by changes in the   value of the dollar and in the prices of energy and raw materials, this pattern seems consistent with   the inference that the recent increase in inflation is due more to these factors than to a generalized   increase in aggregate demand or higher labor costs, for example   Moderation of inflation does require that unit labor costs remain under control  Labor   supply still seems quite elastic  The fact that the recent addition of more than a million jobs has   barely affected the unemployment rate suggests that many people stand ready to enter the labor   force as conditions improve  Wage trends are more difficult to assess  Compensation per hour in   the nonfarm business sector increased at a 47 percent annual rate in the first quarter, more than we   expected  However, because total compensation data include such items as retrospective pension   payments and the value of exercised stock options, they may overstate the true marginal cost of   labor  At the other extreme, average hourly earnings of production workers, which exclude such   items but also exclude other benefits costs such as health insurance, rose only 19 percent at an   June 29-30, 2004 137 of 203          annual rate in the first quarter  The true growth in marginal cost is no doubt bracketed by these two   figures     All this said, it has been brought home to me by recent experience that inflation forecasts as   well as output forecasts are, of course, always hazardous and seem particularly so today  Knowing   when to switch from Meyer’s rule 1 to rule 2 is not so easy  Given these uncertainties, it seems to   me that the best tactic for us at this juncture is to temporize, embarking on a program of gradual rate   increases but remaining alert and ready to adjust in response to incoming information   With respect to communication, I would simply say that I am fairly comfortable with the   configuration of expectations about future tightening that is now built into the market  So if we do   change communication, I hope we will be careful not to destabilize those expectations unduly    Thank you     But that’s much more pronounced in the sustained interest rate—      Thank you, Mr Chairman  The economy appears to have lost some   momentum, and unfortunately the recent slowdown may be more pronounced than can be   accounted for by the rise in energy prices alone  For example, we would normally expect   households confronted with higher energy prices to reduce their saving in order to smooth the   impact of higher energy costs on non-energy consumption  Instead, the household saving rate has   recently risen, hinting perhaps at a more urgently felt need to rebuild wealth in the face of a flat or   declining stock market  Likewise, firms appear to be investing less and, especially, hiring less than   would seem justified by their order backlogs, raising the possibility that the excessive business   caution we saw last year is surfacing again  Some support for the business caution hypothesis is   provided by the estimates of second-quarter productivity growth released this morning—29 percent   in the nonforeign business sector and 75 percent in manufacturing—which account for a large part   of second-quarter growth and suggest that firms are still focused on cutting costs     Overall, our plan to tighten at a measured pace looks pretty good right now  The gradualist   approach moves us predictably toward rate neutrality yet leaves the economy some breathing space   and gives us some time to observe economic developments  One complication for policy, noted by   President Pianalto, has been the divergence this year between core and headline measures of   inflation  The Committee tends to focus on the core measures on the grounds that they are better   indicators of the underlying inflation trend and more likely to influence long-term inflation   expectations  But Committee members have also warned that headline inflation should not be   ignored     I would like to report very briefly on some work I’ve done with the staff that attempts to   address the relative importance of core and headline inflation measures as influences on long-term   August 10, 2004 52 of 103          inflation expectations  We did two exercises  First, staff member Jeremy Rudd and I ran a battery   of regressions relating alternative measures of expected inflation to current and lagged measures of   actual inflation  The idea was to determine which measures of inflation have the greatest influence   on inflation expectations  Our measures of long-term inflation expectations included the ten-year   inflation forecast from a survey of professional forecasters and the median expectation of inflation   five to ten years out in the Michigan survey of consumers  For comparison, we also looked at the   short-term year-ahead inflation expectations from the Michigan survey  Inflation measures whose   predictive power was tested included the total CPI, core CPI, total PCE inflation, core PCE   inflation, and market-based core PCE inflation  We examined a variety of specifications and   sample periods and used both quarterly and monthly data, as available  Many details aside, the   regression analysis suggests that core measures of inflation do seem to be better predictors of long-  term inflation expectations, as anticipated, although their advantage is not in all cases large    Moreover, in the regression analysis, core inflation measures outperformed not only headline   inflation as predictors but also real-side indicators such as industrial production and payroll   employment  In contrast, as expected, short-term inflation expectations are much better predicted   by headline inflation rather than by core inflation     The second exercise, done with Refet Gurkaynak and Andrew Levin, used high-frequency   data from financial markets  Here we measured long-term inflation expectations by TIPS inflation   compensation at the five-to-ten-year horizon, and we investigated how the market-based measure   responds within the day to various types of macroeconomic news announcements  Consistent with   both the regression results and market lore, we found again that news about core inflation has a   considerably greater effect on long-horizon inflation compensation than does news about headline   inflation  Indeed, the noncore part of inflation has a zero or even slightly negative effect on long-   August 10, 2004 53 of 103          horizon inflation compensation  Overall, these results provide support for our focus on core   inflation measures in making monetary policy   In contrast to the regression analysis, the TIPS event study also found that long-horizon   inflation compensation responds strongly not only to inflation indicators but also to real variables,   such as the advance GDP release, the ISM survey, and new home sales—a result consistent with   recent work by Gurkaynak, Sack, and Swanson at the Board and by Kliesen and Schmid of the   St Louis Federal Reserve Bank  Further analysis of all these results would be worthwhile    However, at face value, the finding that long-horizon inflation expectations appear to respond to   short-term economic developments, whether real or nominal, raises the possibility that long-term   inflation expectations in the United States are not as firmly anchored as we would like  This brings   me back to the current situation   If inflation expectations are, indeed, imperfectly anchored, it is very important that we   continue to demonstrate in word and deed our commitment to price stability  I earlier indicated my   support for continuing with our plan to tighten at a measured pace  If the economy continues to   weaken, we may find ourselves considering whether slowing or stopping this process is warranted    I think we would be best advised not to deviate materially from our current plan unless we are fully   persuaded that both core inflation and long-term inflation expectations are well contained  Thank   you     I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman  I think we might   encounter circumstances under which we’d want to skip a meeting in our measured pace of   removing policy accommodation—perhaps to “undisaccommodate”  [Laughter]  But I agree with   Governor Gramlich that a moderate rise in energy prices would not be a rationale for doing that    That’s a circumstance in which it’s important to maintain the anti-inflationary dimension of this   Committee’s policy      I think the difference between us and Korea is that they borrow in   foreign currencies whereas we borrow in our own currency      So a depreciation of their currency creates balance sheet effects      Thank you, Mr Chairman  In reviewing developments so far in   2004, it’s useful to characterize the economy as having faced a medium-sized aggregate supply   shock during the first half of this year  This composite shock comprised various effects   associated with the decline in the dollar, the increase in broad indexes of commodity prices, and   the especially sharp rise in energy prices  The mixture of the supply shock and the ongoing   cyclical expansion made the economic data particularly hard to interpret this spring  This   Committee was generally more willing than outside forecasters or market participants to link   macroeconomic developments to the influences in this composite aggregate supply shock,   particularly the energy cost component  We argued on that basis that both the rise in inflation   earlier this year and the soft patch in economic activity in June were likely to prove transitory    Both of these forecasts have worked out pretty well, supporting the view that shocks to aggregate   supply were indeed the principal reason that inflation in the first half was higher and growth   lower than had been expected   September 21, 2004 67 of 100          Arguably, at this point, the effects of the supply shock may be, to a substantial degree,   behind us  The dollar has been roughly stable all year, and the rise in import prices accordingly   has decelerated  Broad indexes of commodity prices peaked in March  Oil prices are still rising,   and their volatility as well as their level may have a damping effect on the economy  However,   about three-quarters of the increase in near futures crude oil prices since late last year had   already occurred by last May, and refinery margins have fallen  The waning effects of the   supply shock can be seen directly in the moderation of core inflation and the rebound in   spending in the third quarter, as we’ve already noted  Of course, further rises in oil prices or   declines in the dollar are always possible  If no such development occurs, however, the ebbing   of the supply shock will afford us increasingly greater clarity about the underlying strength of   this expansion   My own very tentative assessment is that the recovery at this stage is proceeding at a   pace that is solid but somewhat less vigorous than we had hoped or expected  In particular,   expansion at the current pace seems unlikely to create new inflationary pressures  Looking   forward, the jobs data will be crucial  If job growth continues at the pace of the past few months,   I think we would have grounds for concern about both business confidence and the prospects for   household spending   Overall, I think our strategy of removing accommodation at a measured pace has worked   out well, not only in providing support to the economy and avoiding nasty surprises in financial   markets but also in allowing us time to assess ongoing developments  I support our current plan   of measured withdrawal of emergency stimulus  We surely can raise the funds rate today   without doing damage to the recovery  I also see no need to change the basic framework of our   statement  As we go forward, however, we should remain flexible in slowing or speeding up the   September 21, 2004 68 of 100          process as dictated by incoming data  Financial markets are well prepared for this type of   flexibility, and I believe it fits well with our declared strategy of removing accommodation at a   measured but not mechanistic pace  Thank you     I support the recommendation     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Oil prices notwithstanding, the odds that   the economy will continue to grow above trend and that core inflation will remain low and stable   seem reasonably good  Growth has been solid this year despite the headwinds created by rising   energy prices and a widening trade deficit  By the magic of GDP growth arithmetic, even if oil   prices and the trade deficit do not improve at all in 2005, so long as they don’t worsen significantly,   growth next year will receive a net boost   November 10, 2004 59 of 107    Aggregate supply constraints should not be a problem for the expansion either  Job creation   last month was substantial, but the increase in the labor force was even larger according to the   household survey  The employment-to-population ratio remains low  The number of people   working part time for economic reasons remains high, and the number of individuals who are not in   the labor force but report that they want jobs increased by a half million last month, according to the   Greenbook supplement  Wage growth does not signal much pressure on labor supply either  So in   short, I think the economy still has some room to grow   The inflation fundamentals are likewise generally encouraging  Over the past year, unit   labor costs have risen only 06 percent, and the underlying trend appears to be consistent with core   inflation at current levels  Energy costs are up, of course, but non-energy commodity prices have   declined since our last meeting and are up only about 2½ percent for 2004 as a whole, using the   CRB spot industrial index  The markup of prices over unit labor costs remains close to its 1997   peak, leaving plenty of scope for businesses to absorb higher labor and energy costs  The recent   increase in the TIPS spread puzzles me a bit, particularly as inflation compensation at the five-to-  ten-year horizon is down  It’s also interesting that, since the last FOMC meeting, both nominal   bond yields and TIPS inflation compensation have been negatively correlated with oil prices,   suggesting that investors are concerned more about the growth effect of higher oil prices than about   any possible inflationary effects   Looking forward, I think a reasonable goal for policy would be to try to keep PCE core   inflation at about its current level in 2005 and 2006  In light of the energy situation and the fact that   we are at a stage of the cycle in which inflation pressures sometimes increase, stabilizing core   inflation is important to anchor inflation expectations more firmly and to provide a sound basis for   the sustained expansion  We should keep in mind, however, that inflation can be too low as well as   too high and be aware of overkill  As an illustration of possibilities, a FRB/US simulation provided   November 10, 2004 60 of 107    to me by David Reifschneider projects that, if the FOMC were to tighten by 25 basis points at every   meeting in 2005, we could be back in the disinflation soup by 2006   What path of monetary policy is most likely to be consistent with both nominal and real   stability?  I’ll just note here that the range goes from two increases in the next year in the   Greenbook to about five increases next year in the market forecast  Although policy, of course, will   depend on incoming data, it seems not at all improbable that we will choose to stand pat at a   number of meetings next year while continuing to remove policy accommodation at a measured   pace  If this scenario seems plausible, then we should probably begin soon to signal to the public   that pauses may occur  In particular, as we reach a funds rate of 2 percent, it’s important not to give   the impression that our future funds rate increases will be automatic or that the Committee has   some goal for the funds rate that is independent of the state of the economy  Instead, we should   focus on whether the overall thrust of monetary policy as reflected in the entire term structure and   not just the funds rate is consistent with our objectives  Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support both parts of your   recommendation I have just two comments  One is that I think you overstate a bit the idea that the   current funds rate is outside the range of historical experience  As President Poole noted, it’s not so   unusual in real terms—   November 10, 2004 86 of 107      Oh, the 1 percent, okay  I don’t think there’s a basis to move just on an   allergy to a 2 percent funds rate; I think it should be based on the data and on the economy  I would   just note additionally that the economy responds most directly to overall financial conditions, and   there I don’t think we’re anywhere close to the border of what has been experienced in history   My second comment is on communications  As everyone knows, I disagree with President   Minehan; I think we should be trying to provide guidance  In my view it has worked very well the   last couple of years  I don’t think it was surprising that it worked well  Precisely because we are   assessing such complex matters—for example, we’re trying to assess the course of productivity—  it’s very difficult for the market to read our minds  We need to provide some kind of guidance;   whether it’s conditional or whatever it may be, I think we should  I’m personally comfortable with   dropping the “measured” language or modifying the language, but I hope we do not go back to a   completely uninformative statement, at least without some thorough discussion of what the options   might be  Thank you     I support the expedited release of the minutes  I think we should point   out that on a number of occasions this year the delayed release of the minutes has actually confused   the market—stepped on our message from the most recent meeting by sending a somewhat different   signal  And although I don’t have a lot of market contacts, a number of them did contact me at   those times and asked, “What’s going on here?”  Second, I would put more weight on the notion   December 14, 2004 82 of 118           that we all have to go out and give speeches and talks and answer questions and we worry about   giving the wrong signal and confusing the market  It would be a comfort to have a Committee   document out there to which we can refer and which the market can use for putting our remarks in   perspective  That will reduce the risk that we all face of inadvertently moving the market or   creating a misimpression  And finally, I would just note, as Vincent’s study showed, that a number   of other central banks have used this practice effectively and have not had serious problems with it     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Overall, the intermeeting data suggest a   pickup in the pace of the expansion in output and employment, with fewer downside risks to   growth  Inflation risks have also moved slightly to the upside, I think, but falling oil prices help to   make any really significant increase in inflation unlikely  I don’t think the shift in the outlook   warrants a change in the balance of risks, at least not at this meeting, but for me these developments   clinch the case for continuing our policy of reducing accommodation at a measured pace   I’d like to add a few comments on the current account and the dollar  An important question   for monetary policy is how long the current configuration—the large current account deficit and   relatively slow adjustment of the dollar and real interest rates—can persist  If this configuration   were the result of cyclical forces or other short-term factors like currency manipulation, then the   expected half-life of the adjustment process might be short  However, I think the US external   deficit is largely a secular phenomenon which, consequently, is likely to evolve relatively slowly    The key factor underlying the US external deficit, in my view, is excess global savings    Advanced industrial nations with aging populations, notably Japan and Western Europe, need to   save for demographic reasons  Absent sufficient investment opportunities at home, they can do this   December 14, 2004 51 of 118           only by running current account surpluses  Ideally, the savings of these mature industrial   economies would fund investment in developing and emerging-market economies  However, in   part because of the financial crises of the 1990s, emerging-market economies are either unable or   unwilling to accept large capital inflows, resulting in an economically perverse situation in which   countries like Korea, Brazil, and Argentina have become significant exporters rather than importers   of financial capital  The United States is the recipient of massive savings inflows because, to a first   approximation, global savings have nowhere else to go  As neither the demographic factors driving   saving in mature industrial economies nor the inability of emerging markets to absorb large capital   inflows is likely to change soon, these inflows are likely to persist   Is the situation sustainable?  I think it can be sustained for some years, though time does not   permit me to seriously address that issue today  It is worth observing, however, that contrary to the   perception that the US current account is being driven by an unsustainable consumption binge,   Americans are not consuming beyond their means  As a result of rising stock and house prices,   over the past year US net national wealth—that is, net both of foreign borrowing and of   governmental saving—has increased about $33 trillion, or around 30 percent of GDP  That’s a   number which, incidentally, goes some way toward explaining the continuing strength of   consumption spending  If there is a causal relationship between the current account deficit and US   consumption, it’s principally from the former to the latter, as large savings inflows have lowered   real rates and thus raised asset values in the United States   I draw two somewhat contradictory conclusions for monetary policy  First, it’s quite   possible—even likely—that a US current account adjustment will play out gradually over a   number of years  The staff’s assumption of a slowly depreciating dollar is, therefore, the right one   for our planning purposes  We should not attempt to forecast swings in the dollar or base our policy   December 14, 2004 52 of 118           on a presumption that a rapid depreciation is likely in the near term  Let’s see what the dollar does   and then respond as necessary to fulfill our mandate    However, while a slow unwinding of the current account deficit and relatively gradual   adjustment of the dollar may be the most likely outcome, in a world of herding and momentum   trading, financial accidents can happen  A panicky flight from the dollar, whether justified in some   fundamental sense or not, would be very harmful  Hence, my second, and I should emphasize, very   tentative conclusion  When facing a closely balanced policy decision, we are probably better off   erring slightly on the side of tightness rather than on the side of ease  A higher rate makes short-  term dollar assets more attractive and raises the cost of shorting the currency, lowering the risk of a   sudden depreciation  All else being equal, a very slight bias toward a higher funds rate may thus   provide a bit of insurance against a financial accident in the foreign exchange market  Thank you     I support the recommendation    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I know I’m not the median voter on this   issue, so mostly I’d like to listen today  But I have just a couple of comments   The staff did an excellent job of laying out the costs and benefits of a specific numerical   objective for inflation They noted quite carefully that the empirical evidence is far from decisive on   the issues that they raised I think the same argument could apply, for example, to whether or not   low inflation is good in the first place It’s just very difficult to get precise empirical evidence on   these issues, and, therefore, I think we all have to take a priori reasoning as being part of the   argument here  I won’t repeat those arguments, but I think we all have to introspect on these issues   The question was raised as to how we define price stability In my public remarks, I have   occasionally referred to price stability as defined in terms of the core PCE deflator in a 1 to 2 percent                 February 1-2, 2005 16 of 177  range There are two principles here that I believe are somewhat important  The first is that the   bottom level of that range not be zero  I think maintaining some space between the zero lower   bound and our interest rate is important, and I would be uncomfortable with a lower range that   brings us to zero too frequently   The second principle is whether to use a core or a total measure, and I think that should   depend to a large extent on the time horizon  If we’re looking at a relatively short horizon, in my   view the core measure is right because it is less variable and it better measures the underlying trend   If we’re looking at a long-run objective, then I think a total measure is perfectly fine  Other than   those two comments, personally, I would put a lot of weight on trying to achieve consensus, and I   don’t take a dogmatic view on this measure   Let me make just a couple of comments about how I personally would view this innovation   if we were to go down this route First, as the staff pointed out, adopting an explicit numerical   objective would not, of course, be a full-fledged inflation targeting regime of the form undertaken by   the United Kingdom, Sweden, Canada, and other countries  Let me say that I think having a long-  run inflation objective that is defined first of all not as price stability per se, but rather as the long-run   inflation rate that best achieves our dual mandate, would be a major step forward  And if we were to   take that step—that is, if we were to establish a true north on the compass, so to speak, for long-run   monetary policy—I would not push for any further steps in the direction of a short-term inflation   targeting regime   The second observation I’d like to make is that I think one benefit of this approach   ultimately would be to provide a stable and quantitative method of communicating our intentions   and our plans to the public Specifically, if ultimately we went down this route, I think we’d want to   combine an inflation objective with perhaps more frequent forecasts that would help the public   assess whether or not the economy was on a path that would eventually get us back to the stable   equilibrium, so to speak  So I do think this approach would be useful eventually in terms of   communication  In light of that, again speaking for myself, if we were to go down this route, I think           February 1-2, 2005 17 of 177  I would be quite comfortable with removing the forward-looking language that currently is in the   statement and moving toward a more quantitative type of communication over time  Thank you    Does your simulation of the effect of the 10 percent decline in the dollar   include the effects on foreign countries’ income from facing a more appreciated exchange rate?    It also affects their import demands      That’s from the income effects                                   February 1-2, 2005 83 of 177   The reason I ask is because your simulation raises the question of   whether the derivative is the right sign on the current account with respect to the dollar Given the   effect that the falling dollar has on our interest rates and, therefore, on our capital income payments,   there seems to be so very little effect on the current account from the weakening dollar    Thank you, Mr Chairman  The economic recovery seems well   entrenched, and domestic final demand continued strong, foreshadowing healthy growth in 2005  I   don’t see inflation risks as having changed materially in recent months  In particular, labor costs   have been remarkably subdued  However, with the recovery no longer fragile, continued   withdrawal of monetary accommodation at a measured pace remains the appropriate policy, in my   view   Some have cited a possible slowdown in labor productivity growth as an upside risk for   inflation on the grounds that slower productivity growth implies a more rapid rise in unit labor costs    While lower productivity does, of course, lead to higher unit labor costs, all else equal, the links   between productivity growth and inflation, as well as the implications for policy, are actually quite   subtle I’d like to use the remainder of my time to discuss this issue briefly                     February 1-2, 2005 102 of 177  First, it’s important to note that an assumption of slower productivity growth is already   incorporated into the Greenbook forecast The staff projects output per hour in the nonfarm business   sector to rise at about a 17 percent annual rate in 2005, less than recent experience and about a   percentage point below the profession’s consensus estimate of the long-run trend  The projected   slowdown reflects both cyclical factors and the assumption that there will be some giveback of the   extraordinary recent gains As productivity growth has surprised repeatedly on the upside for almost   a decade now, I think the risks for the Greenbook productivity projections should be viewed as well   balanced, at worst   The staff projects that the deceleration in the cyclical component of output per hour should   have little effect on inflation but will instead lower profit margins  And even though the expected   slowdown in structural productivity growth will put upward pressure on prices, the staff expects the   impact on inflation of that productivity slowdown to be offset by other factors like declining energy   prices and a stabilization of the dollar   To summarize, the Greenbook’s baseline forecast shows that some slowing of productivity   growth, at least, is not inconsistent with continued stable inflation  The interesting question is   What will happen if productivity growth in 2005 comes in even lower than the 17 percent projected   by the staff?  If firms view the resulting increase in the rate of growth of unit labor costs as more or   less permanent, then historical experience suggests that these costs will be passed on to consumers   fairly quickly, thereby boosting inflation in the short run  However, it does not follow that policy   should therefore be tightened more aggressively  The appropriate response depends also on the   reaction of aggregate demand to this change in productivity growth   If a slowing in productivity growth occurs that is both perceived as permanent and is also   largely unexpected by households and firms, then stock prices should fall and households should   mark down their estimates of permanent income  The resulting decline in aggregate demand will   tend to offset the inflationary impacts of the productivity slowdown  Also, because firms will expect   a lower long-run return to capital, the neutral real fed funds rate will fall As a consequence, as                       February 1-2, 2005 103 of 177  illustrated in chart 6 of the Bluebook, the optimal policy response to a permanent slowdown in   productivity growth may well involve a slower pace of tightening rather than a faster one, despite a   possible short-run bump in inflation  This scenario is just a mirror image of the post-1995   experience in which a perceived increase in secular productivity growth sparked a stock market   boom and rapid growth in spending, and hence was not disinflationary, despite the fact that unit   labor costs declined   What if productivity growth slows substantially but aggregate demand does not respond?  In   that instance, unfortunately, we might be called upon to make a judgment about whether the   slowdown is likely to prove temporary or permanent  If it is temporary, then neither inflation nor   policy should respond very much  If the slowdown is judged to be permanent, however, the failure   of aggregate demand to adjust would suggest that households and firms anticipated the slowdown,   while the staff was too optimistic  In this case, the slowdown in productivity should indeed be met   with a tightening of policy in the short run However, the funds rate should be lower in the long run,   reflecting the fact that the neutral fed funds rate will also be lower  This scenario is the mirror image   of the 2002-2003 period in which productivity gains created disinflationary pressures that did   require aggressive easing in the short run   To summarize, slower productivity growth does not necessarily require a tighter policy    First, some slowing is already anticipated and incorporated into the Greenbook forecast  Second, if   a significant slowing occurs, the key issue is the extent to which aggregate demand responds to the   slowdown A sufficiently large decline in aggregate demand might well reverse the presumption   that tighter policy is needed when unit labor costs rise Thank you    I support the recommendation, and I promise to try to be happy   [Laughter]    Mr Chairman, I just wanted to note that the index, I think, is simply   an equal weighting of all the various contracts that are traded It makes no attempt at weighting    Because there are a number of different contracts that are traded    There is no economic content weighting    Thank you, Mr Chairman  We are experiencing a mini-inflation scare   in financial markets—a development that we need to take very seriously  The primary reason for the   scare was the recent rapid increase in the prices of oil and other basic commodities  Other   determinants of inflation, it should be noted, seem to be largely under control   Still-strong productivity growth and subdued wage increases have been sufficient to induce   some recent deceleration in unit labor costs  At the sectoral level, recent increases in auto prices   seem unlikely to continue, given the industry’s inventory overhang  And I note that this morning’s   report showed a 09 percent decline in February in auto prices Prices of imported consumer goods   have also been remarkably tame, rising about 1 percent in the year to January despite the fall in the   dollar And the influx of low-cost apparel imports associated with the end of the Multifiber   Agreement should provide more help on that front  Inflation in services is stable, and far future   inflation compensation, which effectively strips out oil effects, has not risen   How serious is the inflation risk posed by rising commodity prices?  One view, which, if   correct, would be quite worrisome, is that commodity prices are the canary in the coal mine—   indicators of easy monetary policy and building inflationary pressure  I don’t find this view   persuasive, and I note that the academic literature has found essentially no support for it  Instead,   recent commodity price increases seem to be largely the result of economic developments unrelated   to US monetary policy, which I would call supply shocks, although without disagreeing with   President Poole What we’re saying here is that China is exogenous  [Laughter] In the case of oil,   for example, international agencies have recently revised downward their projections of non-OPEC   production while increasing their estimates of global demand for crude, reflecting in part the                                March 22, 2005 57 of 116  likelihood that growth in demand this year will be disproportionately concentrated in energy-  inefficient countries, such as China   The weak dollar, which I suspect is responding more to the current account situation than to   monetary policy per se, is also affecting the oil price  Since 2000, oil prices have risen 98 percent in   dollar terms, but they have also risen by 45 percent even in euro terms and by 76 percent in yen   terms   If the supply shock interpretation is correct, then the effects on core inflation of the recent   run-up should be moderate  As is well known, commodities and raw materials make up a small   share of producers’ costs For example, the staff estimates that even in a full employment situation,   in which firms have some pricing power, a 1 percent increase in the core PPI for intermediate goods   should result in less than a 5 basis point increase in the core CPI By the way, I think that fact helps   to reconcile to some extent the benign inflation numbers with the anecdotal reports of price   increases, since many of them take place at the intermediate level   An interesting datum from last week’s survey of 22 primary dealers is that, on average, they   expect core PCE inflation of 191 percent at an annual rate during the third quarter of this year, up   only 6 basis points from what they expected for the same period as of the week before the last   FOMC meeting   If we are, indeed, facing a supply shock, then to some extent the situation is analogous to   where we were last spring when inflation pressures proved transitory and policy patience paid off   However, all economists have two hands  And on my other hand, I agree that there are also   important differences from the situation last spring  The expansion has considerably more   momentum today than it did then  Core inflation is approaching the top of my comfort zone, and I                                   March 22, 2005 58 of 116  would not like to see it go much higher  Finally, futures markets suggest that this time the shocks to   commodity prices are expected to be relatively more permanent than they were last time     For these reasons, the risks to both the output and inflation objectives of a slightly more   aggressive policy posture seem fairly modest  My bottom line is that I support raising the funds rate   by only 25 basis points today However, I believe that it would behoove the Committee to modify   the statement in a way that signals the possibility of stronger actions in the near future  Thank you    I agree with President Poole    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support the recommendation  I think the   addition of the phrase “appropriate policy action” is actually useful, because it will emphasize that   our forecast is conditional on continued tightening rather than being an unconditional forecast   I agree with Governor Kohn and Governor Ferguson, among others, that it’s important to   provide as much information as we have about future developments in the economy and policy    And I think perhaps we should consider the alternative C language that Vincent Reinhart has   suggested   Finally, I would just like to raise the issue of process Of course, it’s very useful to get   information out as soon as possible, but I think we have to recognize that the statement does have to                                         March 22, 2005 98 of 116  reflect the discussion at the meeting and the condition of the economy  Therefore, it needs to be   understood that we have some flexibility to make changes nearer to the meeting  I think that’s an   important point to recognize  Thank you
