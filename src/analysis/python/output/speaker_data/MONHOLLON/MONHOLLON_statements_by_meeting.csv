576,1989-08-22," Mr Chairman, would it be helpful to include in the outline a review of the academic literature on this subject? "
577,1989-08-22," The upward revisions in real GNP growth in the Greenbook seem very reasonable to us in view of the recent strength in some of the economic indicators Also, as has been mentioned, it seems like an almost ideal outcome The July Greenbook predicted a soft landing and this one predicts even a softer landing; hopefully, it won't turn into a touch and go As we assess the risks of the situation we think the risk is probably on the down side despite the apparent strength in some sectors of the economy There are a couple of reasons for this first, our directors and some of our other business contacts in the District have become more bearish in the last couple of months than they've been for a long time; second, and probably more importantly, monetary policy has been tightened significantly on net over the last 2-1/2 years, even taking into account the recent easing The funds rate is still about 3 percentage points higher than it was in late 1986 and there has been a sharp reduction in the trend rate of growth in the aggregates We probably haven't yet seen the full impact of this slower growth in the aggregates on real economic activity So, while we think that the Greenbook forecast for real GNP is quite reasonable, we think the risk of error is skewed slightly to the down side assuming, as the Greenbook does, no further changes in monetary policy  As far as the inflation picture is concerned, we were of course disappointed that the projections didn't show any significant decline in the net rate of inflation over the forecast period We think that also is a reasonable forecast But we think that there is a possibility of a lagged effect of the overall tightening in monetary policy since early 1987, and that it may show up more strongly than is generally expected in the period ahead Consequently, we think that the quarterly rate of inflation may be slightly lower than the Greenbook has forecast Thank you "
578,1989-08-22," I prefer ""B"" with symmetric language "
858,1990-08-21," We think the baseline projections in the Greenbook make up about as reasonable a scenario as anybody might come up with, given the additional uncertainties created by the Middle East crisis The key assumption underlying these projections is that the oil shock will be relatively brief and relatively mild That may or may not turn out to be correct, but it's certainly a reasonable assumption given what we know now But even the stronger and more persistent shock assumed in the staff's alternative scenario produced only a moderately different outcome As has been discussed here, we agree that the [range of] confidence around these projections is obviously wider now than it was a month ago And the probability of a near-term recession is correspondingly higher  As a matter of fact, slowing economic activity in our own District and rather pessimistic recent comments by some of our directors and other contacts led us to think that the probability of a downturn had risen a bit even before the Iraqi invasion But we think it's important not to exaggerate the downside risk to the economy Several points, some of which have been mentioned, come to mind in this respect First, the upward revision in the second-quarter retail sales figures suggests that final demand in the second quarter was stronger than we had thought, and the healthy increase in hours worked by production workers in July indicates that the payroll employment data may have overstated the weakness in the early part of the third quarter Secondly, both the United States and the rest of the industrial world are better positioned, for a variety of reasons, to absorb an oil shock now than in the 1970s Third, the prospects for continuing pretty strong growth in Japan and the European community should hold up export growth to provide a partial offset for softening domestic demand Fourth, the absence of any widespread inventory imbalances implies that if we do get a recession, it should be fairly mild And finally, the projected acceleration in M2 growth in August holds out some hope that the extraordinary weakness in the growth of the money supply in recent months may be ending These observations  -25-    8/21/90  are certainly not intended to deny that the downside risks with respect to economic activity have increased But the purpose is to help keep these things in perspective "
859,1990-08-21," I think there's a serious risk that if we were to ease now, we might be misread by the public and by the markets It might decrease our credibility and might produce sharp negative reactions in both domestic bond markets and foreign exchange markets It might make our longer-run objectives more difficult and more costly to achieve So, I have a strong preference for ""B,"" Mr Chairman for those reasons in addition to the ones you've outlined I don't have a strong feeling about the symmetry question, but I have a slight preference for symmetry "
