7190,2003-01-28,"  Exhibit 5 addresses the issue that the macroeconomic   variables used to formulate real-time monetary policy decisions are sometimes poorly  measured  There are two potentially important sources of measurement error  The  first is that initial releases of key macroeconomic data are imprecise and subject to  revision  To quantify the magnitudes of such revisions, we use a data set maintained  by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia that records the values of major  macroeconomic time series as they were available to policymakers at specific dates in  the past     The top left panel illustrates this type of uncertainty by showing the distribution   of revisions to the quarterly growth rate of real output over the quarter following the  initial data release for the period from 1965 to 2002  Clearly, revisions can be  substantial As shown in the first line in the top right panel, the average absolute size  of this revision is about ⅔ percentage point of output  Moreover, as indicated in the  remaining lines, subsequent revisions can also be large, in part reflecting rebasing and  other methodological changes  The revisions to other NIPA variables show broadly  similar patterns  As noted in the middle left panel, the second source of measurement  error arises because many of the variables that have prominent roles in our economic  models are not directly observed and must instead be estimated  These variables  include potential output, expected inflation, and the equilibrium real interest rate   Inevitably, estimates of these variables are subject to significant error that can be  highly persistent, given the substantial lags involved in detecting important structural  changes in the economy  These two sources of measurement error generate  considerable uncertainty about many of the variables that are integral to monetary  policy decisions  Some of the strongest policy implications likely come from errors  in the measurement of the output gap The dotted line in the middle right panel shows  the staff’s real-time assessment of the output gap since 1980—that is, the estimate of  the contemporaneous output gap made at the time shown  Those estimates differ  considerably from the staff’s current assessment of the output gap for that period, the  solid line  As indicated in the inset, the real-time errors implied by the difference  between these two estimates have a standard deviation of 1¾ percentage points of  output and a high degree of serial correlation  As summarized in the bottom left  panel, mismeasurement of the output gap could, in principle, have no effect on policy   This would be the case if the real-time estimate of the output gap were uncorrelated  with subsequent revisions to that estimate, which might occur if the revisions were  based on information not available at the time of the original estimate  In practice,  however, that condition has not been met, and large initial estimates have often been  revised to be smaller  Under such circumstances, the optimal policy should attenuate   January 28-29, 2003 15 of 195    its response to the real-time output gap measure, in order to reduce movements in the  interest rate in response to the noise in that measure     To quantify the effect of measurement error on monetary policy, we return to the   FRB/US exercise from exhibit 2, only now assuming that the real-time estimate of the  output gap available to the FOMC contains a random error that has the same  properties as those observed from 1980 to 1998  As the bottom right panel indicates,  measurement error leads to some attenuation of the policy response to the measured  output gap (the middle column)  However, that coefficient remains well above its  estimated value  Moreover, the other coefficients of the policy rule, including that on  the lagged policy rate, are largely unaffected  Of course, mismeasurement of  variables other than the output gap might also have important policy implications that  are not captured by this exercise Indeed, some recent research suggests that  incorporating uncertainty about the equilibrium real interest rate might result in  further attenuation and some additional inertia for the optimal policy rule     The top panel of exhibit 6 summarizes our findings A simple analysis of optimal   policy—one that uses the backward-looking version of FRB/US and assumes that  uncertainty enters only through additive shocks—indicates that monetary policy  should move more forcefully in response to changes in macroeconomic variables and  be less inertial than observed on average since the mid-1980s  We have investigated  the sensitivity of that conclusion to three factors—forward-looking behavior,  parameter uncertainty, and measurement error  These factors move the optimal  policy in the direction of the estimated policy rule, but none of the factors alone  seems to fully explain the observed smoothness of the federal funds rate  An  important caveat to this finding is that we consider each of the factors separately,  owing to the analytical difficulty involved in combining them  These factors likely  interact in ways that could affect the desirable degree of interest rate smoothing     Even with the extensions considered, our analysis surely fails to capture important   aspects of the policymaking environment  For example, as noted in the bottom left  panel, policymakers face considerable uncertainty about the structure of the model  itself  All models are approximations and therefore ignore specific variables that  could at times become relevant for policy decisions  Also, the models we have used  for this briefing are essentially linear, whereas the economy may under some  conditions demonstrate large, discrete responses to monetary policy or other events   Policymakers’ concerns about uncertainty may be exacerbated by the fact that some  of the optimal policy rules considered called for large swings in the federal funds rate  that are well outside of historical norms  The problems involved with significant  nonlinearities, for example, might be reflected in a concern by the FOMC about  financial fragility  Such a concern could generate a smoother path for the federal  funds rate if large policy changes were viewed as having adverse effects on the  functioning of financial markets Transcripts of FOMC meetings show that members  of the Committee have at times argued for smaller interest rate changes based on  concerns about financial fragility      January 28-29, 2003 16 of 195    The smoothness of the federal funds rate could also result from various  institutional aspects of the policymaking process, as summarized in the bottom right  panel  For example, the fact that policy decisions are made by a committee, and thus  require building a consensus, could generate some inertia in realized policy actions   Alternatively, the FOMC might seek to avoid reversals in the direction of the policy  instrument  Such an approach would presumably involve sacrificing some  macroeconomic performance, but it might be perceived to have other benefits, such as  allowing Committee members to more easily explain their policy choices to the  public  Judging from simulations of the FRB/US model, reversals would occur much  more often under the optimal policy rule than under the estimated policy rule     Overall, while no model can encompass all the issues that pertain to interest rate   smoothing, the analysis above at least provides some benchmarks against which to  gauge the appropriate pace of monetary policy adjustment   Because the observed  policy is much smoother than would be prescribed by these benchmarks, it is of  interest to determine what aspects of our models or of our assumed preferences may  be misspecified        There has been some research that did that, and I think it shows   that when you add several of these factors together you get a lot closer to the estimated rule than   the optimal rule  That’s pretty convincing     "
