  I've done quite a bit of homework     Well, the staff forecast is remarkably similar to the one I've been using all   summer     One way or another there's been a leak  I would call attention to the swing   in the full employment surplus, which is shown on page I-7  Fiscal policy is taking a rather large  swing toward restriction at the present time  Looking at those numbers, I think I would be coming  down off of my forecast that I had made to the [House Budget] Committee in the past two months   I would also like to point out that the impact of the tax cut will depend very heavily on its  composition  If it's heavily capital gains with it starting in January, as it came out of the House,  much of the impact will go over into 1980  If we have a capital gains change effective on  November 1st, we're going to get an impact in the latter half of this year, so you may have to watch,  as I'm sure you do, how we finally settle that particular issue  Other than that, I have no more  comments on the forecast      I would counsel to stay put at the present time  There have been a lot of   moves going on in the market, a lot of activity  The economy is slowing down; that third quarter  projection is for a 29 percent rate of real growth and one of the things that bothers me the most  about the economic forecast--although I agree with it--is that we have never done it before  We've  never taken our trend line growth to 3-1/2 percent without [the economy] either tipping over or  suddenly taking off on us  It would be nice if we could accomplish that  But I doubt that's the way  it’s going to look 6 to 8 months from now  And if I have doubts on the projections, it would be on  the down side [because] the economy has slowed down considerably and there has been a big  increase in interest rates  I would stay another month in the position that we are in currently  So  that would put me at 8-1/4 to 8-1/2 [on the funds rate], and I don't really know what that implies yet  for growth in the monetary aggregates  I am going to have to work on those relationships       Doesn't the lack of a worldwide boom also come into this?      Well, I think the risk on the downside has increased considerably since  about a month ago  This is little changed from the projection of last month, and my own perception  of the economy is of one reaching a peak in terms of expansion  I would like to associate myself  with the worries that we've never accomplished what we say we're going to do  We've either  slipped into a recession or have resumed recovery  A policy of growing right at the potential rate  of real growth and a constant unemployment rate is a very difficult thing to bring off  I think the  possibilities are that the downside risks are [much] greater now than they were over the summer  If       10/17/78 17             anything, I would have a lower rate of GNP and a slightly higher unemployment rate than being  forecast by the staff      Well, I would favor a money market emphasis in the directive  I would  also favor a federal funds range of 8-3/4 to 9 percent  I feel very strongly that we have moved very  rapidly over the past four months and it's time to sit back and see what we've done  We certainly  haven't done that to date  As to the aggregates, given the uncertainties, I would favor a wide range  on M2 of 6 to 10 at this point  And I think I like your idea of an upper limit on M1--if it gets above  a certain point--but I'm not quite sure what that is, Chuck  Is it 9 percent or 10 percent that we  begin to--      It seems to me that’s a better way than giving a range      And I would stay at 8-7/8       10/17/78 51                 Would you repeat that?      Mr Chairman, if you went to 9, could we then have the suggestion that  there would be consultation before moving beyond 9?      We went to the top of the range very quickly this last time       Well, gentlemen, there's a reason why the econometric models are  predicting a recession  They're based on history  And these are conditions in the past that have  always produced a recession  Only twice, in the latter part of 1963 and in the latter half of 1966,  did we ever have growth this low without having a recession  You are all sounding like the final  quarter before the downturn, quite frankly  I think we should take more account of the commercial  projections because the econometric models are summaries of past history and there's good reason  why they've turned this way      I don't think this [staff forecast] is going to happen  Either we are going to  slip over [into a recession] or we are going to get through it much better than this  I can't remember  a period over the past twenty years in which we’ve foreseen a slowdown that didn't turn into a  recession or we were proved absolutely wrong--mainly in the period when we had the escalation in  Viet Nam  My own feeling is that we are going to turn over into a recession  The chances are  much stronger on that than they are on any sort of recovery coming in  We have a very weak  consumer area  And the investment plans, I think, are going to be stronger than the surveys say but  they're not going to be strong enough to offset the slowdown in the consumer area  I’ve never  projected a 1 percent growth and lived to see it  I think we're in for some trouble  It's a question in  my mind as to whether we'll get through Christmas this year or whether it will hit us next fall      Well, if we go down, I think we are going to go down lower than you do,  Chuck, to a rate of negative growth  And if we recover, we'll probably [unintelligible] through it      If you take the fourth quarter out, you don't get it  Let me also point out  that even though we have a tax cut coming January 1 we have a tax increase on January 1  And we  have another tax increase coming in the fall of next year when the increase on the ceiling on social  security payments [hits]  So you're going to get two big tax increases, which will almost offset the  tax cut that's coming in January  So I'm very pessimistic      Well, I feel very strongly that we should stand still  I would go for a  range of 9-1/2 to 10 on the funds rate and the money market directive, with not all that much  attention at this point to the aggregates  However, if they begin to break loose, I think we need to  consult  I want to say, though, that I would like to see the funds rate kept at 9-3/4  The past two  weeks we have had a range of 9-1/2 to 9-3/4 and the funds rate was actually 9-3/4 to 10, which was  higher than [in] the directive  I don't want to go to a range [with an upper limit of] 10 percent now  and find that we are always at the top end of it      Would you just state it again?      With 9-1/2 still on M2?      There's an extra sentence in here if we're going to drop M1  In the middle  of the page [it says “weight is to be given to M1 if it appears to be growing at a rate close to or  above]…”       You’ve moved up your price expectations  Is that the result of the rise in  crude oil prices?  Is that the major impetus behind that?       But the gasoline prices started up before the OPEC price increase  You  didn’t think--        You get a recession, Paul      Well, it is also vague in the accounting  That is, the social security tax  increase--even though the major part of it is an increase in the ceiling and doesn’t take effect until  the latter part of the year--shows up totally in the first quarter      My view of the economy is that it’s remarkably well balanced,  considering the stage of the cycle that we are in  And, as you well know, I still feel very strongly  that we should sit still and see what we are doing  There are very conflicting numbers--a lot of  inconsistencies in the data that we have  I would strongly recommend that we stay where we are  I  think we’ve gone far enough  We’ve moved dramatically in the past 60 days and we have very  conflicting information coming out of the market  And I see no reason to tighten further  I find  myself saying that I’m really quite gratified that the monetarists are being consistent at this point   If they really looked at the money supply--       12/19/78          21      So my strong recommendation is that we stay where we are  We might  widen the range on the fed funds  However, if you observe the actual numbers on the fed funds  rate, they’ve been right at the top every time  You know, if you give them the range, then the rate  goes to the top of the range rather than the midpoint  We didn’t give much of a range this time but  the rate has still been at the top of it  The weekly average has been around 98 percent      And I would go for a market directive      Wait, I’m not finished  I agree with Chuck that Switzerland, Germany,  and Japan should have taken an action [unintelligible] in the value  There’s another inconsistency  out there, and that is this downward pressure on the short-term value of the dollar  However, the  foreigners are coming in here and buying everything they can put their hands on, which means that  their long-range evaluation of our economy has to be very different from the short-term evaluation  of the economy  It seems to me there is something also inconsistent in the international situation,  just as there is an inconsistency in the domestic situation  I’m done        I find it unacceptable  I think it’s absolutely the wrong time to take  another increase in the tightening of credit  What it will bring about is an increase in the prime  rate I’m sure you are going to go to 10-1/2 percent within ten days on this thing  And that’s going  to get all the hawks sending the prime rates to 13 and 14 percent  It’s just sort of verifying their  action  I would recommend staying with the scenario of “A”       Mr Chairman, what does this move do to the economic forecast?       How much weaker?       And what do you think the probability of two quarters of negative growth  would be if we went to 10-1/2?       Well, I haven’t seen anything come back down since I’ve been here       Is $3-1/2 billion enough?       Well, we have $16 billion already and what’s the Swiss franc sale--$12  billion?       But you’ve got to tell why in July you didn’t come out the way you  started       Or, alternatively, to have both of them       As a matter of fact, they’re presented both ways  They still are  The  budget document has year-over-year and the Council report has fourth quarter-to-fourth quarter   And they are a consistent set of numbers  I think people do them differently       Well, actually, if you have fourth quarter-to-fourth quarter, you’ve got an  implicit [number for] year-over-year  By July you’re there, and it seems to me that if we’re asked,  we should give the calendar year [objective]       May I offer another amendment?  The official holiday is on Monday the  28th and the natural holiday is Wednesday the 30th  And then there’s the 31st, which is a  Thursday  You might think of putting the May meeting on that Thursday, the 31st       Well, that is my dissent, as I am sure you all have [seen]  I feel very  strongly that the object of policy should be toward [achieving] what I consider to be the ultimate  goals for policy, mainly output, employment, and prices--and one that we have no control over,  which is an acceptable distribution of income  I feel that money is really one of the tools and not  the end of the policy and that we should start moving toward focusing the policymaking on our  ultimate objectives rather than on an intermediate, in-between type of objective  And it seems to  me that one of the major objectives of the Full Employment [and Balanced Growth] Humphrey-  Hawkins Act was basically to improve public understanding of economic policymaking and to lay  out what it is we want to accomplish rather than to get ourselves hung up on M1 or M2 or  something of the sort       Now, part of the reason that I think we need to do this is that I think there are  inconsistencies going on at the present time in the policymaking  One of them is the tendency of  the Administration to opt for the most optimistic possible economic forecast that they think they  can get by with  And there is also an inconsistency in the conduct of monetary policy because I  think there has been a tendency to opt for the lowest rates of growth in the money supply--that  [they] can get so low that you can’t achieve them and achieve your other objectives  And one thing  that I think Humphrey-Hawkins may do is to force both sides to face up to the inconsistencies as  they are presenting them to the American public  So I would opt for going forward with saying  that here is what it takes to meet the President’s objectives and then be very forward in saying we  are not going to achieve those objectives because we can’t live with the amount of money supply  that is implied by the objectives [the Administration] is trying to get to  I’d do it in a probability  form because the econometric models are not perfect  I don’t know a single econometric model  that does not have a great deal of somebody’s judgment in it  I know that you are not going to get  it directly on the nose as you go through here  But I think it’s a mistake to formulate all our policy  strictly in terms of money         Not the point  The President will present a rather full-blown economic  forecast and you can read this Act in such a way that the Federal Reserve is to look at that forecast  and say what kind of growth in the money and credit aggregates will be necessary to achieve it   And it may be that the--       I think we have a real danger here  We may very well be in a situation  where we will state our monetary policy and it’s only going to take the outsiders about two seconds  to figure out that because of our monetary policy the President can’t achieve his objectives        12/19/78          55         Which means then you would have to give your forecast  Yes       It seems to me that the other thing generally that you can do on this is to  state that you are not going to hit it 100 percent  Jim this morning was using some probabilities as  to what the chances of a recession are, for example  And it seems to me that we would want to use  that route in order to convey the degree of uncertainty that I think is still associated with this sort of  thing       It depends on how wide a spectrum         However, there is a lag  The entire inflation catches up about 18 months  later on the expenditure side       It sounds like alternative B   [Unintelligible]   Well, I have the same problem with the staff  forecast The economy is either going to recover or we‘re going to  have a recession I think the probabilities are on the side of a  recession, but I don’t see it occurring until the end of this year and  the early part of next year Part of the reason that we deviate from  the Administration’s forecast for 1980 has to do with the statement in  the very opening paragraphs [of Part 1 of the Greenbook] where it says  “and we assume that interest rates will not be changed over the  forecast period” I know that the Administration has forecast, for  the first time on record, a decline in interest rates over the coming  two years So in a way they’ve really put the monkey on our backs  If we relax interest rates we get better results; we get closer to the  Administration‘s projections though we don’t make it completely  There’s no combination that we’ve looked at that resulted in a  complete reconciliation of the inflation and unemployment goals of the  Administration On the other hand, it seems to me that the  unemployment rates [in the staff’s forecast] are going to be  politically unacceptable If we force them up, the Congress will  force upon us an extremely [expansionary] fiscal policy, which I  really don’t think we need at this point   As a result, I guess I’m more willing to ease a little on  interest rates and let the money supply grow If you look at Appendix  I of the Bluebook, the funds rate associated with alternative B rises  from the current 10 percent to 10-314 percent; in alternative [C] it  goes from the current 10 percent to 11-3/8 percent I don’t think we  need that In the current situation, with the continuing strength  that’s carrying forward in the beginning part of this year, I don‘t     2 / 6 / 1 9  -14-   think we need rising interest rates On the other hand, I‘m not at  all convinced that we should lower interest rates So, I would go for  a policy that would keep the funds rate at about 10 percent, knowing  that in [July] when the FOMC meets again on Humphrey-Hawkins, we can  change the ranges We can’t change the base, but we can change the  ranges in the middle of the year And we‘ll have a lot better idea  about where we‘re going by midyear That is always true; the world is  always clearer six months down the line So I would opt for 2 to 5  percent for M1, 6 to 8-1/2 or maybe 5-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent for M2, and  7 to 9-1/2 or 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent for M3, with the idea that we  will keep the federal funds rate at or slightly below 10 percent   Gentlemen, may I point out that that implies  rising interest rates on our--   The 1-1/2 to 4-112 percent   That’s only because we had negative rates of  growth for--   The [projected funds rate] ranges [shown in  Appendix I of the Bluebook] are 10 to 10-1/2 percent for the first  quarter, 10 to 10-314 for the second quarter, 9-3/4 to 10-3/4 for the  third, and 9-1/2 to 10-1/2 for the fourth   Well, I don’t think any of these projections is  reliable, Paul   Well, Steve, in my limited experience on the  Board I have found that the interest rates are always at the top of  the range   M R   PARTEE Your experience only covers a very short period   That’s right I thoroughly agree with you,  but--   No, it was 5-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent   What interest rates go with this?   I mean what does it imply?   No, it means we can go as low as minus 5  percent   No it's a minus--   Only on the up side   Steve, that doesn't give us any leeway if they  are exceptionally weak   It s@ems to me that we'd want to have both  options at this time   That raises another problem, though You're  testifying on the 20th of February, and I'm sure you're going to be  questioned fairly closely   They never bother you on the short-term rates?   I would take a money market directive with a  funds rate range of 9-3/4 to 10-1/4 percent and consultation if the  aggregates really get out of hand either way I’d also have an eye on  the foreign exchange market but [act] only upon consultation     2/6/79 -40-   I would buy 4 to 9 percent and 5 to 9 percent  for M1 and M2 and cutting the upper limit on the funds range to 10-1/4  percent   HOW low is low?   M R   PARTEE I was thinking of cutting a point off   May I ask a question? If we went with that,  what would that do to the funds rate? Does that continue to make the  ranges consistent with a funds rate of around 10 percent?   M R   AXILROD We think a 10 percent funds rate will yield  about a 7 percent growth rate [for Ml] The odds on that are not  extremely high, so what the Committee is discussing is where it may  wish to trigger a funds rate movement I would interpret this [Ml]  range to mean that if M1 were growing at a rate close to 7 percent or  above, the Desk would probably be raising the funds rate   What are you suggesting?   I would be much more liberal   And leave the funds rate alone   With the general understanding that we expect  the rates to stay approximately where they are right now   Who switched?    Mr Chairman, I've looked over the numbers and  I've looked over the projections and I also think we're in the final  quarters of the boom I had the staff put together for me a variety  of indicators in the last three quarters before a peak One thing  that stands out is that they're never the same There is very little  similarity between the various peaks that we've had We seem to do  better [predicting] troughs and recoveries than we do with [the end  of] expansions I think we're headed toward a recession As I look  at the data and the projections, I think the disintermediation and its  impact on housing are finally taking place However, I won't feel  comfortable until I see a March housing starts number [in trying to  determine] where we really are in that area The other elements of  the economy still appear to be relatively well balanced With the  possibility that we could dip into a recession and the high costs of  that in a variety of areas, I would take the position that we ought to  wait another month until we have some better data The first  quarterly estimate by the Commerce Department is notoriously bad It  can bounce from here to over yonder in a month's time in another  month's time we'll have some more real numbers on the economy and that  would be an appropriate time to move I don't think we need  additional restraint at the present time For heavens sakes, our  policies are finally beginning to work Now is the time to sit back  and let them work and not make it seem as if we're panicking about  what's going on in the economy currently, which I think some people  are doing Also, I doubt that most of the spot prices are going to  hold; some of them have been pushed up and are now beginning to recede  somewhat So, my recommendation is no change in policy at the present  time   Well, I can live with a 4 to 8 percent range on  M1 And I don’t think 4 to 8 percent on M2 would make too much  difference; I happen to agree with Phil that if things begin to come  apart, we will need to have a meeting I would like simply to stay  where we are and would recommend a federal funds range of 9-1/2 to  10-1/2 percent If there’s any question on economic developments, the  funds rate should be shaded down I notice that we seem always to end  up at the top of whatever our range is in the actual operations of the  market, and I would like to see the funds rate on the low side of 10  percent, but certainly not above 10 percent at the present time   I could buy it I think we should stay just  where we are at this point   Maybe the thing to do is to stay with 9-3/4 and  That would 10-112 percent with the understanding that we can consult   get both ends of the spectrum    Mr Chairman   Where do you think the dollar is going now? Do  you expect it to stabilize or do you expect the upward pressures to  continue?   was the heavy sell-off of foreign holdings for  the swap operations or was it also to provide funds for that market?   M R   STERNLIGHT Both were going on There were swap  repayments, but also foreign countries were undertaking intervention     4/17/19 -4-    and, as I understand it, they had to liquidate holdings of Treasury  bills to raise the dollars they needed   Most of the $5-1/2 billion was for the  intervention?   I would like to draw the attention of the  Committee to the change in our perception of what has been going on  out there Three or four months ago we were looking at a projection  for the first quarter--I‘m not criticizing staff, my own perceptions  have changed markedly as we’ve gotten more data--of a rate of growth  in GNP of 3 percent It’s now under 13 percent We were expecting  to have 3 percent growth in consumption It‘s now negative; purchases  of goods actually turned down A whole range of estimates have come  in considerably lower than we thought they were going to The only  indicator that seems to be up in real terms is employment And I  would point out to you that employment is not a leading indicator; it     4/17/19 -14-   generally [comes] in fairly strong around the final point of a  cyclical expansion   A l s o ,  two major reasons that we have used in the past to  increase restrictiveness were an excessively rapid growth of the money  supply and the need to maintain the international value of the dollar  Now both of those reasons have apparently disappeared In fact, both  of those would almost suggest that we should ease monetary policy at  the present time However, I also feel that anything we do at this  point would be mainly psychological It will have its impact six to  nine months down the road and [at this point it] will primarily be for  show rather than for any real impact Finally, I‘m quite concerned  that if we tighten, within two months we will have to turn around and  undo it In my view the economy is slowing down and it would be a  mistake to tighten credit further However, given the rate of  inflation, I think it also would be a mistake to loosen at the present  time So I would come out for maintaining the present policy   I would counsel that we stay unchanged My  [view] is that we should probably be easing But again I don't think  we're quite to the point where we should be doing it and [worsen]  inflation I think it would be the wrong move I have no quarrel  with the specifications of alternative B and I would go for a money  market directive   Is it 4 to 8-1/2 percent for both M1 and M2?   I had 3 to 7 and 4-1/2 to 8-1/2   No   M R   WALLICH No    Mr Chairman, I would agree with Bob Mayo and Bob Black I  think that we have a great deal of difficulty with our money supply numbers in April And I, too,  am impressed by the weakness that’s been showing up in the first-quarter numbers We’re  considerably below where we thought we were when the FOMC [last] met If I’m wrong and [the  strong money growth] continues, I can change my mind later But I don’t think we should change  from the funds rate of approximately 10-1/8 percent at the present time   It’s all right    Have you evaluated the economic impact of  sharply rising interest rates, Jim? Have you looked at what the Wall  Street Journal or [people on] Wall Street have said? Suppose the  prime rate went to 13 percent What would be the effect of that on  your forecast?   M R   KICHLINE Well, if it went to 13 percent, one would have  to ask why If it went to 13 percent because all these numbers are  wrong and we have a rip-roaring economy under way, that's a different  situation than if it went to 13 percent as a result of policy actions  But I don't see a rip-roaring economy in the cards Given available  information, I'd presume we'd be talking about a substantial increase  in the funds rate to get the prime to 13 percent And I think we  would be talking about a substantial downward push on real activity  over the period ahead and some improvement in our inflation forecast--  but for the time period of a year and a half, relatively little on the  inflation side   My other question is Is there a reason for  the peculiar pattern that you have on real disposable income? It  seems to have a quarterly pattern that comes and goes   The social security?   I find it interesting that everyone is saying  that they agree with the staff projection but we're all, almost to a  person, talking recession for the first time I don't see the  strength from the consumer side to keep [the economy] going at the  rate that is being projected by the staff These low levels of  disposable personal income are such that they won't support an  expansion in that range In essence, I think we have accomplished  much of what we started out to do last fall, which was to slow the  growth in nominal GNP Now, it came out of real growth and not  inflation, but that shouldn't surprise any of us given the action by  OPEC I also think a move to tighten at this time is just out of the  question as far as the domestic economy is concerned And it would be  the wrong prescription for the international situation; I think it  would make things worse in trying to keep the [exchange] values of the  yen, the mark, the Swiss franc, and the dollar all together Evidence  of further tightening here would just lead to a further appreciation  of the dollar in the international market However, I'm not quite  ready to back down [completely]  little And the only reason I think we should move [the funds rate]  down a bit is that it's six weeks until the next [meeting] I believe  the rest of the information coming in over the quarter is going to be  poor But we do have our telephone network Consequently, I would  recommend staying where we are and, if anything, I would probably  widen the fed funds range And if I understand it, I can understand  why [Steve was] calling for a widening of the ranges on the monetary  aggregates   I think we should be backing down a   I'd keep the funds range at 9-3/4 to 10-112  percent because if we do need to [ease policy], that gives us more  leeway to do it Also, I think Bob's point is right I don't think we  want even the appearance of tightening at this point And I have no  preference on the ranges for the monetary aggregates 0 to 5-112  percent is fine and 4 to 9 percent is fine I would go with a money  market directive   Do we have another month coming up like April,  where we don't know what the seasonals are?   I can support it   But if we go to a [monetary aggregates]  directive, Steve's scenario would change How would it change?   Does that mean that we'll be accumulating  D-mark balances?   May I ask a question? Does the 10 percent  refer to total United States participation--Treasury and Federal  Reserve--or is it 10 percent for [each]?     5 / 2 2 / 1 9  -43-   I would go with this proposal   M R   ALTMANN Governor Wallich   I have one question Does this give us any  idea at what level we're going to support the yen? Are we going down  to the two hundred--   I'm a little concerned that the Japanese seem  They sort of put out a target and I don't want to to be pegging it   be dragged in unless we're really sure we want to do it   I would approve then    He's adjusting it for ATS   Well, on the long-run ranges, I don't have any  trouble accepting the staff's projection as long as we adjust them for  ATS If we stick to 1-1/2 to 4-1/2 percent, that implies a tightening  short-run monetary policy and I don't think we need that at all at the  present time So, I strongly favor adjusting the MI [range] to take  account of our changed projection on the automatic transfer effect I  do have some sympathy with Emmett's point of view that we should  probably be signaling in our long-term ranges a slightly easier policy  next year I'll come back to that when we talk about short-term  policy It seems to me that it's only a matter of time--when to give  the signal and when to do something--and that our first move toward  ease probably will be our most important one We should give thought  to the timing and how much we are going to do rather than  [unintelligible] when and where we have the most effect [The  question is] whether we [signal] it more strongly with these long-term  ranges by putting them up a nominal amount for the off year or by  other actions in our short-term policy So I would endorse the  staff's ranges at this point   Could I change that to 3 to 6 ,  5 to 8 ,  and 6 to  9?    Yes, I changed them   Aren’t we just delaying the explanation? When  we get to next January and we’re 1-l/2 percent above where we said we  were going to be, then we’re going to have to give the same  explanation And in the meantime we’re going to get all the adverse  press on having been outside the long-term ranges   Are you proposing that we go to 1-1/2 to 4-l/2  percent for ’ 8 0 ?    I think you ought to explain very carefully  what we're doing because it could be very misleading I think we've  had a bad reputation for being misleading and not forthcoming in  saying what we're doing We should put all the cards on the table and  tell the [Congressional] Committee exactly what's going on   iw Chairman, if it were not for the  international markets, I would be recommending alternative I What I  am worried about is that we are never going to get to a point that we  start easing that the money markets are not going to get upset It‘s  just a matter of picking our time, and-   When we want to upset the foreign exchange  markets and how much of an upset is going to occur, even if we keep  with a constant policy at the present time And as I said earlier, I  think our first move is going to have the most impact When we start  moving [rates] down, subsequent moves aren’t really going to have the  announcement effect I guess I’m not quite ready yet to make the move  in the international markets But [the time] is going to come and we  are not going to avoid that upset in the international markets   well, you’ll always find someone who’s moving  up If it‘s not the Bundesbank it’ll be England or something I  would go with alternative 11 It is not my preference; my preference  is alternative I   They can’t afford anything else   Money market   No change    Mr Chairman, I strongly support an intervention policy to maintain the value of the dollar in this particular situation I think it was inevitable that we were going to get an adverse response to the President's speech regardless of what he said I have a feeling that the market was just looking for something to use as an excuse to start speculating again in the dollar I think we need to keep in contact as we go along I would join Chuck in saying that I am extremely concerned about the domestic economy To move to increase interest rates and to [tighten] for international purposes, [the concerns] have to be overwhelmingly important to offset the adverse effects on the domestic economy if we do that   Mr Chairman, I am opposed to changing [the funds rate] It seems to me, given the state of the underlying domestic economy, that we are going to be raising the funds rate and it's just going to be a matter of days until we have to turn around and pull it back down again I think we are better off riding out the international storm Other things are in such a state of flux that it would signal a supreme lack of confidence in what is going on here in the city of Washington at the present time I think we are better off just staying still That's all I have  No, I would not change it  Well, Paul sounds as if he is going to 10-3/4 percent He wants a very firm 10-1/2 percent and that has usually been 10 or 15 basis points above whatever the mark was No, I can't agree to go to 10-3/4 percent   But this is not an unusual pattern at this stage of the cycle  But the peak was reached last fall It has been drifting down ever so slightly  I'm glad to find we're all in agreement that we don't know what's going on or what to do about it I can live with a minor tightening at the present time, given a 10-1/2 to 11 percent range on the federal funds rate and some reduction, possibly, in the ranges for M1 and M2 However, I would like to join Frank Morris in that I think we're not going to be there very long We should be fully prepared between the next month or two to start moving back from these ranges as the recession develops I think we are going to be facing an underlying real economy that will probably turn out to be  -34-    8/14/79  somewhat worse than is being projected at the present time If that's true, we're going to see jumps in the unemployment rate in the neighborhood of 1/2 percent a month and I think it would be the right policy when the unemployment rate starts to rise to show some response to the developing recession, partly because it's a proper policy stance for monetary policy to take and partly to reduce the size of the fiscal stimulus, which will be on everybody's mind when we get those types of increases in the unemployment rate  I don't want to do very much now I don't think it's going to have any impact on the inflation rate I can't really believe it's going to do a great deal in the international market because what went on in the international area was not connected to underlying economic events but was basically a reaction to political events However, a minor tightening at this time--I'm saying 10-1/4 to 11 percent on the funds range--I would find acceptable And I'd urge the Committee to be constantly watching the developments in the economy for the turning point at which we can back off There will not come a time in the next six months at a very minimum in which we can say we have won the fight against inflation and therefore we can lower the rates I'm sure that will be an argument down the line--that we still have a raging inflation and therefore we should not react to domestic developments So I would go along with the recommendation in alternative B, with some adjustment in the ranges  I don't think so There is a tremendous amount of sympathy on the Hill to roll back the payroll taxes And for the first time there was constituency pressure of an enormous amount on the payroll tax increases last year I think the people have become terribly sensitized to them with the rapid increases of recent years My concern is that we may again [find ourselves] in many ways politically in the fall of '74--when the Administration waited until there was a palace revolt in mid-January before even proposing any sort of tax action It seems to me, as we get further into the fall, that the type of tax cut that the Administration wants and the type of tax cut that they want on the Hill are going to be very close together  I think what they basically have in mind is a payroll tax [cut] because it would reduce pressure on prices and reduce costs directly on the employers' side There's also a possibility of some adjustment on depreciation--accelerated depreciation or investment tax credit  Yes  I'd be willing to support the 10-3/4 to 11-1/4 with a funds rate of 11 percent and have your [proposed] ranges of 4 to 8 and 7 to 11 percent But I would be very much opposed to the mixed directive It seems to me that we're at a potential turning  -41-    8/14/79  point of rather major proportions and if the money supply does come in very low, then [a standard type of directive] would operate to move the rate automatically down   The problem of putting it in the budget  resolution is that the resolution is not signed by the President  They have to make some sort of alteration in their resolution in order  to have it signed by the President   One question, Jim Is this the first time  you've shown an actual liquidation of inventories?   And you haven't shifted the timing of that  liquidation?   I think you have overlooked that [Ml growth in]  August came in at 6  8  percent We haven't had a continuous 10 percent  rate of growth; at the end of August the rate of growth of the money  supply dropped And if you look closely, it's in currency The rate  of increase in demand deposits has been coming down a l l  summer Can  someone explain to me why we have a sudden increase in demand for  currency? I don't know the explanation for that I would point out  to you that we have raised interest rates 100 basis points [very  recently] That's a big increase in basis points We have a prime  rate of 13 percent, and nobody pays prime--it's prime plus So we are  talking about interest rates in the market that are 15 to 18 percent,  and it's not just on consumer loans We have really gone very far,  very fast in the past 6 to 8 weeks I think it's time that we slow  down and see what we are doing because the major impact [of our     9/18/79 -24-   tightening actions1 is going to be in the fourth quarter of this year  and the first quarter of next year   I’m a little puzzled about this availability argument The  lack of availability previously has always been in one [sector]; it  has always been in the mortgage market I suspect that in other areas  of the market there was really enough money available, except maybe in  the summer of ‘74 Now that we have said that we don’t want to put  all of the restraint on one industry, the word goes around that there  is plenty of available money and nobody is being hurt by this People  have got to be squeezed out of the markets at this point It may not  be the big banks or big corporations, and it may mean [the restraint]  is going to be focused again on certain areas of the country The  Sunbelt seems to be almost imune to any sort of restraint And as we  move [rates] around, it make it harder for New England and for the  upper middle West, along with other areas of the country I’m  extremely reluctant to raise either the discount rate or the federal  funds rate at this point   We’re above the range [for Ml] Isn’t  September projected at 10 percent?   What is the projection?   M R   AXILROD 7 percent   I'm sorry, Henry, I didn't understand your  recommendation   Mr Chairman, I think setting this 11-1/4 to 12  percent [funds rangel and a 7 percent top on [the M1 rangel just  automatically assures that we're going to start raising the interest  rates again   I would go with 3 percent [as the lower limit]  and I would put 9 percent [as the top] I think your proposal is being  pretty [forceful] in putting it so low I have noticed that the  aggregates only work on the up side During the long period of time  the money supply was declining, we ignored the bottom level of [the M1  range] for six solid months--for [apparently] good reasons I didn't  think it was the right thing to do at that time But we only seem to  get excited when M1 growth goes over the top of its range rather than  when it goes to the floor   Not in my--   Well, with the lower limit of 3 percent we  wouldn’t move The possibility of coming in at 3 percent is just  about zero, as far as I can see   It’s probably a negative probability!  [Laughter] You‘ve got this stacked in one direction   Not much    But we don't want to keep the funds rate biased  upward too long   What is the projection for October, Steve?   Yes   I think Phil’s target [proposal] is too strict  In a sense, he’s choking [the money supply] And that seems to me  ridiculous, given the underlying state of the economy as we see it I  think if we aimed to be within the upper part of the range [for the  year]--aimed for 46 percent [for September to December]--we’d tend to  offset the dangers of putting this economy into an actual tailspin  It’s all right to control the money supply, but we don‘t have to cut  it off completely, Phil, which is what your proposal would do for the  last two months of the year   I would support the 46 percent   Oh, I don’t agree   That‘s what we are doing We would be  determining a pattern   Really, we have only 2 months that we can  influence   We have some margin [with the 46 percent]   It‘s 07 on the yearly average   Well, what are you going to do with the  discount rate, take it to 12 percent?   If we take it to 12 percent and we want the  federal funds rate around the discount rate, that means the funds rate  should be approximately 12 percent   But to talk about a funds rate range, it seems  to me we have to have in mind where we are going to put the discount  rate   But I think we want a fairly wide range   It matters to you, Henry, if it goes down   It doesn’t matter to me if it goes down   May I suggest a 4 percentage point spread of  11-1/2 to 15-112 percent with consultation if it goes over 14-1/2?   I feel queasy about it   I'm in   I don’t, Henry, because all we’d be doing is  tightening with no possibilities of [the rate] coming down again   I wouldn’t    As I understand it, you are in a position to  supply reserves and not miss the target this week Is that right,  Steve?   I'm willing to face next week next week I  would say let's try to hit our nonborrowed reserves target and if the  [funds] rate doesn't come down, we should confer again    It's 88 million dollars with whom?   All these are with the Bundesbank?   M R   PARDEE Oh, yes Those are the only swaps we have  outstanding   It’s 3/4 point for 20 percent   M R   COLDWELL 3/4 point in addition   Ted, am I right that you rather markedly  changed your outlook for [growth in] foreign economies, mainly because  of the higher oil prices?   But you were counting on [the economies of]  our trading partners growing at 3 to 4 percent next year and on that  helping our balance of payments   But now their [expected growth is] down almost  to that danger point where they could tip into a recession   We’ve never managed to grow at 1 to 1-1/2  percent without sliding into a recession Have the others?   Jim, you had a model that tracked inventories  that ran off industrial production data, which you reactivated again  Is that tracking the GNP data still? Do the inventory numbers in the  GNP account look to be correct?   Mark, I think you had the only copy with that  particular page blank     11120179 -15-   But that's following a week in which we had a  $3 billion [increase]     11/20/79 -16-   Mr Chairman, I think I can endorse a great  deal of what has been said I would like to make it very clear that I  don't think we have any more control of the aggregates than when we  were operating on an interest rate target Yet the media and I think  some of my colleagues here think that we have run out and put our  hands directly on the aggregates; I don't think that's true I agree  with Mark that the fact that we've changed [our approach] is going to  change the relationships  of difficulty and there is going to come a time when we are going to  fail We were lucky last month that it turned out the way it did  So, keep in mind as we are making policy that we aren't out there  directly determining the Ms And I'm a little concerned that when we  begin to want to expand the money supply we will provide the reserves  and there won't be any response in the money supply down the line   I believe we are going to have a great deal   I am also very concerned about the consumer There is no  housing money; [financial intermediaries] are loaned up I think our  policy should basically be steady as you go at the present time I  would not want to force the banks to borrow any more than $1-1/2  billion under alternative B because I do think the economy is going to  turn down And when it does, I think it's going to drop very  suddenly When people get the first monthly bill for heating oil it  is going to hit us I think there is going to be a gasoline shortage  again and I feel that people quite possibly are going to be very  conservative at Christmas I would come out in support of alternative  B with $1-112 billion of borrowings and I would increase the federal  funds rate In other words, I favor a "B-minus" policy   I want to increase the range I might combine  alternative B and $1-112 billion of borrowings with a federal funds  range of 10-1/2 to 15-112 percent so that when the signs begin to come  through very strongly that the economy is weakening the interest rates  can drop naturally somewhat more than they could before In other  words, I would like to "unskew" it a bit without raising the top but  by dropping the bottom to allow more fluctuations in the rate And  when the rate does start to go down, it will have the space to do that  in a natural way   That's why I think we should let them  fluctuate   We're going to have to break that psychology   What will be published [in the policy record  for October 61 is just the 4-1/2 percent for M1 in the fourth quarter,  Phil   And I think the language to be released this  week is 4-1/2 percent [but that] somewhat less than that [would be  acceptable]   Steve, what would be the annualized rate of  growth on, say, alternative "B"  or "C" from October through January?   And for "C?"   But suppose November doesn't come in as low as  we think it's going to   NR PARTEE Well, we don't know     11/20/79 -40-   I’d rather do it Steve’s way and lower the M 2   target--to have some flexibility for the numbers as they come in--and  leave the target for M1 where it was on a quarterly basis   Yes, but there‘s an awful big advantage in  being able to say we looked at it--that we‘re part way down the road  and we’re not going to change our objective at this point I think  there’s a lot of just good public relations in that   I’m talking about just releasing quarterly  [targets] and that’s all   I don't think Steve's alternative is well  specified It would be 5-1/2 percent for M1 and what would M2 be?   I think that might be appropriate    But why would they change in mid-course? You seemed to be right on track in the first four-week period and then something changed and they became more reluctant [to borrow] in the past three weeks  The funds rate was also volatile in the earlier period It just seems to have been almost cemented in the last two or three weeks  It seems to me that they would have been more cautious at first--in the post-October 6th period--than currently  And much less volatility in the funds rate  But, Henry, when we adopted this procedure we were all perfectly aware of the fact that interest rates could decline under it and that they would be determined by market factors I think it's more a problem of your educating your foreign compatriots about the procedure  But with nonborrowed it's zero The big deviation is in borrowing and--  Mr Chairman, we've gone three months and only had problems in the last month Like Governor Partee, I have no idea what the limit should be I suggest we go another month, to the next FOMC meeting, see what we encounter and get some idea of how much the variation is going to be  SPEAKER(?) Yes, I'd do that too, but we still don't know what the limits are I don't think we know the magnitude of the problems yet and at what point the problems become a policy decision rather than a technical adjustment  -16-    1/8-9/80  Don't you have a problem of not being able to seasonally adjust these measures because you don't have the data [on the components that account for] the difference between M-1A and M-1B?  Basically, the quality of M-1B is going to be somewhat uncertain for a while until we have more experience with it  So will M-1A  But we might have a drop in M2?  I would support what Dave was saying Announcing 3-year targets is an invitation to losing all our credibility We have enough problems projecting out 1 year let alone 3 years To box ourselves in by saying we're going to come down to certain levels by 1982 is an unnecessary restraint and an unnecessary danger We may have that intention, but there's enough variability in this economy that we shouldn't go out on that limb; we should continue to do it by performance I'm not sure I even want to talk too much about what we're going to do in the future--other than [to say we want] to continue to restrain [money growth]--so that we have the opportunity to change our mind as time goes on I've probably done more 5-year projections than anybody else at this table and I speak from experience They're all wrong You don't come out where you say you're going to if you go down that line I strongly oppose any publication or any commitment to a specific number for future years I wouldn't narrow the ranges We have a difficult year ahead of us and I think we will need all the space we can get For the alternatives, a midpoint somewhere around 5 to 5-1/2 percent is probably the appropriate way to go  I would like to bring up one thing that bothers me a little A year ago we were in much the same position We had the money supply down--in fact, going negative--and I'm not sure any of us really understands why the money supply did that between September and March  The econometric equations didn't fit There's a strong possibility that something is going on that has nothing to do with our careful reserve management and all the rest We just may be in the period of the 6 months when the money supply goes down And [last year] we didn't really have a very good explanation as to why it took off after the end of March So, before we pat ourselves too greatly on the back, let's remember that aspect of it and give ourselves enough leeway to accommodate sudden spurts on a monthly or weekly basis, if we do have them, and still not be outside our range  -34-    1/8-9/80  Well, that would be fine, Fred, if we were the sole source of the inflation But it's like playing poker with the other players always pulling all the wild cards We're playing with OPEC, and we really have no control over oil prices To say that we're consistently going to reduce inflation in a situation where we don't have control over inflation is, to me, going out on a limb There may be a time, if this so-called recession turns very deep, when we might want to reverse our policies completely And the risks on this recession, it seems to me, are basically on the down side So, I just find it very difficult to commit myself to any sort of long-term position  I move to ratify  What about the timing on that, Jim? Just rolling back the social security tax is no tax increase rather than an actual tax cut Isn't there a possibility that a tax cut in the payroll tax, say in mid-1980, would be appropriate timing?  Don't forget the $18 billion so-called tax cut is just not a tax increase It's a funny tax cut  Pardon?  Well, given the size of the full employment surplus as shown, it doesn't bother me at all to have an increase in the deficit By the end of '80 it's shown as being 4 percent of GNP  What sort of a monetary interest rate projection do you have underlying this forecast, Jim?  So it's basically a very restrictive monetary and fiscal policy  Is it going to roll forward?  Well, I want to ask a question first Your economic forecast is based on a 6 percent rate of [money] growth If you take the rate of growth of money down another full percentage point, what does that do to real growth and to the unemployment rate?  What happens if you reduce that path by a full percentage point?  I'm not sure I got a [complete] answer My inclination is that if we cut [money growth] below the 6 percent that's in the forecast for the year, we'll have a more severe recession on our hands as we keep the interest rates up I have a  -69-    1/8-9/80  great deal of sympathy with Dave Eastburn's point of view that we should stick to a number and let the interest rates fluctuate Where I come out is that I'd like to see a 5-1/2 percent growth rate for the year as a whole and I'd set a target of approximately 5 percent for the quarter to give us a little range to meet the needs at the end of the year I don't think, frankly, that we can undertake a policy for 3 years of consistently reducing the rate of growth of money supply I just don't think that's in the cards for us in terms of what's going to happen in the economy We've brought the rate of growth down consistently now for 3 years, but there's a certain minimum to which we can get and I don't think it's 3 or 4 percent We are going to get ourselves into a position of setting a target which is so much too low that it's either going to have severe impacts on the real growth of the economy or we're not going to meet our targets Realistically, we're going to [have to] come down to a plateau for growth of the money supply and try to hold it there rather than reduce it a percentage point year after year; and a rate of growth in the money supply of about 5-1/2 percent strikes me as about where that minimum is, given the other things that are going on in the economy So, I can buy alternative B for the quarter, but I do have a higher target for the year as a whole  We really brought the real rate of inflation from about 7 percent to 10 or 11 percent, Henry  -70-    1/8-9/80  I also think it's the wrong time to have interest rates going up If the economy slides off, for once we should be going with it rather than lagging behind it  But it seems to me we want to have some flexibility here If the economy does slide off, I think we'd want to see interest rates slide off If we go to a very stringent monetary policy of 4 percent [Ml growth], we are sort of gluing the [funds] rate at 14 percent with a possibility of it going higher As I say, it would be nice for once to have Fed policy moving in sync with the economy And if the economy doesn't slide off, the interest rate is not going to come down  Mid-July  The law requires that the Board--  Could we start earlier in the day--everybody was here [yesterday] by noon--and end earlier?   Well, there is some magic in it I looked at your [proposed] schedule and I thought that we probably should meet at the very end of the quarter to plan for the next quarter Then I realized that we have constraints on two [meeting dates] One is because of the budget and the [President's] economic report [and] the Humphrey-Hawkins testimony; so we have to wait until January to do that one Then we have a similar constraint in July when we have to wait for the midyear review of the budget before we can do very much I finally came around to your schedule on two of the quarters anyway So, we might as well change the whole schedule into a similar pattern  Why is there a certain urgency of repayment? Are those bonds coming due?  But then the questions will take it beyond that  Do you have the interest rate assumptions in the Administration's forecast?  -25-    2/4-5/80  Fourth-quarter level  By the staff or--?  Well, I would like to go back to the last chart again, as Mark did You notice those tolerance lines, the top and the bottom, are fairly narrow over the next three quarters So it seems to me that we're looking basically at a fairly set outlook for the next three quarters and possibly into the fourth quarter, and I don't  -32-    2/4-5/80  want to throw away what is one of our major advantages The Humphrey- Hawkins Act requires us to give our outlook for this year We have a fairly good idea where we're going this year and where we're going to end up, and our views do not differ a great deal as I hear what has been said around the [table] It's plus or minus a little here or there, and that certainly falls within the tolerance limits of what the staff has projected Secondly, the Humphrey-Hawkins Act says that in the middle of the year we are to reassess what we are doing To lock ourselves into a policy at this point from now until 1981 is the biggest mistake we could ever make We have some idea where we are going for the next two quarters or we can come pretty close to it We have a chance to reassess it in the middle of the year And I certainly don't want to vote for a policy at this time that is going to result in T-bill rates of 117 or 122 percent in 1981 I wouldn't quarrel a great deal with what the staff has projected I would agree within one percentage point on almost any figure they gave us, though I'd probably expect a little higher unemployment rate than they're projecting and a little higher inflation rate, again depending on what happens primarily in defense But if you look at the full employment surplus in the fourth quarter and the first quarter of 1981, it jumps $30 billion And it jumps another $20 billion between the first and fourth quarters of next year We don't have to make a decision on [1981] at this point We have two more major decision points between now and the beginning of next year, and I think we should utilize them to the fullest [We need to] consider the fact that we may settle on a 4-1/2, 5, or 5-1/2 percent rate of money growth and it's not going to have a great deal of influence over the next nine months However, at midyear if we have unemployment rates of 7-1/2 or 8-1/2 percent, we must be prepared to change our policy at that point I don't want to go down the line item by item because I don't have a great quarrel with [the forecast], but I do urge that we not give up the flexibility  Well, I am looking at where we want to be at the end of the year I can't conceive of our ending up at 11 percent bill rates and a 7 to 8 percent unemployment rate I would [be inclined toward] an M1 target of 5 percent, but that implies 11 percent on the T-bill and that's only a drop of one percentage point in that rate So, I come out somewhere between alternatives I and II I also think that our primary problem this year is going to be keeping above the minimum rather than going over the top of the monetary growth [ranges] So, I would prefer alternative I but I could settle for alternative II  I think you should emphasize in the press briefing that we are quite possibly going to have to change the specifications  -55-    2/4-5/80  Do you all realize that alternative III means essentially no decline in interest rates this year?  If we want to compromise, we should go to 3-1/4 to 6-1/4 percent  I have noticed that people worry less when we go under than when we go over  Yes, but M-1B has the most potential for fluctuation  It's a full percentage point drop in the growth rates from last year Doesn't it mean that we're going to have an increase of 2 percentage points in the unemployment rate and no change in interest rates?  Where are interest rates in [that scenario]?  Even taking all the probabilities in the staff estimate, the likely rate of [GNP] growth is between 8 and -22 percent That is just not a very good economy, gentlemen, to have 12 percent interest rates  We're going to get that anyway, Henry, from OPEC over the first three months of this year  A 4-1/2 percent rate of growth for Ml? No  You realize we're already in trouble in terms of being in conformity with the Administration's forecast At least you have to do the testifying on Humphrey-Hawkins We're already inconsistent; this is making it worse  He may have moved it out but the Administration's forecast is markedly different And we will have to go up to the Hill and say we're going to keep money so tight that there is no way that the Administration's forecast can be realized That's about what it comes down to  What else is the Desk going to aim for?  Want another straw vote?  Yes  -73-    2/4-5/80  I would prefer to word it "4 to 5 percent"  I think we should stick to where we were  I would prefer alternative B  Well the January-to-March growth implied by "B" is well below what happened in January So, by definition, we're going to get some tightening  I would prefer to word it the way we did last time   But it could go negative, couldn't it, Steve?  We've had a drop so far in late February and early March and it could  keep going down  I would reluctantly raise [the upper limit] to 18 percent and I certainly  would not raise the lower limit at this point   Second  Do they regularly engage in forward transactions?  But, Chuck, how do you know which way it's going? If we are making an adjustment in the nonborrowed, borrowings go up It's hard to see which one comes first here If we lower the nonborrowed path, that almost dictates an increase in the borrowings  So moved  It's my understanding that a refund will feed directly into the money supply Is that right?  -19-    3/18/80  Well, suppose the refund is real and it occurs Is that enough to knock us off of our money path growth?  They are estimating about $46 billion, I think, so $33 billion or so must be normal  Do we have the technical capability of offsetting that refund?  Mr Chairman, I am in favor of alternative "B" Even [with "B"] the rate of growth [for M-1A] in the period from April to June would be dropping to almost half of what it was in the first two months of the year; even compared with the first three months, it's very low If we go to alternative "C," we're going to be cutting growth relative to the first three months in half, and that implies to me a very stringent credit market If people think they've had stringency these [past several] months, it's only going to get worse if we go to the more stringent specifications I will be very brief I support alternative "B" as it now stands with the 11-1/2 to 18 percent range on the federal funds rate  "C" would mean 4-1/4 percent per quarter for the rest of the year  Would you consider taking a shorter period of time--in other words, setting a target for March through May?  -37-    3/18/80  Mr Chairman, I object strongly to raising the floor on the funds range I have a feeling that when we hit the recession we're going to hit it very suddenly and that we may very well get into a credit crunch It seems to me that it would be wise to keep the wide band and as [much] flexibility as possible It also goes with my long-range feeling that we do want to have a very wide range on the federal funds rate and let the market determine the rates over time We have broadened the federal funds range, and I think that was a move in the right direction I don't mind going to [a ceiling of] 20 percent, but I don't particularly want to raise the floor  I agree with that, but the idea of keeping the range wide in case we do get into a crisis situation appeals to me  I still think the wider the range, the better, because we really don't know what we will be getting into in the next two or three months And the possibility of a credit crunch is out there; it's not an impossibility at all  It depends on what happens afterwards, Henry  Which one? The borrowings, Henry?  We don't know  Then you can't really confine the borrowing  I'd like to keep it at 11-1/2 percent I just think it's a good idea  Don't you think "somewhat less" is a little more dignified?  How much lower?  But how much lower in March and April?  We'd have to put it in terms of the whole year   What are the price indexes doing in other countries?  But, Steve, didn't you say yesterday that there is no evidence that people are moving into other types of money?    4/22/80 -8-  I don't have much to add to what has been said I would like to remind you that it took us two months to raise the federal funds rate by 5 full percentage points And if you're uncomfortable about the period ahead, I'm very uncomfortable about the period we've been through We choked the horse Now, do you want to completely strangle him or do you want to be able to ride him a little further down the line? I find these interest rates outrageously high And March housing starts are real housing starts; they're not a seasonally adjusted number in the middle of the winter sort of thing If we get low housing starts in April and May, we aren't going to have any housing this year And we're obviously not going to have very many automobiles built  We went into this with the idea that we would do it as an automatic stabilizer and that if [rates] went up, they went up They went a lot higher than I ever anticipated And I think they've done a lot more damage than most of us know at this point We should stick to our policy and, if anything, make some allowance for [rates] to go down a bit further It's time that we come off [these high rates] We've always had the reputation in the past of staying [with a policy stance] too long; this policy was designed to get us to the point where the market was signaling what the interest rates were going to do It seems to me the market is signaling rather strongly that the peak is past; we should take that signal and let the market rates go down I'd like to support Bob Mayo's comments about the March [credit control] program He's the only one who mentioned it this morning The six of us here [on the Board of Governors] have been fighting all these questions and answers and appeals and everything else; I think we've had a tremendous amount of impact both psychologically and on banks as to what the growth rates are going to be Those standards are in place regardless of what happens to interest rates in the market And finally, on the international scene, interest rates are going to have to come down in this country over the next 18 months Whatever happens out there is going to happen If we drop them suddenly, we're going to get a market reaction; if we drop them slowly, we're going to get a market reaction; if we keep them up, we're going to get a market reaction I view the international [situation] as one we're going to have to live with; we will have to  -18-    4/22/80  take whatever comes out of it rather than try to gear our domestic policy at this point to controlling the international value of the dollar  Henry has a one-way ladder Have you noticed? It keeps ratcheting up as we go  Or is it the money supply going negative? We have a consultation any time we get a big number but we don't seem to have very many consultations when we get little numbers  I know  I can support alternative B and taking off the one percentage point [on the funds rate range] I think we're more likely to run into a problem of not being able to maintain the growth rates of the money supply, [which may mean we would] need a consultation I also think that the spread between the federal funds rate and other market interest rates may be a function of the surcharge I think the banks are doing everything they can to keep out of the window and not pay the surcharge and, consequently, there's greater demand and greater pressure on the funds rate and on other rates So that gap may just have developed out of our own actions rather than anything drastically different in the market So I would support "B" and a 13 to 19 percent funds rate range I don't know about the borrowings I think we're almost going to have to play that by ear We may just have to end up with a range on the borrowings [and see] how they come in  We don't have the borrowing in the directive, do we?  There's not much borrowing at that rate  But it's a regional problem to some extent   Mr Chairman, it seems to me that if we're wrong, then the market will react and rates will go back up again That happened to us in November and December and again in February It seems to me that we should stick to the policy [we established] and [use] the full range and let the interest rate fluctuate We took that approach when we were going [up on the funds rate] And if necessary, the market will change [the rate] and push it up if we've    4/29/80  made the wrong decision So I would stick with the 13 percent lower limit  Steve, with the money supply dropping and a level of borrowings that is relatively high at the present time, where are [the reserves] going? Do we have a massive increase in excess reserves?  I guess what I'm really saying is that the level of borrowing seems inconsistent with the money supply  No, I mean the actual   Funds are already trading at around 12 percent, aren't they, Steve?  If you left the $500 to $700 million in, what would happen, Peter?  All the way to 10 percent?  I suppose I'd go to 10 percent if the market is as weak as it sounds If we settle on 11 percent, I think we will be back here pretty quickly, probably before the end of the week or certainly the early part of next week We might as well give ourselves the leeway and let the market sort of find its own level at this point So, I would favor going to 10 percent  You know, Paul, I'm a little disturbed by the fact that when [the funds rate was] going up nobody was concerned about the speed at which it went up It ratcheted up over a period of about six weeks And if we are really going to follow this policy, then we're going to have to let the market determine how rapidly it comes down It seems to me we should give ourselves some leeway and if we're wrong, the market will turn the rates around and they will go back up again  Well, with the prime rate at 17-1/2 percent, it doesn't bother me very much to drag it down  Could we settle for 10-1/2?  We're in a range where it doesn't make any difference   Second  I am a little surprised that you say there was equal intervention going up and coming down I got the impression that there was massive intervention by the Germans and the Swiss when    5/20/80  the dollar was rising and that they haven't done anything on the way down--and we've done relatively little Is that right or wrong?  But the amount of intervention since we started out is nowhere near what it was on the way up  How dependent are they on foreign oil?  May I ask In your projection of personal income did you anticipate the number that came out yesterday, which was essentially zero?  -13-    5/20/80  Of course, Fred, if we take credit controls off and it has no impact--if people don't go back to spending--then we can do both simultaneously  Let me comment further on what Fred was saying The reports I've been getting are that credit sales have just plummeted And it shows up on the profit reports of Penneys and Sears that came out this morning Another aspect that people seem to be worried about is that purchases of household durables were so strong in the second half of last year that [that sector] is not going to rebound Everybody has a new refrigerator The other aspect of this is that consumer debt is unbelievably high; and with a very low saving rate the chances of a rebound in consumer spending such as we've had in previous recessions are much lower this time I think that is already built into the staff's forecast  Well, all the news has been consistently bad Every day brings in another indication of greater depth of the slump And it seems to me that the risks are all on the down side at this point If we look at the staff forecast, they have made the recession deeper but somewhat shorter And the total recession isn't much greater [before] some upturn Probably it will be both deep and long, the worst of all possible combinations As a result, I think we should get back to our targets or we should be providing to the economy the sort of support that it needs at this particular point in time So I would support alternative B, moving back by September, and a lower range on the funds rate This does raise problems on the international side If we move to where the interest rates are dropping to the 7-1/2 or 8 percent range, we may encounter some heavy drains [of funds to abroad] and heavy pressures on the dollar I think we have to face up to the fact that if we move to accommodate our domestic policies, it will have some international implications It seems to me that we should openly face the fact that we're probably going to have to intervene rather heavily to keep the dollar where we want it to be in terms of international exchange rates So the directive today should not only focus on domestic monetary policy but on how we are going to cope with the pressures, as they develop, in the international market  So did the money supply  Wouldn't it be wiser to make the funds rate range wider, but with the idea that if it hit certain points we would  -36-    5/20/80  consult before it goes down? Make it 8 to 14 percent so we'd have a full range of 6 percentage points The presumption is that it's going to go lower, not higher  There's a six-week [intermeeting] period And it seems to me of great value to keep that range fairly wide because  -38-    5/20/80  then the unanticipated things will be automatically caught by the market  Yes, but at 13 percent we raised it last time [from] 11 to 13 percent and went a couple of days with the 13 percent  Well, I'm reacting to Frank's point that if we vote [for a lower limit] too close to the 10-1/2 percent, we would be going back too rigidly to setting interest rate targets I think market conditions are such that the market is more or less going to override us at some point, so we might as well have the leeway to ride with the market even if we consult on every half point as the rate goes down on whether we want it to move down that next half point I just think we would look better with a wider range  16  Well, they did when the money supply was running so fast last summer They've been within their targets all along  What is the M2 consistent with that?  Logic would have [unintelligible]  It's 10-1/2 to 19 percent  Quick consultation, say, at 9-1/2 percent?  Another thing we can do to compromise further is to take your specifications of 7 to 7-1/2 percent and so on for the Ms and to make [the funds range] 8-1/2 to 14 percent  With consultation at 9-1/2  The aggregate targets would be 7 to 7-1/2 percent for M1, 7-1/2 to 8--   What is the reason, do you think, that the gold price is going up?  I basically only have a question for Steve Is commercial paper [issuance] still rising? Are the corporations turning to that market?  Mr Chairman, I would think that whether we go through the 9-1/2 percent depends on what happens over the next two weeks If we continue to get very low rates of growth and we don't realize these June money targets, then it seems to me we should slide through the 9-1/2 percent and down to the 8-1/2 percent On the other hand, these numbers have been so unbelievably volatile between the first estimate and the second estimate that I think this is one of those cases where we need to feel our way along If the numbers continue to come in weak, then we go through the 9-1/2; if the levels projected for June begin to be realized, then we more or less keep [the funds rate] in the 9-1/2 percent area  Well, I think I'm halfway in between Depending on how things develop, we go through the 9-1/2 percent And if it looks as if the economy is turning down as rapidly as we think it is, we'll reach [the 8-1/2 percent lower limit]   In November of 1978 we put together a $28 billion emergency package Is that still in existence?  How much did we have and how much do we have left?  What did we actually have out of the $30 billion?  I don't think I got an answer to my question  All right, but that doesn't tell me how much--  How much did we actually draw in November of [1978]?  Okay, thank you  How much do we have to offset?  Is $4 billion enough if you have $3-1/2 billion to mop up?  Seconded  Well, the third paragraph says "to maintain full employment and balanced growth"  -10-    7/9/80  I'm curious about your projection [for the external sector] I know you said yesterday that the real growth of our trading partners was strong--and Japan's was quite strong--in the first quarter But [these countries] seem to me to be subject to the same pressures that we are high interest rates and rising oil prices What makes you think that we're not going to export our recession and have a worldwide recession, which I assume would weaken your forecast markedly?  But that is one of the risks in the forecast Things could be considerably worse--  I'm quite satisfied with the specifications of the ranges at this point Remember, they are ranges, and if we get into the lower parts of them or the upper parts of them we've met our targets We don't have to hit the 4-1/2 percent or 4-3/4 percent [midpoints] right on the nose It seems to me that it would not be wise to lower them, simply for credibility reasons, even if we say it's a technical adjustment Just leave them alone I'd also point out to you that I don't think there is an overwhelming need to change the bank credit number because we know there has been a tremendous substitution of commercial paper for bank credit And if we take [account of] the total sources of credit in [that measure], then the 6 to 9 percent range is one that is achievable It's just a technical development in the market rather than anything that should make us change our targets  But if you add in commercial paper what happens to it?  It probably would bring growth within the range, if we [took into account] the substitution in commercial paper  Yes It strikes me as the same kind of animal [Issuers of commercial paper] have just shifted where they are getting [funds]; and due to the technicalities of the prime rate relative to market rates it's a reasonable thing to do So, we could just explain  -37-    7/9/80  that there has been a shift in the way the market is [behaving] and keep the same range  For next year, I really am disturbed that everybody wants to lower [the ranges] Have you not looked at what the federal funds rate would be if we lower them? The funds rate in the fourth quarter of 1981, if we lower our targets, would be 15 percent How much mortgage activity do you expect to have if fed funds are at 15 percent? There's a limit to how far we can push down on money growth and not just absolutely strangle this economy And given the uncertainties of the outlook at this point, I think the safest thing to do is to say that we are going to stay within the same ranges next year We have wide enough ranges to lower the actual outcome, to come in at the low end But to set out now to push short-term rates up to the 15 percent area seems to me outrageous, frankly It would almost completely negate any real growth that we are going to get over this period The housing market certainly won't come back The thing to do is to say that we will aim to get within the ranges and that we aren't sure we are going to hit the midpoint of every one of them I'd stick to the bank credit range as modified, and then say at this point that we simply plan to continue [those ranges] through next year rather than that our total task in life is to reduce the rate of increase in the money supply year after year I don't think that's what it is  On wages and prices, I don't see that we have a hope of getting it through Congress On taxes I think the most beneficial tax cut we could get--this should sound familiar--is to cut out the social security tax increases, which would probably do more to lower unit costs than anything we could do at this point That has a direct impact on wages They can take out the increase in January and dress it up as a removal of health insurance [unintelligible] And if the accelerated depreciation were put in, we'd probably get the best combination of tax reduction and one that goes directly into people's incomes right away It wouldn't get all tied up in a refund a year later, in the way it has been done several times before So, if we state our preferences, I'd certainly go for social security relief  [Unintelligible]  Look, one of the problems we are likely to face next year is that we will be tempted to set a target that is too low and we will exceed it And it seems to me that our credibility in the long run is going to be worse off if we exceed it than if we are realistic about what we can accomplish Given the fact that it's 12 to 18 months off, it seems to me very reasonable to widen the ranges at both ends at this point  -49-    7/9/80  May I ask a technical question? Is it possible to target on M2?  We have enough trouble with the M1s Why go to M2 when it includes two things we have absolutely no control over?  "C" is below  Yes, it is  If I read that chart right, "A" gets us to the middle of the range by the end of the year, "B" gets us just barely [in] it, and "C" gets us below [the range]  Well, when we were talking about getting into the lower [part of the] range, I didn't mean the bottom We don't have to slide around the bottom of that to say we're still in it I'd rather go with "B" and make sure that we're approaching it I don't think it would hurt us to have an 8 percent rate of increase in money supply over the next several months  But, Henry, that is just the reverse of what you used to argue You always had to offset the overshoots  Are you sure you don't want to drop the funds rate range on that one?  An alternative is to go to 8 to 14 percent  But M2 is running high; if anything, we'd have to make it a little higher  Well, as long as we keep it above the market rate, we've going to have no borrowings at all That's going to influence our paths and everything else that--  Is July a particularly difficult month as far as projections are concerned?  I think it's going to be more influenced by some of the other data If we get another 8 to 10 percent [decline in GNP and] an increase in the unemployment rate, we won't--  And if we get a sharp revision in the second- quarter number or something of that sort, that's going to put more pressure on fiscal policy than a one-month miss on the money supply  -66-    7/9/80  I certainly wouldn't want the record to show that we raised the floor after the second quarter we've had  To me it would depend on why M2 was going up; if it were money market funds going out the window, I'd say no  What are we going to do about it if [M2] goes up?  Which may make the money market funds go up even faster  We could move it to 8-1/2 percent  -69-    7/9/80  Yes, but it's not as [unintelligible]  As long as you don't commit us to lowering the ranges  No, I don't, Henry I'm really not committed to that  I'm not sure I even want to try to lower them  No, we are not committed to a consistent lowering  Some of you are, but I'm not, frankly  That's further than I want to go, Henry  Can't we put it in terms of not really knowing what is going to happen in the next six months?  But you're getting yourself into a box, Fred We've been bringing the rate of the money supply growth down for the past four years and inflation has been going up What is a non- inflationary rate of growth in the money supply?  We don't know  Yes, but even with a 4-1/2 percent rate of growth in the money supply we'd have a very anemic recovery  You can try another caveat in that we really don't know what fiscal policy is going to be; that's still a wide-open area  Yes I don't want to be faced in February with having it said that in July I promised to do this  Are you likely to be asked the question--  The question you're going to get on this, regardless of how we present it, is how much of this is due to the difference in our fiscal policy assumption and how much is still due to the difference in our monetary policy assumption, because the CEA has a much easier monetary policy assumption than we have That could be almost as embarrassing as whether we have [assumed] a tax cut  -80-    7/9/80  Oh, they have lower interest rates  Very little improvement on anything  Couldn't we have a seventh inning stretch?  -83-    7/9/80 -84-   Are there any qualifications around the 1/2 percent?  Well Ernie, quite frankly, I'm thinking of a minimum of zero And going to 1/2 to 1 percent doesn't appeal to me at all for next year because we are going to lock ourselves in We are not going to be able to change this come February  I have a question Jerry [Zeisel], the forecast for 1981--  Mr Chairman, could I make a request? The [staff projection in the] FOMC material was run on a 4-1/2 percent rate of money growth for next year I would like to have sent out to the Presidents and members of the Board [an analysis of] what would happen to the projections if money growth were lowered 1/2 percent or a full percent   There must have been surplus OPEC funds floating around in 1974-75 How long did it take for them to settle down or disappear from the market?  Yes, but they must have had some investible funds that they didn't put some place permanently  I don't think that would get us out of the problem we've been talking about because if we tied it to a longer- term rate it's going to switch from being a penalty rate to being a subsidy rate when the yield schedule inverts  -12-    8/12/80  Jim, why don't you tell us what happens to interest rates under the monetary assumptions we have? Where does the mortgage rate go?  But didn't interest rates hold up for a longer period in the recession of 1974-75? We've had a terrific drop in interest rates, which is going to have a bouyant effect on the stock market at this point  I'm a little surprised at the strong change in sentiment based on so few facts We have a few good numbers or a few numbers that aren't terrible That's about what it comes down to We don't have a good indication of what the third quarter will be yet The labor force data on the payroll basis are going to catch up with us We've just had some good luck on the size of the labor force in the last month or so I would also point out that the past five years have been characterized by a good quarter followed by a bad quarter  -22-    8/12/80  It hasn't been a smooth recovery or [pattern of] growth anyway Many times we thought we were on the verge of a recession and then recouped from it So, I think [the economy] is just jiggling around I am also terribly concerned about 1981 because I think we have a very strong possibility, with the low rates of growth that are being projected, that this will turn into a 1959/1961 situation where we'll have a double recession--one right after the other There is just no strength in this particular forecast; [activity is at] very low levels I think this forecast has the longest string of negative business investment--if it turns out to be as forecast--on record That gives us a very, very poor outlook over a fairly long period of time So I don't think we need to hit the horse any harder than we're doing at the present time We've knocked it off its feet Let's give it a chance to rest awhile and hopefully let it get up at some point rather than constantly pushing it back down again I would say that if we move for any further restraint, we're almost guaranteeing that the housing market will not recoup The prices of cars are such that nobody can buy them; and even though the industry is trying to push up prices, the consumer is in no position to meet those higher prices We have a lot of uncertainties at this point I think we've gotten something out of [our posture of restraint] I'm worried about prices But we haven't had any time at all for [our policy] to be reflected in the current statistics  That's what we thought we were doing with M2  I would prefer "A" For once we don't have to worry about the international value of the dollar currently, which is somewhat of a relief  Yes, I know that Given that, we seem to be on a pretty steady course and we're getting where we want to go with it It seems unconscionable to raise interest rates when the economy is still going down--and I don't think anybody expects the third quarter to be a positive number on real growth I would say if we are going to have to raise interest rates for international reasons, I certainly would like to save the room and do it at a later date So I would come out in support of "A" and just leave [the path] the way it is at the present time  What do you expect the funds rate to be with these specifications? You expect it to be around 10 percent, right?  So that's basically an increase in the rates over the month from where they are now  If we took the midway point, what would you expect to happen to the funds rate?  Are they consistent?  On "A" would you drop the floor to 8 percent, too?  We could [all probably] live with either one of them  Is it possible to get that sort of peculiar specification?  I know, but I'd like to know if it works or not  Yes, but the way we are setting the policy is to bias the funds rate up  Again, are those consistent relationships?  And the funds range is what--8 to 14 percent?  And what about borrowing?   So moved  What is the historical record on this drift in money demand?  It's not a steady series It fluctuates rather--  Does that have a tax cut in it?  I only have two quick questions If we have no change in tax laws, what is the increase in the tax burden from the fourth quarter to the first quarter?  No, if we have the tax increases that have already been been legislated How much of the--  No, just what the dollar volume is We have the social security [tax increase] and something else  Suppose we don't have a tax cut? What happens to your economic projection?  So your growth in calendar 1981 would be essentially zero? Is that correct?  May I ask a question?  I might qualitatively expect interest rates to be higher Specifically, where would the federal funds rate be in the third and fourth quarters under "A" and "B"?  And that would produce a mortgage rate of what, about 14 percent?  How much of that is a result of the banks being out of the [discount] window?  Everybody has been gone from the window for what, three months?  The one week that we had very high borrowings we also had very high excess reserves, didn't we?  I really only find alternative A acceptable As Chuck says, we are probably at the bottom of the recession To take the few indications of reviving growth and use that as an excuse to tighten monetary policy seems to me totally unacceptable We will create a double-dip recession if we start taking interest rates up as high as we would get them in alternative B Last fall, which is not very far behind us, mortgage rates in the 14 to 14-1/2 percent area almost completely closed down the housing market It wasn't an availability problem; it was lack of demand So, I would strongly support alternative A, and I would keep the funds rate approximately where it is This just doesn't seem to me the proper time to rock the boat  But we have taken action After all, bill rates are up quite a bit  How would you formulate this to make it a neutral policy until the next FOMC meeting? What numbers would fit a neutral policy for the next month?  No, I'm just saying that I would like to see things rather calm until we have a better idea of what is going on out there I agree with Jerry Things are too uncertain to try to set a policy at this point that's going to carry us through December So,  -47-    9/16/80  if we could find some way to wait a month without rocking the boat in any way and get a little better idea as to whether some of these [developments] are real or transitory, that would be the wise thing to do  We could round up instead of down, gentlemen  That is moving very close to "B" You've rounded the numbers down and then tolerate shortfalls  That's just a function of being in September We've nailed ourselves down on the end of December and that's--  The fact that there is an end point to this shouldn't be what decides this We could change the specifications to the middle of next year, which I understand the Committee did when it had a rolling base But to over-fight to make it in the last four months just for appearance sake, regardless of what happens in the real economy, seems to me the epitome of foolishness  But we're within them  I'd like to see the range kept at 8 to 14 percent That gives us the maximum amount of range for it I'd hate to signal by raising [the lower limit] that we were tightening policy If it's meaningless, then why do it at this point? I think it will be taken as a signal in the market that we did some tightening   But the increased pressure on the mark is something that has just developed in the past week, isn't it? Why this week, instead of before? Most of the factors that would be pressing the mark have been there for quite some time  Is the problem that the Treasury wants us to warehouse the marks?  The current limits are what--$l billion of all currencies except the yen and $1 billion of yen? And then there is a $500 million limit on any currency within the overall $1 billion limit Is that correct?  Other than yen And you're suggesting that we go up to $1 billion on the D-mark alone?  What about the aggregate, yes?  What has been the size of your D-mark purchases recently?  I take it the overall limit is $1-1/2 billion  Is that from member banks or from nonmember banks coming in or is it net?  Your housing starts alone would do that, wouldn't they? Aren't your housing starts trending downward?  Steve, in the Bluebook you gave us the interest rates associated with alternative A Do you have the ones that are associated with alternative B?  But the near-term rates would be lower, is that right?  I looked back over the numbers and I'm impressed with several things Practically every indicator of real output is below last year We talk about the increases in housing starts in the past two months, but housing starts are 25 percent below last year Industrial production is down a large amount Employment is flat because the labor force didn't grow very much New orders are down and consumption is down Every indicator is below what it was last year If one looks at [developments in] a little longer context instead of just what happened in the last two months, we've created a rather severe recession at this point The numbers that are up, unfortunately, are prices Both producer prices and consumer prices are up 11 percent And within [those measures] are energy prices, which in the producer price index are up something like 36 percent and in consumer price index somewhat over 20 percent If one looks at the money numbers, they have been quite reasonable over the past year They're just about where we would want them to be and I think it makes one wonder I don't think this is a surprising outcome If you tighten monetary policy, the first impact is on real output We have had very little impact on prices We've had relatively well behaved monetary aggregates, but it does raise in my mind the question of where we go from here I'm quite worried that we'll put too much emphasis on trying to get [monetary growth from] the fourth quarter 1979 to the fourth quarter 1980 at some predetermined level Those are pretty arbitrary dates to pick to say that we're going to hit the midpoints [of our target ranges]  What also strikes me is that we're not very good in [estimating the] relationships From the fourth quarter of '79 to September '80, we're off the midpoint on M-1A by 35, on M-1B by 165, and on M2 by 22 percentage points, all plus We're off M3 by minus 12 and bank credit by minus 1 percentage point No way are we going to get all of them on the midpoint by the fourth quarter of this year So it seems to me that we should pick which one we're going to try to keep within bounds I don't think we have any hope of getting M2 within [its range] We can come close on M-1B, but not completely within And when we come down to the fourth-quarter-over-fourth- quarter projections, there's not a lot of difference where we end up if we choose "A" or "B" The rate for [alternative A] is 4-1/2 percent and alternative B gets us maybe two-tenths of a percentage point above that But alternative A does produce an extra 1 percentage point on the federal funds rate What we obtain by running the funds rate up by 1 point isn't a great deal in terms of obtaining our objectives for the year, fourth quarter over fourth quarter I would caution against focusing too sharply on trying to hit something exactly in the fourth quarter of calendar year 1980 We may not have a double-dip [recession], but I think there's a great danger that we will have a totally flat economy if we pursue our [monetary growth] objectives too strongly  Isn't the point about lags relevant here? What we do with interest rates over these next couple of months will impact the first quarter And certainly the forecast for real GNP in the first quarter is weak enough that if we raise interest rates in the next couple of months, we won't [reach] that forecast of real GNP; it will be much weaker than that So instead of trying to figure out what the money supply is going to be for the next two months, I'd rather look at the first quarter And I don't think we need a rise in interest rates with the impact going over into the first quarter  Steve, can you pinpoint a federal funds rate with a level of borrowing?  But that's what we're talking about--how we do it in--  But our determining the level of borrowing doesn't automatically determine the funds rate  We're going to abort the recovery, too  How much higher do you think $13 billion of borrowing would put the funds rate? Somewhere between 12-1/2 and 13 percent?  We have M3  We're literally arguing over tenths And that seems ridiculous when we have such a short period of time left  With borrowing of about $13 billion   Second  What do you mean by that? Do you think the dollar is going to drop?  But isn't that really the question? What are we going to do now? We've covered the Treasury's debt  But isn't the real question before us What are we going to do from here on out?  But I am afraid we are making policy by default By not giving any guidance at this point, we are saying to the international Desk in New York to go ahead and do what it has done for the past month That could lead us not to $$100 million but to another $2 billion in marks And that seems to me a rather major decision Do we want the Desk as the mark rises to buy marks as    11/18/80  rapidly as they can and to accumulate a war chest? Is that what we are telling them to do?  They've done it  And we can change it by notation vote between meetings  Why did they want an increase in the swap?  Mr Chairman, could we have the most recent money supply numbers?  I think the talk about the targets for 1980 is irrelevant We're done At most we have four weeks in which to operate and the reserves will be set with lagged reserve requirements So it seems to me what we're really talking about is how high we're going to let interest rate go between now and the end of the year, and that's it I am also strongly of the opinion that rates are already too high We have already killed the housing market We are depressing the automobile market We have continued pressure on business fixed investment, and it's to a point where I think it will stall out I would like to point out to you that the last time we had a federal funds range approximately like this was in February of last year and we had a 9-1/2 percent drop in real GNP in the second quarter I think the changes in interest rates have influenced a great deal the pattern [of GNP growth] we got this year And I don't think the staff has done a bad job I went back and looked at their fourth quarter-over-fourth quarter projection of February of last year and they had a decline for the year of about 2 percent And if they have the fourth quarter right now, it's going to be a decline of about 1-1/2 percent this year The pattern was different; the pattern of interest rates was not the one anticipated I think these rising interest rates have an extraordinarily damping effect on the economy and if we let them go any higher, we're inviting disaster again In addition, we'd be [inviting] a rerun of the great interest rate cycle of 1980 on an economy that is not where it was last February Last February we were at 85 percent capacity utilization and at 6 percent unemployment A lot of things were different than they are now We have a relatively severely depressed economy that would be put through the wringer again and I think that would be a mistake  Some of you say you're going to take "B" because it's no different from what we did last time There's a 4 percentage point increase in the federal funds rate range associated with "B" It was 9 to 15 percent [last month] and the staff is saying "B" is [now] compatible with 13 to 18 percent I think 18 percent is outrageously high On account of the growth in the money supply, we immediately run everything up to the top of the range, usually within a week after the Open Market Committee meeting Consequently, I don't care what you do with -the money supply I do care what you do with the interest rate range I would put the maximum at 15 percent with maybe a bottom of 11 percent The borrowing assumption is funny because we determine the borrowing from the nonborrowed reserve path By doing a nonborrowed reserve path, at least for the next two weeks, we determine what the borrowings are going to be There's a Catch-22 game going on here  You have worked it backwards, I think, Henry  That's right  I strongly object to pegging that rate at 14 percent We have let it run up way above what we expected a month ago; and if you're going to play that game, Henry, you have to be able to play it on the down side, too A rate of 14 percent is just ridiculous in this economy  Oh, baloney Why shouldn't the security holders have a decline in real income, too? Everybody else has  It's already at 17 percent  -46-    11/18/80   Have you changed your GNP projection at all since last week?  Well, I am sufficiently uncomfortable that I won't go along with 18 percent We already have the rates too high It seems to me that you are playing with dynamite We are [fostering another] cycle like last time So I would dissent   Is there a chance it will go to 19 percent and just stick there? If we get--  I have a question If he sticks to the path, will we be in a position of providing reserves this coming week or withdrawing them, Steve?  I mean next week Are we going to be in a position [to add reserves] or have we done all we're going to do [as of] today?  Thank you, Peter  And then you will argue for an increase in the discount rate again to close the gap  Me  I voted against the discount rate increase yesterday I just think we are using this process to [ratchet] up the rates now to where they should be or where they can be Mainly for consistency, I can't support this proposal because I think if it goes wrong, you folks are going to come back and ask for a discount rate increase again And I think that is going too far I can see the advantage of letting it fluctuate for a week, but the experience that we had last spring was that every time we added another percentage point on the range, we went to the top of it and almost instantaneously it stuck there And then another week went by and we had to raise it again I would just like to see the ratchet stopped So, I will be consistent and vote the same way I did on the discount rate  -11-    12/05/80  How long is that to hold? Is it the next calendar week or until the middle of next week?  To be logically consistent, Henry, I would take the floor off also   I have some questions We have a limit on how many balances we can hold by type of currency, is that correct?  Does the Treasury have limits on how much they can hold?  If they warehouse currencies, against whose target does that go? Or does it go against anyone's?  But there's no limit on how much they can warehouse?  So it goes against our totals?  So we have a limit on how much the Treasury can warehouse Is that it?  So the total volume of marks, say, that we can hold is the $1-1/2 billion limit we have plus the $5 billion that is the limit we have [on warehousing for] the Treasury?  That's it then? The maximum we can hold is $6-1/2 billion?  That covers all my questions  Mr Chairman, what is the legal basis for our holding the balances? Are there any legal constraints? Do we have legal authority to do it or not?  Is that over and above our holdings to cover the Carter funds?  Are you suggesting that we raise that limit too, Henry?  May I ask if I'm correct that if we raise this, then we have an extra $1 billion for ourselves for marks and there is still $2 billion of leeway on the warehousing? So does that give a total of $3 billion of leeway at this point?  Mr Chairman, I'm not opposed to accumulating balances, and these seem like like reasonable increases in the amounts I would say, though, that I am disturbed about the fact that in this most recent episode with the mark and the dollar we've done all the intervention Granted, we needed the marks to pay off our Carter bonds and all the rest, but the Germans have done literally  -24-    12/18-19/80  nothing as far as I can figure out And that bothers me in terms of how effective our policy is  Have you thought of the possibility of requesting a delay in the Humphrey-Hawkins Report pending new Administration policy?  You've just wiped out two--  SPEAKER(?) That wipes out the whole thing!  But if you look at chart 3, Henry, where the money supply is held flat into next year, we are hitting the midpoint of that range  Isn't there another [option] that will reduce [the uncertainty]? If we took as our target M-1B plus savings, that would cover most of the sources we think the funds are coming from It would be a new concept in some ways, but it's also the one behind which we put reserves  How unstable?  But if that happens, then M-1B is going to become interest sensitive  But that's true of any of these It's a matter of going to the one that is the least unstable  -40-    12/18-19/80  Frankly, I don't find any of these strategies acceptable We're not getting any decrease in inflation and any one of them leads to at least a 1 percent increase in unemployment next year And we still have a fairly rapidly growing labor force, with lots of young people and minorities and so forth that won't be accommodated in that situation I happen to agree with Chuck We really are choosing how bad we are going to make the economy rather than anything that is positive at this point However, I am also impressed by the 15 percent projected CPI for the first quarter; I worry about that because last year CPI numbers in that range caused panic, and rather severe panic, and led finally to putting in emergency credit controls Given those considerations, I think we have to choose between a variety of unsatisfactory alternatives I don't think we can achieve either alternative I or IV if we're worried about our credibility With the inflationary forces that are loose in this economy, it is going to be impossible to [achieve] those targets We might have a chance of achieving strategy II or III; besides, they are certainly the least damaging in terms of employment and output and we don't lose anything basically on the inflation rate So I would opt to stay as near as we can [to those]  Maybe the best way to handle the public relations problem in terms of M-1A and M-1B is simply to extend the current ranges and use the [explanation] that we're above them and are coming back into them However, I would lobby strongly for the idea of at least looking carefully at M-1B plus savings If savings are too volatile and if what Jerry worries about happens, savings are all going to move into M-1B Then whatever volatility is left will just move into M-1B So that doesn't seem to be a reason for not using that particular [aggregate] at this time We should at least find something that we can work on I would also point out to you that this projection probably contains as much as any of us knows about the Administration's program It has the $35 billion tax cut; it has what I think is our own good judgment that they won't get the nondefense [cuts]; and we still get a zero rate of [economic] growth So I doubt we are going to get very much stimulus out of the Administration, certainly not over and above this [tax cut]  As far as base drift is concerned, I think that's asking too much If we take [off] from the midpoint of the old ranges and try to bring the new ones down from that, that is a restriction on the rate of growth of money supply that we'd never be able to accomplish given the way things are going now And I urge you to be very careful We could create a very, very severe problem at the rates of interest we now have Obviously, people are hurting and it's not just [affecting]  -55-    12/18-19/80  automobiles and housing People can't make decisions with rates this high And I would caution that we should decide how far we're going to let rates drop, depending on what develops, rather than have some preconceived idea that they should be kept at a certain level throughout the year  But no shortfall would be permitted in the target range in the federal funds rate?  It has bound at the bottom  [Unintelligible] down than up  I move that we accept the proposal   Well, my impression is similar to Jerry's, because we did have these long strings of upward revisions and then long strings of downward revisions I thought you implied, Steve, that the fact that we get a long string of upward revisions or downward revisions comes from external factors Is it possible that these errors in the money supply are leading indicators of economic activity? In other words, if they are all going up, we may be seeing a sharper rise, say, in the goods sector than we had anticipated--or [conversely], a sharper fall Is that possible?  I have a second question The studies distinctly show that fluctuations in the short-term rate got transmitted much more thoroughly to the other rates in the [financial] system, long rates as well as short rates Did we find any evidence that the increased fluctuations of the longer rates were interfering with or changing investment patterns?  You are dealing with a model that was built on much lower variability in long-term rates, so that sort of constrained your conclusions  I agree in that the lesson I got from the past 12 months is that we couldn't pick up judgmentally when the rate should go up or go down There's a distinct advantage to this and, in  -37-    2/2-3/81 -38-  contrast to Henry, I think they should go down as well as up But it has to be an equally up and down elevator I think the main point that comes out of a great deal of this is that we really shouldn't try to control the money supply on a rigid growth rate basis We should aim for it, but the forces in the real economy are going to swing that money growth rate around and we should be prepared for it and try to interpret the misses that we make as a reflection on our projections and what is going on in the real economy To try to make money grow at an absolutely steady rate in a fluctuating real economy will create such horrendous fluctuations in interest rates that it will defeat what we're doing Also, as Lyle says, we have to keep an eye on the general level We can get rates so high that they choke off economic activity, and that's not really what we're aiming for So, I would stick with the procedure, but I would put in perhaps a more fluctuating target in terms of where we want the money supply to go in light of what we know is going on in the real world  The last two times we raised the discount rate, it went right through to the market rates It didn't close the gap at all The moves were undertaken with the idea of trying to close the gap and the gap just moved ahead of us  This would be a movement back more rapidly to the nonborrowed [path] within the interest rate confines?  This is a general question Are we going to publish those studies?  But even if we did some more editing, I agree with Lyle that this is the sort of information that should be made available to the public  Well, I was certainly opposed to raising them and then taking them off this last round Sure, we have moved them up but we haven't moved them down to the bottom number; nevertheless, we haven't hesitated to take the top off I think it's well known that we could have gotten the same degree of restraint without having to go to 21-1/2 percent interest rates So, I'd be more interested in seeing that the bands stick rather than that they become elastic  No [Unintelligible] it was excessive at 21-1/2 percent  Well, I find that hard to accept We're getting to the point where we're transmitting very volatile [short- term] interest rates into the long-term market Even though we haven't been able to detect it in the past 15 months, that has to be something that is going to disturb all sorts of things over a longer- term period I think we're just abrogating our responsibility if we say we're not going to pay any attention at all to the interest rates  We had the inflation before we changed our procedure and it wasn't showing up to that degree in the long-term rates  I don't think so  Not the bottom of the range  Is this going to cause major operating problems at the Reserve Banks?  Yes Actually, I'm just indifferent We've argued we will proceed with--  SPEAKER(?) It puts you in the perfect position  Steve, if we lengthen the carry-forward/carry- back, doesn't that increase your difficulty of estimating reserves at any one point? Doesn't your estimating procedure get more distorted?  But there was a flavor [in our announcement] that we wouldn't consider it until September  But even if we aimed for M2, our control mechanism lever is still M1 It has to be  Well, if M2 overshoots the only thing we can do is lower M1  Steve, didn't you have an experience when you were trying out the different control measures that as you moved the control from one of the instruments to the other, in effect, what it  -75-    2/2-3/81  did was to move the variability to the instruments that were uncontrolled?  So, we are not getting rid of the variability by changing our target; we're just moving it to some other instrument  Steve, actually, we were trying to get back on the path in two specific instances One was the drop in April; and then we were moving back up to the path over a three-month period The other one was the ratchet up in July--or August, I guess We were reacting mainly to two almost discrete occurrences Did that in any way affect the rate at which we tried to get back? It's not as if we continuously drifted off in one direction or the other We just took some tremendous ups and downs that we were trying to correct  As I remember it, you gave us the option of getting back in three months or getting back in six months  Even on the funds rate, Henry, they found [what our new rate was] by noon on Wednesday [after the meeting] anyway  But they'd still request them  But we can't stop collecting it  Conversely, the Greenbook may be [biased] by unrealistic assumptions on money  Permits are at what--around 900,000?  When I looked over the staff forecast, what really struck me most was how sensitive it was to the inflation rate Given the monetary assumptions that we adopted in July, we already have the velocity to a point that if there's any increase in inflation over what the staff is forecasting, real growth could shoot down to the point where it is negative all year long It seems to me that if there is any risk in this forecast, it is that we'll get more inflation and a comparable decrease in real growth So, we could have a year-long recession based on the types of assumptions we're making That would indicate to me that instead of trying to lower the monetary target ranges, which we just barely got within [last] year, that we'd be well advised to stay with the ones we had this past year and try to come in at the center of them rather than to lower them progressively and run what I think is an increasing risk of missing them on the top side My forecast--I'm obviously the bottom one among the governors-- is that we're going to have less real growth and somewhat more inflation And [my view is] that we probably won't have higher  -90-    2/2-3/81  interest rates either or we'll miss our monetary targets for the rest of the year  How do we know five years from now?  But you're likely to be asked  I think we would be better off using the right- hand side Those numbers, the 5 percent and 7-1/4 percent, are in existence and in the public domain  It seems to me that we would be better off trying to explain the change in the range than we would trying to adjust the existing numbers  Will we ever know for sure what the shifts were?  Well, we won't have any information on this  We may also want to shift [the ranges] in July, which we haven't done for the past two years, because we will have a better idea of how much of the program is going to pass Congress The shape of the program may be very different from what has been proposed this month  That is the advantage of keeping M-1A If we have to raise the M-1B range later, it will show up as a reduction in the M-1A range, so we could show our--  What would this do to your nominal GNP growth?  I'm not really enthusiastic about lowering the ranges at all We've been concentrating on page 6, but if you turn to page 7 it shows that the implied interest rates are extremely high If we had to publish our projections of interest rates, we might have a different attitude toward this Even with a 1/2 percentage point reduction, the economic outlook is extraordinarily bad We've used every gimmick we could to get [the economy] not to decline, including shifts in demand for money and higher rates of velocity All sorts of things could go wrong, and there's no room for any slippage at this point in that projection But I see I'm all alone in not wanting to lower the ranges, so I could go along with taking them down the 1/2 percentage point I would strongly support Governor Rice in saying that I don't see anything in this system that says we have to take the ranges down year after year There is a certain amount of money growth that is necessary in this economy If we keep this up, we're going to get to zero [money growth] and we're going to have five years of total stagnation if we commit ourselves to that course So, I would support alternative I as stated in the Bluebook If my memory serves me right, last year we didn't like the ranges on M2 and M3 that were said by the staff to be consistent with our range on M1, so we lowered them And we missed them I think the best judgment as to what are the most consistent numbers is that being provided by our staff Even though [lower ranges for M2 and M3] look cosmetically nice, we could be sitting here a year from now with the same result That we had cosmeticly nice looking ranges and then missed them by the amount that the staff said we were going to miss So, I strongly suggest that we take alternative I as specified  -122-    2/2-3/81  Yes What we did was to take the M-1A and M-1B choice but we didn't like the looks of [the associated] M2 and M3 ranges, so we lowered them And then we missed them We didn't take the staff's judgment as to what was the proper relationship between the M1 ranges and those for M2 and M3  Yes  We got 98 percent on a 6 to 9 percent range for M2 and 10 percent on a 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent range for M3  I would also say that we ought to concentrate on the right-hand side of the page, as I said earlier We have a tremendous public relations problem There are an awful lot of people with sharp pencils out there; the more we tell them what we know and explain to them where our uncertainties are, I think the better our credibility is  Announce the bottom line And I'd tell them just how uncertain we are about that bottom line We could even put the calculations all on one side and show them where we made the assumptions and what the changes are  It sounds in fact more like 6-1/2 than 6-1/4 percent Is that what you're saying?  You mean it will reduce the target by 1/4 percentage point?  I'd take up on Ed's point After all, we're not only setting ranges for perception A year from now we have to figure out where we came in, and we ought to set something that we have some chance of achieving In a presentation of foreign targets about two or three weeks ago, I noticed that the French did very well but they had an 11 percent target I think it's better to be honest and to say, as Chuck is saying, that we misspecified these Then we would have some chance to make it rather than put out a number that is too low, knowing that we're not going to make it  Just barely, by 02  Tony is trying to suggest that we widen the range  But we've known since last July that the specification was wrong If we have to change all these other specifications as drastically as we do, we better get this one right Otherwise, we'll come up next year and say that we specified M2 wrong for two years running and now we're going to confuse the waters by re- specifying M2 in its proper relationship  That's what we thought last year at this time, too  They did that one time on a refund, too, and every bit of it was spent  But the staff forecast is so close to 9 percent already that it means we're going to start constraining almost immediately  Actually, we exceeded M2 by more than M3 We could put them both the same  We're not notable for changing things in July  Chances are that the only way to change in July is up and we'll go through the same argument about how awful it looks  Don't forget, we're going to have a first- quarter CPI number that's possibly going to scoop the markets right out of their minds again I think we're going to find it impossible to raise our targets after we've had, say, a 16-1/2 percent increase in the CPI in the first quarter  But we have all these excuses for changing them now, given the relationships  Better than 9 percent, not preferable to 10 percent?  In a sense, basically that's a vote for a 1/2 point reduction in M1 and a full percentage point reduction in M2; and if we do the cones we get another 1/4 point off on M1 So, if you're going to vote for 9 percent, you might as well take a full percentage point off the M1 range That's essentially what we are going to have to do in order to keep within the target for M2 because our only leverage is to push down on the M1s in order to retard M2  How are you going to get 1/2 point off M2?  That would be moving it down That's a full percentage point We're going from 6-3/4 to 6 percent--that's a 3/4 point reduction in M1--on the left side  SPEAKER(?) What is nominal GNP?  Well, it doesn't hold together intellectually now If we're going to take a percentage point off M2, then the 1/2 point down on M1 isn't consistent  Why don't we do like the British do and just say we're going to exceed it?  Is this the first time the Germans have intervened in the dollar market?  Could I ask another question? Do the Germans have plenty of dollars to intervene with?  SAMA?  Which one of these alternatives is built into the economic forecast?  But one of the problems we have here is that those six months are when we're going to get the most fiscal restraint; we will be getting the full impact of the windfall [from lower prices on] oil plus the sharp increase in social security taxes If the tax cut comes through, it would seem to me that we'd want our restraint more in the second half of the year than in the first half when the economy is already headed down I find the upper limits of these ranges very unacceptable anyway But given what we know is going on, it seems to me that we should be somewhat looser during the first half than we are in the second That would lead me to alternative A with a lower funds rate range, maybe 13 to 18 percent  We're well below target at the present time We're well outside of the range  -155-    2/2-3/81  Depending upon your assumption about the shifts  Just a floor  What is the funds rate range now?  15 percent with no top  ["A" and] "B" [don't have] a half percentage point [difference] in the numbers  Steve, am I correct that if we go for anything less than "B," then total reserves will decline over the quarter?  And if we went closer to "C," we'd have a rather sharp decline in total reserves?  Yes, but this is a total reserves base  That would say we reduced borrowing and total reserves  You don't think it's [unintelligible]?  Steve, if you locked in on the volume of borrowing, wouldn't your multiplier go all over the map?  That's not inconsistent with the targets we have for the money supply?  -169-    2/2-3/81  What period exactly are you talking about December-to-March or the quarterly average or from February?  The 5 to 6 percent for M-1B is a lot closer to "C" than it is to "B"   Are you implying that we would let it reach the 15 percent?  I just want to clarify what your proposal is, Mr Chairman If we moved to a borrowing level of $1 billion, does that mean that we're then going to let the interest rate fluctuate below as well as above the 15 percent floor?  Yes, but moving to the $1 billion plus--  Right But moving from where we are to $1 billion plus in borrowing implies some tightening in the market at the present time And it would lower the nonborrowed reserve path Is that correct?  Yes  I haven't known where it was and wasn't aware that we were dragging our feet on the up side  I can go along with your approach We simply can't make the things reconcile at this point So, let's let the market give us some indications as to what it wants to do  Well, we've already got it    2/24/81  What did we do when we reached the top?  I would much prefer to keep it on an informal basis at this point We haven't really changed the lower [limit of the funds range] We're doing something very similar to what was done in December when we reached the top [of the range] I'd just keep it on an informal basis at this point   But you would still expect [the Desk] to intervene on disorderly markets?  I realize that  When are they scheduled to repay?  Is the $8 billion regardless of signs?  And the $4-1/4 billion is a plus  Wasn't there some question as to whether we were going to put the informal limits directly in the directive?  Seconded  I would like to remind you that those deficit numbers are not independent of the forecast Our projected deficit for next year is considerably above the Administration's, primarily because of a much, much weaker forecast--a 05 percent rate of real growth rather than 5 percent, and higher unemployment rates and interest rates I think we added back in about $18 billion for interest payments based on our interest rate forecast rather than the Administration's, and we're losing about $25 billion in deficit per point of unemployment, if you compare the 6 percent with 5 percent So, if Henry's scenario that the risks are on the up side comes true, the size of the deficit will be considerably below what is being projected at the present time As I understand this forecast, the staff had a great deal of difficulty getting any of the GNP numbers to work out because of the paucity of money It is a very tight forecast And the interest rates that would have come out of just a mechanical running of the model are considerably higher than what are being shown here So, in contrast to what Henry says, I would think that the risks are on the other side The consumer is running out of steam; the automobile [sales] probably won't last [Businesses] can slow down investment I don't feel strongly enough about it to say that [the risk on] the forecast is on the down side, because I think we have some real demand pressures which are being suppressed, namely in housing at the present time, which with any sort of readjustment would rise  -33-    3/31/81  This forecast is one of the gloomiest I've ever seen And it certainly is gloomier than any forecast that is in the public [arena] now, mainly because of the underlying assumptions about interest rates I don't particularly want [policy] to let up On the other hand, I don't want to screw it down any harder at this point It seems to me that the best way to do this is approximately alternative B because what Fred says about other corporations [is true of the thrifts] We're going to have impacts on the thrifts If we keep interest rates up there, we'll get a lot of emergency reaction in trying to rescue them A very good study was done here at the Board on the number of corporations that have had their ratings in the bond market downgraded It's not only surprising, it's fairly widespread There are going to be a lot of corporations in trouble, and I don't see making it any worse for them I would also point out that we have M2 misspecified relative to where we've set the M1 measures We have decided to keep the M2 target where it was last year, even though the staff's best estimate was that it would be higher So we're trying to get M2 into a slot that's inconsistent with M1 And if we just look at the fact that we're over [our target] on M2, I think that is going to lead us to actions to depress its growth and depress the M1s [more] than ever And we've got the money market mutual funds We have an interest-sensitive, very interest-sensitive, [component] in the M1 measures, and if interest rates begin to drop, we're going to be sitting here worrying about the fact that M2 is going down, not that it's going up--and for [a reason] that's not connected with our targets In terms of the alternatives, I come out for "B"  But remember last April we had an estimate at this time of the year for a very large growth in April because of the enlarged refund And, in fact, it came in at -14 percent, as I remember  April is just a terrible month  Why don't we make it 12 to 18 percent, as Fred and I [suggested]  We've used language in the past that gave a number and then said we wouldn't be disturbed if it fell slightly short of it  Somewhat lower  What have the borrowings averaged in the last four weeks?  So $13 billion would be an increase in the borrowing level over where we've been most recently?  I can support the 12 to 18 percent Are you implying that we'd stay at about the $11 billion in borrowing and then let it--  But we'd do it with a consultation?  Suppose it's all money market mutual funds?  Well, it all depends, in Jerry's scenario, on what is making M2 go up relative to M-1B  How did we get to 5-1/2 percent? I thought we were at 6 percent?  All of a sudden we've dropped 1/2 percentage point  Yes It was 6 percent or somewhat less and now it's 5-1/2 percent or somewhat less  If we have [only] 5-1/2 percent, we can take that "somewhat lower" off  What was your fed funds range in the directive?  Did you take a vote on the 5-1/2 to 6?  Or 6 percent and somewhat less  I would prefer 6  SPEAKER(?) Yes  SPEAKER(?) I would prefer 6  SPEAKER(?) I would prefer it too  Try 5-1/2 to 6  Well, if you're going to do that, it should be 5-1/2 percent or somewhat more At least take off the somewhat less  Yes, and you'd let it come out as a minus 3  How far are we off the target for the first quarter? That was a 4-3/4 percent rate of growth or 3 percent or something And we're coming in at what, minus 2 percent?   Well, maybe it's because they're switching all the other ones  It's a quarterly target  May I ask a question?  Steve, you said that you thought the total borrowing would end up about $500 million above the path Is that correct?  Now, if we adjust for that, won't that just send the borrowing up to [nearly] $23 billion instead of $17 billion? Won't the total reserves be approximately the same, and we would just be adjusting the split between borrowed and nonborrowed?  So the short-run decision here is whether we shoot the borrowings up to $23 billion, is that correct?  But any of the actions that you are talking about now implies borrowing rising?  Well, on Wednesday--   In other words, we're leaving the range in place but piercing the ceiling as necessary Is that the idea?  This is Nancy Teeters This is much more specific than the February 24th language In that we simply agreed to accept some shortfalls [in the growth of M-1A and M-1B] In this one we're mentioning both the monetary aggregates and the interest rate range, without specifying what it is So, I think there's less confusion than there was in the February 24th [directive]  The "upper end of"?  Are you planning to put in a paragraph on the consultation of last week?   Second  Well, I'm surprised at the first quarter, and I don't really understand it However, I am also getting very worried about the cumulative effect of this [monetary policy restraint] If real GNP revises up even to 8 or 8-1/2 percent, there literally has been no real growth in the economy for two years That to me says that monetary policy has been working quite well in restraining the economy from any growth We've never had a period like this in which we had literally no growth on average for that [length of] time I think we have to continue to restrain [the economy] However, I am very worried that we will restrain it to the point that we will get interest rates that are going to be really damaging to all segments of the economy Interest rates may be [low] after tax, or in real terms, but they are still contributing to cost and are creating, I think, some of the upward pressure on prices You may be in a 46 percent tax bracket, but you still have to recoup that 18 or 20 percent interest  -10-    5/18/81  rate in order to pay your taxes on it This forecast has eight quarters of 18 percent interest rates I just don't think the economy can survive that way Either it's going [to blow] up on us in the sense that inflation is going to take off or we're going to have major failures and we are going to get a major recession from this someplace down the line And I urge caution when we come to deciding what we're going to make the interest rate because I think [the high rates] are damaging They can do a lot of damage if we are not careful  Has there been any indication that their deposits are being withdrawn in anticipation of failure?  But you'd be prepared to move as you did the day Reagan was shot if there's severe disorder in the market, wouldn't you?  But what is there in the outlook that would bring the dollar down?  -15-    5/18/81  We did  But we were well below our money growth path, weren't we, for the first three months? And to a certain extent we expected a rebound in the money supply in April in order to bring the GNP numbers and the money growth into line  Steve, you show M2 for May at 66 percent Is it below that now?  The 66 percent does?  That implies a negative rate of growth in M-1B during June  Well, I'm shocked by the consensus that is emerging I don't think this economic outlook, which is based on "A," is at all encouraging It means another year or maybe two years of no growth in the economy I find the unemployment rates projected, with no growth, rather unbelievable also More importantly, it seems to me that the level of borrowing is now becoming very crucial here At just under $2 billion we have already put a great deal of pressure on the market We have shot [short-term interest] rates up 3 to 5 full percentage points, depending on which ones you look at If we move borrowing up another $1 billion, the [proposed fed funds upper end of] 22 percent isn't going to hold It seems to me that we really should be somewhere between "A" and "B" and perhaps move the borrowing from the present $17 or $18 billion to just over $2 billion and let that be the deciding point here I'd set the [top of the funds rate] range at certainly no more than 21 percent, which I find difficult to accept We're putting a lot of pressure on the market now We haven't had enough time, as Frank said, to assess what that sudden change in interest rates is going to do I think it's foolish to run rates up another 5 percentage points in such a short period of time, which I'm convinced "C" would do at this point I can live with "B," but I don't like it I'd much rather have the borrowing halfway between $2 and $2-1/2 billion  Yes, but it's better than the [$2-1/2] billion that everybody else is talking about  Is that what sets the reserve path? It's borrowing, isn't it, that sets our reserve path?  What kind of borrowing are we putting in?  What Steve is implying is that the lower limit would be the 13 percent rate of growth  Mr Chairman, I like the way it was in the original here  Yes  The way it has been, where the situation calls for supplementary instructions from the Committee I think that's what it is we want I'd rather not have all that stuff about necessary and persistent and the rest; I'd just leave it alone  I think we can just say it informally and leave it that way It has caused a useful consultation for everybody; it has marked a point at which we make a decision as to whether we're going to do it or not do it  But, Fred, we've violated the range practically every time, with only one exception  But that explanation goes to what's here now  6-1/2 percent  SPEAKER(?) M2 is 6-1/2 percent  July 7th  SPEAKER(?) The 7th is Tuesday, but we may start Monday  END OF MEETING       May I ask a question? How much have you taken out of the nonborrowed reserves to date, Ed?  Does that imply that you're putting the $180 million back?   [During this period] we've had some rather peculiar borrowing patterns within the week Sometimes borrowing was very late in the week and it was very early in the week a couple of times What explanation do you have for that?  We've had some exceptionally tight Wednesdays, haven't we?  What was the shortfall? Was it in float?  Is it consistently in one direction or not?  This doesn't jive with the staff presentation this morning on the deficit that is in the projection The staff doesn't anticipate that the value of the dollar is going to fall more than 4 or 5 percent Isn't that right, Ted?  I assumed there was a self-correcting mechanism and people say it's not going to work  Well, there are two different points of view here We're looking at the possibility of a current account deficit of fairly sizable proportions, which you're saying could bring about a very sharp decline in the value of the dollar  At a later time Our staff has taken just the opposite point of view That we're going to get a sizable deficit and some decline in the dollar but not a collapse Is that correct, Ted?  That takes us back to 180  Well, at least at this point in time  Just as a point of information, when are the Carter bonds due? And how big are our balances over and above the amount that we owe in Carter bonds?  Why do you want a decline on a year-to-year basis?  -15-    7/6-7/81  I thought it was fourth quarter-to-fourth quarter  You mean [unintelligible]?  -16-    7/6-7/81  Do you have a major shift in the demand for money built into the '82 forecast also?  [Interest rates] never go down, Fred  What money supply do you get?  I played with the numbers also and I came up with two scenarios Basically, the overall [unintelligible] is the governor on the rate of growth of nominal GNP And given the reduction in the rate of growth in money and the assumed reduction for next year, we don't have much room for a nominal GNP that is very large One of the two scenarios that seemed to fall out of my working with the numbers was that we would have a full blown recession this year Yes, it could happen With all the growth that we've had, [growth for the year] could still come out at 1 percent because of the first quarter, but we could have zero or a negative in the other quarters If you look at the flash on real GNP in the second quarter,  -29-    7/6-7/81  the only thing that is positive is inventories; everything else is down Basically, it's a negative quarter If we got the recession this year and we stayed with high interest rates, then we could get some recovery but not a very vigorous one next year The other scenario that can work here, with these high levels of interest rates, is that we could squeak by this year without a major recession and then have very, very slow growth next year also--basically two very low growth years rather than a recession and a recovery I don't think we can live with these interest rates over that period of time without really causing a recession, the timing of which I'm uncertain about But with these rates of interest we will be there probably sooner rather than later  The crude food [component] was up very strongly, though, wasn't it?  Steve, in Appendix III, the associated interest rates for the third and fourth quarters are 19-1/2 and 21 percent, is that right?  We don't have the answers, but implicit in these is the level of interest rates Alternative I is the one that keeps interest rates in the 18 percent range for the full 18 months, isn't that correct? Presumably alternatives II and III would put interest rates in the 20 or perhaps 22 percent range  May I remind you that we shouldn't take too much credit for the price easing? I never thought we were totally at fault for the price increases that we suffered from OPEC and food; and I don't think the fact that OPEC and food have calmed down has a great deal to do with monetary policy per se, except in the very long run As a result, I think we ought to be very careful about what we do in terms of interest rates Nobody yet has mentioned housing; nobody has mentioned the Chrysler problem; nobody has mentioned all the companies  -46-    7/6-7/81  that have had their credit ratings downgraded; nobody has mentioned the possibility that the thrifts are going to go [under] if we keep interest rates up I get the impression that we're really tearing at the fabric of the financial world and the economy If we persist in having very high interest rates over very long periods of time, we're going to cause a disaster in this country It may not be next month and it may not be next quarter, but it's going to be a severe problem and it's going to come down on our shoulders for having pushed the economy over the edge  I happen to agree with Tony Solomon on the short run because if we aim for the 3-1/2 percent lower end of the M-1B range for this year, then we have no place to go next year We can put our ranges at any place up to 5 percent, but if growth were to come in [at or] above 3-1/2 percent, we're going to be in a position of increasing the rate of growth of the money supply and not decreasing it So, I think it's foolish to try to come in at that lower end I think we're going to come in at the lower end and I think we're going to come in at the higher end on M2, which we've known since the staff was telling us that in February However, the markets are totally aware of our problems with M1-A and M-1B and M2 If you read the most recent DRI report it describes exactly what our problems are in getting these things to come together Therefore, I don't think we have any credibility problem in explaining the difference between M-1B at the lower end of the range and M2 at the upper end of the range That leads me to the decision that I don't think we should change the ranges We should stick with the M-1 B range of 3-1/2 to 6 percent We ought to have good conversations and a good flow of information back and forth between ourselves, the market, and increasingly with the Congress, and we can explain what is happening We don't have to change the ranges to do that I don't think we should go for alternative II; it's too strict If people look at the first half of this year, everybody is aware that we're way under on the M-1B growth rate Even if we don't achieve our current range the second half of the year, they will be understanding of it And we can talk about it  When we come to next year, if we aim for a higher rate of growth in money and presumably some easing in interest rates, which I think is appropriate at this point in time, then my preference is with Lyle; I don't see any reason to tighten up Nominal GNP next year is going to be a great deal larger than it is this year Why reduce the money supply and almost assure ourselves that we're going to maintain high interest rates for this long a period of time? It seems to me that we don't have to adopt any of these strategies We could stick almost exactly with the numbers that we have this year and, in effect, that represents a fairly tight monetary policy So, I come down somewhere between alternatives 1 and 2 on page 8 and for retaining the 1981 targets for 1982, particularly since we are setting preliminary targets for 1982 In the past we've trapped ourselves by setting [new] targets in July and reaffirming them in February With all the uncertainties that we have, it seems to me we'd be better off to stay put now and, if necessary, change them in February but not commit ourselves to a lowering of the targets this far in advance of actual economic developments  I wouldn't take any of these, Chuck  No, I'm talking about alternative 1 on page 8, which is the shorter-run target I'd take the present ranges for '81 [instead of any of those] on page 14 I don't see any reason to change them  But that has been the issue repeatedly  It has been over the past 2-1/2 years that I've been here, and all we do is end up with high interest rates  Try to tell that to the construction industry  Well, I come down close to where Lyle does I would put the federal funds rate at 14 to 20 percent and borrowings between $1-1/4 and $1-3/4 billion If [money growth] begins to fall short, I would permit it, but I certainly wouldn't permit it to the extent that we did in May and June I think we overdid it in moving down on that particular path Like Frank, I think the [nominal GNP] is going to be somewhat weaker than is being projected, and I'm not sure whether it's going to come out of the real side or inflation We have had some short-term inflation gains that are going to be temporary and we may get a nominal GNP that's a little low over this third quarter; so we could get the 8-1/2 percent rate of real growth with the 14 to 20 percent fed funds rate at this point If growth falls short because we don't get the rebound in money, that's one thing; but if it's falling short because the economy is plunging, I will have a different attitude toward it I assume that if we get information that the economy is either growing too fast or too slow in terms of what we're anticipating, we will have a conference call  But we can always get those sorts of peculiarities  That's what he said  You mean to lower it  Well, isn't that what you're--  If we don't get that rebound in the week of the 8th, then we're off the bottom of the chart, aren't we?  What about Chuck's point about the lifting of the Regulation Q ceilings on the longer-term CDs? We could get a surge in some of those  But shouldn't we take a look as to why it's running high?  It's a combination of all three of them M-1B is between "B" and "C;" M2 is between "A" and "B;" the borrowings are at "A;" and the interest rates are between "A" and "B" You guys scrambled the whole mess!  That's too stringent  Why announce any reduction now? By January we'll have a much better idea of which way we're going  I don't think we even need to reduce the range for M-1B at this point  Then it would be 3-1/2 to 6 percent  Is Steve saying, on purely technical grounds because of the technical factors he's referring to, that if we wanted no change we'd add 1/2 percentage point to the range?  But in the past we haven't changed our minds at the end of the year We feel stuck with what we do [at this meeting each year]  Oh  There are two other problems here, though It's going to be impossible for us to raise the number Suppose we get a repeat of last year and get a sudden expansion in the money supply over the fall; we will end up with a high base Then we will face the problem we faced at the end of last year as to whether we can even meet the targets that we set for ourselves in July And if we lower them too much--by a whole percentage point, say, or even if we lower them at all at this point--and then in February we really need to raise them 1/2 percentage point, we're not going to be able to do it A second consideration here is that if we get the ranges too low, we will never be able to get within them and we'll lose credibility because we can't achieve our targets We have to balance whether we're going to achieve the targets as well as whether we're ever going to have the opportunity to raise them, which I don't think we are  I would much prefer 3 to 6 percent on M-1B  Yes, except that we--  We have never responded when [the growth rates] went down to the bottom; we only respond when they go to the top  [Comfortable] for M-1B We're uncomfortable on the high side for M2  We don't have to vote on the whole package [for the two years] do we?  Are we just voting for '82?  That will give you time before your testimony  Yes   Can we have the levels of M-1B starting with the last week in June, Steve?  We're $17 billion above   Do you [need] a formal vote on it?  They're recorded at cost  But [now] they're really coming back together I think other rates anticipated a drop [in the funds rate], which didn't occur And now the federal funds rate and the other short-term rates are coming together again The other rates were an aberration for a period of about four weeks  They're back to the relationship they normally have The federal funds rate has come back and [other rates] have come up, so they're together again  Would you explain why you're counting the thrift extended borrowing as nonborrowed reserves?  Yes, but why?  So, if we get a large volume of extended borrowing, you'll take that into account as you mark out your nonborrowed reserve path  10 working days, Jerry?  So it's a two-week cycle  So moved  SPEAKER(?) Seconded  I just wanted to point out that as I look at the shifts and the money issues, the things that we can control directly are either interest rates or reserves And we really ought to turn back to looking more directly at reserves and seeing how they stand out for all these new instruments that are developing and not  -16-    8/18/81  try to get back to actual transactions accounts That would take a lot of research and a lot of education on our part to find out just what we would want to do in terms of reserves We're targeting now, hopefully, on M-1B Because we don't control M2 directly, it doesn't seem to me wise to [target M2] If we get to control M2, we only do it through M-1B, so to make that our major target simply submerges the decision on M-1B rather than doing it directly The other thing I wanted to point out to you is--  I think I'm moving slowly in that direction, frankly, simply because I don't know how to cope with all these other things That is the one thing that we do have some [control]--  I realize that On the other hand, it also gets us out of having to judge between what we're going to target on But, with all due respect, may I point out that in February the [long- run] targets for M-1B and M2 were not consistent and they've become even more inconsistent Relative to the midpoint of M-1B, [the Committee] put the M2 midpoint too low It's not at all surprising that one is at the bottom and one is at the top It's just that they are more at the bottom and more at the top than we anticipated they were going to be  How about Chicago? Do you see house price declines in Chicago?  What kind of financing is going on?  Have you any idea what your in-migration is?  Are you going to leave the M2 part in it?  And then what would you do--call a conference?  But it also depends on what is causing M2 to be high  That's why I think it would be better to talk about why M2 is high rather than to automatically--  But don't forget rates dropped very sharply before that happened Rates haven't dropped this year  From a relatively low base  The wording has been changed to that effect  That's for this week?  But it might be into M2 by that time  [Unintelligible]  They might park it temporarily in money market mutual funds  Does that mean in alternative I, in the wording that relates to M2 remaining around the upper limit of its range for year, that you're going to take out the words "or moves within"?  So it's not going to automatically trigger any reaction?  Not right now  This implies initial borrowing of $14 billion?  And add this language in the sentence that starts "It is recognized that shifts"?  9 percent  But in reality, we're not going to follow this That's Chuck's point, that it's a violation  Well, it was [sacred] two minutes ago   Second  I think I read someplace that 30 states have overridden it  John, I noticed that 3 or 4 small banks in Oregon are on the troubled bank list Is Oregon particularly hard hit at this point?  You're talking about Texas [unintelligible]?  It's far and wide; it's headquartered out of Houston is what it is  You have some boom towns, don't you? Up in the Wyoming and Montana areas, don't you have some towns that are starting from scratch and--  It's compounded by the fact that the original rounds of cuts are just being felt Most of them just started the middle of last week so that the reactions, particularly by state and local governments and recipients of transfer payments, are just now being felt  Is that an addition to this 9-1/2 percent [growth for the year] in alternative C or is that [included]?  Public patience for staying on top of the hill won't last  -25-    10/5-6/81  Has there been a market reaction?  I would come out for alternative B; I think we have been too tight If we go for "C," we might see the funds rate go back up to the top of the range, and I don't want to see the funds rate go up I would like to see it in the 14 to 15 percent range I think most of you who have been opting for the tighter alternatives also had the higher growth rates I'm not sure that you have readjusted your perception of how slowly the economy is actually growing to the degree of tightness that has been prevailing over this year So, I would opt for "B" with an average funds rate of about 14 percent, and I'm not worried about the $200 to $300 million in borrowing I think that's about right because they will pay back as they have the opportunity If we go with "B," we will get some easing in the long-term rates, which is what we need very badly at this point, particularly in the mortgage area and in bond rates  Does that include a target?  Yes  Does that give the staff enough information to construct the reserve path?  I would prefer the equal weighing  Well, does it make a difference in the way the Desk operates as to whether it's in a proviso?  -45-    10/5-6/81  Steve, do you have enough of a gap between M1 and M2? For the year it looks as if the differential is going to run about 7 percent and none of these for the fourth quarter is coming anywhere near that much of a difference  Which means we should take a higher number for the M2 specifications at this time  You're afraid of going over the target for M2?  Why don't we take the 11 percent from alternative B and at least allow some leeway  You are going to get the relationship between the two growth rates so far off--!  What do you expect the borrowings to do, Steve?  If we start at $880 million, do you expect them to drop off?  We could also put in a range for the fourth quarter instead of coming down on [a specific growth rate]  For the aggregates, yes  -51-    10/5-6/81  I just thought that's about where we are  They can take it out of the center of the range, which apparently is where we're coming down  I accept it   Second    11/17/81  One question, Mr Chairman The third quarter inflation rate turned out to be quite a bit higher than we had expected and I wonder if there are any special factors there or is it something that's likely to continue? What are the risks on that side?  This would reverse next year, Steve If it starts low, then it will end up--  Some of my concerns have already been expressed I have a strong feeling that we're monetarists when the economy is expanding and we're interest rate targeters when it begins to collapse If we move in and put a floor on the interest rate, which is what it sounds like around here, we'll be in real trouble We haven't kept up with what we said we were going to do I think there is still latitude to lower interest rates from where they are now This staff forecast has a bottom rate on mortgages of 16-1/2 percent; that doesn't speak of any revival in the housing market next year I think we can move it down I agree with Lyle that we have let interest rates swing both too high and too low Or rather we let them swing too high; I have seen very little evidence of their swinging too low at this point I think we will probably want to pay more attention on the high side as well as on the low side in the next cycle There's also a tendency to be very unconcerned when rates rise and then to sit and agonize for weeks about lowering them We did that last summer and a few other times on the discount rate It seems to me that we should be symmetrical and not try to fudge or change our philosophical point of view as we go along  If you look at this forecast--and we have had a lot of surprises in the forecast on a quarterly basis over the past three years--it takes until the end of 1982 for real GNP to get back to where it was at the beginning of 1980 Now, that's a very, very slow- growing economy; and although there have been lots of ups and downs, we end up at the end of 1982 with an 88 percent unemployment rate for three solid quarters That is not my definition of a reviving economy And we have 88 percent [unemployment] projected primarily because interest rates are assumed to rise next year When an economy is growing as little as this one is projected to grow with no impact on interest rates, some policy parameter is wrong And this is even after a very large tax cut at midyear We're not talking about an exuberant economy next year anyway; we're talking about an economy that is just barely keeping its head above water If we then come down and set a floor on interest rates at 12-1/2 percent, we're going to end up like the supply siders did with the Stockman article; somebody is going to notice that the emperor doesn't have any clothes on and that we aren't accomplishing anything Our inflation rates for the past three years have been 97, 98, and 94 percent and this is after three years of monetary restraint Every time we think we're going to get a dip in the inflation rate, something comes along and [drives] it back up again I think we should become increasingly concerned about the rate of real growth in this economy and do what we can on inflation But [we also need to] realize that we don't have complete control and that we could do extreme harm if the economy continues to run at these very low levels of real utilization  It's implicit in setting a floor on interest rates  That's not the argument I heard when they were going up, either  What if you're not happy with next year's targets?  I would prefer alternative B with the 10 to 15 percent I think there is a real problem of perception in that it looks as if we've tightened monetary policy at the wrong time if we go with the 5-3/4 percent target for M1-B  That will scare the market out of its mind if you do that because they would interpret it to mean that we're heading again for the lower end of the range next year  I don't like next year's targets; I think they're too low I hate to commit myself to them; it gets to the point that we can't do anything about them in February We're supposed to take a new look at them in February This freezes us in concrete as to what we're going to do for next year's target  But that argues more for the appearance of it and that we stay with the 7 percent I agree with you that nothing we do is going to affect what happens over the next six weeks  I think that's more like it It's not that we're willing to see a shortfall but we expect that it's going to happen  Is it the difference between [desiring] and accepting?  I'm not sure what you said Did you say construct a path on "A" or--  You wouldn't see the borrowings going above $400 million?  You're assuming the discount rate will go down to around 12 percent during this period of time?  Only on the way up  Is your proposal that if the money supply comes in short we would lower the borrowing?  SPEAKER(?) Yes  So borrowings fall off?  Which higher thing?  November to December  That's right  Don't forget that last year the economy went down at a real rate of 9-1/2 percent in the second quarter No wonder the rates dropped so fast We're going to have a decline here of about half that  What are you doing? Are you suggesting "B" with a quarter billion dollars of original borrowing?  M2  I would much prefer the 10 to 15  Yes  I still don't like the phrase about phasing into next year  My problem is that [money growth rates] are coming in so low this year that if we start talking about lower targets next year--there's already talk around the market of our being lower-limit monetarists--it gives the impression that we're heading for the lower limit next year as well  Well, we're already under for this year  It sounds as if we're trying to pull [money] down so we can make next year's target, and we're already below where we want to be next year--or where you guys want to be next year  Isn't there agreement to let the borrowings slide if it begins to come in low?  But the question is on what path to construct M1-B, isn't it--whether it's 7 or 8 percent in the quarter?  But affirm the target for the last two months  It's easier to say 7 percent for the last two months  -59-    11/17/81  What about the language you had a minute ago that we would provide reserves in the two-month period that would be consistent with a 7 percent rate of growth in the money supply? Shift it from a pinpoint to a reserve supply in there  And say we're going to hit the money supply at 7 percent, but--  Don't you have M2 growth too low?  11-1/4 percent is--  I like Chuck's language Governor Partee's language finesses all of our problems and we've had enough discussion here, I think, that the Manager will know what it is we're trying to achieve  What's the funds rate formulation, Chuck?  It's only been a month since it was there  We've had informal agreements before to consult before we hit the bottom or the top of the range We could do that this time also  If we had an M1-B target of 7 percent for November-December, an M2 target of 11-1/2 or 11-3/4 percent, the funds range of 10-1/2 to 15-1/2 percent, and initial borrowings at $400 million, does that cover what we've been [unintelligible]?  -64-    11/17/81  But is 10-1/2 percent on M2 consistent with 7 percent on M1, Steve?  For the quarter  Why not 10-1/2 percent with a consultation at 11 percent?  We can consult at 11; it's the same thing  October to December  Why can't we say "about"?  Why don't we put both of them in there?  Yes, it does--    What were the terms that the Treasury agreed  to for us to begin [intervening]?       Did the Treasury say in any specific way what          it considered a disorderly market?  Did they say a certain percentage  change or something like that would be--       What I'm trying to find out is  Do we have  some general guidelines from the Treasury as to when we intervene or  don't intervene that you can speak to?      Or the Germans do it ahead of us, or for us  You used up $38 billion of the $4 billion? Is that right, Peter?  Don't you feel you need a little more leeway on that? You are pretty short at this point, aren't you?  The $4 billion runs from when to when?  So you get a new $4 billion starting tomorrow  It's $3 billion Oh, I see what you mean  Have you both been wrong before?  Is it symmetrical, plus or minus?  But the state and local sector is approximately double the size or more of the defense sector, so those declines in state and local are quite substantial, of course, in real terms  Are you going to report a lot of plant closings?  Actually, Frank, the capacity utilization in this [forecast] doesn't get down to where it was in 1974 It bottoms out at 73 percent and in 1974 it was 69 percent  Jim, will the CPI pick up the pre-Christmas sales?  Yes, the December CPI Do they have a way of [measuring] the widespread sales that are taking place?  Ted, has the British price situation improved very much?  And they have had how many quarters of decline in real growth?  I have a question Given the tentative targets that we established in July, are the various growth rates for the Ms now consistent?  Taking just the difference in the midpoints for this year, a midpoint on M1 of, say, 4 percent, given a 2-1/2 to 5-1/2  -21-    12/21-22/81  percent range, would imply 11 percent for M2 and 12-1/2 percent for M3?  And then you have interest rates beginning to rise again in the latter half of the year Won't that mean the same forces that were operating this year will tend to expand the rate of growth in the broader aggregates?  Essentially what you are saying is that we may get a rerun of this year with M1 growth toward the bottom end and M2 and M3 constantly on the--  3 to 5-1/2 is only 2 percentage points  That will only widen the spread between M1 and M2  We are going to undertake a special survey of the money market mutual funds at the beginning of next year, isn't that the timing, Steve?  And we'll try to find out what the transaction use is and what the turnover is on them  We can try  I simply want to support maintaining the M1-B target I have a lot of sympathy with what Frank has said I think we do need to see whether we can find something else It may be in between the two ways that we operate but I am not satisfied with what we have I am really very concerned about the M2 target because we had a 7 percentage point gap between the growth of M1-B shift-adjusted and M2 We got ourselves into this situation where we are below one [target] and at or above the other I would guess that the midpoint of M2 that is consistent with the midpoint of M1-B at 4 percent is 9 percent so that we are going to find that we will do again what we did last year If we hit the 4 percent midpoint of the M1-B target, we  -40-    12/21-22/81  will hit M2 at 9 percent or above So it seems to me this is a perfect time to adjust it We have a history of a 7-point gap If we aim for a midpoint of 9 percent or thereabouts for M2, that is only a 5-point differential instead of 7, so we are not repeating completely what we did last year And we'd have a better chance, I think, of staying within the targets and not agonizing all year long about which one is the most important and which one is going over So, I would associate myself with those who would accept the existing M1-B target, increase the M2 target, and remove the IRAs and Keoghs [from M2] We don't have a record of changing in midstream, Tony We have never changed a target  We never have, from the time we [established the tentative ranges] on down  Yes, but then when we get down to doing it, we always say we won't do it  We'd rather overshoot than change the target That is why establishing them in July a year ahead of time is such a mistake We have no idea what the next year is going to be like And this is not a very good forecast As of the fourth quarter of this year, we will be exactly where we were in the fourth quarter of 1979 And if the forecast is accurate for next year, in the fourth quarter of 1982 we will be exactly where we were in the first quarter of 1981 That is really a galloping economy over two years!  It is not just a midyear shift; it is a mid-18 month shift or any shift in announced ranges We just don't do it  Steve, I am fascinated by Willis' observation Can we get at some of this from the clearings [data]?  But the troublesome thing about the money market mutual funds is that the data we're getting on low turnover and all the rest goes against what all of us hear that people are using these funds as checking accounts My own sample indicated that 99 percent were using them as checking accounts  Then what do we do when everything becomes money market funds?  To what extent does the discount rate act as a floor?  Well, if we have a big December; this is a November-to-March number  Well, I can endorse Tony's suggestion, which was modified by Roger, Chuck, and others If you look at it visually, we need something more than 4 percent [M1 growth] to come in on target So, if we take Roger's suggestion of 4 percent for M1 and use 9 percent for M2, a funds range of 10 to 14 percent, and borrowing of $350 million with the understanding that if M1 growth begins to go up we won't try to restrain it if it means a rise in interest rates, that would be a perfectly acceptable decision for me  No, I am talking about Chuck's point that by going from November to March we have a December which is probably going to be above November and we have a high first month in there so we may need a little leeway to accommodate for the fact that December is coming in above the November level  If we need a little leeway, we could have a conference  -58-    12/21-22/81  What if the decline in the real economy in the first quarter continues at the rate in the fourth quarter? [Interest rates] undoubtedly would be softer  You feel so sure on this  -61-    12/21-22/81  We could do it by saying "around" 4 and 9 percent and let that--  What do we have for the long-term range?  I can buy $300 million  They're not consistent  SPEAKER(?) We aren't compromising  Wait a minute What are our chances of hitting 9 percent on M2 if we have 5 percent on M1?  You want 47 percent?  Probably February 20th with Proxmire  And the 9 to 10?  Do you want a show of hands?  But we have only released these with a 5-year delay, is that correct?   This was with no change in monetary policy?  You didn't postulate that if we had a [tighter] fiscal policy we might have a more--  Does that give you an increase in business fixed investment and housing and so forth? It must  You still have a fairly substantial shift in the demand for money in 1982, don't you?  How does that compare to what happened in 1981?  Do your back data show anything on--  In the past have you had increases in NOW accounts in the first part of January? You've had NOW accounts for what, five years now?  But do you show in those early years a sudden jump in January?  Which ones have the--  Doesn't Illinois have something like that but the date is in March?  They've done away with that?  They could move them out just for [unintelligible]  Yes  But it will have an effect of making M1 and M2 diverge?  When the [market] rates rise over and above the statutory ceilings  Not at the level the NOWs are at  You ought to shoot to the top of the M2 band  SPEAKER(?) Oh, come on!  Well, it's the same thing as widening the relationship  That's exactly the same thing that John is suggesting  Well, my problem is that I'm not satisfied with the forecast If we stick to these targets, we end up with virtually no growth for the fourth year in a row and unemployment of 9 percent or above I think that's politically very dangerous We're courting a lot of trouble for the Congress, the Administration, and the American people [if we try] to hold unemployment at 9-1/2 percent We said we were going to review these targets We set tentative targets and that has turned out in my mind to be a major mistake because we are setting targets for the subsequent year when we're right in the midst of the formulation of fiscal policy for that year on the Hill And then we don't have the courage to change them I don't want to play around with the base because I think that is too difficult to explain  We ought to look at this and ask What gives us an acceptable level of real growth and some decline in the unemployment rate next year? And that leads me to say that we should go at least to last year's M1 target of 3 to 6 percent The target proved disastrous and we undershot it Instead of doing all this horsing around with the base, we should [set the ranges] straightforwardly the way John Balles has suggested and widen the difference between the M1 and M2 ranges, and then try to stay with that Even with 3 to 6    2/1-2/82  percent, if we come out at the upper limit, we are not going to have a robust economy next year But at least we might get some decline in the unemployment rate and in interest rates and I think that's what we're here for Our major responsibility is to provide a healthy economy We are getting considerable forecasts, at least, of a reduction in inflation; and if it turns out that we're wrong, maybe we can change the ranges again in midyear and do it in an honest way rather than just always have this problem of perception One of the problems with sticking with the ranges that we have is that if we don't come within them, then we have an enormous credibility problem starting the end of the year We can push, but there's just so much we can do with this Sooner or later we have to face up to whether we made it within our ranges or we didn't We go into an enormous amount of explanation to try to explain why we didn't We may push off that credibility problem, but we don't avoid it So, I would suggest raising the ranges on all of the aggregates  Are you assuming a decline at any point?  Or over a couple of months  I have a tentative question for Peter I'm not sure I'm totally correct but if I add up roughly [the figures in] the footnotes in appendix 2 [in the Bluebook], you took $540 million out in the multiplier adjustment, which is greater than I've ever seen before That must mean that you had a very unstable multiplier relationship in your initial projections that you were constantly adjusting That also suggests to me that reserves were shifting between categories at a greater degree than is normal When all the reserves went out last summer, they sort of disappeared During this period did you have a shift of reserves from low reserve deposit categories to high reserve deposit categories?  Essentially, we had a reverse of the situation that prevailed over the summer? In a very technical sense, we had a reversal of that?  So moved  SPEAKER(?) Second  Steve, did you say what the borrowing associated with alternative A was?  The $3 billion on borrowing that you're tentatively estimating for "A" could go as high as $5 billion?  We could fall off the cliff on the other side  We have already signalled our displeasure to the market We are at 15-1/2 percent [on the funds rate] and $2 billion in borrowing When we say "stay where we are," are we talking about staying at $2 billion or $2-1/2 billion or $3 billion?  We more than washed out last April in the space of what--3 months?  You're willing to remove the bottom as well as the top?  Well, I don't object to starting at $15 billion on borrowings because that's coming down from where we are My only difference from the specifications suggested so far is that I think we should be prepared to move toward $13 billion The language here does that, but I think it should be put on the table that we're not going to be rigidly stuck at $15 billion of borrowing if things--  The point I'm making is that we went from $300 million to $2 billion [on borrowings] in the last six-week period So, if we're going to be that flexible going that way, we should be prepared to be equally flexible when we get--  If you're going to be intervening, aren't these two--  With $200 million of interest [earnings to be added] in there  -75-    2/1-2/82  There's also the delay in the [President's] economic report and the budget  We're not adding housing next year anyway when we have a 17 percent mortgage rate, so why worry about it?  But we used [the upper end] at least once as a constraint  Not if the range goes up to 10 percent  Does no one share my concern that the forecast is too low? If all our temporary problems get [unintelligible] in essence that we are negating the President's program I find myself in the odd position of being the only supporter of President Reagan in the room here Basically, [the staff is] projecting a major continued recession at very low rates of [activity] And the overall policy may be too tight Whether we have problems with the base or any of the rest of it, we are just making monetary policy too restrictive to get the sort of recovery that I think all of us want  I think there is a disadvantage in going [to testify] as early as the 10th because [Congress] might come back and say that we did not give a proper evaluation of [the Administration's] economic policy  Yes  We have been so flexible!  I learned 25 years ago that monetary policy was a flexible policy instrument, and we have been rigid for 2-1/2 years now, which is ridiculous  No, not that different  It comes to the same thing  That is right And either way it is an easing of monetary policy  Have you thought through the implication of these interest rates for the savings and loans institutions? [Their representatives] were here the other day asking us if we were deliberately putting them out of business And I would say that, yes, we are deliberately putting them out of business  Or how many we want to put out of business  But he is  We could rebase the top  More people perceive that we have 15-1/2 percent interest rates and 17 percent mortgage rates than whether we are [fostering growth of] the money supply at 1 percent or 2 percent or 3 percent  Yes  I would say to Larry Roos that having gone to the reserve targeting and monetary aggregates targeting with a great deal of reluctance and skepticism, and having all the troubles and criticism that we have had, I am getting more and more to the point that I do not think it is the right way to [conduct policy] We ought to be moving back toward interest rate targeting combined with aggregates targeting, knowing that we are not going to achieve either perfectly, but we would have a better monetary policy than we have had and a better economy We have bounced this economy all over the mat for three years with no growth  I have a much more practical point I do not like what we have done to the economy in the past three years I do not like 9 percent unemployment rates and I do not like interest rates in the 17 to 20 percent range  With 9 percent unemployed?  Exactly  What are the consequences of being--  The political consequences of being the sole cause of a continuing 9 percent rate of unemployment can be greater than anybody is talking about around this table  Not this year Our problem is 1983; it is not this year  Or change them  I would prefer to rebase now  Well, I have stated my argument before I do not like the outlook  I want to change the ranges and I want to give more opportunity for growth and some opportunity to reduce the unemployment rate, some opportunity to reduce the interest rates, and some help to the savings and loan and the housing industries  Yes I think monetary policy is much too tight for the state of the economy  I received a solicitation this weekend from Sears to establish an IRA account  How would you feed back the change in the saving rate?  We have yet to--  Not me  Wait a minute, we have the date of the next meeting That is eight weeks away Do we want to wait that long? It is a long time  SEVERAL It is a long time  It is a matter of clearing our calendars or keeping them open  -110    2/1-2/82   Second  That concerns only the interest payments for 1981?  When do we expect to hit the debt limit now?  Do you have an increase of the number of foreclosures on farm land?  But, Steve, doesn't that prove that the congestion that we're anticipating is not in this calendar year but next year?  Are you getting a lot of in-migration?  What I interpret Steve as saying in a very polite way is that monetary policy is too tight for the degree of liquidity that the public demands at the present time  There also may be built into the so-called real rate now a risk premium to compensate for the extreme volatility of interest rates  Didn't a survey of the banks indicate that there was no major increase in the number of accounts?  I'm basically impressed by the fact that all of our worst fears have been realized We have nearly 9 percent unemployment For every Federal Reserve District, the opening sentence in the Redbook was about depression or not functioning well or no sign of recovery We have the thrifts going down We have a liquidity crisis in the thrift industry in at least half of the Districts We have a massive reduction in credit ratings, as Emmett mentioned, and a very high level of business failures What more do you want? We have the economy essentially out flat And under any of these alternatives we don't get a great deal of recovery At the end of the [projection period] we get to maybe 75 percent capacity utilization and still have well over 8 percent unemployment As I thought through it, so many of our other problems would be alleviated if we just had some reduction in interest rates at this point It wouldn't help all the thrifts, but it would certainly help some And going along with a 13-1/2 percent or 13-1/4 percent interest rate, [with rates] rising sharply next year, is not my idea of how to put this economy back to work  Given the alternatives that we have and the wide division of preferences here, I obviously want to associate myself with Governor Partee and Governor Gramley and go for alternative A And if it turns out that that's not doing the job of recovery then, as I said last time, we should raise our targets We can do it a number of different ways The one modification I would make on "A" is that I would go for a billion dollars of borrowing rather than $750 million because I think the $750 million is too strong a signal that we are going for ease But I don't think 13 percent is an acceptable level of interest rates for this stage of the [cycle] I think we can do more I have some reluctance to ease sharply because I don't think we are going to get the correction in the federal deficit that we need to offset the collision course that I anticipate next year if the deficit is not changed But, under normal circumstances and with a normal fiscal policy, we should be a lot easier than we are now And the fact that fiscal policy is so overly expansionary is the only thing that keeps me from urging an even greater relaxation in monetary policy  Could I ask Steve to repeat his proposal on how we might use M2? I don't think I understood it  As I read the first quarter, we had a tremendous increase in M1 but the associated increase in M2 was not all that strong Is that correct?  Where is it now--11 to 18 percent?  With a billion dollars of borrowing  No  Steve, when does that bulge come? Does it usually come in the first weeks of April or a little early?  The point I want to get at is that we would know early if it is going to occur It probably would occur early in the month of April; that is traditionally when it has happened  Are 3 percent for M1 and 8-1/4 percent for M2 compatible? The 3 percent M1 [in the Bluebook alternatives] has 7-1/2 percent M2  We can afford some easing You know, we are really at the bottom of the recession I don't see why you are so enamored of keeping interest rates in the 13 to 15 percent range And it certainly won't help the international situation We are really ruining ourselves with the rising value of the dollar as far as our exports are concerned We could afford some narrowing of those differentials in the international market  The long-term rates haven't moved at all  There are still 17 percent rates on mortgages  But the point is that interest rates also have been a full percentage point higher than we anticipated with the level of borrowing over this period of time So, there's a tighter market with that level of borrowing than we thought there was going to be  What is your proposal again?  Will we have enough information to know what M2 is doing during the month?  We do?  If M2 comes in weak, would you tolerate a higher level of Ml?  How often do we hit our April projection?   Is this a dealer?  When you say bailing out the market and liquifying it, do you mean stabilizing it at some interest rate or letting it move a certain amount? Or have you no idea at this point?  Are they negotiating with banks or with the IMF? With whom are they negotiating for the credit?  They have not gone to the IMF yet?  Gretchen, you've given a rather detailed explanation of why the dollar has declined and yet, as far as I'm concerned, it doesn't get there It seems to me that the dollar declined without any of the traditional reasons as to why international values of the dollar change Is speculation [the explanation for] what is going on in the market? Is there something other than rational [behavior]? Your explanations only go a little way toward explaining the total turmoil that has been in that market in the past six weeks  Are you implying, then, that the value of the dollar will probably rise again, assuming that the domestic situation stays stuck together? If they don't get a drop in rates, will they reverse that expectation and we could see a rising value of the dollar again?  Si, are you getting a lot of out-migration? Can you measure that in any way?  As far as I'm concerned, we can go ahead and have the presentation on the alternatives and I will make my statement then  Could I ask Peter a question? You said that the Treasury cash balance went up to $30 billion Is that an unusual increase?  So there really was a very large final settlement--well above normal--in the first quarterly payment  That would probably explain some of the run-up in NOW accounts that took place in anticipation of April 15  Does this imply that Argentina is about to become a two-currency country like Mexico?  So moved  Frank, is this because there is a minimum that one has to--  And those minimum balances are fairly high?  May I take my turn now? I have listened very carefully, and I get a strong sense of crisis--which I've been anticipating for quite some time--not just in financial markets but in practically every sector of the economy now No particular region seems to be exempt Even if today's problems with the money market are resolved successfully--and we don't have any clue on that as of this point--I think there is another in the wings Whether it's a particularly new and inexperienced or maybe dishonest broker or whether it's one of our larger firms, we are going to be facing financial crisis sooner or later I would hasten to point out to you that since we last met we've had five major bankruptcies, all anticipated Braniff may not have disturbed New York but it obviously  -26-    5/18/82  disturbed Dallas We have a list of close to 75 major corporations that have had their credit ratings downgraded And since that list came out, there have been three additional bankruptcies reported There are other firms that are obviously very shaky and that have very high debt [levels] I think much of this crisis and the problems, both in the international market and the domestic market, have come from the high variability of interest rates And I think people have built into the interest rates now a margin for risk, which reflects that variability And the variabilities also have created new markets that I don't see any function for except for variable interest rates Those are the futures markets, the options, and the ultimate silliness--the options on futures, which strike me as just pure gambling or trying to avoid risk  So, it seems to me pretty obvious when one looks at the economic projection, which I don't disagree with, that we are in the process of just pushing the whole economy not just into recession, but into depression And that's not a forecast of a good economy, I would point out to you It seems to me utter foolishness to have 94 percent unemployment and a 15 percent federal funds rate Those are just two things that have never occurred in this economy before The staff has lowered its forecast, and has done so across the board, although mainly in business fixed investment But everything is down And when I questioned them about it yesterday, they said "We no longer can deny the April numbers" The April numbers are very bad And they carry that forecast of very slow growth out for a longer period of time If you look at it closely, there is no recovery By the time we get to the fourth quarter of 1983, the unemployment rate is down to 88 percent and capacity utilization is up to 73 percent I think we've undertaken an experiment and we have succeeded in our attempt to bring down prices, although I realize they are lower than can be sustained But as far as I'm concerned, I've had it with the monetary experiment It's time to put this economy back together again and to get us some stability as to where we're going and how our interest rates are going to operate I have very little respect for the long-term aggregate [ranges] and I don't feel we have to prove ourselves any more I think it's time to operate as rational people and to try to get the economy at least started on a tentative recovery  Given the alternatives that Steve has presented, that leaves me in the position of alternative A I can't conceive of maintaining these interest rates and not having really severe problems as we move into the summer I'm concerned, as is everyone else, about those deficits I would hasten to point out to you that approximately $100 to $125 billion of the deficit is due to the recession And I don't think we should require the Congress to try to offset recession- induced deficits by cutting expenditures or raising taxes Even if we adjust for that, the deficits are substantial And that's what I assume the Congress will be working on rather than trying to remove the other part of it I think it's time to relax [policy] and to reliquify the economy It's time to permit corporations to fund their securities loans It's time just to say we are finished one job and to start the next one  We also run the danger that if we don't pay some attention to the resolution, they will pass a law   But there's still a fourth possibility here and that is, if we say we're going to overshoot--  All right, I'll suggest a fifth If we're going to overshoot, it seems to me that we have problems in explaining ourselves to the market because we leave them without any information as to what is an acceptable overshoot One possibility is to more or less quantify what we find to be an acceptable overshoot, given all the uncertainties, which we can outline, and they have been outlined We could stay with our ranges for this year and then give some idea as to what the acceptable overshoot would be--in the neighborhood of an extra one percentage point or something of that sort It may turn out that as we go through the year growth will come back down into the ranges and we can just forget about the extra 1 percentage point that we've added on I'm concerned that we never change the ranges, gentlemen, and we're supposed to be flexible So, it would be something if we could break out of that cage, which seems to me very desirable  That's right  And how are you going to construct reserve paths on that basis?  We've never been flexible in February before  My initial response when you were about halfway through the discussion was that it would be more diplomatic if I kept quiet However, I would like to make some points about where I think the ranges should be I can see all the arguments for not raising the ranges On the other hand, if we just say we are going to tolerate going over them, then we will have problems with the people with sharp pencils in New York who sit down and figure out how much money can grow over the rest of the year in order to come within the targets So, I feel fairly strongly that we have to give some indication as to what the overreach that we will tolerate will be I think that will help them It's the clearest way to send a signal to the market that we will tolerate lower interest rates because they probably would associate and accomplish what you're after, Emmett So, I think we can't just go up [to the Hill] and say fuzzily that we're going to go over [the target] We have to make some determination about what is bearable And maybe we want to make it larger; I think the 1/2 point won't do it, Tony A point probably would, and a point-and-a-half would be an even stronger signal to the market to bring the rates down For next year, I see absolutely no reason to lower the ranges at this point That's putting us into a box that we put ourselves into a year ago and we're now trying to get ourselves out of it I think it's foolish to do that In fact, it might be good policy as a general matter year after year to say that we're not changing the ranges at [midyear] and thus leave ourselves maximum flexibility come February  That's December  Yes  Second  On the Hill or in The Wall Street Journal?  When do you testify?  You mean the reason the Administration is so [unintelligible] is because of our seasonal adjustment program?  Well, I want to get interest rates down I'm not worrying about them going up, because I think that's intolerable Therefore, I would move toward what Pres and Chuck have said but a little more strongly If we do get some increase in velocity, we should let it carry through and take the drop in interest rates that I think we need to keep this economy going and to avoid, really, almost a catastrophe So, I would take the specifications of "A" but raise them I would go at least to 6 percent and perhaps tolerate 6-1/2 percent for M1 I think we need a signal in the market that we have eased or rates won't come down and, therefore, I would drop the borrowing I would take a borrowing level preferably of $300 million, but I could settle for $400 million And we need to handle it fairly flexibly It's seven weeks until the next meeting Certainly in seven weeks--and probably later in July--we will have a better reading on where we are It's not an intolerable period of time to let policy run fairly freely And if we're wrong, we can reverse ourselves at that point But at least we ought to experiment to see if we can bring ourselves out of this [recession]  Well, I have no--  But I think that's what we need to signal the market We can phase it down over a couple of weeks, but it's going to take a fairly sharp drop in borrowing to get the message across that we are easing on monetary policy  Well, I can't even tolerate a 15 percent upper limit, as Chuck can I think 14 percent is outrageous in the situation we're in I would much prefer a cap of 14 percent and say that we are not going to go above it We've had enormously adverse reactions over the past couple of weeks as the rate has edged back up to the 15 percent level  Tony, with $800 initial borrowing, regardless of what we do with the rates of growth in the Ms, there is absolutely no change from where we have been for the past 3 months And we're going to have interest rates that are fluctuating between 14 and 15 percent That's no change in policy  And they may be higher  It's close to being--  Well, a 14 to 15 percent federal funds rate for the next three months in my mind is absolutely no change If it takes a drop to $300 million to get it down to 12 percent, my word, that's [only] a 2-point drop That doesn't sound to me like a plunge in the market at this point  Why are the rates going up? Why have funds been trading at 15 percent for the past month? Was it because the borrowings were well above the $800 million that we specified at the last meeting?  We also had a bottom limit in the spring of '80 in that we weren't going to let the rate go below 10 percent or something of that sort We haven't consistently stayed within the limits  It's the same number  But can we say we're going to be tolerant of an overshoot without giving the market some idea of how much? Otherwise, they will be drawing out all sorts of possible--  Yes, but what they do, Preston, is that they sit down and figure out the rate at which the money supply has to grow for the last six months and--  But we may cause more chaos by not doing it  Steve, does this revision in the June number bring the quarterly average back down to 3 percent?  So, what is happening in June is that we're reverting to what you originally expected?  Steve, how does this fit? If we use these specifications, would you think the [federal funds] rate would be about 14-1/4 or 14-1/2 percent?  That's what we had last time with the rates well above that  You know, there has been no discussion of the impact of this on the international value of the dollar If we maintain rates at 14 to 15 percent, what is going to happen to the international value of the dollar?  But won't this continue to keep the value at least high, if not rising?  But by setting the borrowings at $800 million, right there we've locked ourselves in  What does it imply for interest rates? Do they still stay at 14 to 15 percent?  What is 9, 10, or 11?  SPEAKER(?) Billion  We have in the past, at least once, specified a declining level of borrowing over the intermeeting period That would get to your point, Tony, of trying to bring it down gradually over a period of time  How do you decide how to draw it after that?  It's only because we haven't raised the long- run target that we're sitting here figuring out how much we have to make the growth rate decrease in the last six months [of the year] If we raise our long-range targets, we can take this bulge and nobody will question it  I think they'll be more sensitive if we tell them we're not going to do it because then they can figure out how much [money growth] has to go down in the last six months [of the year]  Yes, you mean tolerate [higher] interest rates  All we've ever done when it hits the ceiling is let it go through [Consulting] hasn't triggered any action to keep it below that level  It seems strange to me that you're not lowering it when your objective is to lower interest rates  Yes  Maybe zero?  We've taken all the other specifications of "A" except the borrowing  I'm just questioning whether they are compatible  Wasn't $800 million the target last time?  And it averaged out well over $1 billion, didn't it?  No  Yes, but it determines the path  It would be useful to get some of the attention away from where we actually end up in the final quarter or the final months of the year because making it precisely in those time frames, I think, is a fallacious target  Well, wait Jerry, we're just building up a precedent that we never change the ranges  Yes, but then it seems to me we should go back, say, in August or September and change the range  Yes, but we're still going to run into the end- of-the-year problem with everybody expecting us to try to reduce monetary growth  Yes Nobody knows where our range is for this year, so they're going to try to figure out where it is and we have given them no indication what we're going to do  Yes, but we're not telling them what the tolerance is  But we're really going against the whole thrust of the Humphrey-Hawkins Act, which was in effect "Tell us what it is you're going to do so we can begin to know how to react to it" You know, we may even want to add back in the old phrase "the feel and tone of the market"  In other words, it wouldn't have been noticed if the [Under] Secretary of the Treasury hadn't announced it? Is that correct?  No word at all about the possible overshoot on the long term?  Couldn't we take the position that they haven't completed action yet?  Don't we have a bit of an apples and oranges problem here? They are looking at our December targets, which are for 1982, and [asking whether] those are appropriate to a fiscal policy that is already established for '82 They are really working on the '83 budget and we haven't yet come down finally on what the '83 targets are going to be I think this needs to be straightened out And, again, we need to emphasize the inappropriateness of trying to put '83 targets into place in July of '82 They don't know what we have in mind yet for '83  I know That's right That's why February is a much more appropriate time than July  We don't really know, Frank, until we see what actions they actually are going to take this summer  But there is no final action We don't know what they're going to come out with so we're left literally in limbo as to what next year's fiscal policy is going to be We suspect it's going to be very expansionary; I share that expectation But we don't have anything from Congress at this point on any side on taxes, on appropriations, or anything  Our problem is not the current amount that is going to the federal government It's the fact that it's going to stay that large as we move back into [higher rates of] capacity utilization  -94-    6/30-7/1/82  The estimates OMB is going to release on or about the 15th of July don't come to $1039 billion, I assume Their estimates are closer to ours  So, we're not going to be the only voice in the wilderness that says $1039 billion is a fake--or is optimistic, excuse me  Yes, it is a long time Well, we can always meet on the 22nd of July if we all have to come back to testify   We're always uncertain at this time of the year  Mr Chairman, I'm worried about a different proposition here, and that is If we signal that we're going to lower the money supply next year--and we have never changed our [July] projections made 18 months ahead of time--it seems to me that the market would take that as signalling that we want interest rates to go up and that there is an even greater probability of interest rates going up as the recovery proceeds  You're talking about '82?  The "unusual precautionary demands for money" is what was taken out   What is the annual or monthly flow?  They have some money?  Do we get paid back equally with the BIS? Is that the idea?  Do you want a formal vote?  But the pattern has been continuing, hasn't it, Peter, of very low borrowing until Wednesday and then a very large increase on Wednesday?  Well, but we publish the borrowings, right?  Jim, did you really factor in the sharp drop in rates that has occurred in the last six weeks?  Well, there is a way of handling it, and I think Steve mentioned it And that is to keep our eye on the excess reserves If excess reserves begin to pile up, we could deviate from the path even though [that would mean] not putting all the reserves that we intended into [the banking system] We would operate fairly flexibly to keep the rate either from backing up or from dropping precipitously That's really the key to this, Tony  But we don't want it to drop out of bed either  Well, I would go for alternative A I'm really very reluctant to see rates go back up because I think people need the relief all of us have been talking about I'm basically more concerned about the technical operation of the Desk It seems to me, as I mentioned earlier, that we have to be extremely flexible and look at all of our indicators to make sure that we don't bounce the funds rate down to zero or accidentally bounce it back up to 15 percent So, I would pay much more attention to where the rate is rather than mechanically supplying nonborrowed reserves or trying to hit a target of money supply growth That doesn't mean that I would suggest either increasing or decreasing the band on the federal funds range, but it seems to me our focus should be on that rate Obviously, I would like to have a somewhat lower rate, but I don't want to see rates drop as precipitously as they have in the past six weeks So, a little change in our focus from reserve provision and money supply growth [to a] smooth constant rate on federal funds seems to me more important at the present time  Are you talking about the interest rate range?  We would have gone through it, which we did We went through the range  Or we could take both because I think some of the volatility is going to come, say, from extra borrowing by Continental Illinois or Chase or something of that sort And it would signal to the market that we're going to be there as the lender of last resort  -31-    8/24/82  Wouldn't narrowing the range give some stability to the markets, indicating that we weren't just going to let the rate fluctuate all over the place? I think there's a distinct advantage to doing that  Yes, in October That's true  That's all right  I think they're pretty bad  If our concern is mainly on the upper side and we want to maintain the 5-point range, then it ought to be 5 to 10 percent That signals very clearly that we don't want to go above 10 percent on the funds rate I don't particularly want to go down to 5 percent at this point, but our overwhelming concerns are upward, not downward  Let's make it 4 points   What is your number for the 22nd? Is it up?   We hear rumors through the paper about other problems in South America How much of that can you [verify]?  Steve, how would you actually operate? How would you draw your reserves paths [with a] wider specification?  People could roll it over into another all savers certificate, couldn't they?  And then the all savers certificate disappears completely on December 31st? You can't go into it afterwards?  Will these containment efforts be done in cooperation with the BIS the way Mexico was?  The political implications of that, Henry, in some of these other countries may be much more severe than they are    10/5/82  here Put a country into a situation of restraint in order to correct its external debts and I think there is the potential for political upheaval  Like the Federal Reserve  What are you looking at?  My views are well known, so I can be very [brief] I don't think we can get a recovery with interest rates where they are, and I am very disappointed that they went back up since the last meeting I had hoped that they would go through the 9 to 9-1/2 percent level and maybe go down again Therefore, I would support anything that is going to bring us a generally lower rate structure and bring mortgage rates and other long-term rates down and gin up the economy not only here but worldwide So, I'm in favor of this I don't object to those two last sentences I think they give the directive a very good flavor by saying that we're going to operate in the interest of liquidity in the economy  We go out with an announcement telling the public what happened  That doesn't include those special liquidity needs of particular banks?  Did the $500 million have any special borrowings built into it, Steve?  I would prefer a lower--  That ought to--  Now you have a problem with the last sentence, which says "much lesser"  Say "to a small extent;" take out "much lesser" then  Why don't we be explicit and say, "In light of domestic and international developments, the Committee seeks to maintain"?  I don't mind if we combine the sentences, but I need the "expects that this would involve the growth of M2 and M3" down to 8-1/2 percent  What if M2 went above a 9-1/2 percent growth rate? Does that mean we expect the staff to pull it down?  When we get the new DIDC instrument  I agree with Henry  Just switch one of the clauses  Well, the NOW accounts are--  Why?  Why don't you just take out the words "are continuing to"?  Yes, say "lead to"  Take out that whole thing "in light of the evidence that" and just put "if" That would work  I don't think it really matters whether it's somewhat more rapid  Well, it gives us a little [unintelligible] It puzzles--  But it also gives us the trigger for a conference call, which I think is useful    10/5/82  The understanding could be when the federal funds rate is below 7 percent or above 10 percent We may not have to put it in the directive  It was in there last month  SPEAKER(?) But of course, that's--  They haven't seen it yet, though, Frank  But the Chairman is going to be asked to release some of this when he meets with the Business Council, and I bet somebody asks him what the interest rate--  SPEAKER(?) You wouldn't answer  SPEAKER(?) You won't tell them?  Which is more useful to the Desk?  But on the other hand, it seems to me that we don't want to upset the market totally The main question would be why it isn't in   Second  Second  So moved  Why are you buying? Are you buying for reserve purposes or inventory?  You have a motion that has been seconded  What is the state of the farm economy?  How much of the glimmer of hope you are seeing stems from the drop in interest rates and the anticipation of their going down further?  I wasn't aware that consumer credit interest rates moved with the cycle I thought that automobile and mortgage rates moved with the interest rate cycle, but that everything else was always at usury ceilings  Well, what I would recommend is not new I think we have to get interest rates down to get the economy started Therefore, I'd opt for alternative A I did an interesting thing last week I realized I had never actually looked at the numbers from the early 1930s, so I went back and took a look at them There is no question but that we are not in a situation like the 1930s [Then the economy] just went straight down; in the current situation, it has been going sideways for three years But there is one thing that is very similar to the 1930s and that is the international crisis What    11/16/82  made the depression so extended was that all international credit flows essentially stopped Our interest rates, the lack of recovery in this country, and the high international value of the dollar are creating a situation in the international field that could lead us into something very similar to the 1930s, and I'd be very careful So, not only for domestic reasons but also for international reasons, I think it's imperative that we get our interest rates down and down to a level that will start a recovery In addition, more and more people and more and more members of Congress are pointing the finger at us, saying that the lack of recovery is solely a result of either high nominal or real interest rates If that continues and more blame is heaped on us, the possibility of major institutional changes is looming in the next year I wouldn't change [policy] solely for that reason, but the economic and international outlook are such that we can't afford to stay at these rates Therefore, I would strongly support "A"  Could we achieve that with a 9-1/2 percent federal funds rate?  What federal funds range do you get with the $250 million?  Yes, 6 to 10  We don't want 10-1/2 percent  How much seasonal borrowing do we get on this, Steve--about $50 million?  -41-    11/16/82  And the extended borrowing isn't in that number at all?  But that's not in the--  We could put it at 6 to 10 percent, which would give us a 4-point range  I know it doesn't  But 1/2 point doesn't have to be the end However it develops, we can move the discount rate down to 8-1/2 percent after a 2- or 3-week delay and it's still--  No  It also has the advantage of showing that we were right for a change  This is to reporters, Joe? This doesn't apply, say, if we are talking to the chief economist at a Reserve Bank?  It was just "a source"? It didn't say--  -54-    11/16/82  Mr Chairman, I presume we'll talk about this after lunch, but we could finesse the whole issue by releasing [the directive] right after the meeting, [as I proposed in a recent memorandum to you, which I also sent to all Committee members and other Reserve Bank Presidents]  I don't think that's necessarily so I'd say two things, Paul If we have to have telephone conference meetings or emergency meetings, I don't think we have to announce them The [dates of] FOMC meetings are public knowledge And when we were operating under an interest rate target, the market usually found it out by noon the next day What we had done was not a secret at all  Well, I already have a call from The New York Times  I honestly don't think that [immediate release of our decisions] will do any harm It would solve the problem of leaks And with a group even as large as this one--and the group was cut down from what it was--the idea that we can keep something a secret for seven or six-and-a-half weeks is really a big presumption, it seems to me The way it's working now, if we do have these leaks-- and there will be speculation, considering all the attention that has been given to it--the speculation may finally come down to a consensus of speculation as to what we did or didn't do In effect, we're giving an advantage to the people who have a little inside knowledge instead of making it available to the public generally And I think we're better off, even if we want to change the way we write the directive, if we make it publicly available That doesn't mean that we are frozen into it We can change our mind We don't necessarily have to announce those changes in our mind I think basically the public has a right to as much information as they can [receive] at this point I don't think the leaks are really going to disappear, Paul I think that you're going to get caught as I once did  Well, one gets cornered in an odd way I once got caught--not here--but something got partially leaked and a reporter called me up and said "X happened" And I said "No, it was X+1," and I immediately realized that I'd done the wrong thing If we have this speculation out there, we're going to get these wrong stories And the temptation then becomes very great on people to correct those wrong stories  We announce discount rate changes; we announce changes in reserve requirements because we have to I don't see that this is greatly different from that Under interest rate targeting they found out pretty well where we were I think they have correctly interpreted what we've changed to this time around, with some help  -58-    11/16/82  I have heard  outside the System  I can't foresee that we're going to make any radical change, even as much as 2 or 3 percentage points, at any given meeting Even when we targeted interest rates, I think the most we ever moved [the funds rate] was 1/4 to 1/2 percentage point [Under current procedures] we've been moving it a percentage point in a 400 basis point range We gradually move them up and down; I don't see that we're going to get major market shocks or anything of that sort We did have one major market shock and that occurred when we changed to reserve targeting and a [wide] band on the interest rate target And the market survived; it was shocked but it did survive And then it settled down within the space of about a week So, I don't see that we would be giving away that much information  We always are  There couldn't be much more instability than we have right now  That's right We don't have to take their calls  It would solve the problem though, Jerry, because by Friday it's a non-story  They do it anyway  But this is the second one this year There was a leak between the end of June and the 20th of July on the Humphrey-Hawkins report This is the second time  Well, Pres, we already have computer systems that ring a bell and turn on a red light every time we enter the market in various--  Well, it exists They are not going to get rid of it My question to Peter is Would it make any difference in the operation of the Desk?  Henry, may I say that, given the center stage that monetary policy has moved into in the past 15 years, I doubt that we will ever find the time when pressures are not on us again--when we will be operating in a relatively quiet back-water sort of way   And you're asking for $4 billion?  Will you have the flash tomorrow morning, Jim?  Don't forget, the increase in housing starts is all the seasonal adjustment factor The seasonally unadjusted number is flat And any increase in housing starts that we get from now to March that is seasonally adjusted isn't going to be very many real houses  Boeing must be getting a lot of defense business, aren't they?  They guarantee that rate for how long, Bill?  Steve, with all the nonreserveable components that are already in M2, aren't you going to have a rather major problem trying to estimate what the multipliers are? For any given dollar of reserves we really don't know how much inventory it creates  But then wouldn't you have trouble drawing a reserve path if you weren't quite sure where it is going to go?  I want also to congratulate the staff on a very thoughtful paper I've read and listened very carefully over the past couple of days and, quite frankly, I think we're back to being as close to "the feel and tone of the market" as we've been in thirty years The relationship, I think, is to nominal GNP and its composition, not just to total GNP But we want the right relationship between real growth and inflation As I see it, we basically have three instruments of policy One is reserve requirements, and that line to M1 has become even more muddy; it never was very good because we never fully got through the phasing in of the Monetary Control Act And now we have an instrument that doesn't have [comprehensive] reserve requirements on it The [reserves] link to M2 is very tenuous and it's getting worse It may well be that the multiplier adjustments will become the major instrument in the determination of policy, in terms of actually carrying it out or trying to figure out what we're doing The other instrument we have is the discount rate, which we can move at the recommendation [of a Reserve Bank] And finally, it's the provision of reserves either directly through the open market or through [discount window] borrowings And through this we get to money, credit, and interest rates one way or another We can do it a number of different ways, and we have done it different ways over the years The problem is how to determine the amount of reserves we're going to put into the system Those normal historical relationships that we've been used to have become disconnected We don't have a stable demand for money anymore and we have a history of changing velocity this year Even abstracting from the financial innovation, those relationships aren't very good And if we add the innovation, they get worse As I see it, we used M1 targeting as a means of performing traditional monetary [policy] functions, which was basically to help engineer a recession in order to slow down inflation In fact, what we've done is almost classical We sort of hid behind M1, but that is what we accomplished one way or another  It seems to me that what we need to do now is equally traditional and that is to get interest rates down low enough to get some real growth going in this economy I don't really care what we call it--whether we call it targeting on M1 or whether we have broad interest rate targets or something of that sort I'm perfectly willing to go along and pay lip service to targets if that's going to get us out of this box Fortunately or unfortunately, for at least the next six months, nobody is going to know what to do anyway They won't even know whether we're hitting the targets, given all the money that is moving around out there So, when I thought through my policy goals, at least for the next three months and possibly for the next six months, I concluded that what I want is a federal funds rate in the 6 to 8 percent range and borrowings at the frictional level I leave it to the staff to tell me what rate of growth in M2 will get me those two objectives  -35-    12/20-21/82  It's not a very reliable number; it just gives the general direction  Yes  I'm curious as to how the staff anticipates drawing a reserve path  The meeting is set for February 8th and 9th and the budget comes in on January 31st with the economic report, or probably two days later So, we're going to be fairly constrained at both ends  February 8th and 9th  -54-    12/20-21/82  Until the 20th  How much more depreciation in the dollar are you expecting, Ted?  And that will take the relationship to the mark to approximately what?  What are the resources of the ESF?  So moved  SPEAKER(?) Second  Isn't there also a problem of potential civil disorder in Mexico if they become too austere?  Less so in Argentina?  Well, if we just put in 9-1/2 percent and leave the borrowings there, does this language in alternative one say that if it actually comes in around, say, 11 percent, that we would tolerate it? That's the way I'm reading it  They're not big enough    12/20-21/82  We don't know if it's going to be modest  The next sentence says that  Then the phrase about M3 should come down to the bottom so that all of this obviously applies to [M2]  Under 8-1/2 percent Borrowing of $175 million would take it down toward 8 percent, wouldn't it?  Mr Chairman, I can accept Tony's formulation of this I would guess we ought to go to $175 million [rather than] $200 million, but I don't think it makes a lot of difference I also find myself a little [uneasy], given the length of time until the next meeting and all these uncertainties I'm not necessarily suggesting a full blown FOMC meeting, but I think it would very wise if a couple weeks into January we at least got updated on where we were  I can live with this for three or four weeks subject to a re-evaluation at that time  No, that covers M3  Maybe you should poll for taking it out?   Steve, of the $130 billion you're estimating for January 12th, in dollar terms how much of it came out of non-M2 components?  What does this imply for the operation of the Desk, Steve?  May I ask a question?  I'm just curious whether any of you have noticed any problems in the money market mutual funds as they unwind and disinvest?    1/14/83  Thank you   Do you want to include last week's meeting also?   Isn't your outlook really heavily dependent on the timing of the inventory cycle? If the inventory [liquidation] ceased as of the end of last year, we could get a very large first quarter which could also push the whole year up to a higher level I wonder if you have information from the first quarter that indicates anything on inventories yet?  My point is that when the inventory liquidation quits, at that point we could get a quarter that looks very big but is nothing more than the inventory liquidation ceasing And it could give us a rather nice growth rate even for a year, if we have a couple of fairly jagged up and down quarters as we go through the year rather than a constant growth rate  OPEC gets together    2/8-9/83  It would have to be pretty bad because the stocks are quite large at this point  Going back to the economic forecast, I added up the numbers in our projections and I must say I was quite surprised to find myself on the high side  Yes, I know In part I was surprised because it's usually the other way around Part of it is inventories and, of course, that could hit in any particular quarter or not hit But the other thing that struck me is that we had a considerable increase in fiscal stimulus in the last 3 quarters of 1982 We've gone from a full employment deficit of $8 billion, or 02 percent of GNP, to one of $60 billion in the fourth quarter, or 19 percent It bobs around next year, but it's over one percent all year long And when I did come out high, at the staff's suggestion I went back and reconciled the income side I have higher growth in consumption, which does generate a greater increase in output It doesn't murder the saving rate; you can come up with a fairly good saving rate But the other thing that jumped out at me is that when you calculate personal taxes for calendar year 1983, there's almost no increase We forget that there's a tax cut [in the offing] and it's a big one--to the point that taxes will end up in 1983 within $2 or $3 billion dollars of what they were in 1982 And we're going to get the tax cut in a period of rising incomes; it's not going to come in a period of falling incomes like it did this year--a year in which it disappeared So, I come out on the high side I checked all my numbers and I could shave 1/4 or maybe 1/2 point off my forecast, given all the uncertainties, but it seems to me that we have a lot of things going for us I also assumed that the interest rates would go [down] to 7-1/2 percent, which helps considerably on an economic forecast  I'm close to everybody else, or near the median I think I was at 4-1/2 to 4-3/4 percent on prices But I do get, as a result, a much bigger drop in the unemployment rate It pays off  I think all the rest of us did too  May I ask the staff a technical question? Do we have the same velocity problems with the old M1 that we do with Ml?  I'm just curious  We don't have any influence on those, really  We don't have any control over credit  I agree with Henry for a change and, Governor Partee, I do like the analogy of the fig leaf you cited last time I do think that the monetary aggregates provided a very good political shelter for us to do the things we probably couldn't have done otherwise I don't see that we can move to a very broad aggregate and have any influence on it because I don't know what the relationships are to GNP in these cases and I don't think we have the instruments through reserve management to affect to any marked degree the growth of those very large aggregates So, I can live with monetary targeting for another year But I do have one major plea I agree with all the [comments] about wide ranges and flexibility I'm not so sure we should hopscotch from one to the other, Emmett, but if we have to we might--  I don't know, but I think it'll break down a little  Now, that's my major point here I think we caused a lot of disturbances in the market last year that weren't necessary by not telling people what we were doing It was pretty obvious by midyear, and certainly by fall, that we needed to change the targets We have consistently refused to change targets from the original specification of them 18 months in advance If we had gone ahead and said that due to technical factors and due to liquidity we are going to change the ranges by a certain amount, it would have settled a lot of the uncertainty in the market I think interest rates would have started coming down in March of last year instead of jumping off a cliff in July If we do go this flexible route, I think there is an increased responsibility to be very open about what we're doing and to make it public; it seems to me we should tell people exactly what we're doing or what we're trying to do and why we're trying to do it  What about the velocity of old Ml?  That's the growth of old Ml  What's the velocity of old Ml?    2/8-9/83  No, question  Wait a minute, Steve Let me just see if I [understand] Given the drop in interest rates you would have expected a drop in velocity, if nothing else changed  That's what you're saying a drop in velocity  Tony, I agree with you if one thing is true, and that is if the adjustment is slowing down How fast has it been going the last week, Steve?  Yes  I like the idea I want to get a nice stable base, but if the base is--  What do we do if we get corporate Super NOWs?  We might as well break all of them and be consistent  May I make just one small plea for the other one? The year that we had the shift-adjusted NOW accounts--  To put them all on a February-March basis The year that we had the shift adjustment for NOW accounts, I was almost totally confused as to what our targets were We had shift-adjusted and nonshift-adjusted [figures] There's something to be said for having a common base for all three so that we remember which one we're on if nothing else  Couldn't we develop a technical relationship between the February-March base and a fourth-quarter base?  That's right  That argues for one base  We can always raise the targets  Higher targets  We may have to change it before then  I get the impression--  There is some advantage in making it the same as M2  What do we do with it?  That includes the government?  We know there was an increase during the 1970s As we came out of the '75 recession, the ratio went up to--  Lyle, may I ask what you did? Did you take the $4133 billion in the middle column in the third set of numbers and subtract out $1456 billion for the federal and then on the $4523 billion did you take out $218 billion?  Even more important, the way the sentence is worded is terrible  May I suggest in addition that we change the wording of that sentence? It says "And the associated range of growth for total domestic nonfinancial debt has been established at" It sounds as if we know what we're doing  We think it may be in that general neighborhood  Yes, but I think we should also--  Shouldn't we also add a sentence?  Mr Chairman, I would also like to add a sentence after this  I would like to add a sentence in here that indicates that we have not bought Ben Friedman 110 percent--that we're looking at this as something we would follow rather than use as a strict target  I do On page 2, line 37--  It was the first sentence that I had trouble with  First of all, the word "sustainable" is used twice and I don't know what it means to say "a sustainable pattern of international transactions"  Should we add "hopefully"?  SPEAKER(?) Perhaps  Should the range of bank credit go with this?  Why don't we put "credit flows" as the title?  Do you have a revised M2 for January, Steve?  Mr Chairman, maybe Steve could explain to us how he intends to operate It might help us decide what kind of numbers we put in  I would like to add "unexpected weakness in the economy" because it could be that the January numbers are a fluke I think that's what we're basically aiming at anyway to restart an economic recovery And we need a window to do it with, if it turns out that way  What do you mean by appreciable?  I'm not sure, Lyle, that we even have any numbers  If we take the attitude that we don't want any increased restraint in the period immediately ahead and have interest rates go up, it seems to me that the real decision is on the level of borrowing because we don't know where the growth is going to go or what M2 is going to do Now, whether we want to open that up in the directive, I don't know  But M3 is being affected by the growth rate in M2 also  And if we have an opportunity, we'll ease  So moved  So moved  Second   Agenda item 4a Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations  We're holding these--  Do these limits include the holdings that we have for repaying the Carter bonds?  So, those holdings are in addition to what we hold in    3/28-29/83  Second  Couldn't we also recommend that we decrease our activity in them rather gradually over time?  So moved  SPEAKER(?) Second  Second  Well, the limit on the yen is $1 billion and we have $500 million left  How much interest do we earn on the marks?  How much of other currencies do we hold?  There would still be the $8 billion overall limit  How long will the $500 million last you? It doesn't sound as if it would be a whole year even  You're prepared to support the mark increase, though?  What about the next quarter?  But didn't you say this morning that there were some influences on that final sales number from net exports also?  At this point you have just the month of January on inventories, don't you? So, you really have no feel yet for what February and March are doing on inventory liquidation  The jobs bill that just passed will show up where--in state and local purchases?  And is the new increase in the gas tax devoted exclusively, as in the past, to highway construction?  But between the two of them it's $10 billion  Exports or imports?  What about other South American countries, Ted?  It's cheaper to drill because the interest rates are down?  Currency or checks, Jerry?  -47-    3/28-29/83  Frank, I have a son who works in a gas station They net between $20 and $40 a day because people don't pick up their cash discount  They are charged the credit price and paying cash and [the attendants] have to figure out what the discount is, and people don't wait to get it  I guess I will counterpoint Lyle I think it would be a disaster for interest rates to go up We are at 68-1/2 percent capacity utilization and we have 104 percent unemployment We have just the beginnings--at most three months--of signs of recovery If we abort it, we will have major problems not only in terms of what it will do to the economy because rising interest rates can only force capacity utilization lower and the unemployment rate higher--I think the economic consequences of starting to tighten from that particular position are too severe--but I think the political consequences are even worse If you look at the structure of both our domestic and international institutions, again, rising interest rates could be very difficult to cope with and could only exacerbate problems that are out there I've noticed that we have eleven institutions on extended borrowing That's the highest number that I remember seeing; it may have been higher at other times  Yes, they are all banks We're going to increase the strains in the economy by increasing interest rates And, if anything, I think we ought to be aiming to lower them In fact, I am very much against this If snugging went on--however that term got into the public press--I am opposed to it I think the rates, if anything, should have been drifting lower and not higher over the intermeeting period And [the funds rate] certainly should not have been above the discount rate I also am cautious I want more information We're running on highly seasonally adjusted numbers at this point and sometimes [the final numbers] don't turn out that way I think we do have a backlog in housing and we're probably catching up on it But we could destroy any recovery in housing if the mortgage rate goes up above 13 percent again So, I would be with Emmett I would like to see the [funds] rate come back down to at least 8-1/2 percent and, if anything, fluctuate between 8 and 8-1/2 percent rather than between 8-1/2 and 9 percent The real interest rate is extraordinarily high And I don't think that we can get a sustained recovery, particularly with the high interest rates that we're dealing with at the present time On the other hand, I realize that there is still a booming federal deficit out there And I think there is some movement in Congress to do something about it But if  -52-    3/28-29/83  we give up too soon, they won't do it So, I would like to wait for more information I certainly am opposed to any increase in rates and would like to see them return to where they were at the time of the last meeting I would go for "A" or "B" and I don't think the language makes a lot of difference If I had to be pushed one way or the other, I'd go for alternative I, but I don't think that's what we're operating on, frankly  We had $200 million in the last one, didn't we?  That's what I realized I would much prefer a $175 to $200 million figure in free reserves and then on the basis of that take account of the excess as we're doing it  No, it would be a negative free reserve figure of $175 to $200 million  No, I don't want a negative figure  I take $250 million to be reaffirming an 8-3/4 to 9 percent funds rate and I think that's too tight  Well, I think that $250 million is confirming the snugging It means that we've added 25 and perhaps 50 basis points to the federal funds rate [and it is] above the discount rate now I am opposed to that and I think we should be easing slightly  The wider we can make it, the safer we're going to be  Well, it hasn't been overwhelming  Are you reading from alternative II?  I'm not sure I know where you are on the language  Would you read the first sentence over again?  Regardless of what is going on elsewhere?  I would be in the same position  Well, I would like to focus on the level of interest rates per se I don't want to see them go up And if we focus on $200 million in borrowing, I think there's less chance that we'll have rising short-term interest rates than falling short-term interest rates  Is the economic recovery part within the parentheses?  Okay   I have just one minor question on the [repayment of] the German marks Was that under the debt ceiling?  Tony, how much of that is flowing into Treasury securities?  I would tend to go along with $250 million in borrowings, which presumably would keep the interest rate where it is I have many of the [worries] that have been expressed, particularly in the international scene And I don't think we can get a sustained recovery with 8-1/2 percent rates of interest and 10-1/2 per cent in long-term rates I think rates should be lowered in order to sustain the recovery; I can stay where we are at least until July, but my presumption is that sometime over the next several months we are going to have to lower the rates in order to keep the economy going The other thing that I think is probably going to happen is that with the reduction in the first-quarter GNP we are going to have a quarter-- probably the second or third, as Chuck said--in which the inventories will go in the other direction, and we could get a very strong one- quarter [expansion] If that happens, I hope that we won't panic and then raise the rates in order to offset something which is a perfectly natural development If anything, I would like to see the borrowings around $200 million rather than $250 million  What interest rate are you aiming for? If you snug up, where do you want the rate to go?  That's too much  I thought the $250 million was associated with 8-3/4 percent You're definitely pushing it over 8-3/4 percent, it seems to me  I think you're pushing them up a quarter at a time  I have never seen the short-term rates go up without the long-term rates going up I've heard your argument many times around this table and it has never happened  If we want the long rate down at this point in time, we need to lower the federal funds rate, not increase it  I'll go for that too; it's not saying--  No, we don't want to do that At one point it was $1-1/2 billion  -41-    5/24/83  It still would average out well above where we are now  And what's the rest of it?  What's the first one?  Don't forget they keep revising the GNP down  Well, if they are expected to remain somewhat below their rates, why are we raising interest rates?  Yes  Yes  It's time for me to have--  If you put in the first week of April, the funds rate averages out to exactly 875 percent And if you put in the borrowing--  That's right  Well, where are you going to start our arguing between increase or existing? Isn't that just--  That's right  Slightly marginally?  A more honest way of saying it is when the economy shows some--  That's what we're really talking about; that's right  That is a 1/2 point increase in the funds rate over what we thought we had  But the decision is whether to raise the interest rate or not  That's raising the interest rate  Henry, it was clear last time--  --that we were to go to an 8-3/4 percent interest rate We made that decision 6 weeks ago; now we're going to go to 9 percent  But interest rates went up If the two of them are below and we raise interest rates because they're below, and when one goes up we raise interest rates--  -54-    5/24/83  So we raise the interest rates  Statistically insignificant  I think you contradicted yourself in the last sentence  It sounds as if you're heading for the bottom of the range  In a split, do we have any change from the last policy?  I don't think so; there's only one on the other side  Six [to six] leaves it where it was the last time  That's not what [I'm] against That's not what we're voting for; we're voting to raise the interest rates or not to raise them  That's what you told me last time too   You're not going to take a reported vote on it?   Jim, when does the indexing start?  And how much does that take out of revenue?  Jerry, you have non-oil import prices here What assumption do you have on imported oil prices?  Well, one of the problems is that our huge deficits have always occurred in recessions If they took periods of time in which there were large deficits and high utilization, I think they'd find a different result  A 3-1/4 percent annual average is consistent with the 5-1/2 percent  I came out with almost exactly what the staff did for the calendar year 1983 but I am lower for 1984 because I think the level of interest rates will bite once [unintelligible] accommodated Consequently, I think interest rates will have to go down if we're going to keep [the recovery] going However, I think the most important assumption here on inflation is the constant level of oil prices I think it's a reasonable assumption because of the excess capacity that's available in the world and the conservation that has occurred over these 4 or 5 years If oil prices break loose for whatever reason, then all of our forecasts are going to be wrong And that has been the major source of much of the inflation in the past 10 years So, I can accept the staff's forecast, but I do think there's more of a problem of slower growth in the year 1984 than they are currently forecasting  Steve, if your interest elasticity theory is correct and you have a big exodus from M1 as interest rates rise, doesn't that just transfer the more rapid rate of growth to M2?  That's fine, Henry, if we don't respond to them when they go over the ceiling because if we do, we're going to have to keep the interest rates up  Which range?  We never do, though  Last February was [unintelligible]  What do you propose to do with that credit aggregate if it doesn't fall within the range? What action would that trigger?  MESSRS PARTEE and MORRIS A change in interest rates  I'd put it down to [unintelligible]; suppose it falls at the bottom annually  I don't think you people know what the relationship of the credit aggregate is to GNP, quite frankly  That may be, but I think we know an awful lot more about [the relationship of] interest rates to GNP than we do anything else  I did  If we lower these targets at this point in time, we're going to give the impression that we're going to tighten next year And I'm not sure that that's a good psychological thing to dump on this society at this point  The midpoint of 7 to 10 percent is what they have?  I'd prefer to leave [the top] at 10 percent  You can take the opposite point of view If we leave them alone, it shows we're ignoring them  We haven't had deficits of this size as a long- term trend before  May I ask you a question, [Steve]? I got the impression yesterday when you were talking about the developments in Ml that you don't really expect the rate of growth to slow down very much Rebasing would get us out of this trap, but it's not necessarily going to get us back onto a 4 percent rate of increase from this period on, given the nature of the Ml  So, rebasing would be one way of coping with the 1983 problem as well as the 1984 problem  We may rebase now and have to do it again at the end of the year  We could just not even mention a target for 1984 and see where we are at the end of the year because we may very well have to rebase again then if [Ml growth] doesn't come down And certainly the velocity changes are still going on  That argues, though, for just ignoring Ml-- don't set a target for this year or don't set one for next year  But if we eliminate the ranges temporarily until we have a relationship back, I think that signals the markets that we're not [focusing on Ml] even more strongly--  We change targets  Well, take Tony's [suggestion] and make it 4 to 9 percent and base it on the second quarter  -55-    7/12-13/83  And "B" implies a rise in rates to 9-3/4 percent?  Net free reserves, excluding the one week in the past six when it was positive, would average about $225 million  Yes, net borrowed reserves were about $225 million And I agree with the Chairman that that's what we should focus on--whether we want to increase the net borrowed [assumption] or keep it the same--because the week-to-week changes in the excess and borrowings are really all we have  I thought that was out of there It's the extended that you pushed over  They are not unrelated, Tony  When the borrowing goes sky high so do the excess reserves  There'd be even more pressure on the mortgage rate Last week it was at 133 percent, when we had a--and I quote-- "modest increase" in pressure Apply the same modest increase in pressure and it would get over 14 percent  But, Steve, didn't you say even alternative A implies some increase in restraint?  Why do you feel we need to tighten now over and above what we've already done?  What's wrong with the economy recovering?  You're going to force a change in the discount rate, too  We've already moved  Are you going to show the 7 to 11 percent range [for fed funds]? That is going to come out as a very strong signal that we're raising rates by a whole percentage point and the range by quite a bit  -68-    7/12-13/83  Well, I just find it very difficult to accept any tightening I didn't approve a tightening last time and I just don't think we need any more at this point We haven't had time, as has been pointed out, to get the effect on the mortgage market and the automobile industry of what we have done already And the economy, which has had only two quarters of recovery, doesn't strike me as one that needs a lot of restraint And it's also one which is fairly typical We typically get a quarter like this We should get some recovery before we start tightening again; we should let it get back to something close to normal I'd go for alternative A and keep the free reserves minus the special factors like the seasonal in a range of maybe $200 to $250 million dollars net borrowed  Identified?  You're talking 4th quarter over 4th quarter?  -70-    7/12-13/83  About even  A lot depends on the testimony  We only intended it to go to 9 percent last time  Yes, but suppose it goes up to 9-3/4 percent Then you'll come back next time and argue that we're just validating what the market has already done  It has been in there for quite some time; if we take it out, it's going to cause comment  That assumes borrowing and [unintelligible]?  We are dealing with a very different aggregate And this whole discussion is [based] on the assumption that it is still the way it was for 20 years It's a new aggregate It's going to behave very differently And we ought to give ourselves plenty of room to let it operate and find out what it does  And the question is whether we want to rebase or not  5 to 9  Listen, you lost that argument  It has been worked into the text in the past  It's not set in; that's correct  6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent--  Take out the bracketed sentence?  You can't  Did you take out Tony's change?  No, it's too restrictive for '83  What's wrong with just leaving it 5 to 9 percent for the whole period?  I think we'd get unfortunate announcement effects just by showing that we're going to tighten up again  Down 1/2 point That leaves--  Except Ml, which is down by--  Come on! It goes down a whole point  I move we accept both reports and ratify the transactions  What is the political situation in Brazil? Is it like Chile? You know, Chile blew up last night Is Brazil in that sort of situation?  There was a big riot in Chile last night  Isn't the Brazilian guarantee the one that involves  -94-    7/12-13/83 -95-  SPEAKER(?) No   I didn't realize we didn't have the authority to intervene in the Far East  Tony, what do you consider a major intervention? This totaled $37 billion over those few weeks  But the total intervention was just over $37 billion That looks big to me and just not on the proper scale  So moved  Mr Chairman, I have a different forecast, which I've had since February I did have growth of 8-3/4 percent for one quarter, but I think interest rates at these levels will calm down the economy, bringing it to the levels we had previous to the last run-up during the fall And my real [GNP] forecast for next year is at the bottom of the FOMC [members' range] I think [GNP growth] will probably slow down to below 4 percent, fourth quarter-over-fourth quarter, which will both reduce the inflation rate and increase unemployment next year We don't have a stable relationship on velocity It may return Until it does, it seems to me that what is more important is the level of rates and what that does to economic performance So, I'm anticipating a much slower recovery, with all the consequences that go with that slower rate of growth  I think there was a great deal of pent up demand, particularly in the housing and automobile areas, that came out in the early parts of the recovery As that pent up demand is met and as the rate [increases are felt]--obviously, [housing] is very sensitive to a mortgage rate somewhere between 12-1/2 and 14 percent-- we also are going to run out of people who qualify for mortgages at this level or even at 12-1/2 percent as we move further into the recovery So, I think that we will see a moderation in housing demand and that automobile demand probably will moderate also GM, as you know, raised its prices about 2 percent today Well, 2 percent, given the level they're starting from, makes the real cost of owning an  -13-    8/23/83  automobile very high and rising And I think people are responding to that in a very economic way  Well, it means that more people who could qualify have been wiped out already  No, for the second quarter  Yes It was obvious what the inventories were going to do  Yes, what's this excess?  Including long-term rates  -19-    8/23/83  Well, they've been running $650 million in the last two weeks on the chart  No, the net borrowing ran about $650 million   I want to go back to Frank Morris' question because I think we are beginning to see some evidence of crowding out and I think we see it in interest rates The table on page 5 of the [Greenbook] supplement shows that the federal funds rate has gone up 56 basis points since its recent low in May, and the longer-term Treasury securities--the 3-year, 10-year, and 30-year Treasuries--have gone up 2 to 3 times the change in the short-term rates Then we see the decline of 37 basis points in the fed funds rate since the last  -13-    10/4/83  FOMC meeting and almost no decline at all in the rates on longer-term securities So, I think we're seeing the crowding out in terms of the increase in long-term rates And those longer-term rates may be crucial to getting the type of recovery that the staff forecasts That hits housing and it hits capital goods And it may be that that's what will show up as the crowding out You also remember that in the July/August refunding the Treasury had quite a bit of trouble selling longer-term issues, and the rates had to go up in order [for the market] to digest those issues So, I think we're seeing a new form [of crowding out]--one that hasn't been recognized before  Mr Chairman, I'd just like to make a comment on the international value of the dollar I was rather startled yesterday to learn that the forecast has a 15 percent depreciation in the value of the dollar and that depreciation only stabilizes the deficit  What do you mean by "substantially," Tony, 30 percent?  That's right The best thing we can do for them is lower the interest rates  How much longer does that have to run?  Didn't a judge down there overturn one of the restructurings?  But he hasn't signed the letter?  Seventy  Seventy times  Axilrod? But we haven't--  We average them  No, he didn't  But can we use the words "decrease slightly"? If we got to $650 million, we would be down almost $300 million in the borrowing average for the month  Well, I happen to be depressed about the international situation; I think it has gotten increasingly fragile in the past couple of months And the best thing we can do for them is to get lower interest rates If we have the opportunity to lower them, I think we should do it So, I would probe downward as much as possible and be reluctant to raise the rates  Well, it depends on velocity  -33-    10/4/83  Yes, that's the record  The month averages out as $450 million  But take the monthly nets It was +10 in May; -200 in June; -370 in July; -609 in August; and about -450 in September  Well, the net borrowed on a monthly basis reflects what we've done, if you average out the weeks  Well, we've mentioned enough different things in that length of time  Yes, that explains it  We were so accurate on the MMDAs!  What's the date?  What did you want to discuss in more depth?   What level of interest rates and changes, then, are required to get to the particular path of real GNP?  So the implication is rising interest rates in the short term in order to produce a decreased rate of real growth and price stability  Is the message you are trying to deliver here that the credible disinflationary policy is basically a long period of very high real interest rates and high unemployment? Is that the only way we can obtain low or close to zero inflation?  But in this projection, on chart 18 you don't have tremendous increases in corporate profits and, therefore, you don't have the upward pressure on wages  No, but if we had the scenario in which--  And as a result, that's part of the mechanism by which you get a lowering of the inflation rate in there  Shouldn't the natural rate be coming down over the decade of the '80s?  But that doesn't work That's not what this says It says the faster the economy grows, the more inflation you're going to get As nice as it would be to cap the inflation, we don't have any way to do it except by slow growth  Yes  -22-    11/14-15/83  But the most important thing in reducing the real natural rate of unemployment is the shifting demographics  Yes, but just the demographics are going to reduce the rate of growth in the labor force  Is that an average figure? Is it that it can't be over $4 billion on average?  I was wondering because that doesn't include the repurchase agreements  So, the big operations--whether the Treasury balance is running out or not--are not the subject of this  The price of silver has gone down  May I ask a question? Have they been able to keep the regional and smaller banks on these loans to the debtors?  You have assumed that interest rates are going to stay where they are now, is that right?  One of your contingencies is not rising interest rates?  Yes  There was a steel strike  Mr Chairman, I just want to bring up one thing that I don't think has been touched on, except in the early discussion this morning I'm not sure we have an awful lot of room to do very much because of the foreign international debt situation  In a tightening direction, that's correct I happen to agree with [the view] that this is a typical recovery at this point; if anything, it's a little stronger than even I predicted a year ago But I don't see any great need to move it down because it's going along at a very nice clip, though perhaps a little too fast I don't see that we have any upward mobility at this point, at least until we have some of these things a little more firmly set in the international area And I think it would be extremely dangerous to make a major move of any sort at this point  John, I think there was one cost of our monetarist experiment that tends to be overlooked, which was the extraordinary economic cost of the volatility of the rates The volatility of short-term rates is not all that serious, but when it was transmitted totally and completely into long-term rates it helped to destroy the long-term market I think not only the level of the rates but the volatility of the rates was just economically unacceptable And if we do consider going back to Ml, I think we ought to keep in mind that it has a very high cost in other areas  I thought I did at the beginning I'm very much for just staying where we are and not moving one way or the other But I'm a little curious What do you expect to know in a month that we don't know now? We will have one more unemployment rate and we will have the flash on the fourth-quarter GNP, which is not a very good number  And we won't have Christmas sales So, I'm not sure that we're going to have that much more information in another month Now, if we go into February, we'll have a firmer number on the GNP and another two or three months of unemployment data and hopefully good information on the international side Those seem to me the things necessary for making a decision  How about May of 1983?  We can reverse it  How about "continued"?  Reversing the clauses  Call a meeting  Shouldn't we put 7-1/2 percent?  "Or somewhat more" It's 7-1/2 percent  I think 5 to 6 percent gives a little more information to the market  They include Treasury borrowing   As you well know, I objected to CRR all the way along and I associate myself with reservations about Ml as a major target in policy and about its relevance to GNP But I'm more concerned that if we go to any degree of automaticity, we're going to get increasing volatility in the interest rates Can you give us some estimates, Steve? If we go to 10, 20, 25, or 50 percent automaticity, what degree of volatility will we reintroduce into the interest rate structure?  Per 100 of what?  Well, what are you referring to as "noise"? I was interpreting that as being volatility in the interest rates  Well, I think one of the great costs of the period from '79 to '82 was the high volatility of rates--not only the short-term rates but the long-term rates What I'm really concerned about is that I simply don't want to get back into a situation in which that sort of volatility reoccurs  But the more automaticity we build into the system, the greater the volatility is going to be  But one of the things that was most damaging was that the short-term volatility got translated into the long-term market  Unless we offset it  Well, that argues even more strongly against any large degree of automaticity If our current data are highly volatile, we don't quite know where we are  But is your assessment of the situation that growth would be lower than the staff projection?  Well, as I listen to the discussion around the table, I come to the conclusion that how 1984 turns out is right smack in our laps, [given] the sensitivity of the economy to interest rates --the current levels and changes in interest rates If they begin moving upward and if that gets translated to the mortgage markets, we may as well shut that one down So, our decisions about where interest rates should be and their movements during the year are going to be the crucial factor in determining whether we achieve this forecast or not I agree with Chuck that this forecast would be the ideal outcome And if we could achieve it, we could say that we actually were conducting monetary policy in a way that created a situation [that maximized the prospects] of a return to relatively full employment But I do emphasize that I think the economy is now so sensitive to interest rates--particularly starting from the level that they are--that a move of 100 basis points would completely turn around the forecast in practically every sector There is also built into the forecast a 10 percent decline in the international value of the dollar, which does have direct price implications for next year also So, the whole combination of this, I think, turns on the decisions that are made by the FOMC over the next three months  Jim, a technical question about this large increase in profits we are talking about and the increase in the share and the probable effects that this could have on wage demands over the course of the year If corporations end up with higher profits, doesn't that take some of the pressure off price increases also?  Well, I agree with [Governor Martin] Let me take the 1985 issue First of all, I really don't think we can forecast As I look back over the past 5 years, we've missed turning points and almost everything that has happened--well, not everything that has happened because I think that we have to forecast and the staff has done a good job But to lock ourselves into something that is as far off as two years, with all the variety that can go on, I think is a mistake This year we have changed targets and we've accommodated to changes in the economy as they have occurred, as changes in the various aggregates have come along, and as our forecast has changed I must say that from my point of view the markets responded [well] to what was a very reasonable shift in policy We've kept them informed about what we were doing And rigidly setting targets, particularly out two years, when we have a changing economy doesn't make much sense to me at all If you remember the exercises of 4 or 5 years ago when we ran the econometric model [to evaluate] probabilities, we found that we are pretty good at forecasting the next quarter or the next two quarters We begin to lose that and become less certain three quarters out and even more uncertain four quarters out; and by the time we get to a year-and-a-half or two years out, the econometric models give us almost random numbers We might as well do what the Administration does for their 5-year projections, which is to take an annual rate of growth, just string it out, and put in a hopeful inflation number, because those forecasts for 2, 3, 4, and 5 years out don't have any reality to them So, to lock ourselves in now to something for 1985 doesn't make any sense I think we can talk about it We can talk a great deal about the fiscal policy problem and what that implies for monetary policy, but I don't think we have to lock ourselves in  As for the 1984 targets, [many of] you seem to assume that we're going to be all right in 1984 I think there are a lot of hazards out there We still don't know what Ml is doing I think we need a wide range on it; I'm not terribly satisfied with 4 to 8 percent, but I certainly wouldn't lower it and I wouldn't narrow it As for M3, that aggregate always grows at a rate close to 9-1/2 percent, so it is ridiculous to try to do something else with it It seems to me that we might as well face the reality and put those numbers up to 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent and know that it's going to be at the top of the range and may be a bit over it I think we have troubles ahead I hope that they will be met with as much flexibility and as much openness as we've done this past year I would stay with these targets but raise the M3 numbers  I might also add that the Europeans have the attitude that the dollar is going to drop sharply at some point They are as much confused as we are as to why it hasn't dropped [already] But their real concern is that they perceive that [drop] as a sharp appreciation of the D-mark They are very upset about the implications of a sharply appreciating D-mark in the European Monetary System because there is no way to foretell what the relationships of the other currencies to an appreciated D-mark would be  I have one other question about intervention What makes you decide when to intervene? What is the trigger? Is it a certain degree of movement in the rates, or what, that triggers this?  I move that we ratify the transactions  So moved  SPEAKER(?) Second  -54-    12/19-20/83  It's not a very good number  Well, the end of the year is going to place some upward pressure in the market area anyway, isn't it?  I think we need a period of continuous stability My perception of the economy is that, yes, it has recovered in the typical fashion, but the recovery could be very easily upset with rising interest rates I think we can afford to wait to see what is going on I would add to my concerns that any upward movement in the interest rate is going to make the exchange rate worse I agree with Tony that the more it goes up the harder it's going to fall--it's going to be rather precipitous--and that that would increase our problems of adjustment during 1984 So, I would simply take alternative B, the $650 million on borrowing, and the 6 to 10 percent funds rate range; I'd keep a fairly moderate stance at this point and let the year-end pressure do its thing but then come back out of it in the 9-1/2 percent range [on fed funds] And we can readjust; the [next] meeting is not that far away I would also point out to you that if we tighten now, the policy record from this meeting will be released probably on the day that the Chairman testifies  And the first Friday in January we get the unemployment rate That's about it, isn't it?  Ranges have never been confining  Ml still goes after M2 and M3, doesn't it?  I think that's right  And leave out the lesser restraint  January 30, 31 and February 1  The problem would be--   Second  Ted, I'm a little surprised in your foreign projection that the continued very moderate growth of the industrial countries doesn't do anything for them on prices Is there some reason that they get very little impact on prices?  I would agree pretty much with Lyle and Tony, and with some exceptions with Henry and Chuck We really should give ourselves--as has been said many times--as much flexibility as possible One of my reasons is that I think the international scene is not going to be like any of the alternative [scenarios] that have been presented And we will need everything we can have in order to cope with that because I don't think we know what is going to happen out there and what the interrelationships are going to be I would disagree with Chuck and Henry in that I don't think M1 should be elevated at all I think M1 is an indication that we have found the wrong interest rates I feel very strongly that the relationship with monetary policy to gross national product is through the interest rates and not through the Ms and that any change in the rate of growth of the Ms is an indication that we found the wrong interest rate There are other indications that we found the wrong interest rate as well whether inflation is going too fast, or business fixed investment is going through the roof, or inventories are out of whack, or a lot of other things So, I tend to look through the Ms to what is going on in the world out there rather than at the rate of growth I do not discount them entirely but I give them a fairly low [weight] as they are only one of many indicators of what is happening I would state that we need to keep [an approach] where we can change interest rates when we think it's necessary I don't want to go back to pinpointing them I would follow the procedures that we have used in the last year, moving them gradually in response to changes in economic developments  Given that background, I come down for alternative II I think that we want to continue the recovery We need to figure out as we move into the year what the appropriate rates are to do that without choking it off And this seems to me to give us a lot of flexibility Also, I would adopt the attitude that if it goes wrong, I'm willing to change the ranges I just don't think the ranges are all that important that they should restrict us as a corset would to some dictate of policy  If you had to pick an alternative, which would it be, Frank?  If you go back to the fourth quarter, M1 growth was 10 percent  I have a preference for whole numbers If we just knock off the halves on the M2 range, it looks like we're not being quite so precise That's much better than saying we're going to get to a half point--  Or maybe "improve"  Well, we can say "to improve international debt"  Well, we often do  SPEAKER(?) It's not bad at these levels  Do you propose just to leave that whole sentence out?  If we get 9 percent nominal GNP, that puts the rate at 2-1/2 percent  Instead of saying "likely" and really meaning that it might be less, why don't we say it might be different because we don't know where it's going to go?  Why don't we say "Its relationship to gross national product may be different than in past periods of expansion" That gets away from the technicalities of velocity; it says what we're really talking about  I know, but if we just say "different" it is not leaving us open to whether it is going to be less or greater  Tuesday  That's a considerable change in the [Congressional] committee's procedures; usually they want to have it released at the time that the committee meeting is held  House It's the Senate's turn but I think it's the House first  We've already said that  Are you building additional excess reserves into the reserve paths?  There is a built-in increase, a trend  Well, if the world turns out the way the staff has projected, it is pretty obvious what policy should be I don't think we are going to get this smooth, even, deceleration of the rate of growth We're going to get a good quarter and a bad quarter and a good quarter and a bad quarter And if we don't look through that, we're going to make mistakes We have to take into account the average of where we think we're going, and the trend seems to be that the economy is calming down So, it seems to me that we should wait and see whether that has really happened or not before we tighten up  Which draft are you working from?  You're going to add that reference to CRR Is that it?  I object to that We didn't put M1 back into the primary position again  I don't think so either I think we should have an M2, M3 sentence and then an M1 sentence And I would put it back in a monitoring range because that's where it still is as far as I'm concerned  Doesn't the "respectively" go before the Ml?  If we do that, in the phrase "significant shortfall" do we want to take out the "significant"?  Why don't we move the phrase "in the context of the business expansion and inflationary pressures" to the front of the sentence? Then it will modify both  -64-    1/30-31/84  If we are going to take Chuck's suggestion, we could say "both viewed in the context of economic and inflationary developments"  Yes, because we're not going to adjust policy on the basis of the aggregates, I hope They have been much too erratic to base a decision on them [just] because they're going up or down relative to the rest of the world  Well, not spoken here is the point that we have to keep an eye on what is happening on the international scene too  You've been putting in around $400 million, haven't you?  Didn't we have a pattern of very low borrowing until Wednesday and then borrowing shot up the last day?  It may move up when we get into settlement   Second  Second  I'd like to raise an issue that was not addressed, which is the continuation of an existing policy, and that is providing the Greenbook to the Secretary of the Treasury and four or five other people at the Treasury, the Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, and the Director of OMB We have never been able to trace the leaks, but it seems to me that there is a potential there for leaks coming from outside of the System regardless of how much we tighten our own procedures  Well, there seems to be a lot of access at the Treasury and we don't have any idea what their security provisions are for these documents  I would restrict them from the Greenbook because in the past we have had some distinct and fairly specific leaks of the contents of the Greenbook  I simply wanted to raise the issue It was something that has never been changed and is a potential [for leaks] that we can't control  Certainly, in my own mind this latest leak came from the Hill And we have a continuing problem of maintaining security if we release confidential material to someone outside of the System  The most likely occasion would be when the first vice president would sit in for the president in a conference call And that has been very rare  It goes in the afternoon, right? It [can't] come out Thursday night  Bankers acceptances  Are you typically offered more of these than you accept?  If we stop using it for repurchase agreements, could we drop that distinction between eligible and ineligible now?  Did we announce it when we withdrew from that?  Are we going to have an announcement?  But Lyle, if we do that, then it is not being limited to Fauntroy and his staff It becomes almost a public document and not an FOMC document  Just looking at the current Greenbook, I think the very first sentences of Part II would have to be totally  -22-    3/26-27/84  rewritten That reads "The pace of activity picked up vigorously early this year Housing activity surged, auto purchases and other retail sales rose strongly, and industrial production advanced rapidly in both January and February" There's no question about where the Federal Reserve staff views the first quarter as a result of that Practically every one of those adjectives would disappear  That goes to Chuck's point about communication  In these renegotiations, Tony, are the rates being offered these countries a spread over LIBOR or prime and then the rate moves as those rates move? Is that the way they transmit the change in rates in the United States?  Do they have to put up reserves?  Peter, do you anticipate a situation like we had in September when we had all that money just pouring into our--  Do you expect the total balance to go up into the $30 to $40 billion area?  And there's no indication on the part of the Treasury to cut back on their borrowing to compensate?  I second    3/26-27/84  We didn't ratify the foreign currency ones, did we?  Are these brokered deposits?  The most recent housing starts figures showed a very large increase in multifamilies in the Southern and Southwestern areas And you seem to have an increase in commercial building also  What is your vacancy rate?  Are there vacancies in the residential area or are the sales of new houses--?  You don't have the same evidence of excess capacity in the residential sector?  In answer to your question In the second year of the recovery from the mid-1970s recession, the quarterly pattern was a boom and bust pattern, essentially It averaged out to a good year I haven't looked to see whether they have revised that particular pattern out, but there was a good quarter followed by a bad quarter followed by a good quarter and it was [primarily] in the automobile sector of the economy  Well, I would like to point out one thing that is remarkably different in this expansion We don't have any pressure  -63-    3/26-27/84  on oil prices During the 1970s we always had upward pressure on oil prices and the threat of very large increases in prices, and in my mind that takes a great deal of the inflationary pressures out of the situation As regards the aggregates versus interest rates Having sat here, I don't believe in the aggregates except in a very broad sense as an indicator that is as good as some of the others that are around But to run monetary policy with highly volatile interest rates in order to obtain a rate of growth in the money supply which we don't really control directly seems to me really bad So, I come to the conclusion that what is important is the interest rate That doesn't mean that it's an interest rate on fed funds which we say is 10 to 10-1/2 percent and it comes in at 10-1/4 percent I think some variation in that interest rate is good I think we also can follow the market with it I have a great deal of sympathy for Tony's and Roger's point of view that what we decide today is not independent of the discount rate I don't want to get [unintelligible] because I have to vote on both of those decisions I want to come out with a policy that somehow puts those two together If we vote as a Committee to go for alternative B and then as a Board to raise the discount rate, we're going to end up with 11 percent on the fed funds rate On the other hand, if the Board decides to raise the discount rate, then we get trapped If we raise the fed funds rate to 10-1/2 percent, the staff may come back and say the fed funds rate is 10-1/2 percent and as a result the borrowings are going to be a billion and half dollars because [banks] are going to utilize the discount [window]; we may then have to raise the discount rate to keep the borrowings at a certain point There is a certain amount of circularity going on here We have raised interest rates already; the [funds rate] average of the last two weeks is 1036 percent I think it was probably the proper move I would go with a fed funds rate of about 10-1/2 percent  Well, we didn't resist it  I am assuming that we are going to raise the discount rate to 10 percent if we decide on alternative B  It's at 9-1/2 percent isn't it?  SPEAKER(?) 8-1/2 percent  Raise it to 9 percent  If we raise the discount rate by a half percentage point, then it seems to me that the specifications should be the federal funds rate at 10-1/2 percent and the borrowings at $800 million If we raise the discount rate, we want to offset the impact of that to some extent because if we don't we're going to get 11 percent on the fed funds rate If we don't raise the discount rate, then it seems to me that we can go with "B" and have borrowings of $1  -64-    3/26-27/84  billion and have the fed funds rate fluctuating in the neighborhood of 10-1/2 percent But I don't think one can disconnect those two decisions at this point  If you don't trust M1, why are you putting it up front?  No, it didn't It's the same as variant II on page 13  I don't think I spoke to it, but I--  I didn't speak to it, but I would accept an 11 percent ceiling  Keep the 4 points  I would not go along with 8 to 12  Do you want a show of hands?  What sort of velocity assumption are you making, Jerry? That's vital here to what you think the GNP is going to be  But if you rigidly take these numbers, you begin to get all sorts of volatility in interest rates It's not worth the price  Just as a point of information Have we ever hit a target?  Have we ever hit a target on a short-term basis?  Yes  What role do we see excess reserves playing? Are they precautionary? Or are they an accident because of CRR?  Well, excess reserves ever since October of 1979 have been trending upward and I interpret that as security against erratic Federal Reserve behavior  On the other hand, with some exceptions, I don't think there's strong sentiment to ratchet the rate rapidly  Let me see if I can restate it, Roger The "B" specification with the $600 million excess reserves, in my mind, has a federal funds rate that fluctuates between 10 and 11 percent And if it were persistently at 11 percent, you would adjust to bring it down If it were persistently at 10 percent or below, you would adjust to bring it up  But I don't want to see it go above 11 percent and stay there  You are proposing alternative B with the fed funds rate range of 7 to 11 percent?  There has never been any press comment when we have exceeded the ceilings, at least as I [recall]  At 11 percent  We haven't done anything today, but the rates have gone up 3/4 of a point in the past two weeks  Alternatively, we can take out the specifications for M1, M2, and M3  "Emerged" is the problem  Well, no Actually, it has been fluctuating between plus and minus $200 million; it averages out to 0  I know  In a net borrowed reserve sense it is going up  We were legislatively instructed not only to watch the aggregates but interest rates, real growth, inflation, and unemployment And the sentiment on the Hill is toward managing the real economy, not the monetary aggregates, at the present time I agree with Tony If we go back to emphasis on M1 and put it up front and at the beginning of the road, we could create very unstable conditions in the economy And interest rates will be transferred into the economy  It's going to be above 6-1/2 too, if it's 10  -99-    3/26-27/84  If you do it backwards--  Aren't you just encouraging that after-hours trading?  If you want to make it absolutely symmetrical take out the word "significant"  -103-    3/26-27/84  It's already symmetrical the way it is
