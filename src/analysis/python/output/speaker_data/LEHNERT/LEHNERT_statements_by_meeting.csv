8118,2005-06-29," As Josh noted, everyone’s talking about house prices; but  they also seem to be talking a great deal about mortgages  The popular consensus  appears to be that homebuyers, especially in hot housing markets, now make token  down payments and can just scrape into their homes by resorting to interest-only  mortgages; in this view, borrowers and lenders alike are vulnerable to any fall in  house prices  In my prepared remarks I will address each of these issues   An obvious measure of the vulnerability of a borrower to a decline in his house  price is the ratio of the current mortgage balance to the current value of his home;  this ratio is known as the current loan-to-value, or LTV, ratio  The top panel of your  first exhibit compares the distribution of the estimated current LTV as of September  2003 (the black bars) with the distribution as of March 2005 (the red bars)   As shown by the leftmost red bar, 64 percent of borrowers currently have LTVs  below 70 percent  Moving to the right, a further 18 percent currently have LTVs  between 70 and 79 percent; 14 percent have LTVs between 80 and 89 percent; and  only 4 percent have LTVs of 90 percent and above  Moreover, the recent rapid  appreciation in house prices has actually outstripped mortgage debt growth, so that  the average LTV has fallen over the past 18 months                                       June 29-30, 2005 8 of 234  The middle left panel uses the same data to concentrate on the most leveraged  borrowers  For a given drop in nominal house prices (the horizontal axis), the  vertical axis gives the percent of borrowers who would have negative equity  As  before, the black line reflects data from September 2003 while the red line reflects  the most recent data  As shown by the red line, following a house-price drop of 10  percent, an estimated 4 percent of borrowers would have negative equity, while a  drop of 20 percent would leave about 18 percent of borrowers in negative territory   The middle right panel summarizes average LTVs at origination for homes  purchased in 2004, by state, relative to price appreciation in that state over the  previous four years  States with lower-than-average appreciation, such as Utah,  Texas, and Oklahoma, are at the left, while states with faster-than-average  appreciation, such as California, Massachusetts, and New York are at the right  As  shown, LTV at origination in 2004 was actually lower in states with more  appreciation Thus, homebuyers in California and other high-appreciation states  made larger down payments relative to the price of their house than homebuyers in  low-appreciation states such as Oklahoma     Increasing home equity, mainly driven by rising house prices, has supported  mortgage credit quality in recent quarters  The bottom left panel plots delinquency  rates for loans held on banks’ books (the black line) as well as for the broader MBA  [Mortgage Bankers Association] measure (the red line)  Both have fallen  significantly in recent years   The bottom right panel summarizes the vulnerability of borrowers to house- price shocks  The average LTV on mortgages has declined over the past 18 months,  and most households currently have substantial equity in their homes  In the past  few years, borrowers have benefited from rapidly rising house prices, which have  kept mortgage delinquencies at extremely low levels  However, an estimated 4  percent of borrowers are highly leveraged and could lose all of their home equity if  house prices were to fall 10 percent   As I noted earlier, recent anecdotal reports have highlighted a second potential  risk lurking within mortgage markets—the sudden popularity of interest-only  mortgages  These are the subject of your next exhibit   The statistics presented in exhibit 2 are taken exclusively from data on private- label—that is, non-GSE [government-sponsored enterprise]—residential mortgage- backed securities, or RMBS, pools  The overwhelming advantages of these pools  for my purposes are that they are very transparent; that is, a great deal of information  is available on the underlying mortgages and that they contain many heterodox  mortgages, including interest-only mortgages  Many of the recent press articles  citing the growth of novel mortgages are based on RMBS pool data and thus,  because such mortgages are overrepresented in RMBS pools, have exaggerated, in  my view, the role of heterodox mortgages                                                   June 29-30, 2005 9 of 234  Turning to the data, line 1 of the top left panel shows that the dollar value of  RMBS pools has nearly doubled over the past two years  Moreover, as shown in  line 2, RMBS pools backed by interest-only, or IO, mortgages have increased almost  sixfold, and now amount to nearly $300 billion  However, total home mortgage  debt, line 3, has also increased over the past two years  As shown in the memo line,  interest-only RMBS pools now account for 36 percent of all home mortgage debt,  up from less than 1 percent two years ago, but still a small share of all mortgages   As their name implies, interest-only mortgages do not require the borrower to  make principal payments, at least during an initial period  Borrowers willing to use  IO mortgages could qualify for a larger mortgage and thus be able to buy a more  expensive house The top right panel gives some idea of the relationship between  price appreciation and the popularity of IO mortgages  The vertical axis shows the  fraction of IO mortgages used to purchase houses, by state, in 2004  Again, I should  emphasize that the IO shares are calculated within the RMBS world, and so are  probably overstated  The horizontal axis gives state-level house-price appreciation  from 1999 through 2003  As you can see, IO mortgages are somewhat more popular  in states that saw more appreciation, although, as seen in the inset box, the  correlation is not particularly strong   While the principal value of an IO loan doesn’t decline, if the initial down  payment is large enough, the borrower may have a substantial equity cushion against  price shocks  The middle panel reports the LTV at origination for IO loans made  over the past three years  As shown, most IO mortgages had LTVs below 80  percent, although the trend over time has been away from the very lowest LTVs   That said, lenders have continued to make relatively few IO loans with LTVs above  80 percent  Those higher LTV loans now account for about 15 percent of all  outstanding IOs   Finally, anecdotes often emphasize that IO loans are extended to borrowers  with lower credit quality The bottom panel shows the distribution of credit quality,  measured by FICO scores, among IO borrowers  As a rough approximation, most  lenders define prime quality borrowers as those with FICO scores of 660 or above  The leftmost set of bars thus represents subprime borrowers  As shown, between 8  and 10 percent of IO loans have been extended to these borrowers  Moving to the  right, the next two sets of bars show that the great majority of IO borrowers had  solid credit scores between 660 and 779  As shown by the rightmost set of bars,  about 10 percent of IO borrowers had credit scores above 780  On the whole,  therefore, the credit quality of borrowers using interest-only loans does not appear  particularly risky   One might wonder if financial institutions and investors have, in the face of the  continuing housing boom, dropped their defenses against the mortgage losses that  would accompany a house-price bust  The top left panel of your next exhibit lists  the main institutions exposed to residential mortgage credit risk and the main types  of mortgages held by these institutions  The housing GSEs, line 1, almost                                                                    June 29-30, 2005 10 of 234  exclusively hold or guarantee conforming mortgages with fixed rates  Private  mortgage insurers, line 2, insure the component of mortgage principal that exceeds  80 percent of the property’s value and so are effectively exposed to the credit risk  associated with high-LTV loans  RMBS pools (line 3), as well as banks and thrifts  (line 4), hold a wide variety of different mortgage types, including traditional fixed- rate mortgages as well as variable-rate and junior liens   The top right panel emphasizes that the housing GSEs hold very little credit  risk As shown on line 1, the average LTV at origination of GSE-guaranteed  mortgages was 70 percent; based on regional house-price appreciation, the estimated  current LTV of these mortgages (line 2) has fallen to 57 percent  The average credit  score of the underlying borrowers (line 3) is also solidly in the “prime” category   Obviously, these average values mask some variation in the borrower population,  which no doubt contains some higher-risk borrowers  However, as shown on line 4,  19 percent of the mortgages guaranteed by the GSEs carry some form of credit  enhancement  If one of these mortgages defaults, the GSE receives a payment from  the insurer, usually a private mortgage insurance, or PMI, company   The middle left panel examines the health of the PMI industry  As shown by  the black line (left axis), the ratio of total insured mortgages to capital, the risk- capital ratio, has declined steadily over the past 10 years, indicating that PMI  companies have historically high capital on hand relative to the risks they insure   The red line (right axis) shows net underwriting income—that is, income from  premiums less losses and expenses, relative to capital  After suffering large losses in  the late 1980s, PMI companies have consistently recorded positive underwriting  income In sum, PMI companies appear to have built up a historically large cushion  to absorb the losses that might be associated with a widespread drop in real estate  values   The middle right panel analyzes the risks posed to investors in RMBS pools  These pools contain some of the riskier outstanding mortgages  However, they are  structured so that investors can choose their risk exposure  Further, RMBS pools are  exceptionally transparent, so investors have extensive information on each mortgage  in the pool  In principle, investors should have understood, and appropriately priced,  the risks inherent in these mortgages  In practice, however, investors price these  mortgages using loss models, which are estimated using relatively little data from  major house-price declines   The bottom two panels discuss the exposure of the 8,900 banks and thrifts in  the United States to residential mortgage credit risk  The panel to the left divides  institutions into quartiles by the fraction of their portfolios accounted for by  residential mortgage assets, defined as whole loans, home equity lines of credit, non- GSE RMBS pools, and residual tranches on securitized mortgages  As shown, for  institutions in the bottom quartile, mortgages account for less than 5 percent of total  assets  This fraction rises by quartile until, for institutions at the top, mortgages                                                    June 29-30, 2005 11 of 234  account for more than 40 percent of assets  Residential mortgage credit risk is more  concentrated at these institutions than at the institutions in the lower quartiles   The panel to the right shows the average size and capital-to-asset ratio of  institutions in each of the quartiles  Reading down the first column, which gives  average institution size, one can see that smaller institutions are concentrated in the  first two quartiles, which have relatively little mortgage exposure  Reading down  the second column, which gives average tier 1 capital ratios, institutions in all  quartiles are extremely well capitalized  Thus, institutions with large amounts of  mortgage credit risk on their portfolios are well positioned to handle severe losses   To sum up, neither borrowers nor lenders appear particularly shaky  Indeed,  the evidence points in the opposite direction borrowers have large equity cushions,  interest-only mortgages are not an especially sinister development, and financial  institutions are quite healthy  Nonetheless, even the most sanguine analyst quails  when contemplating a historically unprecedented drop in nationwide nominal house  prices  Such a drop will obviously hurt both borrowers and lenders and will also no  doubt expose weaknesses that will only be obvious in hindsight  Thus, perhaps it  would be best simply to venture the judgment that the national mortgage system  might bend, but will likely not break, in the face of a large drop in house prices   That concludes my prepared remarks    An interest-only mortgage can be purchased by a GSE if it’s below the   conforming loan limit    At the moment only Freddie Mac, I believe, has a pilot program to buy   these, and it’s very small    Not yet     Not that I don’t have an opinion  [Laughter]     Yes  The data that you see on my first exhibit in principle include second   liens, closed-end second liens  And in particular in the graph that you cite I use the newly available   2004 data from HMDA which for the first time has collected data on whether or not the HMDA   loan is a junior or a first lien  So the picture that you see there should reflect the growth of   piggyback loans    Not in the United States  I don’t know what country or planet—   [laughter]                                       June 29-30, 2005 40 of 234   I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have said that  Do you mean the flow or the stock?    Then I beg your pardon  Of course, the stock differences are enormous    As for the flow difference, on net, GSE guaranteed mortgages in both pools and to a small extent on   the balance sheet hardly grew at all in 2004, while it was an explosive year for growth for the   RMBS sector    Okay, let me try to answer that question  I can’t really comment on the   hype mentality or the mortgage broker who uses a high pressure sales tactic  But in 2004, for   example, I believe that, of the ARMs that were originated, less than 10 percent were traditional   ARMs with a one-year reset period  The remaining 90 percent were hybrids that had a rate lock   feature where the borrower is protected from interest rate movements for some period of time  The                                           June 29-30, 2005 60 of 234  data on this are a little difficult to get, but it looks as if the median rate lock period was five years  If   we think about people’s typical tenure in houses, five years isn’t a bad guess for how long people   are going to stay in a particular house  A 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is, in effect, a hybrid   mortgage that resets the day you move  So, I think of this to some degree as a financial innovation,   and one that people are learning about through advertising or the press or whatever  And I believe   this type of hybrid ARM probably makes sense for a lot of people who are making a decision on a   mortgage loan   The other point that I’d make is that the fraction of originations that are ARMs often can   overstate the role of ARMs in the total mortgage market, because people refinance out of ARMs   into fixed-rate mortgages frequently  In fact, I’ve read in the Wall Street newsletters that some   people seem to believe that the current rate of refinancing is elevated by this flow out of ARMs into   fixed-rate loans    Right    Well, as you say, the rates are going to reset, and households will make   decisions about whether to refinance to a different point on the yield curve  Or people can decide to   move  I don’t think there’s going to be a catastrophe on the average reset date that—                                                    June 29-30, 2005 61 of 234   Obviously, if rates went up sharply, that could be a problem    Not any recent studies that I’m aware of  We proposed doing a study   jointly with a private data vendor company on precisely this topic but it didn’t really go anywhere    The question is whether foreclosure clusters can have a pernicious kind of spillover effect  I would   say that lenders and loan servicers aren’t unaware of this problem  In my conversations with them,   they’ve all said that their loss mitigation programs involve holding down the inventory of foreclosed   properties that are on the market  They do not want to let them turn into this sort of “pocket of   blight”—that is the term they used—as a result of the foreclosure process  That’s all the   reassurance I can offer you                                        June 29-30, 2005 62 of 234 "
