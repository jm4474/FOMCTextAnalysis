  Thank you, Mr Chairman, and thank you to everyone around the table  I   think Governor Kroszner and I share the view that people have been incredibly kind and supportive   in teaching us the ways of this institution in the past weeks  So we certainly appreciate that  I know   I do  The only advice that I was given last night that I will not take is that they say that Governors at   their first meeting should sing their opening remarks  [Laughter]  I thought it was a joke, but I guess   that we’ll test it here  [Laughter]    Allow me to offer just a few perspectives consistent, I think, with a lot of the discussion   yesterday and maybe some particular focus on business investment  As was discussed, the   economy appears to be stronger, but as I think about the economy today versus over the last several   periods, what strikes me is how much more well balanced it is than it was over recent periods  The   equity markets, the credit markets, and certainly the anecdotal information that I’ve gleaned in my   several weeks here and before, all tend to confirm that view  And although there are meaningful   risks to the economy, my own view is that there is a greater upside potential for growth than   expressed in the Greenbook   A few notes about the consumer before I spend the balance of my time on business   investment  First, the consumer appears to be strong, as we discussed yesterday  And my own   sense is that, while there may well be softening in the residential market, staggered repricing of   adjustable-rate mortgages and perhaps potential sales of a very novel, new housing product—the   thirty-year fixed-rate mortgage—[laughter] may simplify things, particularly if the shape of the   curve keeps its current trajectory  Second, I would expect there to be, as I think the Greenbook   referenced, accelerating household income growth and perhaps new job creation more robust even   than was described in the Greenbook, particularly if some of the productivity gains that we have   seen over the past several years tend to moderate   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 86 of 167       Let me spend a few more moments now on the business capital expenditure side  My own   view is that the strength of business capital expenditure in property, plant, and equipment may well   surprise to the upside  I think what we saw earlier in this recovery, both anecdotally as well as in   the data, was a growth in cap-ex by a lot of the small and medium-sized businesses  And as one   CEO said to me a couple of weeks ago, big company CEOs have now gotten that memo    Opportunities to drive profit margins through productivity improvements appear to be diminishing   somewhat, and so there appears to be a tendency, a greater willingness, to go back to the well and to   get cap-ex back up to speed  Two obvious indicia of greater cap-ex—which we’ve seen for some   time and that would have suggested to many of us, including me, that business cap-ex would have   ramped up sooner—are, of course, the strong corporate profits and these corporate balance sheets   that are in remarkable shape    What I would like to spend a little time on is, well, what is new?  What is going to make   cap-ex grow over 2006 above and beyond the projections to this point?  And so, as I talk about two   other catalysts, I would suggest that they are not really reflected in the data yet  But my own sense   is that we should see them or at least there is a greater probability of seeing them in the balance of   the year  Of course, current regulatory and enforcement issues are still consuming significant CEO   time and significant director and officer time, and that does tend to cast a rather deep shadow over   these cap-ex budgets  What we are going to find in this proxy season is an occupation or   preoccupation, both in the business press and in some boardrooms, with the ongoing fight over   majority election of directors  There will be fights in boardrooms, fights by institutional   shareholders, and a whole range of op-ed pieces about how these directors get put on boards and   whether the system should be reformed  Obviously, the current environment and the fight over   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 87 of 167       shareholder democracy still tend to cast a bit of a shadow  So I guess the question really is, what’s   different now?   I would note two catalysts  One is CEO confidence  I think Governor Bies yesterday   referred to this in a couple of the surveys  CEO confidence—that look in their eyes, their view of   the animal spirits—appears to be back in stronger measure than I at least have heard in some time    What then happens when CEOs go into the boardroom, as I think most of my colleagues around the   table know, is that they tend to generate some excitement by directors themselves  Directors are   really starting, in some regard, to go back to basics  One CEO said to me about a week ago, “Being   a board member is starting to be fun again,” and that is not something this particular CEO, who is   on a lot of large-cap boards, would have said a year ago  I don’t think he was referring to the days   of going to the golf course in the middle of the board meeting  What he meant by the board’s being   fun again is that board members are focused on where the company should be going  How should   they be growing their business?  Should they be more vested on the mergers and acquisition side?    Should they be more focused on capital expenditures?  And so from that CEO and from many   others, we are hearing far fewer complaints about Sarbanes–Oxley  It does not mean that the   complaints are not there, but my sense is that most of these companies have now been able, at least,   to put a box around their compliance burdens  They have been able to check that box, go through   their 404 controls once or twice, and though they still do not like it, the burden is no longer   consuming their minds when they come to the boardroom   I think what we are going to see in the balance of 2006 are board members coming back to   boards as “strategic advisers,” with a somewhat diminished role for board members as “compliance   officers”  And that is a good thing with respect to cap-ex because the more they are focused on their   businesses, the more they are focused on helping companies grow  I think that such focus is   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 88 of 167       probably incrementally quite positive to a decision about investing the next billion dollars in   property, plant, and equipment  So looking outward, I sense that companies are seeing bigger and   bolder opportunities, and that situation is a necessary precursor to understanding whether or not   these cap-ex numbers increase   The second catalyst that I note may be a touch more controversial—how outsiders are   looking at companies  I guess the way I would say it is not that the barbarians are back at the gates   but that they are gathering  When you look at the private equity world, the leveraged buyout world,   and the emerging hedge fund world, the “outsiders” are now looking at each other in a series of   alliances and are starting to look with a keener eye toward corporate America  They probably have   seen the excess cash and, frankly, the conservatism of boardrooms and the conservatism of   companies borne in the past five years and are willing to “think the unthinkable” and take greater   advantage of that opportunity   I think Governor Olson made reference to the IPO market, which is really telling us many of   the same things—whether a company that is public has, all of a sudden, a new interest in going   private or an IPO candidate is saying, “Really, what is in it for me?  Why should I enter the capital   markets?  Might we make better use of our time and attention by staying private, by growing cash   flow that way?”  Another reason that the IPO market is not as robust as perhaps it would have been   in previous periods like this relates to research  You have to be a very big and very bold company   to be getting large, bulge-bracket firms writing equity research and explaining your company to a   greater pool of shareholders  For an IPO candidate or even for a public company that has been   around awhile with a few billion dollar market cap, getting that kind of research and that sort of   investor base is much harder to do than it was in the years before Sarbanes–Oxley   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 89 of 167       Another item I have considered is merger and acquisition backlogs  The backlogs that are   on file by the largest investment banks and merger advisers are bigger now than they have been in   the past six years and maybe even before that  The difference in the backlogs this time versus in   previous years, I think, is how much is really private equity  It looks as though, in broad numbers,   about a quarter to a third are private equity investors, LBO investors that are looking at companies   that, because of size or background, they would frankly not have spent as much time looking at in   years past  You have a range of LBO players that are now back, and they are now describing   themselves as shareholder activists and corporate governance experts  But twenty years ago they   were there, and they were focused much as they are now on shareholder value   So both the signs—from companies that are internally evaluating their own boardroom   dynamics and from investment companies that are looking to come to the gates and to take a couple   of these companies private—remind us that companies have a perspective about their own cash that   is either use it or lose it  And it would not surprise me to find some very large “blue chip”   companies that feel either under attack or on the precipice of being attacked tending to be bolder in   their capital expenditure budgets   What’s likely to happen in the capital markets should that all come to pass?  One thing that   may happen, and may be a first casualty, in the investment-grade capital market is that some very   large-cap “blue chip” companies with exceptional investment-grade ratings will all of a sudden find   that they are in play by some LBO buyers and private equity participants  As you all well know,   generally in the investment-grade market there has not been much of a change-of-control premium   in investment-grade credit, unlike in the high-yield market  But should a couple of large   transactions occur either here in the United States or in Europe, where a double-A credit one day   ends up looking more like a high-yield credit the next, we might find that investment-grade   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 90 of 167       investors are asking for a greater premium in those markets  I think all of this is a possibility as we   think about ’06 and ’07—not a promise but a real possibility that we should continue to keep a keen   eye on and evaluate  As that dynamic goes forward, we will have an early signal telling us whether   the cap-ex numbers will come in larger than expected   Finally, with respect to inflation, I would add to some of the comments that the Vice   Chairman made yesterday by noting that long-term inflation expectations as calculated in the TIPS   markets, while contained, are higher than ideal  And the market expectations of potentially higher   commodity prices and other material inputs might also cause further pressure on inflation  As we as   a Committee approach our last step or our penultimate step in possibly moving rates, the markets   will be more and more focused on our own vigilance with respect to those inflation expectations    With that, I have finished     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I, too, support the 25 basis point increase in the   federal funds rate and would just like to make a couple of points about the market and market   expectations   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 135 of 167       It does strike me as a particularly inopportune time to miss market expectations  Given the   changes in the economy that we have discussed over the last day and a half, particularly a slowdown   in housing, potentially some growth in the business side, increased expectations of growth overseas,   and, to be candid, the changes here at the Federal Reserve, it strikes me that we should be taking   incremental steps both in terms of message changes and in terms of the sorts of statements we have    So this would be, I think, a very successful meeting if everyone yawned at the statement and the   market reactions were somewhat boring this afternoon and tomorrow   An issue was raised about whether we’re leading the market or the market is leading us  It   strikes me that the markets—and I particularly have in mind traders down on the floor—are looking   to us because I think they’re also confused, and so they don’t know where else to look  This is sort   of a safe place for them to cast their eyes and sharpen their pencils  I hope, over the course of the   May and June meetings, that they, like us, will be seeing other data points that will give them a   clearer crystal ball and that they will be looking both to us and to some other data points to inform   their thinking  But right now, I think their sense of things is fairly cloudy  So with that, we have a   particularly large burden of presumption in figuring out whether we make changes to what was   done in January   A final point on markets and the ownership of the statement, Mr Chairman, which you   referenced earlier  The typical trader in these markets doesn’t fully appreciate what we’re voting on   and the entirety of this statement, and my own view is that’s a little more than would be ideal to be   aired in the public forum  For traders to be reading one paragraph and saying, “Oh, that’s Chairman   Bernanke,” and to be reading the other paragraphs and saying, “Well, that’s the consensus of the   Committee,” strikes me as inviting into their debate a little too much interpretation beyond the data   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 136 of 167       set  So I think our discussion going forward in terms of who owns what would probably best be   carried out in the same close confidence that previous discussions here were   Finally, in keeping with the suggestion that I think President Poole made about our making   as few changes as possible to the January statement at present, the only wordsmithing I would offer   in alternative B is the first two words of section 3 “as yet”  I’m trying to show as much congruence   as possible with the January statement, and so when I see key words like “still” in alternative B, I   think that’s roughly equivalent to “nevertheless”  But “as yet” really is borrowed in some ways   from alternative C, which suggests to me almost an inevitability  That is, we expect inflation to be   coming  “As yet” we don’t see it, but it is almost inevitable  And it strikes me that the “as yet”   words are potentially market-moving words and that they will perhaps suggest more vigilance   regarding inflation, more concern about inflation expectations than we had only a couple of months   ago  So the minor suggestion might be to strike the words “as yet” and continue with alternative B   as written before us, and that in either regard I firmly support      Thank you, Mr Chairman  I hesitate to joke here at my second FOMC  I made a   joke at my first that the inaugural meeting requires the new Governors to sing, and my colleague took me   up on that  [Laughter]  So I will not offer a joke about dancing this time  [Laughter]  In the interest of time    [Laughter]   Going to the central tendency in terms of where the economy is, I suppose I consider myself much   more optimistic than the Greenbook forecast about the state of the economy  I think some of the shocks to   the economy, energy prices being the latest, speak in some ways to the durability, the flexibility, and the   resilience of this economy which, on the one hand, I shake my head about but, on the other hand, I think we   have to believe to some degree   I will not go into too many of the facts, which have already been described, but consumption was up   5½ percent in the first quarter  Business capital expenditures were up about 16½ percent on an annualized   basis, with strong durable goods orders  And the increase in tax receipts that Governor Olson spoke about   is a very good leading indicator, even though some of the details behind that increase are hard to know   President Poole referenced the growth in corporate profits  Let me add a couple of notes on that    What we are really seeing in the equity capital markets is, by and large, profitability-driven growth in the   S&P and in the Dow as opposed to some sort of P/E multiple expansion  It does give some of us more   May 10, 2006 65 of 120    confidence in the strength that we are seeing in the equity capital markets as well as another source of   optimism as to what some of the income-statement benefits might be to consumers   As we think about what might be the elephants in the markets, certainly the housing market is one   from FOMC meetings that preceded my time here  The new elephants in the market in terms of tone and   tenor are inflation and inflation expectations  I would like to talk about them more in just a moment   When we look at the data since our last meeting, though there is a lot of noise, on balance I share   the view that they tend to be more positive than expectations  Average nonfarm payroll growth in the past   six months was almost 200,000, including the April figure, and the idea of less-robust labor markets   appears belied by the solid gains that we have seen in hours worked, the acceleration in wages, and the low   unemployment rate, which is still at 47 percent  So our thinking about a possible slowdown in the second   half of the year has to at least be balanced or perhaps partly counterbalanced by what could be the first   meaningful gains in take-home pay for nonsupervisory workers  Understanding those income-statement   benefits to real consumers is probably a more certain exercise at this point than trying to figure out the   effect on the consumer of the housing markets, which Governor Bies spoke about   On the business front, I am at least as optimistic as I was six weeks ago about the state of business   investment  CEOs, when they have seen the appreciation of share prices in the last quarter, even as they   have seen prices appreciate for many of their competitors, remain more robust, more excited, and, I think,   more eager to spend money   We have seen an increase in the backlog in debt underwriting by most of the big bulge-bracket   firms, and so though some of that money is, no doubt, being spent on stock repurchases, some debt is being   raised in expectation of merger and acquisition activity  At least part of it is based on a view that, as there is   more uncertainty priced in the markets for the second half, companies are getting their ducks in a row to   obtain some extra liquidity   May 10, 2006 66 of 120    Let me make one final point before briefly talking about inflation  I am encouraged, like the rest of   you, about the synchronized global growth that we are talking about  My biggest concern, particularly in   May of an election year, is about what is likely to be a bipartisan foray into creeping protectionism in the   dialogue of politicians here in Washington between now and the November elections  The position   discussions about free trade that we have heard on both sides of the aisle over the past several years are, I   think, going to diminish very significantly  There could also be many more discussions in highly contested   congressional election districts about the need to isolate the US markets, to cut ourselves off from a lot of   foreign opportunities  To be candid, the business community probably isn’t that eager to enter this debate   with a message oriented toward free trade  So I do think that creeping protectionism may become stronger   between now and November and will have consequences for our economy to integrate with foreign markets   and to continue to expand  We may have more difficulty fighting back in some of the export markets, even   with some depreciation of the dollar  The Federal Reserve has a possible role in trying to moderate some of   that discussion   Finally, just a moment on inflation  I guess the way I would characterize it from a market   perspective, and I think this is consistent with Dino’s and the Vice Chairman’s comments, is that market   expectations of inflation are more fragile than they were some months ago  I would not describe myself as   an alarmist about that  However, the traders at many of the securities firms and the folks who are hitting the   trading buttons are contemporaries of mine  They are from a generation that has not experienced inflation   at first hand the way that some folks around this table have  The psychological point of that statement is   that, though we may have seen some laxity in their concern about inflation over the preceding six months   and even today, that laxity could turn into some irrationality if inflation expectations get above our   reasonable expectations and our comfort level  On balance, I think that the markets, particularly those   marginal traders, are looking for some leadership from the Federal Reserve  Perhaps we have seen   May 10, 2006 67 of 120    somewhat less market discipline in the TIPS markets and in some of the other markets, such as   commodities  Other folks have spoken more eloquently than I about what is happening in the TIPS markets   and some of the dangerous signs in the surveys, so I will only offer two final notes   First, on the energy market side and on the commodity side, it is harder and harder to describe the   run-up in prices as solely or even predominantly demand driven  When I think about the new retail   products that are now finding their way to typical broker–dealer relationships at retail-oriented chains, I see   a massive surge of inflows into new silver-oriented mutual funds and copper-oriented exchange-traded   funds  A lot of that speculative money is coming very late into these markets, and that situation should   suggest to us that some folks, rightly or wrongly, are assigning some sort of inflation hedge to that product,   with retail investors, as usual, being the last to get in on it   Finally, on the energy front, I have been thinking about the difference between where we are now   and where we might be several months from now  I was encouraged by the same-store sales numbers that   we saw in April, even in March and April together  Those numbers are very encouraging, but as we get   into the summer driving season, the energy prices may be seen as persistent  The market may take a view   that the higher prices are more permanent than most consumers believe now, and I think that’s probably an   extra reason for our caution on the inflation front  So on balance, Mr Chairman, I am quite optimistic   about the strength of the economy but at least as leery about the expectations for inflation going forward     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support alternative B and would like to echo Governor   Kroszner with respect to the reference to inflation expectations remaining contained  In light of where the   market’s expectations are, for better or for worse going into today and June, the omission of that language   would be a very loud omission  I think that alternative likely would not be expected or generate the kind of   balanced reaction that we are trying to achieve  The other emphasis that we have in section 4 addresses   what I think is the balance of the discussion that we had today  I also like in alternative B the reference to   the current state of the economy in the first line of part 2, where we say that it has been quite strong so far   this year  This wording provides some credibility to some of the data that the markets are perhaps not as   focused on as they should be     So on balance, I do support alternative B as written and would make only a couple of points  As we   approach our last move, or potentially our last move, with respect to this tightening cycle, it does strike me   that the burden of persuasion, if not the burden of proof, rests with us to change course  I do not think that   there is any evidence to this point that we ought to stop or even suggest to the market that a pause is in some   way imminent  We have all largely agreed that the risks of policy error here have increased, and that is why   a lot of consistency between the alternative B language and our March FOMC language is perfectly   appropriate   As the Vice Chairman referenced in the earlier round, we are trying to express to the markets our   view of uncertainty so that they do not take what we say as a guarantee of future results but look at the data   in real time as we look at the data rather than look directly just at us  The balance that has been struck in   section 4 does that very well  Should we get to a pause at some point over the course of the next several   meetings, it needs to be preceded by vigilance, which I do see reflected in section 4  I would conclude only   that it is better to leave interest rate expectations higher at this moment until we see some real signs of   inflation falling more into that zone of comfort, which President Yellen and others referenced  Thank you   May 10, 2006 97 of 120       Thank you, Mr Chairman  In terms of my overall comments, I consider   my views really in the center of gravity, as the Vice Chairman described it, of the speakers   around the table and probably, again, quite a bit more optimistic in terms of GDP growth and   perhaps also more concerned about inflation risks than the Greenbook    When I look at the strength of the fundamentals of the economy, including strong and   accelerating profits, low unemployment, highly accessible capital markets, and remarkably   strong balance sheets both for consumers and businesses, I find it hard to reconcile those with   some of the pessimism coming not just from the Greenbook but also from some economists that   the markets follow  The two trends and the two sets of data seem to be going in very different   directions     Regarding the data that have come in since our last FOMC meeting, some time has been   spent here on a few of the negative surprises, so I want to highlight a few of the positive bits of   news  Federal tax receipts in May were up 26 percent from May a year ago  For the past twelve   June 28-29, 2006 81 of 177    months, as we’ve talked about before, total tax receipts into the government went up   129 percent  Core retail sales rose 04 percent in May, up about 69 percent year over year if we   exclude some of the more volatile items  According to surveys and anecdotes, the manufacturing   base continues to be remarkably robust, both in terms of growth and in terms of jobs  I’d also   note that durable goods orders, though not incredibly robust over the past month, represent   growth of about 10 percent over the past three months if we exclude aircraft and look only at   nondefense capital goods  So all in all, I think that the data suggest a more positive trend     What I’d like to do is spend a little time talking about how the markets have reacted to   this news and build on a couple of the points that Dino made at the outset  First, a lot of pundits   have described the “new volatility” in the marketplace, and I think that Dino made a very   compelling case that the volatility has really not been nearly as severe as the commentators   suggest  Volatility has in some ways been a euphemism for the fact that the markets have been   down, and those are obviously quite different things  [Laughter]    I think another bit of conventional wisdom is influencing decisionmakers, both in   Washington and in business, and it is probably important to correct  That idea is that somehow   the Fed has been the cause of this market volatility  I think that is largely incorrect  When I look   at what has happened, I think that the markets are focused more and more on core economic   fundamentals  We have changed in the perspective of the markets, which used to think some   months and quarters ago that bad news meant good news and now they think that bad news is   actually bad news  The bad news previously meant that we weren’t going to be moving rates   higher  Again, I think the markets, not the commentators, have a better understanding that they   really need to be focusing on economic fundamentals   June 28-29, 2006 82 of 177     When I look at the economic fundamentals, one of the data points that I look to is the   state of corporate profit growth at this point in the cycle  Over the past twelve months, it was   136 percent, and if we look at bottom-up analyst forward estimates for the S&P 500 or for the   Russell, it appears that those analyst estimates are actually accelerating  As a former banker, I   will admit to some bias in these numbers, but they’ve been tracking reasonably well  The   forward estimates are that corporate profits should be up something like 16 percent  So one of   the things that we can do over the next several meetings is see how actual results track against   those expectations, and my bet is that there will not be as much disappointment in those numbers   as the top-down macroeconomic views would suggest    Diving down into some of the individual markets, I suggest that they’re telling us   different things about the state of the economy and the state of inflation prospects  First, the   equity markets have been off on the order of 7 or 8 percent, and many people, myself included,   would have thought that that would have significantly affected CEO confidence, that it would   have changed some perspectives about where they are in the capital expenditure cycle  I think   that probably has happened in the IPO market  The IPO market has gotten slower and more   selective, and issues that can come to market now have been at the top end of what’s in the   pipeline  If we look more broadly, however, beyond what’s going on in the equity markets, if we   look at the cap-ex market, capital expenditures appear to be above plan generally from the   discussions I’ve had with folks who are on boards of different companies    One CEO called before coming out with a survey of CEO expectations for growth in   capital expenditures, and he exclaimed, “What are you guys seeing that we’re not?”  In some   way he was checking to try to understand what the reason was for concern when his company   surveys continue to be quite positive  The only caution I have is that, if you look across a   June 28-29, 2006 83 of 177    breadth of CEO surveys on growth, the survey numbers have, in fact, come down from, let’s say,   April to June  But, again, my sense of the matter is that CEOs are scratching their own heads at   this very moment that we’re having a discussion about the economy in transition  The messages   that come from the Fed and from other policymakers over the next month, including in the   Chairman’s monetary policy testimony, will be very important to set the tone, because CEOs are   not sure whether to continue to hit the accelerator or whether this might be a time in their own   businesses for a pause in capital expenditures    I have a few comments on a couple of other markets  Normally in a time like this, when   the equity markets are off 7, 8, or 9 percent, the merger and acquisition markets, which I view as   a pretty good proxy for CEO confidence, would stop  In fact, that hasn’t happened  M&A   pipelines are more robust than ever  The unthinkable deals are being printed and being   published  Pipelines are terrifically strong, and CEOs are ready in some ways to “bet the   company” on the strength of their convictions—another reason that I have confidence that   business growth could well be in excess of the Greenbook estimates    Let me make two or three other comments  First, in terms of inflation, as I look at the   commodity markets and at the TIPS markets, I’m most comforted not so much by relative   moves, because those TIPS markets are certainly not perfect in describing inflation expectations,   but by the responsiveness of those markets to remarks that have come from folks around this   table  That is, if we think about what our authority is in influencing inflation expectations, the   very real-time changes in the TIPS markets give me comfort that at this point in the cycle we will   be able, with proper and appropriate policies that we’ll discuss tomorrow, to change those   inflation expectations rather dramatically  So I think that’s a reasonably comforting idea   June 28-29, 2006 84 of 177     Finally, the fixed-income markets and high-yield markets certainly have moved higher in   terms of spreads but, again, not a lot by historical perspectives  Under normal market conditions   or more-pessimistic market conditions than we have now, that move, even a small relative move,   would have slowed down those pipelines  Instead, liquidity is plentiful  A couple of anecdotes   that we heard before describe the situation  25 or 30 basis points in the high-yield markets are   not changing activity  They’re not changing the interest of investment banks and issuers in   coming to market as quickly as they can  So in terms of market functioning, apart from price,   those markets are working exceptionally well    What would be a reason for pessimism, and what would be a reason to think that the   volatility that has been discussed over the past several weeks might turn into real volatility?  One   thing that I look to with some degree of concern is the prices that are being paid and the leverage   that’s being put on companies that could change the liquidity in those markets very quickly  I   wouldn’t be surprised to find—over the forecast period for sure and maybe even over 2006—a   “club” deal in which many private equity partners group together in a highly leveraged situation   to buy a very large public company and take it private and, after the course of due diligence and   of that acquisition, the deal closes and they find that they missed the first coupon  That is, the   leverage that is being put on these companies, for all the reasons we have discussed around this   table, is relatively remarkable  Those leverage ratios used to sound like purchase prices, and   they’re expecting meaningful cost savings that can come out of these businesses six and nine   months out  I suppose I’m concerned that, as these deals come together, there might be a   negative surprise that affects the company so that the first coupon would be impossible or   difficult to meet  In that circumstance, all the optimism that I’ve described in terms of these debt   markets could dissipate rather markedly  So I don’t want to suggest a degree of optimism that   June 28-29, 2006 85 of 177    isn’t borne out by the facts  That’s something we need to continue to stay attuned to  Thank   you, Mr Chairman       Thank you, Mr Chairman  Let me support the move of 25 basis points on   the merits  I don’t feel as though I’m constrained by market expectations for this meeting; rather,   on the merits, I think that’s the right thing to do   June 28-29, 2006 126 of 177    Before getting into a discussion of the language, maybe I can give a couple of perspectives,   Mr Chairman, on the markets themselves  My sense of things is that a bit of a herd mentality   remains in the markets in that they have been waiting for our every utterance and, in some ways,   they have been guided by us for a very, very long time  The discussion we’re having today is really   the tough one because we recognize that we need to wean the markets from the degree of certainty   that we no longer possess  I think this discussion is really quite healthy in doing so  In light of that   perspective, I think that alternative B strikes the right balance  Without trying to wordsmith the   statement at this point, I think that, although I share Vince’s view that ultimately the markets will   get to a probability for August that is more balanced, it will take some time  That is, I think the   markets’ first reaction to alternative B and to the various versions that we’re talking about will have   some “stickiness” to the view that they have now  They will believe that we have stopped giving   them guidance, that we’ve gotten out of that business, and that we are somehow culpable for that    We have led them to the river, and now we are telling them that what they do is really their decision   after all  My own view is that this shift is a very, very good thing; but it is not going to be without   some pain, and I think swipes will be made at us  The Chairman’s monetary policy testimony will   perhaps represent just a little bit of that   But a dispersion of market views as to what we should be doing, what the state of the   economy is, and what the prospects are for inflation is a very healthy thing  We will be introducing   some volatility into the markets, probably in a more meaningful way than they may have seen, but   on balance I think such a shift is all to the good   With that backdrop—that these markets are not focused on nuance—and the recognition that   the discussion we’re having is about nuance, let me say a few things in support of alternative B    First, in the rationale section, where we say that inflation expectations remain contained, I think the   June 28-29, 2006 127 of 177    markets will take a couple of shots at us and say, “Boy, you said they were contained previously    You say they’re contained now  What was all that that we heard in between?”  The way that I get   comfortable with the statement that inflations expectations are contained is that some of the   movements in the markets, in the inflation surveys, in the TIPS markets, and in the commodities   markets show they have been responsive to our views  I also feel that we can honestly describe   them as being contained, but the container may be bigger than we had said it was before    [Laughter]  I guess I’m not troubled by that  If we introduced language such as “unwelcome,” the   markets would take it as a reprise of the Chairman’s remarks from a few weeks ago and would take   the view that we were anticipating that they move up the fed funds futures markets for August  I   think that view would be very problematic in light of what I hear is the central tendency of people’s   views here—that we want that bet to be fairer, closer to 50-50, and I fear that our historical use of   “unwelcome” would go against what we’re collectively trying to accomplish   Let me make another comment, about the assessment of risk where we say, “The Committee   judges that some inflation risks remain”  I think that people in the markets are going to focus on the   word “some”  “Some” in recent meetings has meant some further policy firming—that is, more   than one move; “some” was a strong word  In this context, after some time and understanding,   which will not be at 216 or 230 or even today or tomorrow, they’re going to recognize that “some”   actually weakens the statement somewhat  Saying “some inflation risks remain” rather than “the   Committee judges inflation risks remain” will, on balance, modestly lower the fed funds futures for   August and beyond and will more likely bring us back to a point where we will have a fair fight   come our August decision  I think that taking out “some” is likely to be a good change  So, on   balance, Mr Chairman, I support alternative B  Some of the suggestions that have been made about   how to characterize our views vis-à-vis neutrality and whether or not we’re mildly restrictive strike   June 28-29, 2006 128 of 177    me as leading to a discussion in the markets that might not be terribly helpful at this time  Our   walking away from what the markets perceive to be firm and obvious guidance is a bigger move for   them than I think this discussion may be suggesting, and I’d rather not add a new notion of   neutrality, and a discussion about whether we are less loose or more tight strikes me as inopportune   at this moment   I concur with a comment that President Yellen made at the outset about thinking about our   August decision with an option model theory approach  This approach is basically that we don’t   want to exercise that option until we have to  Alternative B preserves our options, on balance, for a   fair fight and a fair discussion come the August meeting  Thank you, Mr Chairman      Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Treasury markets have convinced   themselves in recent days and weeks of the prospects of lower growth, lower rates, and some degree   of comfort with inflation, and they seem to have lurched to that on a somewhat accelerated basis in   August 8, 2006 64 of 158                                   the past several weeks But with some degree of humility, I’ll say I’m not quite as convinced as   they are I suspect that they may lose some of their conviction if some of the data that we’ve all   talked about this morning around this table come to pass  So we need to be keen in looking at   inflation expectations, at the shape of the curve, and at the prices of some of these Treasury   securities to evaluate the market reaction to what we do     I have just a couple of other general comments  We’ll have readings on inflation soon, but   I’m not persuaded that we will have a good view of how persistent inflation will likely be  I suspect   it will continue to trend to the upside and will beg those markets for a further review of the state of   inflation expectations  Similarly, I am not sure we’re going to have definitive views on growth  I   had a lot of discussions with a whole host of folks in the consumer and business sectors  They are   hearing, much as we are, top-down estimates for lower growth in the second half, but their own   bottom-up analysis doesn’t seem to be bearing that out even here in the second quarter  The only   thing I’d note at the outset from the BEA revisions is that, though growth has come down somewhat   over the historical period, quarter-over-quarter variance seems to be at least as pronounced as it was   in the original dataset; so the data are likely to be rather volatile, I would suspect, as we look   through the forecast period   With that in mind, I thought I’d take a couple of minutes looking at growth in the consumer   and business sectors and then spend a few moments on inflation  With respect to the consumer   sector, I am probably more convinced at this meeting than even before that great tumult is going on   below the surface  In discussions with some of the big credit card processors, I asked them to tell   me what they’re seeing  They’re seeing huge changes in categories of purchases and even in the   types of purchases if we exclude energy and gas products  In sum, however, consumer spending   looked quite strong to most of them through June and, importantly, through the first month of the   August 8, 2006 65 of 158                            third quarter Although they had talked to their boards about lower volume in the second half, they   have yet to see it in much of their data across a range of lower-income Americans as well as   Americans with higher net worth  They’re not seeing much softness at all  The other piece coming   out of those discussions is that they had expected to see a ramp-up in delinquencies—again, with   much vaunted news of a slowing housing sector, higher energy prices, and a slower second half—   and they have not The news about delinquencies continues to be very encouraging going into the   third quarter It also raises the question of whether or not we’re going to see an inflection point   With all the discussions about the slower second half, we would have expected that personal   consumption would have shown some more-meaningful effect than the data suggest  So I’m not   persuaded that several meetings from now we’re going to have this “aha” moment and that we’re   going to see this inflection point  On the growth front, I still have the view that growth continues to   be above the Greenbook projection  But I am more concerned, of course, about inflation   I have just a couple of other points of interest on the consumer front  The July index of   consumer sentiment does not suggest much of a slowdown in consumer confidence, and when I   looked at the surveys since our last meeting, I came to a couple of conclusions  When the surveys   ask questions such as “How are you doing?” and “What is your personal financial condition?” the   numbers tend to go in a rather positive direction  “I’m doing pretty well, not great” is the answer, if   you cut through the data  When the surveys ask other questions such as “How is your neighbor   doing? or “What is the state of the economy or the state of business conditions?” the answer we’re   getting is, “Well, my neighbor is having all sorts of troubles”  If we’re trying to judge the economy   by what folks know best of all, I guess I don’t see much of a reason to expect that some of the   worst-case scenarios will come to pass   August 8, 2006 66 of 158                                      Federal tax receipts, which I mention at most of our meetings, for July showed year-over­  year growth of about 13 percent  The gains in wages and salaries implied by these increased tax   collections finally make some more sense in light of the recasting of the official data from last   week’s revisions, with real wages and salaries having risen 34 percent over the past year, which is   about a six-year high   Turning now to the business sector, I put myself as probably as confident as most around the   table on the state of this sector, though I have heard some talk of a diminution in “animal spirits”    But if you look at the data, you see that, as discussed this morning, the ratio of profits to GDP is at a   record high  Momentum continues to be quite strong, with credit spreads low, acceleration in   business sales, and low ratios of inventories to sales; all these factors seem to speak to some   underlying strength   The manufacturing sector, despite some noisy data on jobs and employment, appears to be   in an incredibly strong position  The ISM manufacturing index, PMI, and industrial production,   which advanced at an annual rate of about 66 percent during the second quarter, are all very   positive indicators about the manufacturing sector  We also continue both to hear anecdotes and to   see data about real pricing power in that sector, which is good news on the growth front and   probably gives us a couple of questions on the inflation front   Finally, Dino referred at the outset to some of the bottom-up analyst estimates for profits in   the second quarter and the second half, and I said a couple of meetings ago that we should really   take note of these to see whether they flatten out  They appear to be possibly flattening out a touch,   but you have to do quite a bit of work to get there  Second-quarter profits will end up above   15 percent once the S&P companies all report  Some lower earnings guidance is being given over   the forecast period; but throughout that period, earnings would still be up 11 percent or so compared   August 8, 2006 67 of 158                                             with similar quarters last year—all of which is quite encouraging and comes as surprisingly positive   news to boards of directors of these companies, who had heard about the slowdown but aren’t   seeing it so dramatically   One area about which I spoke earlier was the capital expenditure number in the second   quarter  President Plosser probably summarized the point well in explaining that we should   probably look through that number because of some volatile transportation-related orders    Moreover, when I look at the second half of this year and at 2007, other data on unfilled orders   appear very positive  Pent-up demand for cap-ex should be higher, given that the past three years   had growth rates of 64 percent rather than the 83 percent that we had earlier anticipated  The only   other thing I would note about cap-ex is that there seems to be greater dispersion by industry and by   sector Technology and telecom do seem to be more disciplined in this cap-ex wave than maybe   many of us, including myself, would have anticipated  I suspect that, with continued talk about the   slowdown in the second half, spending on tech and telecom will be bumpy and may drag some of   the aggregate cap-ex numbers down substantially  As I look at the business sector, I find myself   asking the key question of whether this industrial economy, as robust as I think it is, will boost labor   demand and personal income  I suspect the answer to that question is “yes”; but again, it’s hard to   be too definitive at this point   On the inflation front, I share the views expressed by most folks around the table of some   degree of calmness and pleasure about the stability of inflation expectations  But when I think   about what has happened to the bond market, particularly in the past couple of weeks, and the rather   robust moves that the bond market made at the end of last week, I could be easily persuaded that   those inflation expectations will move against us as data come in between this meeting and the next    August 8, 2006 68 of 158                                                   I would probably describe many of these inflation expectations as relatively calm; but if I had to   guess, I’d say that they’re probably a bit more wobbly than we would like   Further on the bad news front, and I think President Fisher and President Poole made   reference to this, no matter how we slice some of the core PCE data and some of the CPI data, even   if we look at things like non-energy services, the trend is not our friend on a three-month or   six-month average  Most of us would not expect it to be our friend over the next six months    Again, the question is how persistent the trend is, and I have genuine concerns on that front  As the   inflation data are likely to deteriorate, we obviously have to look at a broad range of GDP outcomes   for the balance of 2006  In particular, I took note of the Greenbook’s simulation of persistent   inflation to a 3 percent core, which I would consider a genuine risk, and although the Greenbook   simulation suggests that the fed funds rate would need to go only to 59 percent, I’m probably more   concerned that we might have more work to do if that series of events came to pass   Finally, let me quickly note the labor compensation front  I believe that many of the gains   shown on that front have been quite surprising on the upside  They have been good news for most   workers over the past couple of years, and they help explain that conundrum, which we’ve heard as   each of us have sat before this table and been asked on Capitol Hill  How is it that productivity is so   remarkably high and compensation so remarkably low?  Have the gains to trade and to capital and   labor changed?  I think these data suggest that they haven’t  If, in fact, we do see continued   acceleration in compensation gains—even, as the Greenbook suggests, to 5½ percent—I suspect the   markets again will look to that and will take it at face value that those gains are likely to be more   inflationary than many of us around the table believe  I think that’s another concern   On balance, I’d summarize my own position as being considerably more concerned about   the inflation picture than about the growth picture  As Vice Chairman Geithner said, there are   August 8, 2006 69 of 158                                             confidence intervals around all of these that are hard for us to bang the table in support of  The   work that we have from this meeting to the next will become particularly important  Thank you,   Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  From a capital markets perspective, as I think   about this decision, what matters more than the pricing of this issuance—that is, the decision on   25 basis points—is really what the after-market effects are  How is this security going to trade   over the next weeks and months?  When I think about the decision in that context, it puts the   August 8, 2006 103 of 158                            burden on the communications, which are only in small part in the message of our statement   today At the end of the day, I am willing to agree to a pause  But, again, I think that puts the   burden on laying the predicate that we are in fact poised and prepared to act as necessary  That   begins with our statement, but it doesn’t end there  Given the data that are likely to come in   between this meeting and the next (a couple of CPIs, a couple of PPIs, maybe a revised PCE) and   what’s likely to happen to some of the forward-looking market indicators (TIPS spreads, some of   the commodity prices), I think it is very important that the markets understand, before the trading   in the security gets very significant, the depth of our thinking on the subject and of the discussion   around this meeting  The minutes can be part of that communication  Such communication is   important so that they don’t perceive us when we meet next to be reacting to one or two pieces of   data, the way they seem to have overreacted to one or two pieces of data last week, but really   recognize the depth of our thinking on this subject   To be consistent with that view, I think Governor Kohn’s suggestion of indicating a   pause as powerfully as we can is critical The markets, in the first days, are going to take our   pause to be a stop, as reflected currently in the Eurodollar futures contracts and the fed fund   futures contracts But we need to disabuse them of that view as quickly, as frequently, and as   consistently as we can so that the pause does not become read as a stop  We will then have set   out the conditions for the ways in which we might react if different data arise  Again, I think that   the decision today is not an easy one  It’s important that the markets recognize that it is unlikely   that our work here is done With all that said, I’m prepared to support Governor Kohn’s   suggestion     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Just a few brief comments  First, with respect   to the concision of our statement and the minutes, I guess in a perfect world the minutes would   come out much sooner after our statement, but I recognize all the work that needs to get done to get   consensus and understanding on those   I have a modest suggestion, which we can take back up in October  The minutes could end   up being released somewhat sooner but also be more corporate in nature  It strikes me that a lot of   the communication that we do through the minutes is useful for history and for an understanding of   August 8, 2006 137 of 158                                 many of the nuances that we’ve talked about but is probably not that useful for some of the other   communication purposes discussed here  It would certainly be useful if the crucial arguments in the   discussion we had today were available in the minutes before three weeks have elapsed  That   would take some of the burden off figuring out what goes into the statement  Without burdening the   staff by getting the same product done sooner, we could think rather about what should be part of a   corporate-style set of minutes  We’ve taught the market that a full set of the minutes would come   out, but my own suggestion is that the full set could be somewhat delayed  That’s just a sort of   provocative suggestion without as much discussion and thought as we’d want, but I think it partly   addresses the statement issue    Second, on striking the right balance between individuals and the Committee, I’m more   convinced than ever, now that I have gone through four FOMC meetings, that the diverse views that   people express on monetary policy outside this meeting are important and are critically independent   What I’m going to say is not an attempt to break that divergence of views or dissuade people from   sharing them  I think it’s actually more problematic when FOMC participants say similar things   between meetings  For example, Mr Chairman, let’s say that you said X and that 18 of us went out   and repeated X more or less identically after the meeting  The market understanding of that is no   longer X or 2X but perhaps 10X or 12X, and I think that does prove problematic  A burden should   be on each of us, when we take our messages to different places between meetings, to be thinking   about the consequences, in particular, when we’re saying similar things  None of that means to say   that if you believe Y instead of X you should not be able to go scream that from the hills; but if you   believe a nuance of X, you really have to consider how the markets are going to understand the   repetition that they’ve heard   August 8, 2006 138 of 158                                                   Third, just a brief point about market discipline—I think President Yellen and President   Minehan made reference to this  We’ve been fairly cognizant over the past several meetings about   getting the markets to do their own work and not to rely on us  That market discipline is very   important  Governor Kohn said at the outset that the purpose of this discussion is not to have   transparency for transparency’s sake but to try to get to the right monetary policy objectives  It   strikes me as though we could well test the limits of transparency by sharing too much information   and getting the markets in a position where they stop doing much of the homework we’ve only   started getting them to do at this point  The right place to come to that judgment is somewhere   around where that transparency ends up making them more lemmings than we’d ideally like  I must   admit that I’m not exactly sure how to pull that off, but it strikes me that’s the way to structure or to   think about that discussion  Thank you       Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’d like to make four points, a couple of   which have been stated by my colleagues this morning, and then spend a little time on each of   them  First, like many of you, I am more concerned about the upside risks to inflation than   downside risks to output and employment  Second, the markets responded quite positively to the   last FOMC, so they’ve been going in the right direction  The stock market has been up, the bond   market has been up, energy and commodities are down, and TIPS inflation compensation   measures are down  Six months ago I would have taken some comfort from that; now, six   months into being a central banker, I’m worried  [Laughter] So I join the ranks of Jack and the   rest of you who have been here a bit longer than I have  Third, for the first time since I’ve been   here, I’m a little less sanguine about the supply side of the economy in looking at the business   base, the cap-ex base, and the manufacturing base  But I find myself today probably more   comfortable, or at least as comfortable as I’ve been, with the strength and resilience of consumer   demand  The fourth point I would like to spend a couple of minutes on is that I think we are at   the beginning of a major test of market liquidity that’s happening in real time in the fixed-income   markets  So let me take each of those in turn   First, on the consumer side, consumer spending appears to be strong and resilient  As   was noted at the outset, there was a strong July PCE reading, on par with the strongest gains of   September 20, 2006 76 of 132                   the year, suggesting to me that consumer demand may actually be accelerating from the second   quarter into the third quarter  The Greenbook estimate of 3 percent PCE for the third quarter and   275 percent PCE for the fourth quarter may actually be understating the strength of the   consumer, particularly with falling gas prices   I’m also comforted by income growth and labor market conditions, which I see as likely   to be far more important to consumer spending than housing wealth  Consumer income gains   appear to be rising I’ve made note previously of very strong tax receipts  Although they’ve   tapered off somewhat, they continue to be robust  Tax receipts for the year are up about   124 percent The past couple of months would suggest they are in the high single digits, and   though there is some noise in those data, I do take some comfort from them  Other recent   corroboration of labor income, with the revised NIPA data and other measures, suggests that real   wage and salary income again may be accelerating  It has been noted this morning that stock   options and bonus payments may have had an effect in the first quarter, creating a bit of noise in   those data However, they should also remind us of the wealth effect of equity gains, which may   partially offset the negative wealth effect from housing, particularly with 100 million members   of the investor class I think that’s something that needs to be considered in our thinking about   the strength of the consumer during the forecast period  Finally, as I think Governor Bies noted,   the labor markets remain reasonably tight  Despite the softness in housing, unemployment   insurance claims and unemployment rates remain quite encouraging   Turning for a moment to business, about which I am perhaps a little less optimistic than   I’ve been before, industrial production is still reasonably strong but, perhaps disappointingly, has   flattened for August, even though the July numbers appeared to be on an upward trend  When I   looked back over the past 24 monthly readings for 2004 and 2005, both of IP and retail sales, I   September 20, 2006 77 of 132                  found that each declined about six times, so I’m not sure that we’re seeing a new trend here  My   own sense of where IP is in September is that it’s remarkably strong, but, again, I have some   caution that I didn’t have before One other note—unlike the Greenbook, I sense that exports are   likely to make a real, meaningful contribution to GDP during the forecast period     In terms of capital expenditure growth rates, another survey I’d like to mention is the   Business Roundtable survey that came out a couple of days ago  It was more negative on capital   expenditures than it has ever been I would say that the group has a mixed record in calling   inflection points, but the survey results, nonetheless, suggest that only a little less than 40 percent   expect increased cap-ex in the next six months, whereas about half said that cap-ex would remain   constant over that period Perhaps that’s an effort to protect margins with higher costs that could   be only partially passed through As I’ve noted before, earnings growth continues to meet or   beat expectations, certainly through the second and third quarters, and my own sense is that   fourth-quarter earnings will also be fine, probably still at the double-digit rates of about 10 or   11 percent  Perhaps that explains some of the taking the foot off the accelerator in terms of   capital expenditures   In terms of housing, to add a bit to the previous discussion, my own sense is that the   residential sector may have, in fact, crowded out some nonresidential loans during the most   recent boom and that nonresidential construction was marked up sharply in the second quarter, to   an annual growth rate of 22 percent  My sense is also that the market’s capital allocation   function is working well C&I loans are growing about 15 percent or more, perhaps the highest   rate in the past 20 or 25 years, and we’ll probably see a little more capital allocation to this   nonresidential sector Whereas the Greenbook assumes a significant deceleration in this group, I   September 20, 2006 78 of 132               think that there’s reason for some upside surprise  As a result, I expect stronger GDP for the   second half of ’06 than the Greenbook does   Turning to inflation, I think that inflation risks have not materially receded, though we’ve   probably seen acceleration stopping  That is, we’ve seen the top, but the new direction is not   clear One measure that I’ll look to over the next six weeks is what’s going on in the capital   markets  Since we last met, ten-year yields have probably moved down about 15 basis points,   and the Greenbook reports that there should be a slowdown in business debt financing  That   statement of the Greenbook is probably reflected in the data that we’ve seen in July and August   in terms of the capital markets  But the test of liquidity to which I referred will be a big   supply/demand test over the course of the next six or seven weeks  Perhaps $150 billion in   funding is coming to market from the bank loan market, the leveraged loan market, high yield   and investment grade  Admittedly, in that $150 billion number, which stacks up as a big number   even compared with only a couple of years ago, when we would see financings over a year of   $175 billion, there are some elephant deals, and they are probably distorting that number a bit    HCA is coming to market with a $20 billion deal, as well as a couple of other major leveraged   buyouts   The liquidity in those capital markets appears to be incredibly robust at this moment;   there are massive pipelines  You hear words like “euphoria”  I would say that the capital   markets are probably more profitable and more robust at this moment, or at least going into the   six-week opportunity, than they have perhaps ever been  A significant variety of participants are   playing This is a function of huge sovereign debt inflows and of significant liability   management by issuers—some of the CFOs to whom Governor Bies was speaking  Investors at   this moment appear to have very little leverage in terms of the pricing of these deals or in terms   September 20, 2006 79 of 132               of some of the covenant protections that were referenced at an earlier meeting  Previously, I had   said that, particularly in the investment-grade market, we were seeing issuers hesitate to come to   market because they didn’t want to negotiate their covenants away  In the event that they were   to be taken out by a leveraged-buyout player, they wouldn’t want to have a change-of-control   premium  Now that these markets are as robust as they are, those same brand-name issuers are   coming back to the market, and at this point it seems as though they will likely get their pricing   done So, I do not yet have a final determination of what this pipeline looks like; but if all goes   through, it will suggest to me that there has been rather massive liquidity during this period    Other measures of liquidity appear to be somewhat more encouraging from my perspective  The   commodities markets have been mentioned  They’ve probably had some hot money come out of   them, with a lot of retail investors, both directly and through pension funds, coming in too late   and maybe exiting for good, as well as some very encouraging news about the TIPS markets,   which were referenced previously   In sum, I would say that the markets seem to be very impressed by our letting the   economy develop, particularly in the next couple of quarters, and I’m impressed by the market’s   confidence in us I think that it puts a significant responsibility on us and is probably the only   way I can reconcile the rather robust gains in the equity markets and in the debt markets over this   period That is, the markets believe that somehow we’re going to manage to thread the needle   and nail the perfect landing There is, I think, increasingly a one-way bet in the bond markets in   that they believe that there is a degree of accommodation and they have built in a degree of   loosening in the forecast period, which we don’t have a proper understanding of  Only a couple   of months ago we were describing, and the Chairman described, an economy in transition and   September 20, 2006 80 of 132                              the very wide tails around that We still have the wide tails, but the markets seem to think that   we’re going to nail this landing   I think the minutes from the last meeting faithfully captured our concerns about the   appreciable upside risks remaining  Either the markets didn’t buy that description, or they were   convinced that we were going to act with an incredibly deft touch to stop that inflation  All in   all, I would say that in the markets there is less dispersion of views than is probably healthy and   less dispersion of views over these different scenarios than we found ourselves discussing some   time ago  So with that, I think we’ll have a more robust discussion in the next round  Thank   you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Given our decision at the last meeting, I favor   maintaining the pause today, and I favor alternative B  The judgment to pause, as well as the   language around that, does in fact constrain our flexibility, and I think most of us recognized that   going into our last meeting   In reviewing the language, I think that B+ has some superficial appeal, but the appeal really   is in understanding that’s what we meant to say or that’s how we meant the markets to react last   time  That is, I do not think our statement today should redo, correct, or try to reinterpret the last   one  We had one shot in August  We now have a shot in September  Some of the appeal of B+ is   trying to drive those market reactions that we expected  Given what the market has done, it strikes   me that changing the language about what we said last time carries a large burden  The language in   the statement represents a relatively blunt instrument, and our view that it is somehow nuanced or   that we can play nuances through it is hard to prove in the marketplace  I read alternative B as   somewhat less hawkish than our August statement, and I would strongly support Governor   Kroszner’s recommendation to strike “on balance” because, again, I do not want to overly   encourage the market behavior that we have seen over the intermeeting period  So with that I   recommend alternative B with the striking of “on balance”   September 20, 2006 111 of 132                                      Thank you, Mr Chairman  My own views are quite consistent with what   I expressed five weeks ago and with the central tendency of many of the speakers today—that is,   a greater concern about inflation prospects than growth prospects  So I thought what I’d do is   just give you maybe three or four perspectives on market activity in the intermeeting period and   suggest to you what conclusions we can draw from them and what conclusions I’d hesitate to   draw   First, as we noted at the last meeting, the growth in the equity markets is all about   earnings and not about multiples  As the markets record the eighteenth double-digit quarterly   growth rate, with quarterly growth in the third quarter likely to exceed, on an annualized basis,   the second quarter, on one level you would see reasons for earnings momentum and for more   robustness than the Greenbook shows in the prospect for business fixed investment  Despite   those headlines, I think the Greenbook probably has the general slowdown in business fixed   investment and the general slowdown in manufacturing about right  Again, at some superficial   level you would think that these stock prices would be juicing business activity—that animal   spirits would be as high as they’ve ever been  But in fact, what we can say with some   confidence is that historical models of cash and profits have done a poor job of indicating what   the strength of business demand would be here  Although business demand has certainly picked   up over this cycle, it appears not to have picked up as dramatically as a lot of the data might   suggest   So what does that mean?  I think it means that there is generally still conservatism in   board rooms, conservatism by CFOs  Although they have plenty of ammunition in terms of their   access to capital markets and their cash balances, we’ll likely see them use that only when it’s   clear that the economy has turned  If this soft landing followed by a gradual acceleration does   October 24-25, 2006 63 of 203    appear to be the most likely path, I would expect to see these companies put their feet on the   accelerator a bit more and make sure that growth gets back to trend relatively quickly  But the   idea that businesses are going to turbo-charge their way through this without hesitation appears   to be less likely than the data would suggest   Second, let me turn to the debt markets  There is a discussion among pundits about a tug   of war going on between growth risks and inflation risks  As I look at the data in the debt   markets, I must say that I don’t see that tug of war  The only tug of war is really between a soft   landing and a harder landing, under the view that inflation is almost assuredly going to be solved   by the central bank or by exogenous factors  Again, a superficial conclusion would be, boy, the   markets are not worried about inflation, and we should take great comfort in it  Rather, the thing   that gives me the greatest pause is that, just as inflation is nowhere on the table in the capital   markets now, it could quickly emerge; and it would not take much data, which all of us would   consider to be relatively noisy and perhaps not overly valid, for inflation to become part of the   discussion in the debt markets  That’s something I think we have to prepare for  I suspect, as I   think about the balance of this year, that another round of discussions in the capital markets   about an inflation scare is quite possible   The third issue is really one of short-term volatility, which I tend not to overreact to, but I   do think this particular case is telling  Typically, several weeks after a quarter, the markets’   assessment of that quarter’s GDP ends up trending toward truth and ends up without a huge   disparity as they get closer to and smarter about the underlying information  I have no reason to   doubt our own staff’s view that third-quarter GDP is likely to come in around 1 percent    Nonetheless, the markets’ estimates are quite far away from that  Market estimates have, in fact,   trended down, but I’d say the median estimate in the market is still in the high ones, maybe even   October 24-25, 2006 64 of 203    2 percent  So the question really is, come Friday, if the headline number posts the way that the   staff suggests it will, what the market will say about that  My own view is that there will then be   an immediate rush to judgment probably amplified to the downside in a political season like this    They will say, “Boy, the economy is really on the wrong track, and the economic landing is a   very hard one”  Whether that judgment dissipates as markets look forward and start to   understand the reasons for the shortfall is a bit of a concern  Also, some in the marketplace may   have the view that, if that landing is relatively hard and fast, the pace of economic growth will do   our work for us on the inflation front  Obviously I don’t think that view is shared by many of us   around the table; in fact, there might be more work for us to do  It wouldn’t surprise me if the   markets didn’t, at the end of this period, expect there to be a couple of rate cuts built into the first   half of 2007, and I suspect we’ll need to send Don back out there to give them another speech   [Laughter]     What does all of this mean for the real economy?  Again, I’d break it up   into two pieces  First, in terms of a consumer reaction function, I think consumers are going to   be very stubborn and very strong and are not going to be overly scared by a third-quarter GDP   number that they don’t really pay that much attention to  On a very fundamental level they are   feeling much better about their prospects now than they have felt in some time, this is a function   of some of the wage growth that we’ve seen and a function of oil prices and the unemployment   rate  So I don’t really worry that there will be any short or intermediate effect on the consumer    I think the Greenbook has consumer spending continuing in the fourth quarter at something like   3 percent  That’s probably a very conservative estimate given the strength of some of those   underlying fundamentals  Second, what’s the effect of this on the real economy for businesses?    October 24-25, 2006 65 of 203    I’m more concerned about their reaction function  Despite the rather robust discussion in the   business sector that I mentioned at the outset, I would expect them to be concerned  As they’re   thinking about their capital expenditures plans for 2007 and as they’re doing their fiscal year-end   meetings, on balance the concern and the discussion of a hard landing may well affect their   ability to bet big and make big projects  So, again, I share the rather conservative view that the   staff expressed in the Greenbook in terms of where business investment is going to be   Finally, let me just talk for a moment about inflation—again in the context of these   market perspectives  I tried to be as witty as David is in this discussion, and during the break it   occurred to me that I should call this section “Inflation Are Objects in Mirror Larger than They   Appear?”  [Laughter]  That’s my half-hearted effort at humor  I’ve probably talked about the   TIPS markets at least as much as other folks around this table in the past six or seven months,   and I do find some comfort in them  But I find myself increasingly viewing them as being a bit   divorced from some of the data  My view is that expectations of inflation relevant for price   setting may have deteriorated much more substantially than the TIPS markets and the survey   measures suggest  I think the Greenbook has an alternative simulation that hits this case well,   and its conclusion has to be that expectations may account for more of this year’s rise in core   inflation than either we or the markets estimate  Inflation is likely going to be particularly sticky   in the labor markets, given my discussion a moment ago  Very low unemployment insurance   claims, very low unemployment, and strong wage and job growth make me believe that the labor   market may actually be tightening at the same time that everything else we’ve talked about is   happening in the housing markets  The revision from BLS suggested that they found 810,000   jobs through March  When all is said and done about the subsequent six-month period, they may   have found more jobs as well, bolstering the case that the labor markets may, in fact, be quite   October 24-25, 2006 66 of 203    tight  Total compensation is up about 83 percent, the fastest rate since the third quarter of 2000    Average hourly earnings have accelerated now to 4 percent  At the end of the day, we should   take some comfort from the TIPS spreads, but not reliance  As we think about the measure of   TIPS spreads as an indication of inflation expectations, I am troubled, probably increasingly, that   the TIPS markets appear to be following our forecast rather than the actual data, and we have to   continue to address that problem proactively with the markets  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support keeping the federal funds target   constant  Let me enter the fray about language by stating the opinion that we should change   language if we think the markets do not understand our views  We shouldn’t change language just   because the market disagrees with our views  So regarding the distinction between B and B+, I   think because of the minutes and because of the speeches that many of you have given since the last   meeting, the markets hear what we’re saying about inflation; they just simply don’t agree with it  I   feel very comfortable with that  That is, we have told them that inflation is our top concern  They   are very smart, and it’s not, in my judgment, essential that we somehow match the markets’   expectations to our own  Our obligation is to tell them really what we think, and frankly, it is quite   helpful for them to be coming to an independent view  So without going to the distinction between   B and B+ about whether we should change language, I don’t see any compelling reason, in light of   their understanding of where we are, that we should be changing to the somewhat more hawkish   description in B+  As I’ve said before, the language should not be an attempt to rewrite what we   could have done better or could have done differently last time  It has to be a view of, given where   we are, what the incremental benefit of change is  Thus I favor relatively strongly not making the   change to the B+ language that Vincent forwarded yesterday  The markets are most focused on   growth, as I talked about yesterday  The suggestion that Don made about alternative A, section 3,   language is perfectly appropriate, and I think it is reconciled and shared by everyone here   So let me go to alternative B, section 2, language and try to make my views clear in terms of   the changes that have been suggested  First, if instead of describing economic growth in the third   quarter we refer to economic growth over the course of the year, my concern is that the markets will   then see what gets posted as the third-quarter number and will think that we think that growth is   October 24-25, 2006 117 of 203    going to continue to be weak in the fourth quarter  So even though I don’t like pinpointing a   particular time, I get a little uncomfortable if we use the first sentence to say that economic growth   has slowed further through the present, that is, a 1 percent number gets posted on Friday, let’s say,   and then that will be read to say the Committee believes that that is the trend for the fourth quarter    Then couple that sentence with the next, in which we say “going forward”  I think “going forward”   then largely means 2007 because we’ve opined in the first sentence on the third and fourth quarters    I think the general view will be that the “going forward” sentence will relate to 2007 and we will   have left some misunderstanding about where we collectively are on fourth-quarter GDP, and the   markets aren’t going to have that just right  So I would leave the language in the first sentence   referring to the third quarter  Sharing the view that many of you have that “moderate” is not as clear   as we’d like, I think we want to have the first sentence end with the third quarter and have the next   sentence then talking, in effect, about the fourth quarter and beyond  Then because I can’t come up   with a better word than “moderate,” I would suggest the following  “Going forward, the economy   seems poised to expand at a moderate pace”  Again, I’m trying to suggest some optimism, some   inflection point there  The other language I’ve messed around with would be “poised to return to a   more moderate pace” or something else along that line  But I think we’re trying to show an   inflection point, so that would be my modest suggestion for that  All in all, the markets are going to   be most focused on our growth statement  So even though we’ve spent a lot of time on   wordsmithing, I think it is quite important  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Let me frame my remarks around the relevant   constituencies, trying not to avoid answering the hard questions  The prism through which I   think about this is, What’s the political acceptance for what we’re trying to do?  What’s the   market acceptance and what’s the policy acceptance for what we are trying to do?     As I think about the three issues and weigh the costs and benefits, I find the costs of each   are easy to elaborate in great detail  The benefits appear to me to be very real but hard to pin   October 24-25, 2006 175 of 203    down with confidence as to both when we would achieve those benefits and how they would   accrue to the credibility of this institution  I am most in accord with President Yellen’s   description, which is that there may well be net benefits to going down this path but the costs are   much easier to put our hands around  We’re approaching this discussion through the prism of   inflation targeting, which is really the elephant in the discussion  In some ways, I dare say it   made our previous discussion tough because we were tiptoeing around the core   inflation-targeting question  Inflation targeting has taken a life of its own in academia, in the   capital markets, and in the political environment  Although inflation targeting is a proper   framework for the discussion here, it is a very dangerous way in which to approach our public   discussion   Let me discuss that point in a little detail  Inflation targeting, certainly on Capitol Hill   and to many market participants, suggests that some mechanical exogenous force will be an   absolute constraint on the FOMC’s actions  That’s not the way most people here today have   talked about inflation objectives, but it does taint the discussion in our relevant constituencies   outside the building, and we have to be very much aware of that fact  It strikes me that, once   we’ve figured out more or less our own path to making an institutional decision on this, we   should be discussing it more broadly outside the institution as a continuation and manifestation   of what the Fed has long done  Instead of using words like “inflation targeting” outside the   institution, we should use words like “price stability”  Talking about this as the next generation   and the formalization of the comfort-zone language, which either by design or by practice has   marked many of our discussions in the past year, is a much more useful way for us to make   meaningful progress in Washington and in the capital markets   October 24-25, 2006 176 of 203    You saw from Larry Meyer’s survey that there was, I think, a decided tone of “Hey, we   just want to know what the right answer is  Tell us what you guys are going to do next  We just   want data that give us the answer because then we can put them into our Excel spreadsheets and   life will be grand”  [Laughter]  I think that’s a trap that we do not want to fall into  What we   want to be doing, rather than generally trying to provide them with greater clarity than we can   provide about what our decisions are going to be, is to give them better information on what   we’re using to make decisions     I fear that, if we announce an inflation target per se, and provide some specificity about   that announcement, we will have engendered credibility questions that we will need to answer    In the most recent cycle of our interest rate decisions, very few of us, I think, would have   somehow done things differently if an inflation-targeting regime had been in place  My own   sense is that we can’t believe that we need to hamstring ourselves with such an exogenous force    At the other extreme, we don’t want to go down this path if we say inflation targeting doesn’t   change our flexibility at all  So the relevant question is, what does this do to our flexibility?  If   the answer is that it doesn’t constrain our flexibility at all, then it is really unwise because of all   those costs that we’ve talked about  If the answer to that question is that it does constrain our   flexibility significantly, then we have a huge problem in all our constituencies  So we end up   having to admit, as we go down this path, that it does somewhat constrain our flexibility but   saying that the FOMC is as prepared as ever to respond to real market developments with respect   to employment, output, and financial crises   So where does that put us?  Again, the debate should be framed as a continuation of what   we’ve long done  After we announce our conclusions from these discussions, at some point we   would need to reject the straw man of what inflation targeting has become  If an interrogator on   October 24-25, 2006 177 of 203    Capitol Hill or in the capital markets says, “This is the goal, this is the number, and you will get   inflation down to that goal within X number of years,” the response has to be “no”  That is,   that’s not how we’re thinking about the next generation of transparency   Regarding an incremental approach to getting from where we are to where we want to be,   I would begin, once we’re ready to go prime time with our announcement, by avoiding the   adoption of inflation targeting per se and by letting that straw man be put out there and shooting   it down to suggest that’s not where we are  My next measure would be to accelerate the timing   of existing information, by which I would reference the minutes, the lag in the forecast, and the   generation of our central tendency  Then I’d add frequency  I think the idea of going from a   semiannual to a quarterly presentation of our information, as Governor Mishkin suggested,   would be next in the evolution of being more transparent to the markets about what we mean by   “price stability”  Then I would consider adding robustness to the data provided—that is, what   data sets that are not in the public realm and that we use for our own decisionmaking could be   helpful?  Finally, looking at how that information has proceeded along this path of transparency,   we then ask ourselves whether we need to have a formal vote on the big question that Vincent   laid out for us or whether a vote is unnecessary because we’ve already proceeded so far down the   path that we’ve ended up with a rather, though not totally, explicit definition of what price   stability means   As a final comment—we’ve discussed around this table whether this decision is an   individual or a collective one  In my judgment, a consensus decision is a good one  But I don’t   think we should fool ourselves  Federal Reserve policy has been personalized, and no matter   what we do, it will continue to be personalized in the form of the Chairman  What the markets   and the Congress will be most interested in is, “Well, I hear that’s the central tendency view of   October 24-25, 2006 178 of 203    the FOMC  What’s your view?”  I want to make sure as we go through this process that, because   we know that questions will be asked of the Chairman, we haven’t constrained his flexibility  He   must dutifully report perhaps what our consensus views are, but we shouldn’t let there be any   ambiguity about what are our views and what are his views  To the extent that there’s a   difference, perhaps he is obligated to describe that  But I wouldn’t want this process ending up   by constraining the Chairman about what he could say because at the end of the day, whether all   of us like it or not, it is the Chairman’s judgment, much more than any of ours, that influences   our monetary policy  Thank you      Thank you, Mr Chairman  Let me confine my remarks to a couple of   discussions of the economy that bolster the themes that several of you have noted  At the outset,   I’ll say that I continue to be more concerned with the level of inflation and our progress   regarding it than I am with growth  The economy appears to be on track, and I think, unlike the   Greenbook projections, that there’s a prospect for some upside surprises on growth  So let me   spend a few moments looking at the labor markets, the corporate profit markets, household   balance sheets, and consumer spending before coming back to the capital markets a little more   broadly    First, on the labor market side, as has been noted previously, we continue to have   surprisingly strong job gains, particularly at this point in the cycle  The trend on revisions,   regardless of the data series, tends to be continuing upward  The labor markets continue to   December 12, 2006 65 of 134         accept new workers into the labor force more smoothly, with the participation rate the highest   since 2003, which suggests a dynamism in that market  Hiring plans of small businesses have   moved to their highest level in nearly two years and tend to be a pretty good forward-looking   indicator, perhaps a better indicator than large companies  In light of all that, I think the   Greenbook rightly acknowledges that the household survey may imply even greater strength than   the payroll data suggest    Second, turning to the profits picture, there continue to be remarkable profits for the   S&P, the Dow, and the broader markets, predicated on strong cash flows and record profit   margins  Broad-based NIPA profits are up 30 percent pre-tax for the third quarter  S&P   delivered 20 percent profit gains in the third quarter  I think the trend there is particularly telling    That is, estimates by earnings analysts continue to surprise on the upside  As we move through   the quarter, those bottom-up estimates continue to track very, very positively  I think that’s   probably a good indication of why we’ve seen equity prices increase  When we look at where   estimates are for the fourth quarter, bottom-up estimates for the S&P 500 are at about   91 percent  For 2007, year-over-year increases of about 93 percent are expected  These   numbers are very strong, but they are significantly down from the high double-digit numbers that   we’ve seen over the past couple of quarters  My own sense is that continues to suggest good   news for the equity markets and good news for corporate profits  I expect that equity prices will   outperform over the next couple of months if the numbers move up from 9 percent into the   double digits  If that trend is reversed and we see disappointing corporate earnings, we could see   a pretty rapid pullback in the equity markets, with some implications for the broader economy  I   mention this discussion of profits and recognize that, though there is some correlation between   December 12, 2006 66 of 134         corporate profits and the broader economy, we are continuing to see a disproportionate share of   total income coming from this sector  So it’s a sector that we need to continue to evaluate    Third, turning to household balance sheets, net worth grew $3½ trillion over the past four   quarters, as the Fed’s flow of funds data suggest  Assets are growing faster than liabilities,   whether we include or exclude housing, if we look at just the past four quarters  Continuing   remarkable levels of household and corporate liquidity continue to suggest very good news    Although in these data we do see growth of household debt relative to income, this is a trend   over the past twenty-five years, and I don’t really note anything overly disturbing there  So   when we look at those three measures—labor, profits, and balance sheets—I come to a pretty   encouraging conclusion in terms of an underlying sturdiness to the economy, particularly in   regard to individual consumption    Let me turn to consumption, with a bit of a short-term focus here on the fourth quarter  I   think the Greenbook suggested anecdotally that November might turn out to be a little softer than   October and a little softer than expectations  My own sense is that some real upside surprises are   there  I had discussions with contacts and reviewed data from two large credit card companies,   which in total represent about 35 percent of all of consumer buying over this period  This real-  time information ends in November and looks across demographics  It excludes subprime   lenders  The only subprime folks in these two portfolios are those who began in the primary   market and found their way into the subprime market  So I recognize that we are missing an   important piece  However, when you look at consumer spending for November, you see little to   no deterioration in credit quality—credit is still incredibly strong across regions and income   groups  I pushed each of the two companies to find areas of weakness, and they found this   exercise to be pretty tough  Their own internal credit measures have not shifted  They had built   December 12, 2006 67 of 134         in some softening in November and December Christmas spending, which they have not seen    They continue to see a huge reservoir of untapped credit, and they do see some de-leveraging by   folks in key consumer groups, which they think suggests that consumers are in very good shape    The consumer spending trend from these two contacts continues to be very positive  They   expected to see growth in November on the order of 4 percent; they saw growth of 5½ and   6 percent  Though it’s too early to call this Christmas season a success, they are much more   positive than they were before November began, in terms of both dollar purchases and   transaction swipes  So my own sense is that the consumer appears to be quite strong    Having now listed four areas that I think have rather remarkable strength, I want to spend   a moment on another topic that has been discussed around this table, which is manufacturing  As   we look at the manufacturing base and we try to evaluate how we will know which inflection   point the economy turns on, the manufacturing data are likely to be quite telling  I’ve been   surprised and disappointed by poor manufacturing ISM (Institute for Supply Management) data   and other weak data, and I’ve asked myself whether the weakness shows some spreading beyond   autos and housing, which we’ve all discussed for some time  When I look behind those data, I   am comfortable that much of the weakness that we see in manufacturing really is consistent with   that theme—that is, second-order and third-order suppliers into the auto and housing sectors    Other weakness does appear to be related to certain machinery and equipment, but I have seen   that weakness more in the data than in the anecdotes  As President Minehan suggested, I think   that these data end up being somewhat weak, but the weakness is transitory  The share prices of   most of these large multinational manufacturing companies continue to outperform  The tone   that these companies have when they’re meeting with their analysts continues to be quite   positive, so this signal may well be false, but we have to focus a bit more on it  By the time we   December 12, 2006 68 of 134         meet in the first quarter we’ll have a better sense of whether the manufacturing base, in terms of   volume and productivity, is giving us any indication of what’s happening in the broader   economy    Let me turn, finally, to the capital markets  Capital markets, as has been mentioned   around this table, continue to function well  The Board staff has rightly observed that long-term   forward corporate credit spreads are widening somewhat, showing that these markets, while   awash in liquidity, are responding to price signals and are starting to focus increasingly on credit    In a couple of instances, issuers that tried to come to market, both in Europe and in the United   States, were beaten back, which was, frankly, good news from the perspective of market   discipline  The securities that they were trying to issue were PIK notes  These are paid-in-kind   securities by which the company can pay off the investors either in cash or through additional   paper, and the pool of liquidity for such notes is not so deep  That kind of discipline in the   markets should encourage us  Having said that, I consider the debt capital markets to be   incredibly robust  I talked previously about remarkable pipelines that were at record levels    They have all now priced at significantly beneficial terms  In November, as I think Dino noted,   high-yield corporate issuances were at a record  The leveraged-loan market was also at a record,   and we found instances in which issuers obtained better terms by issuing in larger volumes  That   tells us that some people in the investor base really want to get their full allocations  If they can   get their allocations, they’re willing to pay a premium for doing so  The backlogs priced   remarkably well, and I think those markets are functioning well    Let me enter the discussion about trying to reconcile the bond markets and the equity   markets by making four points  First, the leveraged buyout data that Dino discussed are one   explanation  That is, you don’t need to have a leveraged buyout of a vast majority or of even a   December 12, 2006 69 of 134         significant number of companies in the S&P for those values to find their way into the markets    My view is that an LBO floor valuation now exists across more sectors than we could have   anticipated before—into technology, for example—and companies that, because of their size,   were previously out of reach for the private equity players  Part of the growth that we’ve seen in   the equity markets has occurred because the LBO prices that could theoretically be paid, with   balance sheets that are probably much less conservative, have raised the prices that are paid in   the capital markets for these same companies  Second, the difference between the equity and the   bond markets is about earnings growth and not multiples growth  On a price-to-earnings basis,   the suggestion is that earnings in 2007 will be up something like 9 percent over this year, and the   price-earnings multiples don’t look out of whack  You end up with earnings that, if they are   delivered for another year or two, don’t make these companies look all that expensive  Third, in   reconciling these markets, I’d suggest that the difference is really about us  The markets think   that, if the trajectory for the economy softens significantly, the Fed will be responsive to it,   notwithstanding what we’re saying currently—that dependence on the data means that we will be   agile and we won’t be stuck in our words of yesterday in judging the economy that’s   forthcoming  So they believe that we will effectively lower rates to achieve a very soft but   successful landing  Finally, expectations are built into the bond markets that rate cuts are ahead    The discount rate in evaluating cash flows for these companies obviously comes down as well,   further bolstering their value  So I suspect that these markets are perhaps a bit more consistent   than some market prognosticators would say  But we must continue to evaluate them over the   next several weeks and months  Thank you, Mr Chairman      It’s a tough question, and I’ll try to take it in turn, which is that most of   the liquidity phenomenon that I describe here and that we see in the US markets, we describe in   the FOMC as a US phenomenon, but it’s really a global phenomenon   So as we think about   what this liquidity tells us about interest rates, it’s hard to draw a certain conclusion  That is,   these markets are increasingly global  The US multinational financial companies that are   successful in having access to capital in worldwide markets can take companies public in   worldwide markets  So even if you believe that the Fed was too loose or overly accommodative,   we’re somewhat limited in what we can do to stem that worldwide liquidity for the reasons that   you mentioned      When I talk about liquidity, moreover, I’m suggesting partly the first explanation that you   gave, which is that there is access to capital, which has been described around this table as free   December 12, 2006 71 of 134         money, by more people in more investments that might not otherwise be satisfying a strict return   on investment or return on equity basis  So we’re seeing not only smart capital from folks with   long track records who have entered this market and can deploy their investment dollars but also   folks with less experience who can finance themselves particularly in the debt markets in a way   that was unimaginable in previous cycles  So I think liquidity really means a couple of the things   you’ve noted  Obviously, I, like you, think that these monetary aggregates are not providing us   with much insight  Moreover, regarding your initial point, we would have a hard time drying up   this liquidity, if that’s what we attempted to do, given the global nature of the sources and the   uses of funds       Thank you, Mr Chairman  I, too, favor no change in the federal funds rate   today and agree on the risk assessment in section 4  Let me make three points  First, I think that   there is a rebuttable presumption—particularly in December, given what’s going on in the   markets—of somewhat less liquidity and somewhat less interest in surprises now than at other   points that favors fewer changes rather than more  Second, I think your remarks, Mr Chairman, the   Vice Chairman’s remarks, and several people’s remarks over the intermeeting period have focused   December 12, 2006 108 of 134         on uncertainty and have tried to challenge the markets about their degree of certitude regarding   what’s likely to happen  When I review the language, I try to keep that in mind and reinforce the   view that they need to be doing their own homework and to be thinking about what the tail risks are    Third, it’s not our job to force our forward curve of interest rates to match the markets, but I’d rather   not reinforce their views either   So when I turn to the language, my preference is to agree with President Minehan’s   alternative C  But we’ve been whispering about Governor Bies’s compromise over here, and just to   make the words even briefer, a suggestion for the wording is, “Although recent indicators are   mixed, the economy seems likely to expand at a moderate pace on balance over coming quarters”    This wording acknowledges what’s going on in the markets, Mr Chairman, and so it captures what   you rightly said about our continuing to pay attention rather than having a knee-jerk reaction  At the   same time, it doesn’t put more of an emphasis on data on either side of the line  That strikes me as a   reasonable compromise, given all that I’ve heard today  Thank you      Thank you, Mr Chairman  I thought I’d provide just a couple of   perspectives, first on the 2006 economy and then, by extrapolation, on the trends in ’07  With   respect to 2006, I think the economy outperformed market expectations and Greenbook   expectations, for probably at least four reasons  The first is the underlying strength of the   employment market, which has been much discussed today  Second, the strength and durability   of household finance, which, as Vice Chairman Geithner said, turned out to be far more   determined by W-2 income than some of the household balance sheet items like home equity and   stock market effects  But we need to take another look at that trend in 2007  Third, the   economic outperformance in ’06 had much to do with the resilience of the US capital markets   as evidenced in credit spreads and other financial instruments, particularly in the face of some   rather seismic events—one-time, potentially systemic events like the Amaranth Advisors   collapse; cyclical price spikes with respect to commodity prices that may well have been   somewhat demand-driven; a series of supply shocks driven by oil; and a seeming transition to   slower growth in the middle of the year  Fourth were the continued powerful sources of liquidity   that smoothed the transition over the several bumps in the road    I also looked at what the most reliable and the least reliable indicators of the state of the   economy in ’06 were to see whether those signposts might hold for ’07  I think the tax receipt   information that we saw in ’06 was telling us that incomes were likely ahead of trend—tax   receipts for ’06 were up a total of 116 percent  Corporate profits, which were up 92 percent in   the past four years, had another remarkable year, up in the mid-teens  Stock prices, obviously   closely related to corporate profits, were up 84 percent in the past four years and up about 15   percent in 2006  Credit spreads continued to trend tighter; high-yield spreads were down about   January 30-31, 2007 77 of 255    100 basis points from September  Another couple of reasonably reliable indicators for ’06 were   the household survey of employment, which suggested early and often that employment growth   was likely to be ahead of expectations, and merger and acquisition pipelines, which suggested a   degree of confidence in the markets by business leaders and other folks involved in finance    A less reliable indicator for 2006 growth was the shape of the yield curve, and the   suggestion from most of us around the table to the markets was that the yield curve wasn’t   predicting much by way of recession in the short term  Another less reliable indicator was the   consumer confidence and business confidence surveys, which seemed to snap all over the place,   perhaps more because of geopolitical events and some short-term data than any really driving   profile  With respect to inflation, it is hard to find any indicators that were very good at telling   us its path, but I do think that the TIPS spread, even when there was much talk in the spring and   the summer about rising inflation, seemed to stay relatively well anchored and not to move too   much based on some of that noise in the data  So that indicator seems to have been reasonably   good  As was mentioned earlier, monthly CPI and PCE core measures seemed to be moving   around rather significantly, so it was hard for us to determine too much from them as 2006 went   forward    Taking all of that into account, as I think about 2007, I find that analyzing those   indicators is not without significant peril, but let me attempt doing so  The trends appeared   supportive of strong, balanced economic growth for 2007, and although inflation expectations   are well anchored and recent high-frequency data appear promising, I remain much more   concerned about inflation prospects than about growth  Having said that, I do think that as an   institution we go into 2007 with probably even heightened credibility on the inflation front and   in terms of our perspectives on the economy, which should help us over the next twelve months   January 30-31, 2007 78 of 255     Two key themes summarize my views on 2007  First, strong employment trends should   continue to support consumer spending  Second, strong corporate balance sheets and balanced   global growth should support capital expenditures  Now, of those two themes, I would note that   I have considerably more confidence in the former than in the latter  I’ll spend another moment   on that shortly  The tone of the markets appears to be exceptionally strong  Spreads have   tightened, even as yields have trended back to 5 percent  Over November and December, we had   three weeks, each with more than $11 billion being priced in the high-yield market  Just to give   some perspective on that fact, for the year 2000 there was a total of $50 billion in the high-yield   market  But what has happened in the past six weeks that might be able to inform our   judgments?  Double B spreads have tightened about 25 basis points, single Bs have tightened   50 basis points, and triple C spreads have tightened 70 basis points in the past six weeks, all of   which continues to signal to me that the economy maintains a relative strength and that investors   feel confident about the bets that they’re making  In summary, I would say there are significant   tails on both sides of this rather strong base case for the economy, but the economy is more   likely to track above the expectations of the Greenbook    Let me spend a couple of moments on the consumer  Contacts from two large credit card   companies to whom I spoke last week expect and have seen in January the same kind of strength   that they saw in December  The first three weeks of January look to be a continuation of the late   but positive trend in the fourth quarter  For what it’s worth, the contacts’ own projections are   that the first quarter will be rather strong, much like the fourth quarter ended up being  Today,   we’ve all tried to wrestle with what the Greenbook referred to as the “unexplained strength” of   household spending during 2006 to determine its effect on ’07  Let me spend a couple of   January 30-31, 2007 79 of 255    moments on a hypothesis that the contacts proffered regarding that strength, which the   Greenbook references in its “buoyant consumer” simulation      What that strength may well prove is that employees worked more, earned more, and had   more savings from their household balance sheets to fund consumption than the data to this point   are suggesting  I think that could turn out to be the case in 2007  First, people worked more    The benchmark payroll survey on total job creation may well be revised upward again   significantly, like the revision of last year  Gains in service jobs may well be less counted than   some of the losses in other kinds of jobs—another bias for upward revisions  The JOLTS data to   which President Pianalto referred continue to be very positive, suggesting a real dynamism in the   economy that may well be accelerating  Participation rates may continue their recent spike as   new workers selectively choose to enter this marketplace  Average hours worked moved up in   the fourth quarter to an annual rate of 22 percent, and that trend could continue  So monthly   employment gains have not proved much harder to achieve as we approach what we thought was   full employment, and the NAIRU may be lower than estimated  Second, people certainly may   well have earned more  Average hourly earnings were up 42 percent for ’06, an acceleration   that was rather widespread from ’05 measures  Though the data on compensation continue to be   mixed, they do seem to be trending in that direction  The divergence between profits and   compensation suggests to me at least that there is large upside potential for unemployment to   stay low and for wages to accelerate, perhaps in a catch-up for wage gains that we didn’t see   earlier in the cycle  Third, as a result of working more and earning more, I suspect that workers   may continue to spend more, particularly with the gift of what seems to be relatively low oil   prices, in the mid-fifties  The oil price seems to me to have less of a risk premium and now   January 30-31, 2007 80 of 255    appears to reflect some elevated supply and at least modestly lower demand  In sum, with   respect to the consumer side, I am reasonably well confident    I’ll spend just a moment on the business side of the equation  Fourth-quarter profits   appear to be quite good, with two-thirds of companies beating estimates  As many of these   companies are challenged to have double-digit earnings in 2007, they may look for other avenues   in which to buy those earnings—in the M&A world—or increase cash outlays through share   repurchases from their excess cash on the balance sheet to maintain earnings per share growth in   the double digits  Another alternative is that they might choose to increase cap-ex as many of us,   including myself, would have expected them to do earlier in this cycle  Doing so could have a   negative effect on short-term earnings but would show some real confidence in their long-term   investment and growth plans  As already mentioned, shipments and orders fell in the fourth   quarter, and our working explanation is that much of that fall is really an inventory adjustment    We’ve had that discussion for a while  I would expect business investment and industrial   production to pick up  If it doesn’t do so in the first quarter, my confidence about this side of the   economy, about this leg of the stool, will be significantly reduced  Between now and the next   time we meet, we will have a better sense of whether that turn on the business side of the   economy is real or whether we just saw a false start in December  So I think we’ll be able to   come to a much firmer view when we meet in six weeks  All in all, I remain reasonably   confident and optimistic about the forecast  Thank you, Mr Chairman      Thank you, Mr Chairman  Let me spend a minute talking about a market   issue before turning to the language  We’ve talked a bit and Vincent talked a bit about option-  implied measures of uncertainty about the policy path, which are near historical lows  That’s   certainly the case now, and it was the case when we last met  Even though the expected path of   policy and market prices have moved much closer to our own in the past two months, it’s as though   the markets are saying—to be a touch glib—“always certain, rarely right”  I would have thought   that we would have seen market uncertainty about the policy path change along with their view that   we were going to take less-dramatic action over the past six weeks  That tells me that market   measures of uncertainty may not be altogether accurate here, and that’s a troubling sign as we try to   figure out whether they are really telling us about uncertainty or whether they are a separate bet   unrelated to our future policy actions   Today I, too, favor maintaining the federal funds rate target, and I generally share the views   expressed in alternative B  As Governor Kohn suggests, the jump from “mixed” to “rebounding” as   the operative word suggests a reaction to the data that strikes me as somewhat more positive, at the   same time that my own sense hasn’t changed dramatically over the past six weeks  While the   January 30-31, 2007 119 of 255    markets seem to have moved dramatically, we have really been a rock in this process  The markets   have come closer to us, and so I’d rather not appear overly reactive to some very recent data   With respect to section 4, I was concerned at one point that the words “the Committee   judges that some inflation risks remain” seemed a little too dovish  Through the minutes and the   speeches of our colleagues, that wording has come to mean exactly that inflation is more of a   concern than anything else  So in some ways it has become ossified but true, and so I don’t see the   benefit of going to alternative C  With that, I generally support alternative B and suspect that we   shouldn’t be making many more dramatic changes than that     Thank you, Mr Chairman  In my views, I associate most closely with   President Stern  So I will avoid going through all eight questions and will provide perhaps three   further thoughts on what President Stern talked about—first, on what our dominant goal is;   second, on what the benefits of going forward are; and third, on how we might go to market with   something along these lines     First, with respect to the dominant goal, I think, as Governor Bies and many others have   talked about, it is our credibility  Our credibility today is somewhat asymmetric, in the sense   January 30-31, 2007 194 of 255    that I think that we have a lot more credibility that we could lose in this exercise than we could   gain  Not only is the credibility of this institution very high, but I would say it is even higher   than it was six months ago  That suggests to me that we should go slowly, conservatively, and   prudently through this process  How does that relate to forecasts?  When I think about the   forecasts that we considered yesterday for the fourth quarter, which has passed, I’d say that our   staff does a better job than anyone on Wall Street or than many of us could have done alone, but   we see the errors involved—which is not at all a criticism but a reality of the business we’re in  I   hesitate to think about making forecasts four times a year, including periods we were quite far   into, and about how that affects our credibility  Instead of extending into a third or fourth year, I   would think about making forecasts in a going-forward, rolling eight quarters way so that we   would always have a full two years in front of us  We wouldn’t be in some ways culpable for   making an error of information that we really should know in the market’s expectation  It does   strike me as a little odd that our forecast period changes by virtue of our current calendar  I think   about that from a credibility standpoint  I don’t want to mess up in front of these markets so   obviously    I’d put the question of frequencies in the context of what benefits we are trying to   achieve  It seems to me that the predominant benefit is strengthening the transmission   mechanism of monetary policy between us and the capital markets and the reaction function of   the capital markets back to us  If we provided forecasts four times a year, I fear that our numbers   might replace the markets’ own forecasts  That is, they might say, “Well, I’m a little bit more   robust in my views than the Fed  So I’m going to take their numbers and add a couple of tenths,   because I’m the chief economist at Morgan Stanley” or Merrill Lynch or Goldman Sachs  I   worry that our numbers might end up polluting the quality of the information they go out with,   January 30-31, 2007 195 of 255    and then we would be reading back their numbers and saying, “Boy, our numbers look a lot like   theirs  Aren’t we very good at this?”  I worry about that transmission mechanism effect   In   terms of the quantitative and qualitative information we put forward, the focus really should be   on what Don described as the story, the narrative—one that Wall Street and the rest of our   constituencies, like Capitol Hill, can think about, ask tough questions about, and try to interpret    What we get back then in terms of their quantitative and qualitative assessment could be better    All of that speaks to the focus on the narrative rather than on the numbers    Finally, how would we go forward with whatever we conclude, and what would be the   best means of ensuring that this incremental work that we’re doing has the beneficial effects that   we hope for?  To achieve this goal efficiently—I’ll use words that may be a bit more glib than I   intend—we should use a “benevolent leader” model  I’m not saying a “benevolent dictator”   model in which we all say, “Hey, Chairman, here are our best views; they are all yours”  Nor is   the model a pure democracy, where all nineteen of us parade, “These are my numbers  This is   my view of the world  These are my estimates”  In which case we provide more information,   but I’m not sure we’ve really helped the cause of what the Fed is trying to achieve  The   “benevolent leader” model probably falls somewhere between the two  With that model, we   would use the opportunity or the timing of the monetary policy testimony, when everyone’s   attention is on the Chairman and the Fed for those macro forecasts  The Chairman would report   the work product, and the work product would have two pieces  The first—and I don’t mean to   prioritize one over the other—would be the Chairman’s work product, which would incorporate   the views of others as he sees fit, and he might well want to reference where his views coincide   with the central tendency and where they differ  But in that we ought not to constrain the   Chairman  In that way, I don’t view the Chairman, in his testimony or in his announcement of   January 30-31, 2007 196 of 255    projections, as the press spokesman for the FOMC  Those are his views  But second, and very   much alongside his views, he would present our views  His presentation of our views is useful in   making certain that a lot of attention is focused on them  In answer to one of the questions from   the subcommittee, in some ways we might well be delegating to him the ability to draw a central   tendency and make appropriate conclusions  I trust in his ability to do this  If a future Chairman   doesn’t think independently and honestly provide accurate views of what the Committee   members have said, the Committee has plenty of checks and balances at its disposal to make sure   that we have some discipline over that second half  So that’s an appropriate way to think about   getting the most bang for the buck of this incremental work with which we’re proposing to go   forward  One of the memos said that the public is likely to place the most weight on a forecast   made by the entire Committee  I think that’s true only if the Chairman’s views happen to   coincide with the Committee’s  If the Chairman’s views differ from the Committee’s views—  which I presume is not impossible—it is not obvious to me that the statement in the memo is   correct  If the Chairman’s views differed substantially, there would be, for better or for worse,   different power centers and sources of information, and I think the markets would be looking at   each  So that’s perhaps another reason that I think this “benevolent leader” model might be the   best way to go forward  Those are just some preliminary thoughts  Thank you       Thank you, Mr Chairman  Let me say at the outset that I believe the   moderate-growth scenario is the most likely for 2007  But as many of you have already discussed, I   had thought that business fixed investment particularly was a very real upside opportunity and now   March 20-21, 2007 61 of 196    consider it a very real downside risk  The Greenbook marked down BFI over the next couple of   quarters, but I think there’s further reason to be concerned about it   Let me confine the rest of my remarks to the market tumult of the past several weeks and   give you my views on that, which are broadly consistent with what Bill said at the outset  First, my   sense of what the markets seem to be telling us is that the real economy is weaker  The first-quarter   earnings numbers that Bill showed us very much reflect a trend that we could be seeing more of and   that suggests some downside risk in the equity markets that Governor Kohn referred to a moment   ago  A markdown of data in the fourth quarter of 2006, disappointing data regarding business fixed   investment, the weakness in the subprime market, and so forth suggest to me that perhaps the   markets have been reacting to a US domestic economy that is in somewhat weaker shape than we   could have expected even a couple of months ago     What was the cause of the market tumult of the past several weeks?  When markets cannot   single out a proximate cause, they have a tendency either to construct one or to be completely   dismissive  In my view, some subset of rather sophisticated investors over the past six months or so   have been looking for an opportunity, or maybe I should say an excuse, to pull back from certain   markets in which credit-risk spreads have been unusually low; and over the past several weeks, they   found one  There has been a generalized discomfort with markets priced for perfection and levels of   volatility that seem uncorrelated with the real world which we’re all trying to analyze  Many of us   have noted in speeches during the past couple of quarters that we have been surprised by the level of   certainty implied in market prices, and I think that message is now starting to find its way into the   marketplace  So the tumult and volatility that we’ve seen in the past several weeks will, as it   continues, make it more difficult for us to gauge what’s going on   March 20-21, 2007 62 of 196    Might this financial market tumult then actually affect the real economy going forward?    Generally, I would have said that these financial market activities are quite distinct from the real   economy  But in the case of business fixed investment, I can’t help but believe that the market   uncertainty, the talk of recession, the animal spirits that certainly have been negatively affected—all   might affect some boards of directors and management teams that are trying to decide about   whether to step on the gas on cap-ex or might get them to retreat even further  Given strong balance   sheets, incredibly strong operating cash flows, and all of the momentum that they should have, I’m   as puzzled as Tim Geithner as to why we haven’t seen that capital investment  The tumult in the   markets in recent weeks gives me more reason to be concerned there  Perhaps these management   teams are going to find share buybacks to be even more compelling compared with the alternative   of capital investment     In general, I took the volatility of the markets at first blush as probably being a proper wake-  up call to folks who had gotten perhaps a little too complacent about what was going on,   particularly in the credit markets  Having spent a lot of time in New York in the past several weeks,   I think that, if that was a wake-up call, many market participants seem to have hit the snooze button    [Laughter]  Many are reviewing their portfolios and risk positions certainly, and we are seeing a bit   more caution  Perhaps that’s justified by real economic fundamentals or by some lemming   phenomenon  That is, most of these investment banks and other asset managers have in front of   them as they’re making decisions a credit-risk button and a client-risk button  Over the past couple   of years, they have always hit the client-risk button—that is, I don’t want to take client risk; I don’t   want to lose this business  So they have hit that button, and the credit markets have been so   accommodative and the syndicated markets so strong that they’ve been able to make some free   money there  For a short, short window after February 27, they seem poised to hit the credit-risk   March 20-21, 2007 63 of 196    button  One senior credit-risk officer at a major institution told me that he was very popular again    People wanted him in every meeting as they were making underwriting commitments  He called   me back a few days later and said, “No one wants to talk to me again”  [Laughter]  So I worry   whether that wake-up call has actually been felt   Now, could this market volatility of recent weeks spread beyond the subprime market and   lead to the kind of credit crunch that would have meaningful downside risks to the economy?  I tried   to imagine the circumstances in which that would come  First, I looked at financial intermediaries,   and rather than trying to distinguish between commercial banks and investment banks, hedge funds,   and other private equity, I tried to think about them as being creators of credit, distributors of credit,   or holders of credit, forgetting all other labels that are associated with them  Typically, before the   rather robust capital markets of the past several years, most of these institutions would decide which   of those areas they would be in   Do they create products and get them off their books, or do they   make big bets by deciding what to hold and not?  Many of them have now decided that they could   be in all three businesses  All three businesses were profitable  To the extent that a portfolio   position no longer fit, they could sell it or syndicate it very quickly  In this new environment,   however, with new volatility, these portfolio holdings over time may prove harder to liquidate, and   the out-of-the-money options that the creators of structured products have been writing may no   longer be free  A couple of weeks ago, Warren Buffett described one of these financial hedge fund   phenomena  He described the groups as the “innovators, the imitators, and then the swarming   masses of incompetents”  [Laughter]  I won’t describe who is in what category in these markets,   but many financial institutions seem to be following one particular premier investment bank that has   managed to be a creator of products, to be a syndicator, and to be taking very large principal   positions   March 20-21, 2007 64 of 196    What happens if these other financial institutions get uncomfortable as these markets   tighten, to the extent that they decide that they no longer want to be in the equity bridge business?    To cite one example, which President Fisher raised, in a very large, highly leveraged transaction   recently, a couple of the investment banks decided to put up a couple billion dollars of capital, and   they were short some equity checks  Typically, they would then go to a series of other banks, bring   them into the deal, and then try to syndicate that quickly  But the first investment banks that were   involved wanted to make sure that there was no competition in the syndicated market  So three   non-US financial institutions wrote $1 billion checks for an extremely small fee and agreed to hold   that billion dollars of equity on their own balance sheets for a term of not less than 365 days and to   syndicate it later only to those who would be satisfactory to the lead investment banks  To what   extent over the next twelve months will they and others feel uncomfortable in this new business   environment with that kind of equity exposure?  If that process ends up being disorderly, there could   be a rapid turn to risk aversion  Of course, I think the more likely case is that this is orderly and   supportive of sustainable growth, but that’s the financial situation in which I would get very nervous   very quickly   I think a second mechanism by which the situation could become worse involves a whole   set of legal risks around the subprime markets and uncertainty generally over where liability rests    Through the good intentions of policymakers in the Congress and in state legislatures, some   uncertainty could be introduced into the foreclosure market and into the syndication markets Many   enterprising state attorneys general seem poised to do just the same, and that kind of legal risk could   be very dangerous for these credit markets   Finally, what does that situation mean for us?  I suspect that, besides our needing to keep a   focus on these financial markets, it is what’s happening in the real economy  As we’ll discuss a bit   March 20-21, 2007 65 of 196    more tomorrow, our statement should be and will necessarily be read in the context of our reaction   to incoming real data as opposed to our reaction to what’s happening in the financial markets    Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I also generally share the views of alternative B   and favor maintaining the federal funds rate today  I thought what I’d do is just highlight a couple   of things  First, I think the statement needs to be reflective of the real economy rather than financial   markets, as we discussed yesterday  So let me spend a moment on the reference to “still-favorable   financial conditions” in alternative B  I think the financial conditions are still favorable, and so   that’s an honest depiction of events, as is the rest of the statement after the reference to coming   quarters  I think the question really is, If we enter the debate over describing the financial   conditions, how do we get out of it?  So when we meet next, I’m wondering how we’ll then   describe the financial conditions  Or if we stop any reference thereto, what is that saying?  That is, I   think these markets are adjusting in a very orderly way  I don’t feel now, as I feared a few weeks   ago, that we would have to say and do things to ensure that adjustment occurs  If we don’t refer to   these financial conditions and we continue to suggest that we think the economy will expand at a   moderate pace over the coming quarters, that in itself shows that we have some degree of comfort   that the financial market tumult hasn’t really changed our central tendency  So though I’m   comfortable with the honest depiction of all of alternative B, I worry a bit about what our exit   strategy is  I can’t come up with a better way in which to refer to financial conditions without   inviting that discussion, and so I’m left with puzzlement about an exit strategy on that question    The most important thing that we’re accomplishing in alternative B is suggesting that we aren’t   going to come to the rescue of market tumult, that market discipline is working, that we don’t want   March 20-21, 2007 95 of 196    complacency in the markets, and that our job is not to make sure that people make money in those   markets  Our job, as many of you have said, is to keep the economy on an even keel  So with that,   I favor alternative B, but I will remain a little uncomfortable until someone can tell how we answer   the question about what we do next regarding the reference to still-favorable financial conditions     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I thought I would just state a few points as sort   of a predicate before diving into the questions  First, I probably have a bit of a financial market bias   on this topic, and I would begin by saying that the financial markets rightly or wrongly already   believe that we have some form of inflation targeting  So that’s in some ways my own jumping-off   point  I’ll admit that it’s soft  It’s confusing  It’s a little bit ugly  There is a lot of ambiguity, but   the question that’s ripe for consideration is what the relative benefits and costs are of establishing a   more crystal clear objective from that point  Second, as background with respect to the economic   forecasts, the financial markets have necessarily been forced to construct their own narratives  In   fact, until very recently, really until the past year or so, they’ve not focused a lot on our projections    I’m quite encouraged that over the past twelve months they’ve spent more time and attention on   them  So it strikes me that there’s a much clearer case for real net benefits in elevating and   explaining our projections  As a final jumping-off point, I would say that the outcome that weighs   March 20-21, 2007 161 of 196    quite heavily in my assessment of this subject is what quadrant we want to avoid  I drew for myself   a simple two-by-two figure  Establishing a target and not establishing a target are on the Y axis,   and success and failure are on the X axis  In some ways our job is to avoid establishing a target and   failing  We’re trying to avoid that quadrant  That quadrant strikes me as considerably worse than   staying in some ambiguity, such as where we are now, and over time, as I think President Poole   rightly warns, worried that we might fail  It strikes me as important that there is somewhere to go   and that we still have an out  We can adopt some kind of shock treatment, as other countries with   far less credibility have done  So I would say that the basis of my answer to these questions is really   trying to avoid that quadrant   In weighing the relative benefits and costs, I’m more convinced that the benefits are small   than that the costs are small  I’m really not sure about the costs  For all the discussion that we’ve   had here and for all that’s been written publicly about the inflation-targeting question, what is far   more important than our enunciation of an inflation target is the way it works in practice  As to the   points that President Stern made about our accountability and credibility, we could agree on the   perfect inflation target with the perfect ranges and have that all work perfectly, but if we and our   successors don’t abide by the rules that we set, then all is for naught  It reminds me a bit of the   discussion that occurs in the Congress about tax policy  They fight over whether tax policy is   permanent, they spend a lot of time debating that back and forth, and it is not permanent because   other Congresses can immediately undo what they did  So I’m a bit hesitant to suggest that, even   with our best intentions and even with unanimity around this room, over time we wouldn’t be   sending mixed messages to the marketplace as our preferences change and as our membership   changes   March 20-21, 2007 162 of 196    With that, let me go to the questions at hand  I would reserve the right not to make a final   judgment on the price stability goal questions until we conclude our thinking to a significantly   greater extent on the economic projections  Should we define a numerical objective?  Ultimately   there may be net benefits to establishing the objective, but I’m not yet convinced as to the gains    Maybe even more important, I would prefer not to implement any final decision on the numerical   objective until we have made progress and have implemented the economic projections, and I’ve   really tried to focus on not prejudging the latter question  Why should those two issues be   separated?  I think they should for a couple of reasons  First, these projections are going to be   terribly important, and if we bundle them with our answer on the inflation target question, we would   be stepping on our own message and on our own focus  There’s a lot here for the capital markets to   swallow, particularly as many people around this room have described what they’re trying to   achieve  I feel as though the projections would become relegated to the back burner in public   discussion if they were placed in tandem with an announcement on the numerical objective   I’m also worried about the timing of the rollout  It’s easy for me to say that I would rather   the times to be more benign before we make a decision on the numerical objective  That might be   foolhardy  There may just not be a perfect time in which to take this step, but, boy, I’d certainly be   more comfortable if we announced an inflation target with which we were at that very moment   broadly consistent  To the extent that we’re not, in my own thinking about credibility and   accountability, I would in answer to the rest of the questions let my numbers be a little higher and   my timing be a little more robust  My vital sense in combining these two questions is that slow and   steady will win this race and that it would be hard to walk back from a numerical objective if we’re   unable to accomplish it properly, whereas I think we have only gains to be made from taking this in   stages   March 20-21, 2007 163 of 196    Regarding the question of whether it should be a point or a range, my answer is perhaps too   practical  I think the ranges—for example, those that we’ve given on economic projections—have   been broadly misinterpreted by the markets  If we look at the monetary policy testimonies and let’s   just say, for purposes of exposition, that each of our forecasts in the central tendency is between 2   and 3 percent, that range gets reported, and I think it is understood as the FOMC’s belief that the   economy will grow between 2 and 3 percent next year, which is quite different from the statements   that we’ve made  That is, we all have different uncertainty bands around our projections, but the   range, even in the context of a numerical objective, is harder to explain  My preference would be, if   we were to go down that path, to establish a point and suggest that there could be variance around it   most of the time  In that way, misses could be frequent, and the judgments that we made would be   perceived to be less mechanical and less formulaic   With respect to the time horizon, certainly these words would be discussed in association   with one another  The language with which I would be most comfortable would be that the goal   should be generally achieved in the long term in a manner consistent with the dual mandate  A   flexible horizon is more useful for us to demonstrate consistency with previous Fed actions  It’s   more consistent with our focus on evolution and is more suggestive that we’re not somehow   crossing the Rubicon here  This is really what we have long done, and we’re simply taking a next   logical step  I don’t feel strongly about the question of the price index  Obviously, as Governor   Kohn suggested, the more long term the focus is, the less the index matters   In terms of the group versus individual dynamics, I find it hard not to argue that a consensus   view is far preferable  I would point out one consequence of the other way  If the judgments end   up being too diffuse, too individualistic, we might actually get some negative value on our   communication with the financial markets  My sense is that unanimous is great, close to unanimous   March 20-21, 2007 164 of 196    is pretty good, and if we get much below a strong, strong majority, I am worried about mixed   messages as this policy gets rolled out   In terms of the projections, on which I don’t think we’ve spent a ton of time in today’s   discussion—nor was that its purpose—I just reiterate that most of our judgments here are forward   looking  Most of our determinations on policy are data dependent  By focusing on the projections   as a first step, I think we can put the markets, broadly defined, in better recognition of what that   means  I support the trial run in May  I suppose that the confidentiality around that dry run is   essential to making it successful  If word of that dry run found its way into a broader constituency, I   think we’d very quickly find ourselves having to make decisions before being ready to do so  What   I’ve seen of the narrative from the staff I thought was very good, but I still am troubled about   whether we can describe our uncertainty in a sufficiently robust way  I thought that was a very   good swing at it, but I reserve the right to revisit that note so that it conveys our sense of uncertainty   without sounding too obscure  Thank you, Mr Chairman      Thank you, Mr Chairman  My own views on the economy haven’t   changed much since we last met and aren’t terribly at odds with the Greenbook  I’d highlight a   couple of reasons for concern, a couple of areas in which the misses could be severe  I share the   views expressed by many around the table, most recently by Governor Kohn, on the inflation   front  I remain quite concerned about inflation prospects, and I’m keeping a wary eye on   inflation expectations, particularly if there were to be acceleration in the trends on commodity   prices or the foreign exchange value of the dollar  My sense is that the markets haven’t fully   taken into account what that could be, and we could find the markets more preoccupied with an   inflation scare than they appear to be at this moment  So I think that, during the balance of ’07,   the inflation risks tend to be more significant than the growth risks, and I would expect to see   sequential increases in GDP, as in the Greenbook, as we go through the next several quarters    The big point of what that is predicated on is really the continued accommodation in the credit   markets and the capital markets, as several people have noted   I was thinking about my projections and, as we look to ’08 and ’09, the bigger risks there   tend to be more policy oriented as we head into the next election, and they may well have some   effect on the capital markets  So as I think about the second half of ’08 and the first half of ’09   May 9, 2007 58 of 130    and what the likely GDP implications would be, I can’t help but think that changes or perceived   changes in tax policy and trade policy could be the biggest drivers to the capital markets and, as   a result, have the biggest effects on the macroeconomy  So there are huge risks, as I look beyond   ’07, in terms of where GDP might come out; but as a central case, the Greenbook formulation   looks roughly in accord with my own   Let me spend a moment on consumption  My view is broadly consistent with what others   have said earlier today  I spoke in the past week with one credit card company whose customer   base is similar to the average aggregate customer base in the United States  They have about   one-fifth of all credit card spending, and they reported to me their April results, which might   provide us with some clues about PCE growth and credit quality  Card spending for April, from   their perspective, was consistent with moderate deceleration in real consumption  They ended up   in April with nominal year-over-year growth of about 4 percent in non-auto retail sales, which is   a slowdown from the fourth quarter of ’06 and a slowdown from January, but it is up a bit from   February and March, when they were getting quite despondent and were worrying a bit about   their projections for the next three quarters  They think their April numbers look okay, quite   consistent with the moderate deceleration that many folks here have talked about  They believe   that they have hit the floor on that, but time will tell  What they have not been able to do, at least   up to the time of my discussions with them, is to break out retail purchases outside fuel to find   out whether less strength is there than the 4 percent top-line number would suggest  I suspect   that would be the case  How all this fits into market expectations we’ll know over the next   couple of days  This strikes me as an average, okay number that may be a touch better than   market expectations, but it shouldn’t give us a whole lot of comfort if we’re trying to suggest that   there is a robust recovery on consumption and PCE  Credit quality remains very strong across   May 9, 2007 59 of 130    consumer credit and the company’s mortgage products  I would note that they don’t have much   subprime in their portfolio—what is subprime has fallen to that level rather than having begun   there when they issued the credit  Payment rates, use of credit lines, delinquencies, charge-  offs—all are at very positive levels with little indication of more-serious weakening of consumer   demand  So, again, I think the prospects outlined by the Greenbook in terms of PCE look   broadly consistent with the April numbers   Let me turn now to the capital markets and the credit markets and speak about three or   four observations that may be a bit more newsworthy than when we last met six weeks ago    First, I will talk a little about the dearth of defaults in corporate loans, then spend a couple of   moments on private equity, building on Bill Dudley’s discussion at the outset on the correlation   among asset classes, and finally spend a moment on the shakeout in the mortgage markets  The   predicate for this is something that we all know, and several people have spoken about earlier   today  As corporate America has become more cautious, Wall Street has become more   aggressive to satisfy investors’ appetites for risk  So we’re seeing risk aversion in one category   on Main Street and real risk-seeking behavior on Wall Street  Financial risk-taking remains high   and may well have even increased since we last met  If you’ll look at the MOVE options index   measuring one-month volatility on Treasuries, it’s the lowest it has been in about nine years,   since the index came into being, and it suggests President Minehan’s point that all the forces of   liquidity and froth that might be in the market are probably more present today than any of us   could have imagined given the tumult in the markets in late February  At the same time,   nonfinancial corporate risk-taking continues to be more subdued than objective measures would   suggest it should be  There is reason to hope that the cap-ex data will come around to where   many of us expected it to be already, but some determination still needs to be done on that  So   May 9, 2007 60 of 130    we hear, and some of us even say, that these capital markets appear priced to perfection, that   credit markets are as strong as ever, and that liquidity is plentiful  I would add my concern to the   implausibility of that notion, which President Geithner and others spoke about  The reason for   central bankers to worry is, of course, that these narrower spreads provide less of a shock   absorber for unforeseen events   Let me now go through the points that I mentioned at the outset and describe their   implications for the decisions we make  First is the dearth of defaults on corporate loans    Historically low year-ahead default rates were referenced in the Greenbook, and they should give   us comfort, at least in theory  I share the Greenbook view that corporate defaults should increase   as profits level out and leverage increases to more normal levels  But fewer defaults are even   possible in this financing environment, and that makes me a little less sanguine about those data    If we think about covenant packages on corporate loans, both originated on Wall Street and   originated at community banks—I think President Yellen spoke at a previous meeting about   covenant-lite deals—it is incredibly hard to get defaults in the context of these loans, never mind   event-of-default notices and everything else that would find its way into the indentures  As a   result, we have seen a recent spate of financings with covenant packages that are increasingly   issuer-friendly, without triggers that would otherwise cause defaults  no debt payment   schedules, never mind even the need to make interest payments, with the ability to turn those into   sort of pay-in-kind notes  All of that, it strikes me, should make us nervous if business   fundamentals shift abruptly and investors are left with little opportunity to gain access to their   capital or to be in a position to force companies to restructure their operations  As a result I am   less sanguine about these low default data that we continue to receive from Wall Street   May 9, 2007 61 of 130    A second point is the state of private equity in the capital markets  What I note builds on   the recent history that we’ve seen  massive fund-raisings; larger LBOs; increasing leverage; in   the past twelve months, we’ve seen the so-called club deal phenomenon; the growth of equity   bridges, which I and others have talked about; and when we last met, we discussed the interest   many of these firms have for rushing into the capital markets by finding permanent capital  The   newest development is the growth of syndication in the equity placement in these LBO markets    The same way that we have syndicated debt markets that have matured incredibly over the past   six to ten years, on the equity side there are huge investments that are presently being considered   and potentially being made  So one LBO sponsor might fund a certain portion of the equity   check on an LBO and then line up, through an equity syndicate manager at a traditional   investment bank or a commercial bank, the ability to sell down the rest of that equity through an   infrastructure and distribution system that is being built  I doubt that we will see that syndication   market five years from now as deep and as large as the debt markets  But I do think that it shows   us that new liquidity continues to come even to the private placement 144(a) markets alongside   the growth in the public capital markets  That liquidity could well improve tradability  To the   extent that these syndications are new, they show us that liquidity is plentiful; but they also show   us that many of these new mechanisms have not been stress-tested  The other implication of this   boom in private equity is that it has raised the floor on equity prices  My sense is that there is a   private equity put that may well have replaced what used to be thought of as a Federal Reserve   put on the floor of equity prices, and that equity put appears to be larger than it has ever been    Thus we have seen increased total leverage through these structured products; credit markets, as   I’ve mentioned, are more robust; and there is a question of stress testing, which is still to be   determined   May 9, 2007 62 of 130    Another point on the capital markets relates to what Bill said about the correlation among   asset classes  CEOs, CFOs, and chief risk officers of large financial firms have found quite   troubling the greater correlation among asset classes than most of their internal models had   suggested  As they looked at their dashboards in the weeks after the tumult that we saw last   February, they grew increasingly uncomfortable about whether they had accurately measured   what their firms’ downside risks are  Certainly it’s encouraging, as Bill showed us, that there   appears to be less correlation over recent weeks  That’s a lesson being learned and relearned and   tested and retested in these institutions  That they may be heeding the wakeup call is good news,   but time will tell whether it will be enough to catch up before problems arise in the market    My final point concerns the consequences of a shakeout in the mortgage markets  My   sense is that, after the fallout in subprime, the market is becoming more consolidated with larger,   more-sophisticated lenders that can more quickly provide more markets that satisfy customers’   newest wants  The success in these markets of investment banks and hedge funds will go to   those with scale, with strong distribution systems, and with control over their servicing   businesses, so that they are effectively able to engineer workouts and avoid the need to foreclose    I think that over the balance of this year we will hear more news from small and medium-sized   commercial banks that feel as though their market share is being taken away during this tumult,   and that is something that we need to continue to observe  With that, Mr Chairman, I’ll save the   rest of my comments for the next round     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I favor alternative B and think that there is a   very heavy presumption against our changing the language much from our March statement    From all that I’ve heard today, I don’t think we have even convinced ourselves that we have   matched that presumption or overcome that burden of persuasion  So though I’ve had some   sympathy in isolation to the Stern suggestion, I don’t think this is the right time to take it up in   light of our experience of the last statement  For several days, we had the markets focused on us   rather than on the data  What you, Mr Chairman, and others have done over the most recent   period is to try to get the markets to be dependent on the data rather than to look at us  These   changes in language—whether the Stern amendment or something else at this point—do just the   reverse of that  I don’t think this is a good time for nuance in the markets, and so I don’t think   our substitution there would be good  I don’t think we can agree, even among ourselves, what   the Stern amendment would do—whether it’s hawkish or dovish; and if we can’t, I hardly think   May 9, 2007 97 of 130    it’s a good prescription for us to send it out to the markets and have them figure it out for us    [Laughter]   So I strongly favor alternative B  I think the markets will read the change in section 2—  where we say, “Economic growth slowed in the first part of this year”—as “We believe April as   well was quite mediocre”  I think that’s what it means  That’s what we believe, and so that   change is justified by the facts  In terms of the “on balance” language in section 3, I could live   either way, but I don’t see a compelling reason for adding “on balance”  I think the markets still   want to see in us a reflection of what they believe  They believe that we’re cutting, that our   credibility on inflation is real, but that we’re just being a little cute now  I wouldn’t want to give   them an excuse to say that we’ve taken our foot off the accelerator, that we’re less concerned   about inflation  It is just one data point, so I’d prefer to leave it without “on balance” as it was   previously  That’s it  Thank you      Thank you, Mr Chairman  Regarding overall economic growth, my   own macroeconomic views are not inconsistent with the central tendency of the projections   that were pulled together for this meeting  I think the staff and the participants around the   table deserve significant credit for being stubborn about the moderate-growth hypothesis   while markets have been on all sides of it  The markets appear ready to look through the   second-quarter GDP growth number, which appears to be a bit above trend  I’d say that we   have gotten some credit from the markets for being stubborn and stubbornly right on our   economic forecast, but they certainly haven’t given us their proxy, and I would not expect   them to do so  They happen to share our views for now is what I would say, and I wouldn’t   expect that situation to remain over the forecast period  Again, neither should our intention   be to somehow get these curves to match over the coming several quarters   On the inflation picture, though it has improved a bit—and I am trying not to   disregard very good news—I must say that it strikes me as thoroughly unconvincing  To   me, inflation, in our old statement language, remains the predominant risk  I am less certain   that core will continue the recent trend  I do believe that headline inflation may be telling us   something in terms of secular trends around energy and food that we can’t dismiss, and the   June 27-28, 2007 78 of 261    warnings from some of the other signals that we would see as rough proxies for inflation are   still very real   Regarding what the financial conditions are telling us about growth, it strikes me   that, from all the data we have received between our last meeting and this, financial   conditions might be as different as any other sets of data that we received  My view is that   financial conditions are still supportive of growth, but somewhat less so  It is hard to   determine at this point how much, but let me take a stab at doing just that  Since we last   met, as Bill said at the outset, we witnessed ten-year Treasury yields increase on the order of   between 30 and 50 basis points  I am not uncomfortable with that incremental tightening of   policy in the financial markets, but we have to be careful of what we wish for  I think the   explanation from our staff here in Washington and Bill and the staff in New York is right,   which is that markets have not come to a rosier view of the future  All they have really done   is to take out the downside risk that came out of the first quarter  As the data came in a bit   above expectations, that insurance bet that they had—that we were wrong and would have   to cut rates—really lost credibility  I think their central view of the economy now is not one   that roars back but one that is quite consistent with the moderate growth story  The financial   markets have indeed tightened policy somewhat  Even since the time that the Bluebook was   produced last week, spreads have apparently widened in addition to the risk-free rate being   somewhat higher  But this is all happening in very real time, and my report a week ago   would have sounded quite a bit different from the one today   We have witnessed increased term premiums and greater volatility across many, if   not all, financial markets  Both the MOVE index for Treasuries and the VIX for equities are   high relative to the averages of the past year but are still fairly reasonable over a somewhat   June 27-28, 2007 79 of 261    broader period—say, the last five years  Term premiums I would characterize as returning   to more-normal levels—but, again, not out of line with history   We have seen in the Bluebook that credit default swap (CDS) spreads and other   spreads had widened, but that yet hadn’t happened in the high-yield market, where   apparently there was some narrowing of spreads  That has changed rather dramatically in   the past four or five trading days  I’m sure Vince will share more information on this   tomorrow  But the CDS spreads really occurred first; then there was a lag to high-yield   spreads  In the past two weeks, investment-grade CDS spreads have widened about 7 basis   points, high-yield CDS spreads have widened about 20; a relatively new index of loan CDS   spreads has widened about 65 basis points; and most, if not all, structured products, even   assets wholly unrelated to the housing markets, have been undergoing some spread   widening  As I mentioned, high-yield spreads appear to be catching up to CDS spreads, and   with the incredible flow of deals in the market, I would guess that the trend continues    We’re seeing higher financing costs and slightly tougher terms for LBOs; the latter is a   remarkable new development  M&A prices, probably for the first time since I have been   sitting at this table, appear in the markets to be coming off their levels  So when auctions   for properties of publicly traded companies are occurring, the price between initial   indications of interest and final bids for the first time may actually be coming down   Why is that?  Interest coverage ratios cannot go much below where they have been   in this cycle  It is 12 or 13 times, but again, as the risk-free rate has gone up, as spreads   have widened, you can buy just a little less debt for that  As a result, equity players that do   not want to compromise their equity returns can pay a little less for these properties    Whether this phenomenon is very short term, like the phenomena we heard about after the   June 27-28, 2007 80 of 261    tumult in late February and we returned to in the heady days of the capital markets, I do not   know  This may just be a temporary preference shift toward quality and toward higher   volatility and a return to the “glory” days, but I tend to think not  It is a tough call, and I   reserve the right to change my judgment   I think that the new supply that’s coming into the markets, most of which needs to   get priced before the markets slow down in August, will test the markets’ resilience, will test   prices, and will test terms  Up to this point we have seen very little reduction in liquidity,   but we are seeing a few deals being pulled from the market  Pricing power appears to be   coming back to investors, and negotiations around prices and terms seem significantly more   balanced than they have been in a very long time  Some of the instruments that we have sort   of giggled about around this table—the pay-in-kind notes with optional cash payment—  seem to have lost some traction in the market in the past week  I do not know whether they   will return, but I take this new discipline in the markets as an encouraging sign  So what is   going to be the resulting effect on prices, terms, and conditions?  That is something we will   have to judge; but financial conditions, as I said at the outset, are perhaps somewhat more   restrictive than they were, but they should still be quite supportive of growth   At the outset I talked about the risk on the inflation front  Let me build on a couple   of remarks that Vice Chairman Geithner made about risks now in the financial markets  If   the problems that we have seen around structured products that have come out of the Bear   Stearns scenario are really about the subprime markets and subprime collateral and housing,   there’s not much to worry about  But to the extent that the story is really about structured   products—products that have not been significantly stress-tested—then there is a risk that   the financial markets may react and overreact  That scenario will bring up reputational risk   June 27-28, 2007 81 of 261    issues  Even financial intermediaries that are in the agency business are relearning the   lesson that agency business is not free—that there are, in fact, dissynergies from being in the   principal investment business and the agency business under one marketing name  We are   learning a lot about what the markets believe about the transparency of prices, particularly in   times of financial distress  Of course, in times of distress, the correlations among all these   assets do not look as they do in models, and that is something that will play itself out  I   think that Tim rightly referenced the role of gatekeepers in the credit agencies, who I suspect   are going to have a fairly rude awakening over the next six to nine months  As I also said,   regarding this financial innovation, which on net is of great benefit to us, we will really see   some of the products tested  Along with the products, moreover, the market participants’   behavior will be tested, perhaps in this upcoming period, as never before  So the financial   markets are a friend on this, but there is greater risk than there was when we last met  Thank   you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Like many of you, I see no reason to   materially change market expectations about our policy action  It is important that we   not appear more comfortable with either the level or the trend of inflation than we   actually are  Any nods in that direction in the statement are ripe to be misinterpreted, and   the process of fixing any such nod would be tricky  Yesterday Vice Chairman Geithner   said that financial markets are in a delicate place, and I would say that is particularly   relevant in the context of this statement  So I would try not to mess with market   expectations, given what we know about the state of our financial markets  All that   having been said, I support alternative B  I like Governor Kohn’s amendment, and I still   June 27-28, 2007 115 of 261    think we are running a bit of a risk in suggesting to the markets that we are more   comfortable  But I don’t think there is really much we can do at this point to mitigate   that risk more than the Kohn amendment suggests  Thank you     Isn’t there a third alternative?  The minutes are what we actually   discussed, and the other thing is a story  I think President Moskow’s question really   relates to whether or not we are going to try to weave what we actually discussed into   some coherent story or try to make the minutes really be what I suspect they were   originally intended to be, which is what the color and commentary of our discussion   were?     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I also think that your straw-man   proposal really does strike the right balance, and I strongly support it  We probably owe   it to you between now and the fall, or whenever you feel appropriate to be able to go   forward with an announcement, to keep our discussion in this room  Our confidentiality   around this discussion for the past year has been incredibly helpful, and it does strike me   that your ability to frame something that fairly represents your views and our views   without having any of it previewed by us, wittingly or unwittingly, is awfully important     In terms of additional reasons that I think we have the right balance in your   proposal, there has been a discernible difference in the markets in putting data-  dependence into practice  In seeing how the financial markets have reacted to data sets   and how they have struggled with what those data have meant, I think that they seem to   have come a long way from a year or two years ago in understanding how we process   data, rather than looking at the width and depth of our briefcases or the winks and nods of   our statements  I can’t help but think that we have really made some progress down that   path  By putting the projections first and foremost on our list of deliverables to come, we   are going to continue to ask them to do their own homework as opposed to relying on us    If we were to go a step or two beyond that at this point, we might undermine some of   those good market practices that are starting to bear some fruit   June 27-28, 2007 184 of 261    The markets judge us by our actions and not by our words, and that is why I must   say that I don’t think any of these iterations or any of these proposals that we have   discussed is a panacea in and of itself  These proposals and iterations constitute an   appropriate framework for us to continue our dialogue with the markets  By taking this   next step we are going to put some of our words into action by generating these   projections quarterly and seeing what responses we get  I tend to think that we are going   to learn quite a bit through that process  As others have said, while the economic   environment is apparently benign, I think that the political environment and the financial   markets are probably somewhat less so  Maybe that suggests to me another reason for   taking appropriate steps and not going beyond them at this point  Finally, I don’t think   the financial markets are asking for more than your proposal suggests  I think Tim has it   right in some ways—they are still just asking for the answer key  What we are doing   here is finally telling them that we are not going to give them the answer key but that we   will tell them more about what we’re thinking  That will be more than sufficient to that   constituency, and over time we can revisit what we are doing   In terms of details, I will refer to only three items  First, on whether we should be   making our projections under appropriate policy or sharing a fed funds rate path, I am   incredibly concerned that policy forecasts would be misunderstood to be policy   commitments  Again, I think that would undermine much of the good work that we’ve   done  Second, regarding the anonymity of projections and the points that President   Fisher made, I am a little uncomfortable with even these numbers of 1 through 19 with   each of our projections because I think that the veil that we have around us could well be   pierced  Another way for us to get the benefit of that might be for us to individually   June 27-28, 2007 185 of 261    submit our projections to the staff  Then when the staff circulates them for us to review,   they would have the projections aggregated to the extent that we can see granularity but   not be listed as numbers 1 through 19  Obviously, that can be done a lot of ways  But I   am very concerned that, if we were to go with individual projections, we would have   calls and speculation that would make us all hunker down and somehow explain why we   are where we are and be somewhat less interested in hearing where our colleagues are or   in modifying our projections over time  So I would favor even a step back on   anonymity—but only enough, obviously, to give us a view of where our colleagues are     Third, the question that requires probably the most time among the issues that   have been raised is the third year versus some three-to-five-year average  I could change   my views on this, but my instinct is that, if we were to adopt a three-to-five-year window   for that set of data, it might look just a little too cute  I would prefer that we all do our   best to say, “This is about projections”  As we get into a third year, our crystal balls are   cloudier than they are over shorter periods  Over time, if we were to do that with a third   year, in our own ways and our own speeches, we could be elaborating on what that third   year means to us  To some of us it might be aspirational  To some of us it might be   opportunistic  But I would hesitate to go further than that at this point  But, again, I   think this is the right path forward, and obviously discussion will continue  Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I like the statement format and process   and, like Governor Kohn, think that the governance, while it is not urgent to change, will   catch up with the reality and with the expectation  Thank you      Thank you, Mr Chairman  As many of us have discussed around this   table and many of you already mentioned today, it has finally happened  Per earlier discussions,   the much-anticipated repricing of risk is upon us, and I think what we all have quickly   recognized, then and now, is that the diagnosis was the easy part  More difficult is to figure   when the symptoms would manifest themselves; harder still is to understand the second- and   third-order consequences; and perhaps most difficult is to determine whether any treatment is   needed or whether, as the Hippocratic oath suggests, the patient will recover on its own  Even   orderly repricings have fat tails, as Governor Kohn mentioned, and what we find in the   marketplace is complacency replaced very quickly by deep concern  Certainly, this recent   market turmoil looks particularly pronounced in contrast to previous periods when trees appeared   to grow to the sky and markets were priced for perfection in a world that seemed to most of us to   be decidedly imperfect  Let me discuss two distinct matters—first, the state of the financial   markets, building on the presentation from Bill, Tim, and others, and then the harder part, the   impact on the broader economy—before trying to summarize the situation     The financial markets have really provided wind at the back of the broader economy   throughout this most recent period, even until a month ago  I think the open question, and the   August 7, 2007 68 of 136    hardest, is whether those financial markets will prove sufficiently resilient—that is, whether the   underlying shocks to the economy that might occur are exacerbated by this financial market   situation or whether the worst of the outcomes are made less severe by the financial markets    Perhaps it is best to review the dynamics of different asset markets to assess their implications   for credit availability during the forecast period  The threat is that these different asset classes   increasingly look correlated, particularly in times of distress  Certainly, the events of recent   weeks culminating in trading late Thursday and Friday of last week are troubling, driven by a   combination of factors  first, symbolized perhaps by one financial institution that has   unwittingly called its own liquidity into some question; second, a function of a reduction in   confidence in markets themselves—a pullback in liquidity—with considerably less trust in   underlying valuations, underlying collateral, and the underlying structure of markets themselves;   and third, an expectation, at least in the mortgage markets, that there is still another leg down and   so one way bets, at least for a period, appear insufficient to bring other opportunistic capital in at   this point  The pullback was manifested in the difficulty of rolling over extendable commercial   paper, as Bill and others have said, a lack of bid for anything mortgage related, a lack of trust in   credit ratings, and a fear of using financial institutions as counterparties  The next period in my   judgment holds out some promise, but not a guarantee, of opportunistic capital  Certainly, there   are big fund raisings by investment banks and other private pools of capital at remarkable   leverage levels, giving the potential that the pools of liquidity that are on the sidelines could   quickly find their way back into the game     Let me now turn to different asset markets to try to assess when we will know how they   will figure themselves out and make sure that we are able to get some judgments before it is too   late  So I will spend a moment on the bank and leveraged-loan markets, a couple of moments on   August 7, 2007 69 of 136    the subprime market, and another moment on a third bucket of assets, which might be everything   else, as we are trying to figure out whether there is real spreading  First, in the bank and   leveraged-loan market, the volume of loans, as many of you know, is somewhere between   $220 billion and $320 billion of committed capital in the pipeline  The underlying credits still   appear quite strong, and I will tell you that I have a reasonably high degree of confidence that, in   spite of the distress, these markets should work themselves out between now and the next FOMC   meeting  We certainly won’t see any return to the markets that people have gotten used to over   the past several months and years, but I would be surprised if we didn’t see opportunistic capital   coming into these markets and bidding prices  Just to give you some idea, off that denominator   of capital committed, we might see losses on the order of $30 billion or $50 billion  I would say   that’s a fairly conservative estimate  Bank debt, which is the most secured, might have discounts   of 3 to 5 percent, should bids find their way into the market in the coming days; leveraged loans   and high yields, discounts of about 10 percent; and second lien mortgages, discounts of 15 to   20 percent  Almost all of these are largely related to risk premiums, not credit quality  Real   money is still in these businesses  Some of the hot money that was discussed earlier, some of   these CLO buyers, are no doubt gone for some time  I think the most encouraging thing is the   new funds that have begun capital-raising campaigns, even over the past weekend, looking to   buy the distressed securities, market-force the commercial institutions that have been having it   on their books, and mark it to market  Remarkably, many of the same commercial banks are   prepared to stand behind these new leveraged investments with leverage of about 4 to 1  So I   would expect that market to increase pretty quickly  Market functioning there is thus, in my   judgment, likely to improve  Some deals are certainly likely to blow up, relieving some of these   banks of their commitments  But in this market, because there are multiple gatekeepers and   August 7, 2007 70 of 136    because valuing the underlying credit strikes me as not that time-intensive or taxing a process, it   is likely in my judgment that, come fall, we will come to some new equilibrium     I can be far less confident, however, about the subprime mortgage market  My base case   assessment there has a much lower confidence level, both in terms of timing and in terms of   outcome  The subprime market has about $14 trillion in outstandings, and there is considerably   less certainty about the underlying credit  It is harder to measure and appraise the underlying   pools  Recovery rates will be still harder to find  As a final note, which might have struck the   markets last week, apparently more fraud is endemic to these pools, making valuation   increasingly difficult  As a result, I am less comfortable about suggesting what the underlying   losses might be  They might be $100 billion  They could be considerably more  I’m also less   confident that there will be opportunistic capital coming back to these markets over the next   thirty or sixty days  With another leg down, it could take considerably longer  As a result, I am   quite a bit less confident that the market functioning will return as rapidly as we would hope  I   am more concerned that, unlike the multiple gatekeepers we find in the leveraged-loan markets,   for those that relied on the single gatekeepers, the credit-rating agencies, given that their   credibility has been shot, it is much harder to see that this market will unwind itself in a rather   calm and comforting environment, at least over the balance of 2007   The final set of asset markets I’d speak a moment about is “everything else”  What about   everything else that is subject to structured products?  What about everything else that is subject   to complex financial instruments?  Some questions arose late last week about the market   integrity regarding those  I think it is just too hard to judge how that is going to work out  We   are seeing losses showing up in some very unlikely places  I’d like to say that what we have   August 7, 2007 71 of 136    witnessed over the past week is transitory, but for that set of asset markets, it is probably hardest   for me to come to a broader judgment   So what are the effects, then, on the broader economy?  I agree with the point that   President Stern made earlier that this judgment is extremely hard to make  I also agree with   Governor Kohn’s judgment that there is a very real downside risk if some of these financial   market turmoil issues persist  If I look at some of the credit channels and at financial   intermediaries and ask whether they are under stress, I see more dispersion of risk among   similarly situated institutions  Some commercial banks may well be under more distress than   others  I have no doubt that some investment banks are under more distress than others  We see   some of this dispersion in credit default swaps and some of it in equity prices, but my sense is   that the underlying fundamentals of their core businesses are very different from each other and   from their competitors than they’ve been at any point in this cycle  For some of them to take   losses on their own balance sheets of $3 billion, $4 billion, or $5 billion, as an investment bank,   might not be hard to do when many of them have been picking up market share and using their   own proprietary trading and agency businesses to steal customers and revenue from others  But   for the balance, I think it is unclear how it is going to result  With many of the investment   banks’ quarters ending in August, the markets are going to put genuine pressure on them to come   clean with their losses  I expect most, if not all, of them to do so  So I think come mid-  September we’ll have a clearer sense of what their own marked-to-market models suggest  What   about the broker-dealers?  Again, not principally their regulators but I suspect the markets are   going to push them to come clean with what their losses are  Large financial institutions I would   expect, though with less confidence, to take writedowns of their portfolios of leveraged loans and   writedowns to some extent of their mortgage products to try to assure the investing community   August 7, 2007 72 of 136    of their financial positions  I hope that the process would work out this fall, but as I mentioned,   I’m less comfortable that we’re going to get that kind of transparency with the regulated   commercial banks than with some others   Private pools of capital are also undergoing a real shakeout  For those with liquidity   pressures, which will tend not to be the largest hedge funds or private equity funds, we will read   about their problems, and we will read about their closings, over the coming weeks and months    The good news is that the largest among them have used the period of strong liquidity over the   past year to more or less have quasi-permanent capital to term out their loans and provide capital   so that they could take advantage in this period  I understand that there has been very little spike   in margin calls where most of the assets rest in the hedge fund community  So for many of us   who have talked about hedge funds bringing resilience to these markets, this is really a time of   testing  I think the early news for the largest among them is quite positive   Many of you have talked about what the other transmission mechanisms are for having   GDP effects  The wealth effect is real  We have lost about $1 trillion in market capital in the   past twenty trading days, and that can’t be discounted  Questions about board room confidence   and cap-ex in the second half of this year are equally real  My sense is that we are going to   finally use that excess cash on balance sheets that many of us have long talked about  Finally,   with respect to consumer confidence, though I think the recent data suggest that it’s positive, I   suspect that the next set of data we get will show a retreat from those numbers  It is very hard to   judge how real consumers are going to react here   Let me make two final comments  Opportunistic capital is a key here to a smooth   transition  It’s key to ensuring that what happened in the financial markets doesn’t seep its way   into the real economy  Of the equity investors that were using loose credit markets to get equity   August 7, 2007 73 of 136    returns, the most sophisticated are focusing on and looking for equity returns in the debt markets    So many investors previously investing in equity are now looking to the debt markets, where   they see a risk-reward tradeoff that is better than it has been in a long time  That gives me some   confidence that opportunistic capital will come back to some of these markets  That said, rating-  sensitive buyers will no doubt pull back given that ratings are less authoritative  So I will end   where I began, which is looking at economic fundamentals  I think Governor Kohn talked about   how the capital markets, the financial markets, and the labor markets have proven to be   absolutely core to the resilience of the broader economy  To the extent that there is now an   unfortunate timing between weakness in the financial markets and some potential weakness in   underlying credit, we can rely less on the financial markets to come to the rescue, should that   circumstance occur  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Before diving into alternative B, I’d say part of   the reason that we are trying on different clothes around the language in alternative B is that we   have an odd juxtaposition of growth and inflation at this time  That is because the growth risks   seem to be driven largely by a financial market situation that we still don’t totally understand, and   we even have some disagreement about how quickly we will come to that understanding  So unlike   our typical juxtapositions, when we have intermediate concerns about inflation and about growth,   here it strikes me that the differences are in timing and in magnitude—that is, if the downside risk   from the financial markets happens soon and we’re in the middle of it and we just don’t see it yet,   boy, we might know it soon and that could have very ugly outcomes  I think there are differences   here  I also think there are differences in our power  Our power over inflation is pretty darn good,   and we can exercise that kind of judgment  Our power over getting in the middle of these markets   by moving rates ¼ percentage point or moving our language is harder for me to decipher  That’s   why I think the suggestions about the language of alternative B are good ones, and they are hard for   us to all wrestle with     The reason I come down for alternative B as written is that it strikes me that we have two   goals  One is to be as clear as we can be with the markets, notwithstanding their expectations of   August 7, 2007 101 of 136    what we see, and I think alternative B does that  The second goal is trying to buy ourselves some   insurance and some flexibility  I worry that, if we were to drop “predominant,” which has become   part and parcel of their view of where we are, it might turn out that these markets are benign and   this isn’t the storm I talked about just a moment ago, and it will be hard to go back to that word  I   don’t know how we go back to “predominant” in September or in the meeting after that if we have   dropped it  So in some ways I think the question is, as in the Poole approach, Do you drop   “predominant” and move the downside risks to paragraph 2, and is that roughly equivalent to   alternative B as is?  The reason I do not think so is that alternative B as is provides us with more   flexibility to end up dropping the downside risks if that eventuality comes to pass  So for the   reasons that Governor Kohn has given, I think we probably have the right construct here in   alternative B  Thank you, Mr Chairman      Thank you, Mr Chairman  Very briefly, although there is hope in some   markets that what’s going on is a slow but certain practice on price discovery, I think it is accurate   that market functioning has been erratic at best in certain markets  What we have seen, in effect,   has been a real-time global margin call on all leveraged positions, leading to disengagement by   some market participants perhaps induced by fear  Although there are no guarantees, as Governor   Kohn said, I think that this is a natural experiment by which we’re trying to test whether, in fact, a   negative liquidity shock has hit the economy, and we will see who the takers are to these various   moves  Again, I think this move positions us best to buy a little time to see as best we can what the   effects on the real economy are  I strongly support both of these initiatives     Detectable and material, significantly      Thank you, Mr Chairman  As Governor Kohn just suggested, I think   financial market tumult is likely to be of sufficient duration to have a meaningful effect on the   September 18, 2007 77 of 188    real economy  The policies that we’ll be considering later today are unlikely to be a panacea, but   I think that is not a reason for us to avoid taking some smart and preemptive actions  The   recuperation of these financial market trends is positive, but I wouldn’t measure the recovery   period here in weeks or even the next couple of months  I suspect it is going to take longer     The moderate growth story that many of us have been telling and that is reflected in the   Greenbook and has been for some time appears at best case to be even more moderate  The   downside risks and the possibility of some nonlinear events in these financial markets are higher,   perhaps not as high as they might have seemed when we last met by videoconference, but those   prospects are still very real  When we had the videoconference on August 16, there appeared to   be at that moment extremely poor market functioning, necessitating our actions that day  I think   we rightly determined that there was a liquidity shock, maybe even a liquidity crisis, that was   affecting financial intermediaries and that our actions were necessary to stop the liquidity   symptoms from manifesting themselves as a credit crisis  To that end, our work goes on today    The results from that action and the benefit of time seem to have stopped the bleeding, and the   deterioration of financial market conditions has largely ceased  However, although the   improvements at this point are quite encouraging, I don’t think they are yet convincing  Let me   just spend a few moments on the distinct phases of what this financial market distress has looked   like and try to outline, maybe even oversimplify, where we are in that   Phase 1 strikes me as liquidity replenishment by financial institutions and marketmakers   alike  During the past three to four weeks, commercial banks, investment banks, asset managers,   and other private pools of capital have had to reassess their liquidity needs, their cash needs, in   light of the tougher financial market conditions  Today, by and large, they have more cash on   hand than they ever thought would be necessary or prudent  But that liquidity replenishment, at   September 18, 2007 78 of 188    least for the median and stronger firms, is somewhat complete as they evaluate what the risks are   of contingent liabilities coming on their balance sheets and as they reevaluate the stress tests and   the comments of the people and the risk managers who had been telling them that they were ripe   for financial distress  Some degree of confidence has been broken over the past six weeks  I   wouldn’t say it has been reestablished, but I think that is probably one of the things in the post   Sarbanes-Oxley era that are giving the decisionmakers at these financial institutions a little less   interest in diving back into these markets—they learned that maybe what they had at their   disposal or what they thought they knew wasn’t as certain as they had hoped  Many of these   financial institutions during the past several weeks still thought that another leg down was   possible—that strong financial institutions were continuing to ensure, and would continue to   ensure even today, against four-sigma events—and that the best way for them to lose their jobs   in this environment was to be short of liquidity  They are also very focused on what is   happening among their peers  They are very focused on their relative strength, and they certainly   want to be the survivors if the situation gets dramatically worse  All of these are in some ways   ex post rationalizations for why many of these institutions didn’t serve in the shock-absorber role   that we would have expected them to take quickly after market distresses had begun  I think they   are getting used to the new environment  They have long since forgotten the robust times and   the robust profits of the past five years, and they are looking at their capital ratios and getting   some comfort from what their people are telling them  But when we look at these financial   institutions, we are probably more prudent to judge them by their actions rather than what these   capital ratios would suggest  Their actions are still not ebullient  Their actions are still not   overly opportunistic   September 18, 2007 79 of 188    I said before that liquidity is confidence  Well, in times like this, I might be wrong    Liquidity is oxygen  They can’t live without it, and no price can compensate them during this   liquidity replenishment period for a lack of oxygen  I think O2 levels might now finally be   returning, so that they can enter phase 2 of this process, when they are able and willing to part   with their cash  Phase 2, thus, is about finding new market-clearing valuations, being able to   discriminate among differentiated assets, and being able to put opportunistic capital to work    Admittedly, I’d say this valuation phase is less advanced than the liquidity phase, but the process   of price discovery is slowly but surely working its way through these asset classes  High-yield   bonds are one example  Chrysler priced high-yield bonds at 95  A couple of days later they   were trading at 99  Other sorts of leveraged loans and high-yield financing have indicative   prices in the mid-90s, but there are very big pipelines, as we have discussed before, that could   take a while to clear  My best guess is that we won’t see those markets clearing until after the   commercial banks announce their third-quarter results  So in mid-October, we might see a new   estimate of that, but I will admit it’s very hard to say  The price-discovery process around   subprime mortgages is less advanced, but even there we are seeing trading desks asking the   executives on the top floor for balance sheet capital because they see great prices for which they   just need the balance sheet  That those discussions have begun and are somewhat more   advanced than when we last talked is an encouraging sign, but the process of adjustment to the   new market realities will take time  Bill Dudley spoke in great detail about other important   developments—discrimination among asset-backed commercial paper programs being made   depending on sponsor and collateral, financial institutions and the counterparty risk they   represent being differentiated, and commercial banks more so today than even some weeks ago   September 18, 2007 80 of 188    willing to invest in jumbo prime mortgages in the expectation that the securitization markets will   reopen   It strikes me that we are substantially advanced in the liquidity phase and only somewhat   advanced in valuation  That would take us to the third phase  The third phase is about the cost   of capital  We’ll talk about it more in the next round, and optimally I would say that the liquidity   replenishment and valuation necessary would be far more advanced before monetary policy   actions would have to be put into place  But I think we bought ourselves some time, and this   strikes me as the right moment for us to take monetary policy actions  The good news is that we   have seen some tentative progress in those first two phases, and we’ll talk more about our actions   to come   Let me just highlight a few more issues  What are the key challenges?  What are the   things to which we might want to look to see if the situation continues to improve modestly or   reverses itself?  I would look at a few things  First, as you look at some of these SIV structures   and conduits, particularly outside the mortgage assets, to this point they are largely suffering   from a liquidity crisis rather than a credit crisis  That could change if the real economy falters,   and that is an additional reason for us to take monetary action today  Second, many still believe   that it’s not safe to come out and play, and they are continuing to hunker down  I would have   thought, right when this started brewing in the middle of August, that by now folks would have   been more comfortable, but the median person is still more scared than I would have expected    Third, leverage is harder to come by  Even on investments for which the credit work seems   pretty easy, like high yield, it is hard to get leverage alongside these equity placements, making   folks less interested to jump back in a big way because the returns aren’t there  Another   indicator I’d look to is the medium-term note market, which we haven’t discussed a great deal   September 18, 2007 81 of 188    but is really a sibling of some of these other commercial paper markets  They don’t appear to be   too distressed at this time, but as mentioned earlier, I would also look at the mortgage-backed   securities around commercial real estate  The lack of term funding, which we’ll discuss when   we discuss the auction term facility, has put financial market improvements at some risk  Even   though we have been seeing real improvements in recent trading days, the prospect that these   institutions are rolling over their funding and looking for funding every day strikes me as   significantly increasing the tail risk and suggests that we need to take action   Finally, on the real economy, having spoken to a range of credit card companies   yesterday to try to get their sense of three things, I can give I think generally positive reports    First, as a measure of retail sales, the view of institutions that cater to the high end, the middle   end, and the low end is that retail sales in August and through the first two weeks of September   were fine, not great  But when I asked them the question “If you weren’t aware of what was   happening in the financial markets and you were just to review these data, does it look as though   something happened?  Does it look as though there was some exogenous shock?” to a person the   answer was, “No, it looks as though things are coming along okay”  I think that’s reasonably   encouraging  Second, I asked them about the credit quality of consumer behavior, whether   delinquencies for individual credit card behavior at the low, medium, or high end had changed,   and the answer was that they really hadn’t changed much  They can look and find yellow or red   flags, but they said generally that consumer credit quality also looks fine  I’d say the biggest   caution from three or four of these credit card companies came on the corporate side    Corporations wanting to be more protective, being more risk averse during this period, seemed to   have cut back on allowable expenses for things like airlines, hotels, conferences, and the like, so   their corporate credit volume had slowed up somewhat—but, again, nothing overly dramatic    September 18, 2007 82 of 188    Last, I would just share the uncertainty and hesitation that has probably crept its way back into   boardrooms generally as many of these companies outside the financial sector are trying to figure   out what the crystal ball looks like for the real economy  That hesitation is not useful, and as I   said at the outset, I think the best case is that we give up a couple of tenths of GDP  Thank you,   Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Just a quick point on moral hazard—I think   there are fair concerns about it  The losses that have been felt in the markets in the past six weeks—  that money is gone  It is not coming back  It is true that some of these institutions will find new   ways, create new products, buy assets cheap, but that lesson has been learned  Behavior is changed    I won’t say forever [laughter] because that is an awfully long time, but it is changed for purposes of   this cycle  Profit profiles of all these financial institutions are now fundamentally different    September 18, 2007 115 of 188    Nondepository institutions are looking at their access to capital in a dramatically different way,   thinking about whether they have business models that work  So I think it overstates our ability to   suggest that, whether we move 50 or more over the ensuing months, we would somehow fix that   and make things like they once were  So I think the moral hazard argument in this context is really   a straw man that I just wanted, after Governor Kohn’s comment, to kick one more time   In terms of the stance of monetary policy, as we’ve discussed, the equilibrium rate here is a   function of fed funds and a function of what’s happening in the real capital markets  The real   capital markets are fundamentally different, and so a reduction in the fed funds rate today of   50 basis points may or may not be sufficient to find some new equilibrium  I think we will need to   continue to evaluate that as we go forward  Bottom line on the statement, I support alternative B   and the 50 basis point reduction  I think the markets will have some genuine consternation this   afternoon and in the ensuing days in figuring out what we mean by paragraph 4  As others have   said, there is some ambiguity, but I suspect it is inevitable given that we really don’t know what our   next actions will be  So I support alternative B as written  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Mr Chairman?     I don’t feel strongly, but would it make more sense to have this change be   consistent in time with changes in communication strategy more broadly?  Now, recognizing this   is not of the same import, but rather than have a question be raised and then have to explain it   September 18, 2007 122 of 188    through our communication folks and others, I wonder whether this might not just be sort of a   housekeeping footnote as part of a broader communication rollout     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Very briefly, when I think back about a week   ago to maybe one of the darker days that we’ve had in the past six weeks, there were so many more   institutions that were funding themselves on an overnight basis that it wouldn’t take much   imagination for us to get very fearful very soon if there were some kind of shock that made it   impossible or much more difficult for them to fund themselves twenty-four hours later  So I think   the ACF would have held great promise then to be useful in addressing some of the headline risks   that could very quickly have had systemic implications  I think the ACF holds great promise now   I’ll highlight only one question, which is timing  I share the view put forth by President   Stern that, to the extent we see these markets improving on their own terms, which is something   we’ve seen in recent trading days, we wouldn’t want to do anything to stop that momentum  If we   had hit the button today, it may well be that they would have had to take stock of this new   instrument and compare it to the other alternatives they have, and that improvement could have   potentially been delayed  On the other hand, if we wait until these markets deteriorate to where they   were a week ago, the efficacy of hitting the button then would also be less than ideal  So my own   sense on timing—and it’s something that the Chairman will, I think, brief us all on if we get to that   September 18, 2007 162 of 188                                                                                                                                                 September 18, 2007 163 of 188  point—is to the extent that we see that momentum has stopped and we see the ground weakening   below us, then we might have to make a risk-adjusted call at that point  I don’t think it will be a   very easy or a very apparent one  But on balance, I think that the macroeconomic possibilities are   pretty scary, which makes me suggest that we would lean forward on this Thank you, Mr   Chairman      Thank you, Mr Chairman  I thought I’d just talk about four subjects today    first, spend a few more moments on the capital market conditions, which Bill did a great job of   summarizing; second, talk about financial intermediaries; and third and fourth, talk briefly about   implications for growth and inflation  In terms of the capital markets, I think it is important that we   judge their state today not from where they might have been two weeks ago or from where they   might have gotten ahead of underlying reality—if you look at credit spreads and equities—but from   where they were before we last met or from where they were in the darkest days of August  I think   these markets are at the very high end of what are reasonable expectations for improvement  As   October 30-31, 2007 58 of 162    Governor Kohn suggests, it doesn’t mean that they can’t reverse themselves  It certainly doesn’t   mean that they are solid—plenty of fragility is there  But all things considered, as a function of both   time and Fed policy, there is, indeed, better sentiment; bid-asked spreads have narrowed; price   discovery is at work; and differentiation and tiering are very real  I’d highlight a few markets that   have gone into the category of being on more solid ground  Bill referred to the interbank funding   markets  The multiseller bank-sponsored conduit is performing well  Prime auto finance paper has   gone through quite a volatile period in the past couple of months but has now found its way to the   good side, where I think those markets are increasingly open  High-quality paper is increasingly   being received on terms that don’t look dramatically different from the way they would have looked   before August  Another example is credit card receivables   Of course, as many others around this table have pointed out, there is no panacea  Serious   problems remain in some asset markets, particularly housing and certain parts of structured finance    But I note that might be for good reason  I’d hesitate to call this poor market functioning  By and   large, it may be that some investors don’t like the outcomes, but as the asset-backed commercial   paper markets have separated the haves from the have-nots and the have-nots are without bank   sponsorship and have poorer quality assets and poorer disclosure, they are having a hard time   finding and securing bids  Another example might be some large financial institutions that are   rolling over more of their funding on a shorter-term basis than they desire  There may be good   reasons for that, and as we think about our policy tools tomorrow, we shouldn’t try to come to the   rescue with any fixes for institutions that may not have been managed well or, at least, may not have   had a capital structure that fit the risks  There are a couple of other indicators of continued concern    Obviously, the Treasury bill market has been quite volatile and is a pretty good reminder to us that   these markets are not back to anything that we’d even want to consider normal  Another indicator   October 30-31, 2007 59 of 162    that I look to in evaluating whether the capital markets are coming back to some normalcy is the   percentage of cash holdings in money market mutual funds  In the pre-July period, money market   mutual funds, particularly those that hold these prime-plus securities, would hold 5 to 10 percent of   their assets in cash  On the darkest day in August, that was up to 45 percent  By and large, my   sense is that the average now is something in the mid-20s  That suggests that there might be   requests for redemptions and liquidations for which they need to keep cash available, but they are   feeling a little better about their prospects and about some of the paper that they’re holding   On balance, I’d say it’s pretty easy for us to sit here and judge improvement  It’s a lot   harder for us to judge success  I think President Plosser talked about the normalization in these   markets, and we must hesitate to think that the markets before their August turmoil were normal    Risk premiums were abnormally low, and access to credit perhaps unusually easy  So in judging   the success of time in our policy prescriptions, I think we’re having a hard time—at least I’m having   a hard time—figuring out what are the new steady-state outcomes that are trying to be achieved    These markets appear delicately balanced between fear and greed  One example of greed, as we   discussed in previous meetings, is some of the pay-in-kind, or PIK, securities with toggle features in   the high-yield market  One of them was priced just last week between 97 and 98  So some of these   corporate credits may well have improved in the eyes of the market beyond what we think might be   sustainable  On the other side is fear  A new paradigm is trying to take root in the markets, but the   risk of reversal remains very real  The marks on many leveraged loans look good  But if you judge   the financial institutions that hold this paper, they are rushing to get the paper to market as soon as   they possibly can, perhaps with a view that the corporate credit conditions won’t hold at these   levels   October 30-31, 2007 60 of 162    Second, let me talk briefly about financial intermediaries  As we discussed before, after the   tumult in mid-August, many of them retrenched  Then many of them tried to re-liquefy  At that   time they were trying to revalue their securities  Now they are probably somewhere in the process   of revaluation, review, and refinement  Some of them, after the earnings announcements of the past   couple of weeks, might be going back to step 1 and trying to understand what the risks are and what   their liabilities are  Some of the improvements that we saw in the capital markets after our   September 18 meeting might have been upended or seemed so by a couple of announcements from   a leading investment bank and commercial bank that represented a negative surprise to the markets    A couple of explanations are possible for why the market seemed to react not just with respect to the   securities of those two banks  Were the losses and risk-management systems particular to those   banks that called the risk management into question, or were they illustrative of losses to larger   segments of their peer group owing to poor risk-management systems?  It was probably a   combination, but I guess the key question for me is whether we are seeing impairment of the entire   financial sector or simply the realignment of the competitive landscape  I think the answer is the   latter, but I’m not certain  The best-in-class comparables among commercial banks and investment   banks seem to suggest that bifurcation is at work  If you look at the credit default swaps, at the   profits, and at the share prices for the best in class of this group, they seem to have come out of the   scare of a couple of weeks ago stronger and more profitable and, frankly, in much better shape  I   would have thought that those sorts of entities would be putting opportunistic capital to work in a   hurry, particularly when many of their competitors are down  I’m afraid that is not the case  Even   they are playing defense in this market  We talk, I talk, about the resilience of our capital markets    What they tell many of us, I think, is that the way for them to be resilient is to be exceptionally   prudent here  The risk-reward tradeoff for them suggests that this is a time to be careful  You can’t   October 30-31, 2007 61 of 162    succeed if you don’t survive, and I suspect that many of them are still quite jarred by recent events    The profitability of most of these financial institutions has been significantly called into question  I   suspect that the losses in the fourth quarter are going to look particularly bad, but I would expect   that many of these financial institutions are asking themselves the question of what business they   really should be in after all   Third, let me speak briefly about the implications for economic growth  To me there is no   question that we have less market uncertainty than two months ago, and the prospects of some   really bad tail events have dissipated somewhat; but there is still caution, as Vice Chairman   Geithner said  Certainly, large multinational nonfinancial companies, excluding housing, seem to   be holding up well, as represented by their bottom-up S&P earnings forecast for the fourth quarter   of next year, and certainly there’s good news to report, as President Poole suggested, from many in   the tech sector  Housing is, of course, as bad as the Greenbook has long suggested  So at the end of   the day in terms of trying to judge what’s going on in the real economy, we go back to a discussion   the Greenbook highlighted for us, which is the state of the consumer  Even though on balance I am   a bit more optimistic than the Greenbook for GDP growth for the balance of ’07 and ’08, I have to   admit that the conclusion that consumer sentiment has taken a hit seems, at least from my reading   and my discussions with some business leaders, to be backed up by some very disappointing   consumer spending for October  Having surveyed a few of the credit card companies, I think that it   looks to many of them that October spending is really not at comforting levels  Nominal spending   excluding fuel for their consumer base appears flat to down over the past four weeks  That is, I   think, a rather remarkable outcome  Delinquencies have also ticked up a bit, but I would say that’s   probably less disconcerting to me than what the credit card companies seem to be reporting as a   October 30-31, 2007 62 of 162    proxy for retail spending  The key over the medium term, however, is job growth and real   disposable income, in my judgment more important than the negative wealth effects from housing   Let me turn to the final issue for discussion—at least on my list—which is inflation risks    At the end of this six-week period, I must admit to being considerably less sanguine about inflation   prospects and risks than the Greenbook  It is true that incoming data have not been bad at all  Some   have even been pretty good, and inflation expectations are seemingly anchored  But as Governor   Kohn suggested, I worry a lot about inflation psychology and the real effect of importing inflation   given dollar weakness and the effect of commodity price increase pass-throughs on a breadth of   products  Given the massive liquidity on the sidelines, given uncertainty in the global capital   markets and the current political calendar, and given the rather large and growing expected   discrepancies in interest rate differentials between us and our trading partners, I worry about   outsized moves between the US dollar and foreign currencies  A disorderly move in the dollar   could prove very costly, even undermining foreign direct investment in the United States and   perhaps threatening to unanchor inflation expectations, particularly if the judgments of this   Committee aren’t well understood by the markets  I have never been a big believer in looking at   artificial levels for prices or at charts to figure out where we should worry  Nonetheless, I must say   a euro-dollar move beyond 150 strikes me as a level that the markets will be paying keen attention   to  We’ll obviously talk about the policy tradeoffs involving these risks in the next round  Thank   you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Let me be the most recent but, I guess, not the   last to say that this is a close call  I suppose I take more comfort in that than some around the table   because I am pleased at the progress though it is not perfect and we’re not even back to an honest   view of normal in the financial markets  That it’s a close call suggests to me that the data in the   financial markets are normalizing  I guess the alternative of a close call would have been to have   this be an easy call, and I suspect that the only way this would have been an easy call would be if   we continued to have bad data and bad sentiment in the market  So I think we’re in the realm of a   close call and we shouldn’t completely rue that situation  Again, that’s probably a function of the   resilience of the economy, the resilience in the markets, some time and patience, and maybe even a   little good monetary policy  So I’m okay with that, I think   October 30-31, 2007 118 of 162    The judgment that we make on moving or not moving ¼ percentage point today matters, but   it strikes me as being considerably less important than what the future path of policy is expected to   be in the capital markets  So I think that the most important judgment we make is in the fourth   paragraph rather than the first paragraph  Let me spend a moment on what the financial markets are   telling us with a degree of certainty which, speaking for myself, is quite surprising  Again, I think   they have responded to real data over the past couple of weeks  They haven’t changed their   probabilities based on utterances from the Chairman or from any of us, and I take some comfort in   that  I might disagree with what they’re saying, but I don’t think that they’re just giving us a mirror   image of our own views  So I take what they’re saying and the certainty with which they have   taken on board that we’re going to move today  It’s not determinative  It’s not dispositive, nor   should it be, but the debt capital markets, at least, think that the economy is worse—worse than the   Greenbook and worse than many of us feel  Again, I would say that I have to take that on board   without giving it too much predictive capability     I think that Brian is right—given the fragility in the financial markets and given the surprise   that we had for them last time, I wouldn’t want our judgments today to add to that volatility, which I   think would be quite possible  In sum, I would say that I support alternative A as written on this   revised page  I think that, absent having strong language in alternative A, section 4, it would look to   some as though the markets dictated this outcome  I think A-4 and robust balance of risk language   is important so that the markets don’t believe incorrectly that we succumb to what their wants are  I   think that previously, including at our last meeting, when we spoke about uncertainty, they seemed   to understand what that was—that it wasn’t that we’re just calling it uncertainty but we really have   cuts ahead  For better or for worse, they’ve now learned a lesson  Uncertainty with even pretty   good data led us to cut this time, if we end up adopting alternative A  So if we use that same   October 30-31, 2007 119 of 162    uncertainty language, I don’t think it would have the effect that it had last time of letting folks be on   both sides of the bet on whether we would have continued actions  So I’m comfortable with   alternative A, paragraph 4  It is a way of addressing market expectations and addressing our   uncertainties by insurance, but being very clear to the markets that they ought not prejudge nor have   we prejudged the outcome next time  The references to inflation risks there and in alternative A,   paragraph 3, are useful to address some of the broader concerns we have about commodities and the   foreign exchange value of the dollar  So with that, I think that alternative A is the right thing to do   and that it does preserve for us plenty of ability to call it as we see it when we meet next  Thank   you, Mr Chairman      Thank you, Mr Chairman  Let me just highlight a few points  First, on   the diagnosis of exactly what’s going on in the financial markets, I do think that the deterioration   of the financial markets since we last met has been quite remarkable and quite profound  That   doesn’t mean that it couldn’t work itself out, but this is a turn that is likely to have some impact   on the real economy  There is risk that, if we were to let the current dysfunctional markets   persist through year-end, we could be having a meeting like this videoconference  I think it puts   us in a materially worse position, which gives me a presumption that we need to think   proactively, as the staff has done here going on four months, to try to come up with some   medicine to cure what ails the patient   I don’t think that this is predominantly a year-end phenomenon regarding the term   funding markets  We have a bit of a natural experiment on that by looking at a period a few   months ago—called a quarter-end—that wasn’t much different from a year-end, at least among   US financial institutions  Again, at least among US financial institutions in terms of   disclosure, in terms of balance sheets, in terms of scrutiny, this isn’t an altogether different   analysis regarding window dressing and cleaning up balance sheets  I buy the argument that in   Europe the year-end funding pressures could be more significant because of the differences in   December 6, 2007 38 of 51    disclosure and scrutiny around those two periods  So the idea that somehow we could hold back   on this again and think these problems will largely solve themselves is not a great bet   In terms of the blurry line between our liquidity-provisioning roles and our credit-  provisioning roles, I’ll admit that it is a hard distinction to maintain  When I look at financial   institutions, particularly large ones, in the post-Gramm-Leach-Bliley era, when they have   increasingly converged whether they be commercial banks or investment banks, and I think   about those that are in the best shape in terms of capital, credit, and reputation, I’m not   comforted, because they are having very much the same sorts of liquidity pressures  I won’t say   that this is a liquidity problem and not a credit problem, but as I look at institutions with very   different credit postures, these liquidity issues, these term funding issues, seem to be nonetheless   apparent   In terms of the policy response we’re contemplating today, I obviously support both   initiatives and think it’s pretty important that we see if we should be, in fact, bypassing some of   these large institutions to try to get liquidity in the hands of a larger universe of depository   institutions and replace less-liquid assets, as the Chairman mentioned, with more-liquid assets    As I think about this alternative versus the discount window, I must tell you that I am not at all   convinced that the discount window stigma could be removed—for reasons of history, which Bill   Dudley mentioned, and for reasons that the state of these financial institutions now versus when   we last practiced our discount window operations are materially different  I think the overall   environment on stigma and solvency and questions about the financial wherewithal of some   large commercial banks are now more apparent in the markets, making them less likely to want   to go to the window, even if the spread were narrowed considerably, even to 15 or to 10 basis   December 6, 2007 39 of 51    points  So I don’t think that’s a very attractive option among the others that have been   mentioned     Let me highlight two more points  One thing that gives me some sense that a TAF might   work is the auction dynamic  Auctions work across securities markets  They work in selling   companies  They work in selling broad corporate debt issuance, and the dynamic of auctions and   the competitive dynamic therein strike me as likely to be quite useful  I would expect there to be   considerable bids if all goes well operationally, maybe 5 basis points above what we’ve said is   the reserve price, and so the hope is that this will be, in fact, a crowded auction  As the Vice   Chairman said, I don’t think that there are any guarantees  We have plenty of things to worry   about  My own view is that this is not a rapid response from us in times of particular crisis  An   idea like this has been bubbling among all of us on this videoconference call for many months in   different versions, and I think if there were a time to use it, it’s precisely where we are  On the   question of the swap, I think it does add  It adds something to the momentum in these markets,   to the idea of concerted action, which is both art and science as we see that these markets have   been more prone to sentiment than to data in recent months  So with all of that, Mr Chairman, I   support the move      Thank you, Mr Chairman  Like many of you, I think that the risks of bad   economic outcomes are higher than they were when we met in October, both here in the United   States and among our trading partners  The profound deterioration in financial markets—which in   my view has changed significantly, more so than the data on the real economy—as been much   discussed already  I’ll make two separate observations about that deterioration now versus on the   darkest days in August or September  First, we’re seeing a very meaningful preference for   Treasuries as opposed to agencies  In our discussions and in the data several months ago, they   would have tended to be bundled together, but are putting more pressure on Treasuries in this   current environment  Second, it strikes me that more overnight funding is being done by more large   financial institutions, and that has to concern us as we talk in the next round about policy  Liquidity   conditions have been hurt by several related factors, most of which speak to a lack of confidence    Certainly there are lower expectations about the macroeconomic environment and a lack of   confidence in counterparties and in funding through year-end; but perhaps mostly, the escalating   December 11, 2007 72 of 138    risk aversion within the four walls of most, but not all, very large financial institutions has caused   this market turmoil, both in the formal banking system and in what President Yellen described as   the shadow banking system   So why have these institutions lost faith and so much conviction?  I’ll give a few reasons    First, senior management instability  Second, a lack of confidence—by boards, senior managers   who are still around, and the rest of their people—in the risk-management systems  There is a   growing chasm of confidence between the boards—and those who are around them—about their   stress tests and about their ability to withstand a series of shocks that could lead to further   deterioration  There is also a very bad risk-reward tradeoff for those who are prepared or have been   given some ability to put balance sheet capital to work  If they make a bet and it turns out to be very   bad in this environment, their jobs and the jobs of many of their peers will be over  If they make a   bet and it turns out to be as good as they expect, they won’t be keeping much of the fruits of that   trade  As a result, I think we are finding that key people across institutions—which President Fisher   and others talked about as keen to provide opportunistic capital—have stepped back, I would say   materially  Finally, it’s not year-end pressures with respect to balance sheets that strike me as   having the biggest effect here  It’s that, as these managers are looking at their businesses for 2008,   they’re fundamentally having to ask themselves the questions about what businesses they are really   in—whether they all should be originators, distributors, and holders of credit and risk or whether   they need to go back to where they were five or six years ago, when they were picking their   comparative advantages  As they look at the budgets for next year, I think they have a lot of   understanding of what their cost structures are if they don’t change their personnel, but they have   very little clarity about what their top-line revenue will be  That has led to some serious questions   about putting capital to work when you’re really not sure what your core businesses are  I expect   December 11, 2007 73 of 138    that process not to be completed in weeks or months but really in quarters, and it’s for that reason,   among others—as Governor Kohn referenced—that I expect this period of relative strain to last for   a while   Let me raise a question that I asked at the last FOMC meeting  Are we seeing merely a   change in the competitive landscape or a fundamental weakening across classes of financial   institutions?  I would say that today most large financial institutions, both money center commercial   banks and large investment banks, are on the sidelines to some meaningful extent—unable or   unwilling to put their balance sheets with any real force to work on new capital or on new projects    They’re likely to be stuck there for a while  Surely there are a few large institutions with both   capital and conviction that are opportunistically deploying capital with extremely compelling equity   risk premiums  I think about that more as cherry-picking than any interest or ability of these   institutions to buy the entire orchard  So they will be survivors, but they are being very, very   careful     Is there enough opportunistic credit from those institutions that distinguish themselves,   along with classes of other institutions that we talked about today—large foreign banks, US   branches, super-regional banks, mid-sized banks, community banks, credit units, the GSEs, the   Home Loan Banks—to pick up market share and take advantage of that slack that’s been left for a   period?  I think in a word the answer is “no”  That is, they will inevitably pick up some market   share during this period  This is good news for the institutions that had been crowded out by the   money center banks invading some of these regions  But as I look at their own conviction, at their   own balance sheets, and importantly, at where their source of credit might come from—from these   same capital markets that are in dysfunction—I get encouraged that they can pick up some of the   slack, but I wouldn’t expect them to be able to pick up enough for us to avoid the spillover effect to   December 11, 2007 74 of 138    the real economy  It is true that many of these institutions now find business and new loans to be on   better terms  They’re price leaders rather than price takers  There is less competition for some of   these new C&I loans and some of these new consumer loans  This is a good thing, but again, I   wouldn’t overemphasize that they are somehow going to be able to pick up the slack   What about other forms of opportunistic capital, like sovereign wealth funds and hedge   funds that are playing an important role in re-liquefying large banks?  Again, I see that as part of a   solution, but in my view, we’re really still early in that process, and most of those institutions that   are out looking for capital are likely to get more rounds of capital in the coming weeks, months, and   quarters  The terms of the investment by some of these external funds suggest that this is not the   final fund raising but really one of the first  In some ways, this is a much trickier position than if we   saw one class of financial institutions that was weaker and thought that others could fill in  Again,   the provision of credit normally made possible in this environment by the structured finance   markets is affecting all financial intermediaries—the weak, the strong, the regulated, the   unregulated, those on Wall Street, and those in other cities   So what does the immediate future hold?  Let me spend a moment breaking down a few   classes of these institutions  Investment banks first  I expect most of them to be on the sidelines for   a while  I expect the 2008 budgets, which are still coming together now, to likely suggest that they   are exiting from some businesses and firing employees in larger numbers than markets expect right   now  What about large money center commercial banks, particularly those that have been in the   headlines?  Obviously I would expect them, with some leadership clarity, to take a direction, but   these businesses take a very long time to turn  So what will they do?  They will continue to prune   their balance sheets, continue to sell noncore assets and businesses, continue raising capital, and   continue their discussions with rating agencies about meeting rating agencies’ expectations  These   December 11, 2007 75 of 138    rating agencies want to be observers  They no longer want to be market makers or market   participants, but I suspect they’re going to find a reversion to the role of some years ago hard to pull   off in this environment  What about super-regionals and community banks, which many of you   spoke about with some view that their current balance sheets look okay?  I think there is a sense of   foreboding in that group about their commercial real estate exposures  Even though they are largely   open for business, we shouldn’t overstate their ability to pick up some slack  After all, the   secondary market is closed for many of them  Their portfolio lending is up  The credit line   utilizations are being fully tapped  Their own profit projections are likely to be coming down over   2008, and even though they certainly want to increase market share, they’re reading the same   headlines, and my own judgment is they’re likely to be still somewhat worried   In sum, these problems appear to me to have been long in the making—long before they   struck the housing markets—and will be somewhat longer in the rebound than we might have   thought even some weeks ago  The catalysts for improvement, though, are manifold  First, new   leaders with dispassionate views are coming to many of these financial institutions and are willing   to sell assets at prices that the leaders who brought them into different businesses might have been   unwilling to do  Again, it strikes me that the ability to sell an entire book of business at a fixed   dollar amount and run a competitive auction might help clear many of these prices that have   otherwise looked pretty stubborn and pretty hard to mark  In terms of other validators that might be   coming into these new investments, as I mentioned, I think the raising of equity funds is   encouraging, but these validators, particularly those in the United States and some in sovereign   wealth funds elsewhere, are pretty patient, and I don’t see any of them thinking that they need to   deploy their capital quickly or on terms with which they are uncomfortable because they will have   an opportunity to look at tens and dozens more term sheets in the next several quarters  As many of   December 11, 2007 76 of 138    them are making investments now, they have a range of term sheets in front of them, and that   judgment won’t be rushed in their view  So the idea that it would be a panacea for the real economy   strikes me as a bit overstated in the current environment   So what about the real economy?  No doubt the turmoil in financial markets, some of which   was self-inflicted, has the potential to do more harm to the broader economy in the fourth quarter   and in early next year  But we have to be humble about our understanding of that transmission   mechanism  The preceding discussion strikes me as giving less comfort than I had at the last   FOMC meeting on the short-term resilience and dynamism of our financial markets to repair   themselves quickly  I’m still very optimistic over the forecast period and the medium term, but it   puts more of a burden on the resilience and dynamism of our labor markets and more of a focus on   the resilience and dynamism of our product markets and of our businesses  They do appear to be   holding up okay  In my view, if you look at the various surveys that were referenced earlier today   and the Business Roundtable survey of CEOs, these would be much more dire forecasts if we were   in recession now than they appear to be at this moment  Most of these CEOs, who are not great at   calling inflection points, still think that their business is okay  The economy has slowed; it is   riskier; but it strikes me that we have a good shot of being able to follow through on the pattern   outlined in the Greenbook   Finally, just let me make a quick note about inflation risks  I think the inflation risks have   garnered certainly less of my attention in this intermeeting period and might have garnered even   somewhat less of the discussion around this table  The inflation risks that we saw six weeks ago   strike me as not having improved very much  Inflation risks are quite real, and so as we are   choosing our policy options, we have to keep these in mind  But we obviously have to take the   December 11, 2007 77 of 138    shorter-term risks and the illiquidity in the markets into account first and foremost as we think about   both monetary policy and liquidity policy  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support alternative B as is  Without   monetary policy action, it does strike me that the harm to the real economy could be larger and   longer than otherwise  Similarly, I would say that without employing the liquidity tools that we   discussed when we met by videoconference, monetary policy may well be insufficient to bring   about real improvement over a reasonable period of time  So I like the combination as a very   useful, natural experiment to help us figure out what the diagnosis of the patient really is  It does   concern me that, if we go with 50 basis points today along with the TAF, the swap, and other   actions, it would be harder to disentangle what exactly ails these markets, which is some   combination of capital and liquidity   With respect to the question of how much—again, back to the 25 or 50 basis point   move—it strikes me at least that this is a very hard time for us to be evaluating what the   equilibrium fed funds rate is  If policy is a function of both the fed funds rate target and what is   going on and how capital markets are reading and processing that information, these markets are   in a period of incredible dysfunction  That suggests to me that we should go slower and be more   cautious in trying to get to equilibrium  It is easier to assess that when markets are functioning at   levels that are superior to where they are functioning now, and I hope by the time we meet next   that the markets will be giving us a clearer read, so we can approach equilibrium or at least   understand it better   December 11, 2007 113 of 138    Finally, with respect to some of the discussion around alternative B, section 4, I think as   written it gives us maximum flexibility, as was referenced earlier  I don’t happen to think that   market expectations would be changed much if we added a sentence about downside risks to   growth  I think last time around they took our uncertainty paragraph, learned that it meant that   there was a rate cut coming, and I don’t think we need to push farther than that at this point    Thank you, Mr Chairman      Thank you, Mr Chairman  Just a few notes  First, on financial markets   and financial market functioning, I think as Bill Dudley suggested that they are much improved   from our last meeting  I take that as a very, very good sign, and I think that the improvement in   financial market functioning will be useful to us to help calibrate the effects of changes in   monetary policy  We spent some time even today talking about where we are on some range   between neutral and accommodative and where we want to go  When the markets aren’t   working, then any policy that we could conceive of would in effect be restrictive, if the markets   weren’t willing to take our action and do something with it to provide credit  So I think we were   right to focus on getting the markets back to work, which is a process that isn’t complete, but I   think the trends are our friend there  Second, concerning financial intermediaries, I would   underscore the point that the Chairman made at the outset  The problems among large financial   institutions are very serious, and unlike financial market functioning, which has improved, I   January 9, 2008 39 of 60    think the state of these institutions has not improved since we met last  While it is true that they   have been raising capital, both in the form of equity and convertibles, the process of writedowns   and capital-raising is far, far from being complete  I think we continue to have some headline   risk, both in the United States and among non-US institutions, between now and our meeting at   the end of the month as well as throughout the first quarter   The good news is that the real economy data have superseded those data with respect to   financial institutions  The bad news is that these top twenty or so institutions are still largely ill-  equipped to facilitate credit or to be shock absorbers here to any great degree  If you think about   that in terms of other shock absorbers that might be available, including fiscal policy, I think   there is reason for the seventeen of us on this conference call to feel relatively lonely in thinking   about policies that can be brought to bear, both from the private sector and the public sector    With respect to the real economy, even if one isn’t as pessimistic in terms of probabilities of a   mild recession or as pessimistic on the chance of a really, really ugly scenario much more dire   than that, I still think that risk management suggests going in the direction that the Chairman   emphasized for reasons that have already been discussed by many others on this call     As I mentioned, I think there is more burden on monetary policy as I think about fiscal   policy and some of these other measures  That gives me a view that perhaps we should be erring   on the side of reaching for a little more by way of rate cuts than we would in a parallel universe   where we had financial institutions and fiscal policy that were likely to be quite useful  I’m   somewhat less certain that either of them will be able to stand here in the fray  With respect to   tactics, I think the right course of action is, as Governor Kohn just referenced, for the Chairman   to provide some direction to the markets in his speech  That direction will not be perfect  They   will not understand exactly our posture, but I think they do need to hear from him a sense of   January 9, 2008 40 of 60    where we are collectively, and tomorrow provides a really good opportunity to do that  It would   be good for them not to be surprised to any great degree when we meet in a few weeks, and I   think the Chairman will rightly focus them on the real economic data  So as the data change,   their own expectations of policy could change as well  Governor Kohn talked about the possible   erosion in confidence in our ability to put policy in place, and I think that by meeting today and   hearing one another’s views, having the Chairman go tomorrow, and then meeting to finalize our   judgments on policy action, given all our constraints, is the best course of conduct  Thank you,   Mr Chairman      Thank you, Mr Chairman  Let me just make a few brief points  First,   during the discussions on this call, we have described these financial markets as fragile  That   strikes me as rather euphemistic for what we have been witnessing really since the first of this   year, particularly what is being witnessed overseas today  The losses appear to be self-  reinforcing  Panic appears to be begetting further pullbacks by investors, retail and institutional   alike  There seems to be continued interest in the safest currencies, and this pullback strikes me   as quite nondiscriminate, geographically and in terms of sectors, companies, and even entire   asset classes  Certainly, we shouldn’t be responding to those moves unless, when we think about   our credibility, we think about it both with respect to our inflation-fighting credibility and, I   think as Governor Kohn just said, our financial stability credibility  I think the standard for   moving between meetings is a very high one; but looking at the evidence, both in the financial   January 21, 2008 23 of 32    markets and in the real economy, and thinking about our own credibility, my sense is that we   rather convincingly meet that standard   My judgment would be, if we chose not to act today, that we would in all likelihood not   make it until next week  There can’t be a ton of conviction that by virtue of 75 basis points   today we are going to redress some of this fear and some of the psychology that is working   against us in the markets  But just because we don’t have a panacea, just because monetary   policy can’t solve the monoline problem and can’t solve some of the other problems, doesn’t   mean that we shouldn’t be doing our part  It strikes me that by taking action today we are doing   our part  We are showing the financial markets and the real businesses that we do get it    Speaking for myself, I am glad that the interbank funding markets are working better  That puts   them in a better position to take more advantage of changes in monetary policy  Through the   TAF and through time they are now lending to each other  But based on what has happened in   the last several days, it doesn’t look as though they are going to be lending to many others  So   our action today needs to be focused very much on that front   With all that said, Mr Chairman—and recognizing how quickly the decoupling   hypothesis seems to have raced away from these markets as quickly as it found its way into their   collective wisdom—we look to emerging markets and look to markets here in the United States    I think our actions today will go some small way to ensure that markets come back to a more   realistic assessment, but we shouldn’t fool ourselves that somehow we in any way are going to   be solving this problem between now and the next time we meet  Thank you, Mr Chairman      Thank you, Mr Chairman  I will endeavor to stay out of the growing,   creeping pessimism caucus  [Laughter]  You can judge for yourselves whether I’ve been successful   doing so  Let me talk briefly about two economies that are in a tug-of-war, and rather than   reference the housing and nonhousing economies, let me try to talk about it in the context of the   economy of financial services versus the real economy  On one level, of course, financial services   are not so large a share of GDP that they could threaten the macroeconomy  But the transmission   mechanism between credit markets and the real economy, whether it be through the credit channel   or other channels, while imperfectly understood, is having very negative effects on the cost and   availability of credit for real businesses and households, with the risks there to the downside    Financial institutions, as many of you said, are open for business, but I would say somewhat less so   than when we met in December  As we approach the credit line renewal season, that is happening   amid a period of depleted credit availability and significantly tighter lending standards  In addition,   financial institutions as a group are, in my view, undercapitalized, even with the recent capital   infusions  Finally, the dynamism that I would be hoping to see among financial institutions is   clearly lacking; and while I think, as President Pianalto referenced, that there are new market   entrants like hedge funds that are pretty keen to provide mezzanine financing, it’s a pretty slow   process to match providers and users of capital  So at least for the near-term forecast, I wouldn’t   expect that to come much to our rescue   If the US financial institutions were an economy all to themselves, they would probably   already be in a recession  While that doesn’t necessarily equate to a recession for the broader   January 29–30, 2008 86 of 249    economy, it sure doesn’t help  The repair process that President Geithner referenced among   financial institutions strikes me as very fragile and quite incomplete  Income statement shortfalls   due to falling profits, poor visibility, weaker pipelines, and the need to reduce headcounts very   meaningfully strike me in some ways as a more urgent and troublesome issue for large financial   institutions than their balance sheet weakness  On the balance sheet front, however, I’m also   concerned that more impairments are to come for large financial institutions and more dilution is   expected for current shareholders  Although the window for foreign investment is open now, I   wouldn’t expect that window to stay open throughout 2008  So even though I’d say that income   statement concerns should be more pressing for them, these balance sheet issues are very real  In   some way these institutions have been built, or I should say rebuilt, over the past six years to   prepare themselves for a low volatility, high liquidity world, and what they found is the exact   opposite  They are at different levels of understanding the new world, and it will take them quite   some time to rebuild their businesses to be profitable in it   Rolling capital calls across financial institutions are continuing  Many are hoping to play for   time, but I think there’s a risk that time will run away from them as new events find their way into   the front pages  Virtually no financial institution strikes me as immune to these pressures, and while   we see that new problems and new acronyms are emerging daily, they strike me as having the same   underlying problems affecting different asset classes  Regional banks have begun to fund their   balance sheets successfully—certainly a good sign—but I suspect that they are also in the early   stages of needing to raise considerably more capital   As Governor Kohn said, there is a hope and an expectation that global institutions would be   a source of strength, at least in financial services  Again, in financial services, my sense is that non-  US financial institutions, especially those in the United Kingdom and Europe, are in the midst of   January 29–30, 2008 87 of 249    playing catch-up to their US counterparts  I expect the year-end reporting process for them, which   really begins now but will be at full speed by mid-February through early March, will find many of   the Landesbanks needing to be recapitalized  I think we’re going to find that both large and small   institutions are having a hard time getting through the bank reporting season in Europe  Equity   prices in Europe and CDS spreads are already giving us some indication of what’s on the horizon    It’s not just about subprime in Europe, contrary to some of the indications we received  Perhaps   even more than US institutions, many European financial institutions have incorrectly believed that   high credit ratings across asset classes would in and of themselves serve as protection  The   overreliance on credit ratings that we see in the United States strikes me as even more pronounced   in Europe  The shocks caused by these financial institutions could have a dramatic impact on their   economies, probably more so than the effect of US financial institutions here in the United States    That obviously has a consequence in terms of a further shock and also a consequence on the real   side in terms of US exports   Let me turn to the other side of that, that is, the real economy itself, excluding financials  I   think many of you referred to the labor market data, which strike me as mixed  I’m perhaps a touch   more optimistic that we’re going to see some improvement at least in the short term there, but I   can’t have the conviction that I’d like  The real economy is doing its best to resist these financial   shocks  We can see that fight playing out around E&S spending, around business fixed investment,   and around cap-ex more generally  You have nonfinancials with strong corporate balance sheets,   excess cash, and high profit levels that are debating in corporate boards about the uncertainty posed   by the macroeconomy  It’s hard to say which side is going to prevail in that battle  The backdrop,   as many of you mentioned, has weakened, with risk premiums widening across the board  Real   PCE for January is not showing much of a snapback from a weak December but also, I would say,   January 29–30, 2008 88 of 249    not much more deterioration from December levels according to the credit card companies that I   spoke to  The bottom line on the real economy—the trends in the real economy may be a bit more   positive coming into the first quarter from the fourth quarter than the Greenbook projections, but I   would say I am a little less optimistic that the fiscal stimulus package is as likely to be as   constructive as the Greenbook would have us believe   The forecast, as a result, overall depends on the ability of nonfinancial corporations to hire   and invest despite this macroeconomic uncertainty  I have some confidence that the Fortune 500   will be willing to continue to push along this path of moderate growth; but small companies,   particularly those that are really the source of job creation, may be more negatively affected while   the credit channel is impaired, and this is happening at a critical time  The Greenbook base case or   the “faster recovery” pace depends to a degree on improvement in credit intermediation or at least   not another shock, and it’s that other shock that worries me  If deterioration among credit   intermediaries continues, the real economy will suffer  Of course, the correlation is hard to pin   down   Finally, on the inflation front, I share the concerns expressed by several of you that the   persistence of recent inflation information coming into this period is a cause for concern  I’m less   sanguine than the Greenbook that we’re going to see the power of that inflation fade in the event   that the economy softens some  The backdrop of stubbornly high commodity prices, despite lower   global demand in recent weeks, and a lower exchange value of the dollar are likely to put pressure   on the inflation front  The data, as we have all talked about, on core and total inflation are not   promising, so I would consider that also to be an upside risk  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support alternative B for several reasons, not   least of which because it actually seems to reasonably capture what we talked about yesterday  So I   think it has that benefit  To state the obvious, we are in a very tough spot  There are clearly risks on   both sides of the mandate, and for folks who are of differing opinions, I don’t think that they would   January 29–30, 2008 142 of 249    either deny the tough spot we’re in or say that we have a lack of worries on either side  I think   President Geithner said in the Q&A at the beginning of this round that we’re choosing which policy   error we’re prepared to make or, more charitably, we’re deciding where our worries are the greatest    It does strike me that alternative B does that reasonably well  To step back for just a minute, I think   that the tough spot we’re in is a function of issues that were very long in the making and will take a   long time to work out  That probably has two implications  First, as to what Governor Kohn said,   it’s easy for me to feel more comfortable with our judgment by saying that we’ll be able to undo it   really, really soon; but if it is going to take a long time for this to work out, I don’t want to take any   false comfort in that  The other implication is that, when I say that this is long in the making, I   mean particularly for financial institutions  It has taken them a long time to dig themselves into this   hole for the credit-intermediation process to be as deeply disturbed as I take it to be at this point  So   when I think about what policies we would make on the monetary policy front, I wouldn’t want to   excuse or somehow allow them to get off scot-free; by going with alternative B, I don’t think that   would be the case  Financial institutions have far more work to do than we have yet to do on   monetary policy  I think they are further from recognizing where they need to get  That will take   some time   In listening to other people’s perspectives on the elixir of a 3 percent fed funds rate, I think it   would be a nice luxury to give 3 percent a chance, but it’s probably not practical for the following   reasons  I have tried to convince myself that the monetary policy moves in the last nine or ten days   were a one-time step-function change, by which we were setting a level based on where we think   the real economy is, and we need to get back to normal monetary policymaking  I think dropping   the word “appreciable” as in alternative B is one way to do so  The goal would be for monetary   policy to get back to sort of normal business in tough times     January 29–30, 2008 143 of 249    Another point, just of commentary, is that, by taking this action along the lines of alternative   B, it would be nice if we weren’t going to be lowering the value implied by the markets of where   the rate will end up  So my support of alternative B is nonetheless with this worry as well—that the   markets might think that we have more-dramatic actions and that we will have to go lower longer   than is currently implied  I don’t mean to give them additional credit there, but I don’t think that we   have a great alternative  As to the point about market expectations, I would note that we will—and   necessarily at some level should—during the course of our next several meetings disappoint market   expectations, and that is not something I think we need to run from  I think that will be part of the   discipline function, but this is probably not the right time to do it   As a final point, alternative B is consistent with the narrative that we’ve started based on the   data we saw in mid-December, based on the Chairman’s speech earlier this month, and based on our   meetings over the past several weeks  It strikes me that it would be prudent at this time of financial   stability risks and uncertainty in the markets for us not to add volatility—not to throw out a different   nuance or try to be too clever  So while I have sympathy for some of the ideas and amendments   that have been suggested in this discussion, we’ve come to a pretty tough place, as I said at the   outset  It’s a tough fork in the road  We should all feel to some degree uncomfortable about the   choice we make, but the choice we’re making today needs to be as clear as it can be  Even if we’d   get some comfort in being a little cute, a little clever, and a little nuanced, I’m afraid we might be   undoing some of the clear bet that we have to put on the table  So with that, I support alternative B   as written  Thank you, Mr Chairman     I’d add only that I think where the rating agencies are now is trying to come   up with cleaner boxes and better governance—Sarbanes-Oxley types of structures, ombudsmen,   liaisons, Chinese walls  The core issues that Mike and his team bring up seem highly resistant to   change, but you know, there will be nothing like three months of public hearings, if not hangings    [Laughter]  That could change that dynamic, but that’s in the early stages      Thank you, Mr Chairman  My comments will be short  I share the   assessment that Bill Dudley and others made in terms of the market functioning, and I think the   March 10, 2008 29 of 39    rolling capital call that we discussed at videoconferences appears to be accelerating, particularly in   recent days  The most recent catalyst, as was pointed out, was counterparty weakness driven by   large balance sheet exposures and a lack of term funding  Highly leveraged institutions are   uncertain about a lot of things, but let me highlight two of them  first, the value of their collateral   and, second, their ability to secure financing  I think today’s action is an attempt to hit the second   and not hit the first, and in so doing hopes to respect a pretty important line   As I heard the discussion today and the discussion of the markets, it’s as though three horses   are competing in a race  The deleveraging horse seems to have raced ahead  The policy reaction   function horse is the one we’re working on now  The most important horse is the horse that   represents fresh capital, and again, I think the goal of our policy is to get that third horse to go  I am   trying to figure out what our objective function is here, and I think it is principally to help provide   liquidity for high-quality assets held by a class of highly leveraged financial institutions so that we   can do three things  buy time to facilitate price discovery, improve market functioning, and   improve the efficacy of open market operations  We are not trying to establish asset values  We’re   not trying to buy assets  Those aren’t our goals, and it strikes me that they shouldn’t be  The hard   question that came up at the outset is whether these actions can stabilize some part of the capital   structure of financial institutions to help us achieve those objectives  For me, as Governor Kohn   said, this is a very difficult call, but in the end I do support the judgment  I think we’re going to   have to continue to watch the extent to which the healing that might happen in the agency market   and in the AAA MBS market moves down the quality spectrum, and we have to be alert to ensure   that they don’t come to us seeking solutions there but that we get that third horse back into the race    Thank you, Mr Chairman      You’re still going to get questions apparently  [Laughter]     I’m under the impression—Bill, you correct me—in the earnings call   from the investment banks today and tomorrow, the four remaining are going to do all they can   to destigmatize this facility with answers to the effect that “we haven’t tapped the facility yet, but   we would be very open to do it in the right circumstances” and to provide some comfort that it is   not stigmatizing in their own minds  For the strongest of those firms to say that should provide   some halo for the rest  But to Bill’s point, I think we will have to evaluate that as we go     Thank you, Mr Chairman  To join the growing chorus in the discussion   today, I would say that there are very significant policy challenges across five areas on both sides   of our mandate  First, the real economy is materially weaker  Second, inflation risks are quite   discomforting  Third, we have genuine issues with respect to financial stability  Fourth, we   have very real problems with respect to the credit channel and credit availability  Finally, as I   think a couple of others have said, we have risks in terms of possible disorderly moves on the   dollar  In terms of what markets believe that we believe are the big concerns, I think they rightly   understand that we are very worried about downside risks to the economy  They believe that we   are very focused on financial stability risks; and with the three new facilities announced in recent   periods, they are coming to believe that we are finding an effective means to deal with a credit   intermediation system that is, to perhaps overstate only a little, broken  But market participants   may not yet believe that we are as concerned as we ought to be about inflation risks and about   risks with respect to the path of the exchange value of the dollar     With that summary having been made, let me talk, first, about financial market   conditions   About the deterioration in market functioning since the last FOMC meeting, Bill   March 18, 2008 60 of 127    spoke in great detail  Over the past couple of weeks, not just in the episode with Bear Stearns,   counterparty risk has become the dominant concern in markets  As has been pointed out around   this table, it is increasingly difficult to separate liquidity issues from solvency issues  So what   should we take from this deterioration in counterparty risks?  If we look at a range of financial   institutions that have different degrees of implied backstops by the government based on their   size and their regulatory structure, we think about the GSEs that have an implied government   guarantee and even Ginnie Maes, which have the full faith and credit backing of the US   government and about which the Board staff shared some data yesterday with us  The spreads   on all of these look as though they have widened substantially  We have seen very real   deterioration  But when you see that it is happening for the Ginnie Maes, just as with many of   these other securities, it suggests that this is substantially, but not completely, about liquidity risk   because the credit risk of Ginnies ostensibly can’t be called into question   Financial institutions, more broadly than financial markets, are having a hard time finding   their way  We have talked around this table before about their balance sheet problems, and most   recently we have talked about their income statement problems in figuring out what their core   business is  In the markets in the last couple of days, we have had the broker–dealers with   widening CDS spreads and falling share prices, and of course, that is about their mortgage   exposure and liquidity concerns  But I think, most fundamentally, that the business model of   investment banks has been threatened, and I suspect the existing business model will not endure   through this period  As a result, the current architecture of the regulation of financial institutions   and of the business model across ranges of financial institutions—commercial banks, investment   banks, and hedge funds—will change through this period  The old model, at least in investment   March 18, 2008 61 of 127    banking, of high imputed leverage works incredibly well in a world of high liquidity and doesn’t   work as well when liquidity is in short supply     Why do I think this matters?  It matters because it suggests that any catalyst for   improvement from financial institutions feeding into the real economy for the rest of 2008 or   even for the first half of 2009 is quite suspect  These institutions are spending all their time and   attention on their own business models, figuring out how they can survive this period, not on   providing credit to the real economy  So I don’t look to financial institutions to be very good   shock absorbers or very good catalysts going forward  My concern, broadly, about financial   institutions is highlighted when I think about the need, across all these institutions, to raise   significant capital for safety and soundness purposes and, in addition, for credit availability   purposes  It strikes me that this broad class is systematically undercapitalized, and we need to   use all our tools to persuade them that it is in their interest and in the interest of the broad   economy for them to raise capital   But finding capital, certainly over the next six months, will be a very real challenge  The   capital markets are not in a very strong position to satisfy issuer needs at present  That obviously   can improve over the next couple of months, but there is no certainty  Sovereign wealth funds   and other sources of investment that we have been talking about for some time—and we saw   their real interest in investing in financial institutions at the end of last year or early this year—  are quite beaten down  Those that I talked to, who are very sophisticated investors from places   in Asia and the Middle East, do not want to appear as though they are doormats for these   financial institutions  Their own political structures make the losses they have had to endure   front page news  I think the expectation that sovereign wealth funds are going to continue to be   a source of funding in this period is well overstated  Moreover, private equity—the case for   March 18, 2008 62 of 127    opportunistic capital—has little ability to get leverage in this environment, and so if they don’t   reduce their target hurdle rates, I don’t expect them to be able to come to the rescue  All of that,   again, suggests to me that the real economy will have to wait awhile for improvement as this   repair is slow and not at all certain over the next six to nine months   Obviously, the implication for the real economy is hard to speculate about, but I think,   looking at some rough measures, maybe a third of the credit availability of the real economy has   been taken out during this period—maybe more than that  I would say that the last week makes   it hard for us to judge how much more credit channel capability and balance sheet capacity have   left the real economy, but it suggests a picture for the real economy that is worthy of real   concern  Now, when I look to the real economy, I would just underscore the comments I have   heard from others  A couple of CEOs who have been incredibly optimistic, at least in my   discussions with them in the past couple of years—these are CEOs of leading consumer product   companies—have thrown in the towel  They have given up trying to justify and explain away   weakness  Across the auto sector, a couple of the new owners of the auto companies are now   focused on a scenario in which units are in the 145 million range rather than the 15 million or   155 million range, largely because of weakness of consumption in terms of consumer purchases    But that really goes back to credit, and in some ways the credit availability to fund those auto   purchases is a chance for another stepdown in the next month   I think that business cap-ex is as threatened as has been represented today  It is the only   area for which my own sense is probably more negative than the Greenbook’s in terms of   weakness to expect out of Europe and the United Kingdom  It is hard for me to think, as we go   through this period, that Europe and the United Kingdom would stay as decoupled as recent data   suggest  Their economies are tied to their banking system more concretely than we are tied to   March 18, 2008 63 of 127    ours, and I suspect that their large financial institutions are going to suffer real problems during   this upcoming period  If not, it is certainly a risk factor   Let me turn to the last two issues—inflation and currency  On the inflation front, there is   little reason to be confident that inflation will decline  There are reasons to believe that our   inflation problems will become more pronounced and, I fear, more persistent  The recent run-up   in energy prices and commodity prices in the context of weaker global demand is troubling  No   doubt partly it is a move to real assets by the financial community—that is, a hedge against all of   this is certainly, to the Governor Kohn’s point, raising commodity prices  But I am not sure what   catalyst will change that over at least the next six months  As the Board staff has noted, there   has been some rise in inflation compensation and inflation expectations  There is acceleration in   the fall of the exchange rate of the dollar, suggestive of increasing import inflation  Moreover, it   is not obvious to me that a slowing economy in this cycle, in the short term at least, will do our   work for us on the inflation front   Finally, let me turn to currency  Given this particular confluence of events, the   accelerated depreciation of the dollar is troubling, and I think the risks of a disorderly move on   the dollar in the upcoming six weeks are hard to discount  The catalyst of that could be a sudden   de-pegging by certain countries in the Middle East  But even if that does not come to pass, there   is an expectation in the market, where traders are looking for bets where they believe they can   make money with certitude, that there is still a free one-way bet on the dollar  That is not   healthy for currency movements, regardless of one’s view of where the dollar should ultimately   be trading against the currencies of our trading partners  At this time, particularly, given our   concerns about making sure that the US economy remains open for foreign direct investment—  that this is where others want to invest their capital—it strikes me as a reasonably dangerous   March 18, 2008 64 of 127    prospect if the view is that the dollar will continue its accelerated path  Obviously, this suggests   very difficult judgments for the next round of our discussion, and I will take up monetary policy   in that context  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  A couple of quick introductory points  First,   I have total confidence in the Fed and the FOMC, certainly over the course of my couple of years   here, in effectively handling these challenges, which is key to highlight at the outset of my   remarks  I have total confidence in this institution’s ability, in particular, to handle both sides of   the dual mandate  Moreover, I would say that I have total confidence in our ability to have a   really robust discussion here and recognize, as President Geithner pointed out, the fragility in   these financial markets  A lot of our strength comes from being able to have very open, tough   discussions with each other and recognize that, if they were in the public square, they could be   misinterpreted and destabilizing  I think he is right that we all need to take that into account,   particularly over this next intermeeting period, which we all hope lasts six weeks  Moreover, I   think that the power of our tools, our creativity, and our innovative abilities over November,   December, and these recent weeks has been incredibly impressive  I think that those will work   in concert with monetary policy  I would underscore a point that the Chairman made, which is   that we have taken a huge burden on ourselves and that the burden will have to be matched by   others here in Washington—and I suspect before we get too much into the second and third   quarter by others around the world—which will go a long way toward helping us accomplish our   objectives   Second, I have total confidence in US financial institutions over the medium term to   deal with these issues  They will come out of this thing stronger, smarter, and faster and will be   huge net exporters of services, but that is going to take a while  My own view is that the capital-  raising is good and very important  If the tail is as fat as we have discussed, capital-raising by   March 18, 2008 101 of 127    these institutions should help them stave off safety and soundness issues that could arise  So I   think that it is good prudential management by them and us alike   To the task at hand on monetary policy, I will support alternative A, as the Chairman   recommends, and I take particular comfort in the narrative and language in A as being a very   important next step for us to guard against risks on the currency front and on the inflation front    Now, these words themselves won’t do a ton in the short term, and they won’t have an   immediate effect, but I do think it is important for us to take these and build on them in our   private and public statements  So that gives me some comfort  On the decision of 50 points   versus 75 points, I would be kidding myself if I thought that those 25 basis points were   completely consequential  I wouldn’t ascribe virtue or vice to that sort of bid-asked spread  I   would say that it is a hard call  I share the view expressed by some that these markets are going   to need to be disappointed at some point here  That is the only way the words that we express   will be properly understood and taken into account in the markets’ judgments, and I worry that   we are not going to have any great opportunities to disappoint them over the course of the   upcoming meetings   Finally, let me say this  I will end where I started in this discussion, which is, at the end   of the day, it is this institution’s credibility that is paramount and that is increasingly the case at   this point in the cycle  It strikes me that we have to continue to make the case in the upcoming   months that we have the will, the wisdom, and the tools to tackle these issues  To the extent that   monetary policy is perceived by pundits and Fed watchers as not working, it is important that we   rebut those arguments and explain that our tools will work over time and that we are looking for   assistance both in Washington and in other nations’ capitals  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Brian, does “somewhat” mitigate it a little, or does that highlight it?      Thank you, Mr Chairman  As has been described by most around the   table, official data on the real economy suggest weakness but haven’t materially changed since   we met in mid-March  Others have talked in more detail about weakening labor markets, poor   consumer sentiment, and worrying trends in consumer spending  Certainly the reports through   March that I have received are that consumer spending in March was as bad as anyone who was   in the business of retail or credit card spending could have envisioned  That is certainly   disappointing  Oddly, there are at least some preliminary data through the first few weeks of   April of some improvement, but I don’t take much signal from them  Also, obviously, as others   around the table have said, the tone, trading, and expectations of financial market participants   have improved markedly  If only I were as confident  Whereas market participants only some   weeks ago saw fear, they now perceive promise  Whether that is the triumph of hope over   experience only time will tell, but I am skeptical     Let me talk for a few moments about a couple of positive factors that should be helping   and four or so negative factors  First, on the positive side, I want to give voice to the capital-  raising that a couple of others around the table have referred to  We and the Treasury have been   calling for some months for capital-raising across all types of financial institutions  The   questions then were whether financial institutions were willing to take the dilution and go raise   capital  At least equally as important was whether there would be sufficient investor demand  I   think the answer to both of those questions appears to be “yes”  Investor demand from nearly all   April 29–30, 2008 78 of 266    sources—including sovereign wealth funds, hedge funds, and traditional long-only managers—  has funded virtually all classes of financial institutions—that is, investment banks, money center   banks, regional banks, and community banks—across the capital structure—equities,   convertibles, and preferred debt—in a huge range of distressed and more-stable situations  I   think that is invariably a very encouraging sign, and we should only be so lucky that those   markets remain wide open  Is this improvement likely to be enduring?  This strikes me as pretty   consequential as to whether or not we see the economy respond as favorably in the second half   of this year as the Greenbook suggests  Is the improvement in equity markets, in leveraged   loans, and in high-yield markets and the narrowing of CDS spreads sustainable, or is there more   bad news to come that is not priced into the market?  My own view is that balance sheets are on   the road to repair but that income statements for these financial institutions remain highly   challenged  March was a terrible month for financial institutions’ profitability, which should   make it harder for credit to expand, as would be hoped for with any sort of V-shaped or U-  shaped recovery   The second positive factor, building on the increase in capital, is really what is going on   among the Fortune 2000, particularly the nonfinancial Fortune 2000  Earnings look pretty   stubborn and solid  Though they have come off their peaks, corporate profit levels are quite   remarkable for all of the things that are wrong in this economy, and they look to me to be   anachronistic with previous periods of recession  The balance sheets of those Fortune 2000   companies look excellent  The investment-grade markets remain wide open  I think the question   is whether those Fortune 2000 will be hiring workers during the next two or three years in the   United States, and on that front, I am probably reasonably skeptical   April 29–30, 2008 79 of 266    So if those are the positive factors, let me turn to the negative  First, consumer weakness   seems to be spreading  The largest credit card providers report that credit card spend is   deteriorating—again, absent a couple of odd noises in April—and that the strains showing up as   delinquency, which were once only in states where housing issues were predominant, now seem   to be in other states as well  Second, credit availability for small business seems under   remarkable pressure  Not only has the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey continued to be   disappointing, large money center banks appear to be pulling back from some segments of the   small business markets entirely  Third, interbank funding market problems, as others have   discussed, seem inconsistent with the broader improvement in credit markets  It is a troubling   sign that all might not be as well as it appears in this curative process  A fourth and final   negative factor is inflation  The Greenbook, which has a much more benign forecast for inflation   than I do, revised up the forecast for core and headline inflation in the second half of 2008, as   David said  I am still more worried about inflation prospects  As for inflation expectations and   possible second- and third-order effects of these changes in prices, trading and anecdotes over   the last several weeks and months continued to be troubling  I have spent less time in my   remarks on inflation than on growth but only because I suppose there is less to say  The trends   are troubling  The relationships among our policy actions, the foreign exchange value of the   dollar, and commodity prices are worth further scrutiny  In summary, although we should be   pleased with the official data on the economy as not deteriorating in the intermeeting period and   with financial markets that have certainly exceeded my own expectations for improvement, I   remain quite concerned about pressures on both sides of the dual mandate—a discussion that we   will take up more in the next round  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I can support alternative B, but I must admit I   can’t do it with the conviction that I would prefer to have  I think market participants will look at   our decision today and at the data over the next few weeks and try to measure whether we can hold   up to the pause language that accompanies alternative B  Taking action with a 25 basis point move   today, we have to then be prepared to stomach the continued weakness in the real economy that is in   many of our projections  Speaking for myself, I’d say we also have to be prepared when we next   meet to hold the line even if we see a retracing of some of the improvements in financial markets    So in my own base case, the judgment when we next meet will be a harder one  The economy   might look weak; financial markets might look weaker than they are; and trying to signal to the   markets in alternative B that we are serious about holding the line at what would then be 2 percent is   putting a pretty hard task on us  I think we’re capable of holding the line there, but we have to hold   ourselves to that standard   The 25 basis point move, in and of itself, doesn’t strike me as that consequential  What   strikes me as consequential is the symbolism  Given the uncertainties that Dave and the team have   April 29–30, 2008 126 of 266    spoken about, it strikes me that the 25 basis points is not nearly as consequential in effect as what   might well happen to the transmission mechanism and the efficacy of this change in federal funds   rates on the real economy  Put differently, if the financial markets can get back to business, they   will be helping the real economy, in effect lowering the cost of capital far more than our actions   would today   As I said, I think the symbolism here does matter  By moving 25 basis points today, we’re   taking some risks with the dollar  I think that the dollar improvement we have seen over the past   several days and weeks has occurred because there’s an expectation that we are closer to a pause   and that this Committee is going to have a tougher decision about whether or not to move than they   had anticipated some weeks ago  Even though the language in alternative B is useful in trying to lay   the factual predicate for a pause when we next meet, there will be a lot of folks who will be   wondering about our convictions there, and when they do, I think we are assuming some dollar   risks  We are also assuming incremental risks on the inflation front  Continued easing could well   encourage the perception that the FOMC has a greater tolerance for inflation than is prudent, with   potential adverse effects on inflation expectations, a further run-up in commodity prices, and a   continued decline in the foreign exchange value of the dollar   So this is a tough judgment that we’re making, with significant uncertainty  I take comfort   in believing that the language in the minutes and the remarks that we all offer between now and the   next time we meet will suggest not that this is a cut with a dovish pause but that this is a cut with an   expectation of holding after our actions today  We are not barring all events because we can   certainly imagine the world turning yet again and we can certainly imagine another let-down,   particularly in the global economy  But this is a statement that we want to hold after our action   April 29–30, 2008 127 of 266    today and that we are prepared to stomach some additional bad news with respect both to the   economy and to financial markets  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Governor Kohn shamelessly stole my question  [Laughter]       Thank you, Mr Chairman  Let me add my plaudits to those already   expressed on the quality of this work, and then let me confine my comments to the timing and   sequencing  First, with respect to the rollout of the white paper, it strikes me that, given that   questions have been raised about what our flexibility is around our balance sheet and tools in the   event of continued problems in the financial markets, we just need to be cognizant in that paper   of how this discussion might be read, not in the context of a long Fed effort to get interest on   reserves but perhaps as being solely responsive to what are perceived to be burdens on our   balance sheet flexibility  I am just sensitive to how that white paper will be read and rolled out    More broadly, on timing—come fall, in the event that we decide collectively to go to the   Congress seeking other authority with respect to the PDCF, investment banks, and other things   that might or might not be concluded, even though this timeline makes a lot of sense, we might   be in good stead to have a fairly good sense of the conclusions to which we will ultimately come,   even if our exhaustive Fed rigor isn’t complete by that time  If there is real benefit to   accelerating our new authority from late 2011 to some earlier period, we could put that in the   context of some of broader asks from us with an expectation that we might get some traction   there  So as a sort of secondary timeline, having that option value come fall strikes me as useful    Thank you, Mr Chairman      Thank you, Mr Chairman  At this point everything has been said, but   everybody hasn’t said it  So let me try  [Laughter]  Let me make three summary points, and then I   will talk about three issues that I think are harder  First, on the economy, through late May, as the   June 24–25, 2008 78 of 253    Greenbook suggests, the real economy proved more resilient and more dynamic than the consensus   had anticipated  Consumer spending was moderate but positive, and the labor markets were soft,   but neither was necessarily indicative of a recession through late May  Business fixed investment   and corporate profits ex financials look all right  Productivity growth looks, frankly, impressive,   and corporations, unlike consumers, still appear okay through the month of June—but I’m going to   return to June in just a short while  In sum, my assessment of the economy reasonably   approximates the average GDP from the Greenbook for 2008, but I remain considerably more   cautious on the catalyst for return-to-trend growth in the forecast period of 2009 and beyond  I   suspect that this is a long, slow climb with the credit channels needing to be rebuilt and that the   process is still in its very early stages   Second, let me talk about the financial markets  Financial markets continue to show tenuous   but real improvements in market functioning—which, as Bill Dudley suggested, is remarkable   given the weakness among financial institutions themselves  Leveraged loans and high-yield   markets continue to trend toward improved market functioning  Credit spreads are well off their   March highs  Credit markets, in particular, are holding up well, despite the broad weakness across   equities   Third, let me turn to inflation risks  Inflation risks, in my view, continue to predominate as   the greater risk to the economy  There is more evidence of a global secular reversal of inflation   trends, making the jobs of central bankers worldwide considerably more difficult  I remain worried   about energy and food pass-through and the effect of a weakening dollar if our policy rates and   those of our major trading partners are perceived to diverge  I would expect import prices, core   inflation, and expectations to move up in the coming months even more than in the Greenbook,   likely causing a policy response by our foreign peers  Commodity prices, again, with the exception   June 24–25, 2008 79 of 253    of metals, have been moving up while global demand is falling, and markets have come to see this   rise of some, if not most, commodities as essentially permanent  So at the end of the day, we have   to be concerned about this period of above-acceptable inflation  It’s crucial that broader prices do   not start to rise at still-faster rates, and that could well happen if those making decisions about prices   and pay expect higher inflation in the future  Anecdotes are not comforting, particularly on the   price front  As a result, I think the trajectory of inflation is less favorable than in the Greenbook,   thereby necessitating a policy response more significant than the Greenbook would suggest   Let me turn to three even harder issues  One is consumer spending  We’re not done with   the second quarter, and my sense of what’s happened in the first three weeks of June is pretty   miserable  I hate to extrapolate based on three weeks of data to the trajectory of the economy  But   from a discussion with contacts from three credit card companies that constitute a little more than   half of the credit card spend, I would say that the views from these guys were shocking in how bad   things looked in the past three to four weeks, particularly in comparison to reasonably positive news   from the previous two months  It is suggestive that June will be much weaker than May, and if I   add that to the figures on autos that are coming out of the Detroit Three, those are a couple of   anecdotes that make me a little hesitant to declare with an exclamation mark what an enviable   second quarter we’ve had  I also look at equity market prices sometimes as maybe telling us   something  I would say that consumer companies and retailers over the last three weeks have gotten   killed  So I’m a little hesitant to suggest that the second quarter is going to be strong    Delinquencies and charge-offs have also moved meaningfully to the downside in the last three or   four weeks among these credit card companies, and this weakness appears to be much more focused   on the coasts than it is in the center of the country  I heard that from three of three  My own view   June 24–25, 2008 80 of 253    may be influenced by my take on the fiscal stimulus—it sure doesn’t appear to be helping very   much   The second issue that I continue to struggle with is financial institutions  Financial   institution equity prices showed significant underperformance, and some people say that is the   Federal Reserve’s fault  We’re talking up our concerns about inflation  We’re changing the   Treasury curve going forward  I think that is a total red herring  The reason that financials are   getting killed is an equity story  They have business models that are having a hard time delivering   profits in this environment  They have had to show a very tough quarterly set of losses  I think the   problems on financials have to do with financials and not with the Fed, though there is a disturbing   amount of chatter in the markets that somehow we’re the cause of that  I am comforted, again as   Bill Dudley reminded us, that the broader market functioning has been able to withstand this   dramatic financial institution weakness  Whether at some point that will give out I don’t know, but   I’d say that’s extremely encouraging  In addition, we have to recognize that massive amounts of   new capital are going to be needed for financial institutions of all sizes  Given the weak   performance of virtually every financial investment from November till now, I think it is very easy   to see a supply–demand problem  It is very easy to see that, with the number of banks that come to   these markets, some of them at some point might not be able to find capital even at dramatically   lower prices than their expectations  It is prudent for us at the Fed to think about alternative sources   of more-patient institutional funding during this period   The third issue for discussion is credit availability, especially for small businesses  This   strikes me as being key to the labor market situation  Credit availability for small businesses has   held up better than I would have expected four or five months ago, but pockets of weakness remain,   particularly among the regional banks, which are a source of concern  I guess I’ve become   June 24–25, 2008 81 of 253    convinced that credit lines have not been tapped out  There was a theory, one that I even had some   sympathy toward, that increases in C&I lending in the last few quarters were involuntary, reflecting   existing credit lines that were called upon  That strikes me as being somewhat overstated    According to anecdotes and our own survey of the terms of business lending, it does suggest that   capital is still available for these small businesses to provide some strength to the economy; but   again, continued weakness among the regionals could call that into question   Let me turn finally, Mr Chairman, to the projections  I have some sympathy for the view   that Vice Chairman Geithner put forth  It strikes me that at this time the markets will see the   benefits of changing our communication strategy as, yet again, pretty small  The costs are harder   for me to be certain about  So if anyone is proposing to do this during the next six months, I would   have real hesitancy about introducing this variable into our communication strategy amid our   assessment of all the other challenges that we have  So I favor having a trial run come October, but   I think we should revisit where we stand on the inflation front, the financial institution front, and the   growth front before adding this to the mix  To the extent that we find the appropriate time to go   down this path, I would favor option 3  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Let me say just a few things  First, to state   the obvious—there are risks on all sides of these decisions  Second, I will try to wade into the   debate briefly on this accommodation point  My own view is that policy is accommodative—the   degree of that is why we are having this debate  I think about our degree of accommodation as a   function both of our target fed funds rate and what the financial markets do with it, by which I   don’t mean just what the expected fed funds targets are out in the future but the transmission   mechanism  The degree of accommodation, as we think about our decision now and in the next   several months, will depend more on financial market developments than, frankly, the decisions   that we end up making on the target; and it is very hard for us to judge the direction of these   markets  As much as we have talked about tail risks on the financial market side and the real   economy side being diminished, I think all of us would say that there is a real chance that this   will be a long, hot summer  It is hard to know what the credit channels are going to do with our   target federal funds rate  It is not obvious to me that we should try to perfectly offset the changes   in financial market developments by contemplating changes in the federal funds rate now   What I think most likely is that we won’t be as certain as we would like to be regarding   growth risks and we won’t be as certain as we would like to be regarding financial market   developments before we have to begin a posture of removing policy accommodation  So with all   those caveats and a view that policy remains more accommodative than we can allow it to be for   too long, I will support alternative B and think that we have to remain very open-minded, very   nimble, in our task of removing policy accommodation   In terms of President Plosser’s suggestion on “considerable,” I think the reason for the   debate over using that word is in my own view that these markets are still under considerable   stress, but the trend from the last statement to this statement is that they are under less   June 24–25, 2008 126 of 253    considerable stress  Therein lies the difficulty in wording this in the statement  If we do remove   “considerable,” it wouldn’t surprise me that when we next meet we will say, “Boy, it seems as   though stress is up  Wonder if we should put it back in?”  I don’t feel strongly, other than I don’t   like the idea of removing it now if we think that there’s a chance that the trends, which are very   tenuous, turn around  So I think I would favor the language that you have written  Thank you,   Mr Chairman     Not a question, just for the go-round     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Let me make a few prefatory comments, and   then try to answer a couple of the key questions in the memo  First, a crisis is a terrible thing to   waste  My sense is that we have an opportunity here to do the right thing over the period to try   to get market discipline—to Charlie’s point—back and vibrant and working countercyclically   with regulatory discipline and capital standards  So this is an opportunity  As we contemplate   our six-months-and-a-day problem, what do we do between September and year-end?  I agree   with Vice Chairman Geithner’s comment that we need to keep options open, and I will make a   proposal in a moment for how to do that   Second, the memo from the staff said that improvements in financial markets have   resulted, importantly, from the availability of the special liquidity facilities, and I agree with that    But I wouldn’t give short shrift to the other things that have been going on in the markets that   June 24–25, 2008 183 of 253    have improved market functioning  I don’t think it is fair to say that we deserve a   disproportionate amount of credit for what has happened  We have seen a ton of capital-raising    We have seen a lot of diversification of funding sources  We have seen changes in duration by   financial institutions  We have seen improved disclosure and transparency  We have seen big   write-downs  We have seen brutal changes in management teams  We have seen pairing of   business lines and improved risk management  So it strikes me that market discipline is alive   and well  It was necessary for us to do what we did, but I think it hangs way too much on our   facilities if we suggest that we are the only thing that is keeping the system together   As a final prefatory comment, the memo says that some investors have indicated their   willingness to lend to primary dealers in recent months, and that has been conditioned on   dealers’ access to the PDCF  It strikes me that proves too much  I am not sure that is a good   thing  The concerns we have late in the cycle, when we look back, include that market discipline   broke down  In the short term, obviously, we want to see some of the money market mutual   funds from President Rosengren’s neck of the woods hang in there with these institutions so we   don’t have a sort of panic coming  But over the short to medium term, we want the guys in   money market mutual funds to recognize that, when they are providing funding overnight, they   are making an investment decision that has a risk  So I hesitate to suggest that we want to do   things over the period that let them be complacent  We want to do things that make them very   focused on the decisions they are making     Now a bit to the key questions that were asked in the memo  First, on liquidity facilities,   on the question of the PDCF and its symmetry with the TSLF, I like that notion of the balance of   having an auction and having one that is available more regularly  But we have to recognize that   the PDCF, whether intended or not, has been stigmatized  If Lehman Brothers, when they were   June 24–25, 2008 184 of 253    on their darkest day, had answered the question differently, I dare say they might not be in   existence  They were asked, “Have you accessed the PDCF?”  The answer was, “Absolutely   not”  If their answer to that had been “yes,” I suspect that they and we could have been in a very   different circumstance  So what does that prove?  I think that proves that the existence of these   facilities matters  It keeps institutions in the game  The particular terms matter less  But also, in   extremis, accessing that facility, unlike the securities lending facility, causes losing a   considerable amount of control over one’s own fate  So I think we have to take that into   consideration   We have considerable leverage over these institutions at this time  No matter what they   and their lobbyists say, they want us to be their regulator more than they can possibly contain   themselves—mostly for our credibility and mostly for our balance sheet  I worry that if we   extend the PDCF as is by just punting it down the road some months, we will lose some of that   leverage  So one idea, which I must say I haven’t explored as much as I probably should, is   extending the PDCF, not as is but by modifying it in a way that would make Bagehot proud—by   making it more expensive, by widening the spread  Now, there are other things we could do in   this short-term extension that modify its terms—changing collateral or changing haircuts  But it   strikes me that price might be an interesting way to say, “Listen, we aren’t pre-judging outcomes,   but you can see from this move that we aren’t comfortable with the status quo, and we are asking   ourselves these very hard questions that we brought to bear”  That could send an important   signal, which I don’t think would be overly disruptive to the markets if we explained some of the   rationale for doing it   Let me turn, finally, to the prudential supervision questions  I have a note here in answer   to the first question, “How do we limit moral hazard if we continue the facilities?”  My bold   June 24–25, 2008 185 of 253    answer is “carefully,” so I guess not much is there  On what principles should supervisory   expectations be based?  I think Art talked rightly about these different regulatory frameworks for   the big money center commercial banks and the investment banks  We’d be doing ourselves a   disservice over the period, Mr Chairman, to take the regulatory regime that we have now had for   a long time for these big complex commercial banks and try to put it on the investment banks    I’ll answer this the way I began  We have an opportunity to start with a blank sheet of paper,   with four institutions over the period, and figure out how to be really, really good regulators,   building on the lessons that we have learned from our traditional supervision and regulation   function  I think that we would be making a mistake by saying, “We have a model, and let’s   throw it on these guys”  If we regulate these four institutions the way we have long been   regulating commercial banks with the OCC and others, I think we won’t have maximized the   best of regulation  The goal would be to figure out how to regulate these four right and then,   frankly, to export those lessons to what we have long been doing to make regulation better and   stronger across this group  If it turns out that we do to Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley what   we have been doing to Citi and JPMorgan, as was suggested, we will find other people will be in   the business of investment banking, so we won’t have done terribly much to mitigate systemic   risk   Finally, on the question about the role for the Congress  Both in the medium term, Mr   Chairman, in the context of your speeches and as we get toward the end of July, when you   announce some modification—if the FOMC agrees—about these facilities and the PDCF, it is   very important that the Congress be given serious responsibility for this  It has been very easy   for them to criticize, on the one hand, and to whisper to us all their support, on the other  I think   they need to be given very important homework assignments in terms of what they can do    June 24–25, 2008 186 of 253    Some form of FDICIA with investment banks might be one example  Wrestling about these   issues in terms of regulatory organizations strikes me as very consequential  Even if we could   convince ourselves that we have all the regulatory authority to figure this out with our regulators,   we would be better off, when we are ready and we have the right answer in our own view, to   bring it to the Congress for final clarity and to get their imprimatur  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  So just on behalf of the troublemaker caucus,   [laughter] let me make a suggestion  It doesn’t strike me as though the deltas between Vice   Chairman Geithner’s formulation and what I proffered are that large  That is, I think we   collectively agree that we need, as part of an extension of the facility, to ensure that there is a   suite of facilities and self-help efforts—tri-party repos, OTC derivatives, principles by you, and   clarity on what the horizon looks like  I guess the only question is, At the time that you solicit   the notation vote and announce this—let’s say that is the second half of July—how comfortable   are we at how that package looks to suggest that we are keeping options open and that the signal   we are sending is not that this is a business that we want to stay in forever?  Maybe in that   context we will see what kind of progress we are making in truth on some of those infrastructure   improvements and in the narrative, so that we can revisit—I think maybe with some guidance   from Brian, Bill, and the staff—what the incremental benefits are of a modest change to the   PDCF in that context  By the second half of July, we might find that we are much more   informed so as to weigh the benefits and costs of it      Thank you, Mr Chairman  A couple of things briefly  First, Mr Chairman,   the most important decision that needs to be made—and, again, I defer like others to your   judgment—is on the extension of the facilities, given market expectations about what you and   others have said about them in recent weeks  While many very serious, legitimate issues have been   raised about the nature of our supervisory framework and about our comfort with the collateral   we’ve received, I would suggest that we won’t be able to wait until we’ve gotten comfort around   those questions before you decide that we should take a vote either today or by notation vote on the   broad facilities that we’ve already put in place  So I would suggest that maybe we’d want to   separate that from the broader discussion   As for the most optimal mix of liquidity facilities, I’m convinced that what we have is   imperfect  It has had some beneficial effect, but it can be improved upon  Exactly how we judge   those improvements—the standards by which we come to a determination, which will necessarily   be imperfect in these markets—is worth further consideration; and I would not object to separating   that question from the extension question that you raised at the outset  Thank you      Thank you, Mr Chairman  I have no material changes to report in my view   on the overall state of financial stability, growth, or inflation; but as I talked about at the last   meeting, it still is likely to be a long, hot summer, and we’re only about half over with it  I’ll talk   first about financial institutions—make maybe four or five points—and then turn quickly to the   economy and inflation   First, on financial institutions, I think the body blow that the financial markets and the real   economy have taken because of the turmoil at the GSEs is not complete  It is easy for those of us in   Washington to forget that bill signings don’t always solve problems  I’d say, if the last thing that   happens on GSEs is that the bill was signed two weeks ago and action isn’t taken in the coming   August 5, 2008 80 of 145    weeks and months, then I would be surprised if we could get through this period without more GSE   turmoil finding its way onto the front pages  Second, in terms of financial market conditions, the   fall in oil prices and the rest of the energy complex is, indeed, good news, but it strikes me that it has   camouflaged an even tougher period for financial institutions than would otherwise be the case    That is, financial institutions somehow look a little more resilient, but I think part of that is only   because of the negative correlation that’s developed in recent times between equity prices of   financials and oil prices  The financial institutions themselves strike me as being in worse condition   than market prices would suggest   Third, capital raising, as we have long talked about, is essential to the fix among financial   institutions  The way I best describe capital raising over maybe the last nine months is that the first   round of capital raising, which was in November and December, was really the vanity round  This   consisted of very limited due diligence, sovereign wealth funds signing up, issuers relying upon   their vaunted global brands, and capital being raised in a matter of days  The second round   probably took us to the spring, a round that I’d call the confessional round  [Laughter]  In this   round, financial institutions said, “Oh my, look at these real write-downs that I have  Look at the   need for this real capital raising, and here I’m telling you, the investors, all that I know”  But the   second and third confessions usually have less credibility than the first  The third round is the round   that we’re in the middle of, which I think of as the liquidation and recap round, likely to be the   hardest round to pull off  It is likely to force issuers of new shares or of new forms of preferred   stock to be asking of themselves and their investors the toughest choices  They have to assess the   strength and durability of their core franchises  I think that this will be happening in very real time    So the circumstance of an investment bank that Bill mentioned at the outset I don’t think will be the   sole case of this  This liquidation and recap round is later than would be ideal from the perspective   August 5, 2008 81 of 145    of the broader economy, but it is absolutely needed  Until we see how it occurs, it’s hard for me to   be much more sanguine that the capital markets or the credit markets will be returning to anything   like normal anytime soon   Let me make a fourth broad point about financial institutions  Because of these different   phases of capital raise, I think management credibility among financial institutions is at least as   suspect as it has ever been during this period  Even new management teams that have come in have   in some ways used up a lot of their credibility  It would be nice to believe that they have taken all   actions necessary to protect their franchises and their businesses, but most stakeholders are skeptical   that they’ve taken significant or sufficient action  At the end of the day, no matter where policy   comes out in terms of regulatory policy from the Fed and other bank regulators or accounting policy   from the SEC or FASB, it strikes me that those changes in policy are less determinative of how   things shake out  That is, management credibility is so in question that the cure is not likely to come   from accounting rules or regulators but from the markets’ believing that what management says is   what management believes and will act on it  As a result, I think that many of these financial   institutions are operating in a zero-defect world, which is posing risks to the real economy   Fifth, let me make a final point about financials  We’ve all talked a lot about the effect of   different curves for housing prices on the financial institutions themselves  I don’t mean to give   short shrift to any of that, but I would say that the level of uncertainty and associated risks of their   non-housing-related assets are now very much a focus  According to July 2008 data, of credit   currently being extended by banks, only about 20 percent is for residential real estate  Only about 9   percent is for consumer credit  So that leaves the balance in areas where these financial institutions   and their management teams have to be asking themselves whether the weaknesses that are   emerging in the real economy will place uncertainty over assets that have nothing to do with   August 5, 2008 82 of 145    housing  That’s a major downside risk for financial institutions and has not been much of a focus of   shareholder and stakeholder concerns   There are two open issues that will guide some of our thinking, at least with respect to these   credit markets  First, as we talked about a little last night with the presidents, are the embedded   losses so great at such a critical mass of institutions with management credibility so low that many   more than currently expected might be unable to survive?  This is a question that I’m not sure I   know the answer to  Second, despite the concerns about the effect of the credit markets on the   broader economy that I talked about, our monetary policy may not be terribly well suited to be   fixing those problems, and financial institutions may not be terribly sensitive to the extent we decide   that we should change the stance of policy     Taking all that into account, let me say a couple of words about growth and inflation  First,   on the economic growth front, given my views of what’s happening in the credit markets, it’s very   hard for me to believe that the economy will get back to potential anytime soon  There are   continued financial stresses that could last through year-end, and in there could be an upside   surprise  Still, all things considered, my base case has second-half growth still above staff estimates   owing in part to the productivity we’ve seen in recent months and the remarkable resiliency of this   economy  If we look beyond that horizon, though, toward the Greenbook forecast in 2009 and   beyond, I must say I don’t really see the inflection point to take us back to economic growth of   22 percent or whatever the Greenbook suggests  I think we’re going to be in this period of below-  trend growth for quite some time  My own view is that, when the Congress comes back after its   August recess, we will be in the middle of a big debate on “Son of Stimulus” and that the stimulus   probabilities have moved up quite materially  However, it is not at all obvious to me that it will do   much in terms of helping the real economy  Outside the United States, I share the view of Governor   August 5, 2008 83 of 145    Kohn, which is that I’d expect global GDP, particularly GDP among advanced foreign economies,   our major trading partners, to continue to disappoint, making the remarkable addition of net export   growth to our own GDP likely to dissipate   Turning finally to inflation, my view is that inflation risks are very real, and I believe that   these risks are higher than growth risks  I don’t take that much comfort from the move in   commodity prices since we last met  If that trend continues, then that would certainly be good   news; but I must say I don’t feel as though inflation risks have moved down noticeably since we last   had this discussion  The staff expects food prices to continue to be challenging; that is certainly my   view  The staff also expects core import prices to fall rather precipitously  I’m a little skeptical of   that view  I think it’s possible, but I don’t really see the catalyst for that given what we see about   changes in input prices overseas and given expectations of the dollar in foreign exchange markets    So with that, I think that the inflation risks are real, and I’ll save the balance of my remarks for the   next round  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be brief  I favor alternative B as written and   presented  I think it strikes the right balance by highlighting the risks that we see on the inflation   front, and I agree with Brian’s characterization that the capital markets’ reaction might be a little   surprise  It is hard for us in a time like this to predict exactly how the capital markets are going to   interpret this, but it wouldn’t surprise me to see some initial market reaction that is ostensibly   negative  That doesn’t trouble me too much  Ideally, the removal of policy accommodation, which   August 5, 2008 119 of 145    we talked about today, would be from a position of strength not weakness, but we may or may not   have the luxury of waiting for that opportunity  Finally, I think it’s important over this period that   we not be perceived to be lurching  I think alternative B strikes the right balance of explaining our   concerns and provides us reasonable optionality—that is, as you’ve described previously, state-  determined rather than time-determined  Thank you      Thank you, Mr Chairman  Let me do three things  I’ll talk first about a   modal forecast but probably give it short shrift; second, about financial market conditions; and third,   about policy  Working under the assumption that our modal forecast doesn’t look quaint a week   from now, if the world were somehow to hew to a reasonably moderate view of how financial   market conditions work going forward, personally I’d be a bit more optimistic than the Greenbook   for the second half of ’08  I think that the net export growth is likely to prove stickier than   embedded in that forecast in spite of a stronger dollar and weaker global demand  But as we get to   September 16, 2008 59 of 108    2009 and 2010, I would actually be less rosy than the Greenbook  I don’t see real catalysts for the   economy to normalize and to approach trendlike growth  Key uncertainties around financial   markets, labor markets, and housing and, I think, broader macroeconomic uncertainties that I’ve   discussed before in terms of trade policy, tax policy, and regulatory policy, would make the creep-  back to potential slower than embedded in those forecasts   On the inflation front, I continue to be encouraged by the strength in the exchange value of   the dollar and the work that is doing for us on import price inflation  I’m encouraged by the move   down across a breadth of commodities—not just energy, metals, and food but really across the   entire basket—but I’m still not ready to relinquish my concerns on the inflation front   Let me turn now to financial market conditions  I have talked before about the financial   architecture  I guess what we can say today with more confidence than I’ve been able to say before   is that the dismemberment of the existing financial architecture has accelerated in the last few days   and weeks, and we will very quickly look at business models, and industry will find new business   models, we hope, to provide credit to the real economy  Financial markets have been testing   financial institutions with weaker capital structures, uncertain management teams, and unsustainable   business models  I think the question before us today that’s hard to judge is whether financial   markets are now to the point at which they are acting indiscriminately, testing all financial   institutions regardless of capital structure or business model  I’d say that the evidence of the past   twenty-four or forty-eight hours is still unclear  I think we’ll have a greater clarity several days   from now about whether markets are able to make the distinguishing judgments that we would   count on   Look at the CDS spreads for the two remaining independent broker-dealers, Goldman Sachs   and Morgan Stanley, which Bill referenced  Goldman Sachs’s CDS moved up another 190 or so   September 16, 2008 60 of 108    this morning  They are up 340 in the last two days  Morgan Stanley’s are up 690  I wouldn’t want   to say whether those numbers are right or wrong  It may be that the business model is a failing   one—that is, wholesale funding is no longer practicable in the world that we’re now in  If the   problems were confined to that part of the financial services industry, it would be tough and it   would be ugly and, if you were a resident of New York, particularly painful  But I don’t think it   would rise to the level that would force us to recalibrate monetary policy  But if, in fact, those   losses end up being endemic to all financial institutions, even those with strong deposit bases and   higher capital ratios, then we certainly would have to take that into consideration  The few that are   trying to swim against this tide are flailing; and without extraordinary actions either by a consortium   of their competitors or by the official sector, they’re likely to continue to fail  I think our efforts to   date to protect the broader financial markets and the economy from knock-on effects in particular   financial services sectors do seem to be helping to cushion the blow  But the prospect of some   meaningful discontinuity and of some systemic risk remains real, and it’s hard for me to judge today   whether that prospect is as low as we might have thought even some weeks ago   Ultimately, the question for the real economy is whether the emergence of this new financial   architecture can come quickly enough to get credit markets to normalize  Is the suddenness of   events in the last week going to accelerate the move toward a new financial architecture?  Will the   forces of creative destruction make that faster but ultimately bring credit back to these markets   sooner?  Are these forces so strong and overwhelming that all financial institutions will be   hunkering down, clinging to an architecture that no longer works?  That’s a question to which I   don’t know the answer   A couple of more points on markets  I think the work that was done over the past few days   on Lehman Brothers should make us feel good in one respect  Market functioning seems to be   September 16, 2008 61 of 108    working okay—by which I mean that the plumbing around their role in the tri-party repo business,   due in part to the Fed’s actions, seems to be working  It’s ugly  The backroom offices of these   places are going crazy  There’s a lot of manual work being done  So they wouldn’t give it high   marks  But it looks as though positions are being sorted out in a tough workmanlike way, and so   that’s encouraging   Other than the CDS moves and the equity moves on the other broker-dealers, Goldman   Sachs and Morgan Stanley, I don’t think that that is the real specter that’s casting some question   over broader financial institutions  I think the Lehman situation, no matter what judgment we made   this past weekend about whether or not to provide official-sector money, is not what is driving   markets broadly outside of the investment banks  What’s driving the broader uncertainty are   questions about institutions like AIG that were rated AAA, that were so strong that counterparties   didn’t need collateral, and that were a certain bet to be a guarantor around stable value funds and all   sorts of other products  If in a matter of weeks that AAA rating and that security could turn out to   be worthless, then that would force institutions to evaluate two things  First, narrowly, how much   AIG exposure do I have?  Second, more broadly, if that’s AIG, what about the rest of the insurance   companies?  What about the rest of the financial institutions, which aren’t investment banks but are   really representing the foundations of the US financial system?  So it is both those direct and   indirect aspects that we have to try to understand as best we can  My own view is that the AIG   question would be more financial devastation if these institutions turn out to be meaningfully   insolvent but actually, in some ways, less market dislocation among intermediaries  That is,   Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, and Bear Stearns are touching and are in the middle of many more   flows of data, and there are real losses being felt  But if an AAA company like AIG were really   fundamentally insolvent, the direct losses to a range of institutions, particularly those that are not   September 16, 2008 62 of 108    just wholesale institutions but are retail institutions, could be very significant  I don’t think we   know the answer yet to the question of whether AIG speaks to a broader loss of confidence that   could affect the foundations of the US financial system   Let me turn finally to policy, Mr Chairman  I support alternative B and, based on some of   the discussion from Presidents Lockhart and Stern, I’d make some simple suggestions that may   strike a balance that acknowledges the concerns we have about financial markets but doesn’t put us   in the position where we are inclined to lurch in one direction, which as some people suggested   could create more uncertainty than we intend  My suggestion, Mr Chairman, would be to take the   first sentence from alternative A, paragraph 2—“strains in financial markets have increased   significantly and labor markets have weakened further”—and make that the first sentence of   alternative B  Then strike the second sentence of alternative B, because I think we’ve largely   covered that  That order gives proper attention, it strikes me, to the financial market developments    Finally, in the assessment of risk, Mr Chairman, if you look at the last sentence, I would suggest   modifying that ever so slightly by inserting the word “closely” and making one other modification    So that last sentence would read, “The Committee will continue to monitor economic and financial   developments closely and will act as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price   stability”  Also, if you think it’s acceptable, rather than saying “financial developments” maybe   there we would say, “The Committee will continue to monitor economic and financial market   developments closely”  Those would be my suggestions to try to strike that balance—that we are   keenly focused on what’s going on, but until we have a better view of its implications, we are not   going to act  Thank you, Mr Chairman     My sense is—and this is certainly open for discussion—that we want the   focus to be that we are really watching market developments closely  We are not trying to   September 16, 2008 78 of 108    monitor the broader economy, which we might not be able to measure too much  I will admit   that we have “economic and financial markets,” with “closely” modifying both of them, but the   idea was to put the focus on the market side to a slightly greater extent than we normally do     On “closely”?     Let me ask Brian and Bill  Brian, without “closely,” how do you think   the markets will react to that?     I think the sentiment we are trying to suggest is watchful waiting  We are   not indifferent, we are not clueless, we are paying attention, but we are not predisposed  Hence,   Governor Kohn’s suggestion     Keenly?  Carefully?     Well, we have done things like “in a timely manner” and other kinds of   phraseology       Mr Chairman, I would support “carefully”     Yes, sir      Thank you, Mr Chairman  Let me make three brief points  First, on   financial markets, I think Bill described them accurately as a mess  I guess to amplify that comment   I’d say that what appears now in financial markets is that the thesis we’ve been talking about—that   this is significantly about housing—seems to some extent overcome by events  I think the best way   to view financial markets is to say that what’s fundamentally going on is a reassessment of the value   of every asset everywhere in the world, and what might have been triggered by housing has   certainly gone beyond that  That forces us and market participants alike to think about the mix of   policy responses, not principally or not just from the Federal Reserve   October 7, 2008 26 of 30    Second, on the economy, I suspect that it will be increasingly hard to find decouplers, and I   suspect that the real economic problems in Europe and among the advanced foreign economies are   likely to be more real, deeper, and harder for them and their economies to respond to than ours  So   as Nathan suggests, that makes the policy decisions they have over the coming months and our   ability to count on a global recovery even more suspect   Third, on the policy front, in thinking about this as a global, synchronized rate cut it strikes   me that the first two words of that phrase are far more important than the last two and that the focus   on global, synchronized action is an important symbol to markets not just here but abroad—that the   world’s central banks and policy action are very focused and that all of us will do whatever it takes   to try to make sure that the real economy and financial markets respond more positively  So I take   your judgment, Mr Chairman, that this is the right time—to take advantage of the action of a host   of central banks; and I’ll join the realistic expectations crowd in thinking that we shouldn’t oversell   what’s the likely policy response    In terms of the statement itself, I would be comfortable with the statement as written but   would have a preference to dropping “materially” as you suggest  Thank you      Mr Chairman, I support the proposal on the floor  I think the safeguards are   meaningful and real and should help  I think the bar for further consideration, as Nathan described,   should be high, but we shouldn’t overstate what that bar is, given how circumstances can change   quickly  I wouldn’t want to have to change that rule in the middle of the game, but I think the high-  bar language works  On the question of delegating to the subcommittee, I think in the interest of   speed it would be appropriate; but given the sense around the table, certainly making sure that the   folks around the table were at the very least briefed as to the thought process might be a prudent   path forward     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The first sentence of the Greenbook said that   “recent economic and financial news has been dismal”; and the last sentence on page 1 of the   Bluebook said that “markets generally remain extremely illiquid and volatile”  I can’t do better than   that, but I can certainly do worse; so let me give that a try  [Laughter]   Market prices and official and corporate data confirm an additional leg down in mid-  September, which has been much discussed  I think it is going to become increasingly clear that   October, particularly the first 20 days of the month, was materially worse  So if we fell off the cliff   in the middle of September, I think that once the data come out and find their way into the   marketplace in October, the Greenbook forecast might look a bit more positive than the facts on the   ground would suggest  As a result, my own forecast is less optimistic than the Greenbook, but there   is plenty of uncertainty, as I think Dave Stockton talked about yesterday   Let me make a few comments about financial markets before turning to the broader   economy  I expect a prolonged period of significantly strained credit markets, and that strain is   likely to be exacerbated between now and year-end and I suspect even well into 2009  The credit   intermediation process that we’ve talked about is fundamentally broken  I talked six months ago   about the financial architecture that was fundamentally being changed  I think that has all happened   faster than I could have anticipated  Confidence, not just in counterparties but in basic rules of   doing business across financial markets, has been lost, and my own sense is that loss of confidence   is not easily fixed, even by well-intended government programs  We should all be quite patient in   October 28–29, 2008 101 of 206    terms of seeing the benefits of the rather dramatic actions taken by the official sector, both here in   the United States and overseas  Corporate bond rates and other risk spreads may well fall from their   recent peaks, as suggested in the Greenbook, but spreads across asset classes are likely to stay far   wider than historical norms throughout the forecast period  I think these new spread relationships   are uncertain  So what we thought would be sort of normal spreads of LIBOR and normal spreads   of corporate bonds, all have to be reassessed not just by us but also by market participants  Even if   credit is now made more available to businesses through some of these new Treasury and other   programs, I suspect the all-in cost of capital is likely to materially impede business investment,   particularly given expectations by businesses for a weaker economy in the upcoming period  As   Vice Chairman Geithner suggested, monetary policy might be able to do a bit about this, but it is not   going to be able to change it very much   Let me turn to three points on the economy before closing  First, in the near term, given my   sense of how October is tracking, it’s likely to be extraordinarily weak  I expect weaker fourth-  quarter consumption than the Greenbook, weaker labor markets going into 2009, and a materially   weaker fourth-quarter GDP print  Some labor surveys—including some of my own preferred   measures, like the JOLTS—seem to be holding up; but I’m not sure that that’s going to hold for   another couple of months  So I’d expect the labor markets to trend more materially in the direction   that I’ve discussed   Well, what about beyond the near term?  What about 2009 and beyond?  It strikes me that   the catalysts for marked improvement are lacking  When I think about fiscal policy, regulatory   policy, tax policy, and trade policy, which I talked about previously, it’s not obvious to me that any   of those are going to provide some kind of catalyst for a marked change in the contour of the   economy  On the fiscal front, I assume that the fiscal stimulus is likely to be larger, maybe even   October 28–29, 2008 102 of 206    materially larger, than in the Greenbook alternative simulation, but my own conclusions are similar   to the Greenbook’s, which is that I’m not sure it’s going to be terribly effective  I’m not sure it’s   going to be constructed in that way, and I’m not sure it will do nearly as much as it will inevitably   be advertised to do  A more disturbing trend probably even than the efficacy of a fiscal package—  which in my own view is absolutely necessary, but again I query whether it’s going to be structured   in a way to do what it needs to do—is that potential output in the forecast period is likely to fall    Trend growth rates are coming down, and I expect productivity to fall perhaps even more than in the   Greenbook projection  The vaunted resilience of the US economy, which I’ve talked about for a   long time, is certainly going to be tested during this period  Business investment, it strikes me, will   be a useful gauge as we get into the first quarter of 2009 to see how tough an economic period we   have in front of us, and I worry about the decisions that business people will be making  Now, of   course, against all of this, markets could snap back, as we saw a little yesterday—2009 could look   better  We have to remain open minded about the possibility that the economy will continue, as it   has over the past ten or fifteen years, to outperform model-based expectations   Let me turn to foreign growth  These decouplers, which were so prominent for so long, are   somehow hard to find these days  Foreign growth strikes me as likely to fall faster and stay lower   than in the Greenbook projection  The road back is not likely to begin as early as the first quarter of   2009 for our major trading partners  The “more financial fallout” alternative simulation strikes me   as significantly more likely for foreign growth  In light of a growth trajectory that is better here in   the United States than outside the United States, at least relative to current market expectations, I’d   expect the foreign exchange value of the dollar on balance to strengthen against a basket of foreign   currencies   October 28–29, 2008 103 of 206    So let me turn finally to inflation  The trend on import prices, the broad measures of   commodity prices, and the expected dollar strength all suggest that inflation problems are abating   markedly  I think an open question, which isn’t likely to be dispositive but is likely to be   interesting, is how sticky prices are, particularly from the consumer product companies during this   period—how long the various surcharges and increases in prices we’ve seen can stay high and the   companies attempt to keep profit margins  My guess is that they can make profit margins look   decent for another quarter or two; but beyond that, prices across a broad set of products and services   are likely to retrace some of the gains in recent periods  I’ll save the balance of my remarks for the   next round  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Let me begin by agreeing with Don Kohn on   two things  This is the toughest economic period I can remember in his lifetime, [laughter] and I   October 28–29, 2008 140 of 206    support alternative A  I think the inflation trends and the trends in the global economy give us   flexibility, which six months or so ago I did not think we would have  I think that gives us some   degree of freedom that, given all of the negative tone, including my own, around the table, gives us   at least some source of comfort   Next I would say that I agree with the consensus around the table, which is that these   problems are not principally about monetary policy  But I also think that monetary policy isn’t   irrelevant to this, and all agencies of governments around the world are making tough decisions, and   the marginal benefits of further monetary policy changes strike me as not high but not irrelevant  I   think President Plosser talked a bit about the alternative policy paths in the Greenbook that range   from keeping the fed funds rate constant where it is to taking it to zero percent and the surprisingly   small differences in output, employment, and core inflation there  In some ways, in the discussion   that we’re having about 25 or 50 or moving or not, it would not be fair for any of us to overstate the   importance in terms of directly affecting the economy in the short term     That goes to my final point, which is that the most valuable asset that we have isn’t what at   the end of this meeting might be 100 basis points left of monetary policy  Frankly, it is the   credibility of the institution and the credibility of the FOMC  If I compare our credibility now to   virtually any other organization in the United States or maybe even globally, I think our credibility   is holding up quite well, particularly relative to the degree of difficulty we have in front of us,   relative to the trauma in financial markets and the weaknesses in the economy  So it is that asset,   that credibility, that we need to continue to protect more than incremental basis point moves on the   fed funds rate  I think that credibility will be tested over this period as it will for our counterparts    We don’t want to find ourselves in a corner come December or come a couple of brutal days in the   markets where we feel compelled to continue to act and make 50 basis point moves unless and until   October 28–29, 2008 141 of 206    we know where we want to end up on this  So I’m sympathetic to that point of view  We need to   tell the story before the story is told for us of what our lower bound is, why it’s there, and what our   diagnosis of the economy is  I think that the Chairman and the rest of us will have ample   opportunity to do that between now and December and that it is quite important to make sure we   come out of this as strong as we have been through this period so far  Thank you, Mr Chairman      Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’m a visual thinker  [Laughter]  So I’ll begin   where Governor Fisher ended his remarks  To thank Brian, David, and Nathan for two reasons    First, obviously I thought you did a great job, and second, I didn’t want to be the first jerk around   this table not to acknowledge you  So I felt some burden now to be 15 for 15 and thank you for the   work   December 15–16, 2008 87 of 284    Let me make three background points and then try to answer some of the questions that   Brian asked of us  First, I think we have two risks in the zero lower bound discussion  One is   overstating the importance of our judgments today in helping the economy get back to potential    The second risk is understating the importance of prospective Fed actions given our frustration that   our policy accommodation to this point has only partially offset the deterioration and credit   weakness in the real economy  The first trick is getting that balance right, recognizing that our   actions are important but probably not determinative, at least solely determinative of the outcomes,   given what markets will end up doing with the messages we send and given the need for fiscal and   other policies  The second trick is that, notwithstanding our announcements or what we take to be   our target, the effective rate is likely to be very close to zero for quite some time  So maybe more   precisely in this context, the zero lower bound problem could be understood to mean that the   expected protracted period of weakness will come because monetary policy is unable to provide   enough stimulus to generate a robust recovery  That is true as far as it goes, but we shouldn’t assign   more import to this problem than it deserves  That is, the protracted period of weakness is not   simply or largely about monetary stimulus  It’s about a broken financial architecture of which the   official sector response, including monetary policy, is only one piece  At the same time, monetary   policy can’t be as efficacious as desired and is constrained by these zero lower bound problems    Thus, we don’t have a free pass to stand idle  Incremental interest rate policy may be of limited   value, but it’s still relevant in stimulating demand   Second point—the judgments today are made harder by the degree of market discontinuity   and market dysfunction  I take very seriously the risk that reducing the fed funds rate to zero could   further degrade the functioning of financial markets and do so at a very inauspicious moment    Getting that market functioning is our way out of this mess, and though we would in normal   December 15–16, 2008 88 of 284    markets expect money market mutual funds and regulated and unregulated financial institutions to   adjust, there’s a lot about their behavior in the past six months that hasn’t followed normal custom    I worry at this time, when we’re trying to get markets to respond, about putting an incremental   burden on their reaction function  The current period is distinguished from 2003 and other   antecedents by the broader systemic fears about our system of credit intermediation, and I agree   strongly with the idea advanced in the materials that were presented last week that the level of the   Treasury repo rate is more critical to Treasury market functioning and the functioning of other   markets than the target rate or the effective fed funds rate  The deterioration in repo market   liquidity that Bill and others spoke about correlates strongly with lots of other bad things—fails in   Treasury markets, the inability to predict market clearing prices, and the inability to hedge other   assets  During this period, in which we have seen this unfortunate behavior, everything else seems   to have gone wrong as well, so it is hard to draw any causation here  But I do worry about those   market effects   As a third point, on balance I’m inclined to believe that the macroeconomic benefits of   pushing the envelope to get to zero may be outweighed, particularly now, by additional financial   market problems  In more normal circumstances, disruptions in these markets could be addressed   quickly by changes in market practices  But there is reason to worry this time how quickly they   could come   Let me turn now to some of the questions that Brian raised  First, on the question of   whether we should move or keep our powder dry, I think it’s clear that, once we decide and we   know where we want to go, we should move as swiftly as possible to get there  But I think the key   word there is “readiness”  So when we want to make this final move, we need to be ready in three   respects  First, the Board and the FOMC have to be ready in terms of what our consensus is    December 15–16, 2008 89 of 284    Second, the markets must really understand why we are making this change in regime—they need   to comprehend fully what is driving our policies  Third, we have to have an operational ability to   perform and execute, and that’s really a question for Bill and his colleagues as we continue to   expand our facilities   The second question was about the cost of reducing the fed funds rate target to zero  I   would put it simply that the zero lower bound in my opinion isn’t zero, but it is lower than 1   percent  I’m not sure if it’s 25 or 50, but I would be probably cautious about pushing beyond the   point of our comfort   Third, in terms of the benefits of communications, we are judged by our actions far more   than our words, and I think the markets have gathered a view of what our reaction function is  So   when we talk about the need for our communication language to emphasize the conditionality of it,   I think that’s quite consistent with how we’ve talked previously about our forecast  Our judgments   on policy are dictated by our forecasts  As our forecasts change, so too might our decisions  So I   think I’d put our communications in that regard   In terms of introducing or reintroducing an inflation target at this point, I’m not sure that it   would, at least in the short and medium term, drive the kind of market reaction that we would   expect  I think markets would be wondering, after long discussions over the previous eighteen   months about subcommittees and communication policies and inflation targets  Why now?  Is it   that we’re actually now more concerned about inflation expectations and the medium-term view of   what’s consistent with price stability than we were during much of that period in which we were   talking about inflation that was higher than our expected range?  I’m not sure I have been able to   internalize and conclude why that would be appropriate at this very moment to introduce into our   statements   December 15–16, 2008 90 of 284    In terms of nonstandard policy tools and the purchase of large amounts of agencies and   Treasuries, I think that the Chairman’s point about the composition of the asset side of our balance   sheet is key  In a different regime, I would have been uncomfortable about agencies  But my view   is that they are wards of the state at this time  The US government has said so  To the extent that   we can provide our fire power to both the Treasury market and the agency market, it is probably   worthwhile to do both  We probably have an opportunity to test the importance of some of these   nonstandard policy tools in executing the timing and process and making public our announcement   to this point of providing up to $600 billion in aid to this market  I would prefer to avoid setting a   ceiling on conventional rates—that’s not the role of the Fed  Better to leave that announcement to   others  I think it is also critically important with respect to agencies that we make sure we   understand the posture and policies of the new Administration  If they think that the agencies are   effectively going to be treated like wards of the state, I’d feel more comfortable   In terms of the expansion of credit backstop facilities, my first concern would be that I’d   defer to Bill and his colleagues about operational bandwidth  Second, I think we probably have an   opportunity—and you do, Mr Chairman, in your speech early next year—in announcing what our   criteria are and what our framework is for expanding our credit backstop facilities  Third, I’d say   that we do need to address, probably in that same period, our exit strategy and clean up any edge   problems that might have developed during this period  The CMBS market is in lousy shape  I   think that’s not largely because of what we’ve done, but there is a gravitational pull on the bit of   liquidity that is out there to the residential market and away from the CMBS market  There’s   probably an opportunity for us to try to clarify that in the context of the TALF program   Finally, in terms of other nonstandard tools that would be particularly useful, again, I think it   would be important to state publicly in all of our discussions the need for the fiscal authorities to be   December 15–16, 2008 91 of 284    taking first losses and ensuring that the new Administration, the new Treasury, is prepared to   support the Fed in that so that they’re in the credit-loss business and we are really just using our   facilities and knowledge to put that into place  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Several quick points  First, the latest leg of   deterioration, which began in mid-September, is showing few signs of abating, as Governor   Kohn suggested  I think the November retail sales data look like a head fake  Revisions to   December 15–16, 2008 149 of 284    September and October, as the Greenbook suggested, make us think that November was   probably worse and December worse still  So in some ways I think our job is difficult because   the weakness seems to be accelerating   Globally, the deterioration is found everywhere  The data are playing catch-up  I am less   optimistic that foreign activity will perform as well as the Greenbook suggests and that foreign   activity will respond in 2010 because of lags in policy response and less flexibility in their labor   markets, their product markets, and their political markets  The depth and the degree of the fall   in data and policymakers’ expectations overseas, particularly in Asia, are remarkable, shocking   even, and I think we are likely to see policy responses there that are hard to judge but are likely   to be changing pretty quickly   In terms of US households, real household net worth has collapsed about 15 percent or   so through the end of the third quarter—more than in 2001 and more than in 1974  Ongoing   declines in financial markets and house prices are likely to depress wealth further in the fourth   quarter and beyond  So-called savings from lower energy prices look as though they pale in   comparison to what else is happening to US household balance sheets  As we have discussed   before, every asset everywhere in the world is being revalued, and households are feeling it   In terms of financial markets, I will underscore what Dan suggested and what Bill   suggested yesterday—the significant overall deterioration in conditions  We all have a tendency   at this point in the year to say, “Well, there are a lot of year-end effects, and we are not going to   really know until we get through this period”  We have had baby versions of year-end effects in   the quarter-end effects in almost every meeting that we have had, and I have been a little   dismissive of those  I would say that there does appear to be more year-end stuff going on in   these markets than there has been since this period of weakness began     December 15–16, 2008 150 of 284    If you think about the two former investment banks that have balance sheets and year-  ends that close at the end of November, this is the last quarter in which they will have that  They   have had more demands and more interest in, in effect, renting out their balance sheet as their   customers’ balance sheets end in December than they ever have had  The prices that are being   paid for them to rent their balance sheets—to take exposures off the balance sheets of their   clients—suggest that maybe, just maybe, the year-end effects are more significant this time than   they were in the previous six or seven quarters  It doesn’t give me a ton of optimism, but in   January, market functioning could look a little better, and I think that would be the best news we   have seen for a while  You have heard me say before that, until we see market functioning   improving and until we see these markets clearing, it is unrealistic to expect the real economy to   turn  I still think that is true   Turning to two final items, inflation and the fiscal package—on the inflation front,   although there are risks in this environment for prices to fall below those consistent with price   stability, I still believe that these risks are not likely to materialize in the medium term  So I take   stock of, but ultimately discount, the Greenbook’s deflation alternative simulation  On the fiscal   front, more, bigger, faster is what is going to happen inevitably to what I would describe as the   first fiscal package of 2009  The trillion dollar number over two years, which is now being   bandied about, is larger than the Greenbook forecast and looks almost assured, with a greater   share going to the states in my view than in the Greenbook forecast, more toward public   infrastructure, perhaps less toward tax cuts on a relative basis than in the Greenbook, but bigger    I would be surprised if that initial package isn’t supplemented through larger annual   appropriations and another stimulus package, if not by the end of 2009 then by 2010  As a   result, my own sense would be that the 2010 deficit is likely to be significantly larger than the   December 15–16, 2008 151 of 284    Greenbook forecast  Now, knowing the precise contours of this fiscal package is tough  I would   say the only good news is that the duration of the slowdown is likely to suggest that the fiscal   package may end up being somewhat more permanent in its incentives and somewhat more   permanent in its effects; and I suspect, because of that, it is likely to provide some good news to   the economy  But I wouldn’t expect that to happen in the next twelve or eighteen months, other   than perhaps a bit of benefit on the arithmetic  In terms of changing the overall contour, pace,   and strength of the resilient economy, I would say that is still quite a way off  Thank you, Mr   Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  As others have said, the choice among these   alternatives, particularly A, B, and C, is not really a choice about the effective rate  It’s a choice   about our clarity, our conviction, and maybe most important, our readiness in announcing a new   regime  As I described yesterday, I think the zero lower bound is not zero, and so there are risks   particularly in these markets of going there or threatening to go there  So the balance of my   suggestions and edits come from the zero phobia  [Laughter]   First let me talk about C briefly  Alternative C is a sort of way station  It is our last chance   to describe the old regime and to pivot to a new regime, whether the new targeted rate was 25 or 50   basis points  But seeing that there doesn’t seem to be much interest in that, I won’t try to reconcile   the music and lyrics of C, which announces a target and then says we’re going to miss it; but I had a   couple of suggestions to try to bring that together  So let me confine the balance of my remarks to   the choice between A and B   I think in alternative A we are all-in  It makes the new regime explicit  It is likely to be   somewhat of a surprise to markets and puts a large burden on all of us—particularly you, Mr   Chairman—not only in the next few hours but really for the next days and weeks in describing with   great rigor what the new regime is  I think we’re up to that, but it is certainly a tall task at a time of   great uncertainty in markets  The way I would try to make that task a little easier is through various   December 15–16, 2008 199 of 284    channels—suggesting that we are in some ways revealing the new target in paragraph 5 by   suggesting that the implied effective target is 25 basis points, given what our change is on the   discount rate and the interest rate on reserves  So that, I think, has a way of making the transition to   the new regime less massive than it might be and reinforces my zero phobia point  I think that’s one   way in which the bold, new regime with a lot of explanation in the next few weeks can at least be   not as scary to the markets in the next couple of days    What about alternative B?  If we were to go in that direction, I’d make one modest   suggestion  In the first paragraph, I would insert the word “between”—so “the Federal Open   Market Committee decided today to establish a target range for the federal funds rate between zero   and ¼ percent”—to suggest that you’re not going to be at that endpoint  Now, I’ll admit that’s not a   massive change, but it makes me feel a bit better about my phobia and about how markets, banks,   and others might react knowing that that is a point you do not want to cross  So a suggestion there   Now, on your open question, setting a range in terms of the optimal level of inflation or not,   I’m not crazy about a range  But if we have a range, I think it is scary, lurchy, to include it today,   and so I wouldn’t do it  Conditionality, I think, is fine  I don’t feel strongly about our considering   Treasury securities  I do like Governor Kohn’s suggestion about deleting “to continue” because   bold new regimes aren’t continuations of what we’ve done  They’re bold and new  So I think that’s   an important change by Governor Kohn  Thank you     I apologize for the bad English that I offered before, but an alternative to the   first sentence that you read that would, I think, be English to Jeff’s fair point—it would be to delete   the word “target”  So it says, “To establish a range for the federal funds rate between zero and   ¼ percent”  So those are your two options     Withdrawn      A couple of things First, in the Citi case, as an example, the markets are   putting a lot of pressure on them to slim down and sell off assets  I think that, as quickly as they   can rightly restore their brand and their business, they and their shareholders will have every        January 16, 2009 13 of 69  incentive to do so I think that is already happening  Under the terms of the CPP, negotiated   chiefly by the Treasury, the company has the option to get rid of the government ownership at   different periods I think it will be a sign of strength when they are able to do so   In addition, there is an incentive—and Scott can correct me on the terms—that, if they   were to pay back the government by year-end ’09, then the options, the warrants in effect, that   the government would get would be half what they otherwise would get  So generally under the   CPP you will see the strongest of this group looking to distinguish themselves for being stronger,   by November/December of this year—to try to say that they are different, that the options and   warrants they have given the government will now be reduced because of the redemption feature    But in square answer to your question, there isn’t some compulsion that somehow the   government needs to be paid back first among the order of preferences for their liquidation     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I will keep my comments short mostly because I   do not think my views have changed materially since we last took up this discussion  On the merits,   I remain skeptical of the benefits of establishing an explicit inflation objective, and in terms of   timing, I think the timing is really quite poor at this moment  Part of the reason for the skepticism is   that I do not believe an inflation target would have or should have changed our conduct of policy   during this period or most other periods that I could envision  In substance, I think that establishing   the objective is of far less consequence than the conduct of policy and the actions of this body  Our   credibility and commitment come from those actions—come from our reaction function to changing   circumstances—far more than from what we say, and I think that is particularly true in times like   this I am convinced that the benefits of an inflation objective are small relative to the prudent steps   that we have taken in terms of our longer-run projections—along the lines that President Yellen   mentioned—in keeping expectations well anchored  I am far less certain, however, that the costs of   establishing an objective are small, particularly in a period like this   President Evans talked about this discussion being orthogonal to the financial situation  I   think that is quite euphemistic  Among the questions the world and the markets have about the   FOMC, this is not on the top of the list or maybe even on the first page of questions they have about   us at this moment The very nature, role, and responsibilities of the Fed are central and are being   asked about in all corners, both in the Congress and in markets, and I think that we should not   burden those discussions by adding the discussion of an inflation objective to get some modest   benefits thereof in this environment  Thank you, Mr Chairman      Thank you, Mr Chairman  Let me begin with financial markets before   turning to the economy  On financial markets, I will give a few points that I have described in   my notes as “tenuous improvements in market functioning,” but I really think that I will describe   them as feigning optimism  So let me feign optimism with three points on financial markets           January 27–28, 2009 152 of 267  First, bridge financings We saw earlier this week a very large bridge financing to fund   an acquisition I would say that bridge financing by its very terms probably could not have come   together 30 or 45 days ago There are a couple of other very large deals being contemplated that   require bridge financing, and I would say this bridge looks different from bridges of the last   cycle I would not call it a new equilibrium, but I would say that neither the acquirers nor the   lenders/underwriters would have been prepared to agree to terms like this  This is a bridge that is   not very good It is a bridge that gets expensive in a hurry  It is a bridge that could give way    But buyer, seller, and underwriter came to terms here; and whether or not this is a new   equilibrium in funding transactions with some assurance that there will be cash for a period of   time if the acquirer does not lose its rating, this and other factors suggest that at least there is a   new negotiation happening So I would say that it is a positive sign   Second, trading businesses The firms that are left and that still have meaningful trading   businesses had fantastic Januaries  Why did they have such good Januaries?  There is just not a   lot of competition left  Bid-asked spreads are wide  A lot of volatility is now presumed to be   built into the models and into traders’ behavior  I would say that, if you are still in the trading   business and you are looking for sources of profit and good news to get you through this cycle,   some are there  The capital intensity of these trading businesses is lower than it was before  The   necessity for firms to commit capital to be profitable in trading is lower  So I would say, again,   that this is some, tenuous, improvement and may be a new equilibrium there, which is good news   for some of the survivors that are in trading   Third, and I think probably the most essential point, is about the prospects for large,   internationally active financial institutions to raise capital  There is a good chance that in the   next week there will be a large non-US internationally active financial institution that tests the        January 27–28, 2009 153 of 267  capital markets for a very large capital raise  It is likely to be a rights offering  It is likely to be   at a very significant discount to its current share price, but I would guess that it gets done  If it   gets done, that says that there still is private capital at some price  Maybe it is a price that   existing shareholders don’t like Maybe it is a price that companies don’t want  But if those   private markets are open for the relatively strong outside the United States, I would say that is   encouraging and we need it The last 30 capital raises by financial institutions aren’t just losers    They are big losers, and it is hard for investors and others to be opportunistic when they see that   track record  So I think the success or failure of these financial institutions might well be tested   in the next week—when we see a pretty good institution give it a real shot  So that’s my   optimistic pitch     Now words of caution As Trish said yesterday, I think that we are back at maybe the   most precarious state in financial markets that we have been at, at least in a regularly scheduled   FOMC meeting, and I think that this is going to be an awfully consequential few weeks  It is   true that risk aversion has been reduced, but only a bit  We have seen a bit of an unwind in the   flight to quality and a bit of an unwind in the flight to the most liquid securities, but, boy, I   would be hesitant to overstate the improvement here  Even if we look at high-yield markets and   we note that they are off their peaks, there are still expectations of defaults that are near   Depression levels I want to take comfort in some of these data, but I think it is probably just a   bit of a bump from the darkest, scariest days that we had in the prior period   Second, I would note that share prices of large financial institutions broadly and regional   financial institutions have all gotten crushed in 2009 so far, and that has raised real questions   about the solvency and durability of their franchises as publicly held entities  So the question   remains  How have credit markets seemed to improve along the lines that Trish and Bill have           January 27–28, 2009 154 of 267  mentioned, while we have had this huge markdown in the valuation of these companies?  Again,   as Trish noted yesterday, I think the answer is us, the Fed  Sure, we have seen some   improvements in markets that we haven’t been directly involved in, like A2/P2  But the Fed’s   facilities have been primary in support and have been a partial bulwark against broader financial   institution weakness So in some ways I use that to reconcile the discrepancy between   improvements in market functioning, at least in the very short term, and the miserable news that   we have had on broad financial institutions   Third, a note of caution and concern There are still a lot of 50-cent dollars out there, and   no one seems to want to buy them  That these arbitrage opportunities are still available in   markets that don’t require great sophistication and that people are not taking them up should tell   us that something is very, very wrong  Only those buyers who have longer-term horizons, risk   neutrality, and balance sheet capacity can participate in these markets, and those are criteria that   are not found among most folks that could partake  So these 50-cent dollars might be 60-cent   dollars, but they are still out there, and that should be telling us that things are in pretty tough   shape   Finally, and maybe of most concern about the state of financial markets, is the large and   increasing number of financial institutions, including many that are most systemically important,   that are perceived by markets to be effectively insolvent or nearly so  Single-digit share prices   for a large class of financial institutions do not strike me as a new equilibrium  And to avoid the   theological argument that we had a bit of yesterday on whether this is an equilibrium or   disequilibrium, I will tell you that I do not think it is going to stick around for long  If you think   about these financial institutions that are trading at $3, $5, or $7, I am not sure I understand how   they can continue to get through the next 12 months in that state  I do not know how they can           January 27–28, 2009 155 of 267  run their businesses, how they can incentivize their employees, or how governance will hold with   the specter of continued losses and possible nationalization  My sense is that this is not a   sustainable equilibrium, and I fear which way it breaks  I think the specter of nationalization   may delay public market recapitalization of many of these firms, though I expect that the new   Administration will do all it can to provide clarity  As the real economy continues to deteriorate,   I suspect that it will take a couple of shots at this to “get it right”  And this single-digit share   price might well continue to limit the efficient provision of credit to the real economy and   continue to hinder financial flows  So I am skeptical in a tumultuous world that these single-  digit share prices are sustainable for financial institutions, and, again, the way in which they are   likely to break is pretty disturbing   So what does all of this mean for the real economy?  Others said it more extensively than   I will, but the economy is in terrible shape  Activity is falling fast with little indication of   stabilization even at new lower levels  As I think Dan described yesterday, the nature of this   turmoil, which I define more as a breakdown of the global financial architecture than some   housing-led recession, is likely to have a recovery period that is slower, bumpier, and tougher   than most recent recessions would suggest  As a result of all that, I am more negative on GDP   and employment prospects than the Greenbook forecast is, in both the near term and the medium   term   Mr Chairman, with respect to your question about the second half, I think we should see,   arithmetically and because of the inventory issue, a slowdown in weakness, but it does not look   to me anything like a real recovery  I am also skeptical of near-term GDP growth that is   expected from the stimulus package  I don’t expect foreign economies to perform as well as the   Greenbook says or to recover even as quickly as the United States will, as it no doubt ultimately           January 27–28, 2009 156 of 267  will I expect net exports to be less supportive of GDP growth than the Greenbook suggests, and   I read foreign exchange markets as being supportive of the view that advanced foreign   economies will actually underperform the United States in the period ahead   A couple of final concerns before I turn to inflation  In a world like this, where the model   of capitalism that has come from the United States is now being doubted—maybe even ridiculed   in some corners of the world—the risk of big policy errors everywhere, not just here but   everywhere, is higher The US weakness in the story line—that somehow this started in the   United States and this is the fault of the United States—makes it harder for us to stop bad   policies from being undertaken outside the United States  So with all of that, I am quite   uncertain about the timing of improvement in financial conditions  The decision on the use of   TARP funding is thus likely to be critically important, and this solvency overhang is likely to be   harmful to GDP in the balance of 2009 I think that the framing question for the new   Administration should and might be what the official sector can do to help reopen capital   markets so that real common equity that these institutions need can come to bear  What sorts of   risk insurance do we need to provide?  I am not sure how the real economy can get traction until   some of those things are answered   Finally, on the inflation front, I will be brief  The inflation picture, of course, bears   watching, but I am still skeptical that deflation risks rank as high as many of the other risks that I   and others have described today Inflation expectations remain key and obviously should be a   focus of our continued discussions here   On the long-term projections and the recommendation that comes from the   subcommittee, I support it  The benefits, at least in my view, will be felt more inside this room    I think it does help us communicate and understand one another’s views  The idea that somehow        January 27–28, 2009 157 of 267  that is going to have anything more than a modest near-term effect on how the world thinks   about inflation and thinks about our behavior probably overstates, but I do think it is, on balance,   a step in the right direction  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Maybe I will start with a note on the political   economy before turning to the statement  I had thought that we would know the situation was   improved when the Fed was off the front pages  I think we have been off the front pages not   because the situation has improved but because the Treasury is taking over the front pages, and   that is a good thing So I feel pretty comfortable that we are finding ourselves slowly but surely   into this week’s headlines that we are murky and they don’t know  I am not that encouraged, as I   think about this statement for us, to try to make news if we don’t have it  The baton has been   passed to a new Administration, and we should be cautious about stepping up before we know   exactly where they are and before we know where we are  That is just an instinct, which maybe   pervades and suggests a preference for alternative B           January 27–28, 2009 196 of 267  With respect to a couple of the items that have been debated on alternative B, Mr   Chairman, I would resist the suggestion that we import the sentence in section 3 of alternative A    I prefer to keep it as is  I would rather not, to the point made at the other end of the table, add on   additional risk at this point in the public square  My own sense is that the risks haven’t changed   materially since we last met  But adding that sentence suggests that somehow we are now   acknowledging that they have, and at least to my mind it is not quite there  Even though   sometimes I also have an instinct to make the statement a confessional of sorts, I think it is   dangerous for us to do that until the lust is outside our hearts, so to speak  [Laughter]   I had always been accused by someone who very recently sat at this table of temporizing    But with his recent absence, I suggest that we temporize here on paragraph 3  [Laughter]   Though I think it is quite possible that we will include a sentence along the lines that President   Yellen suggested, put me in the temporizing camp, but please don’t tell him So what does that   mean?  I like alternative B as written Not to add to your burdens, but I am also uncomfortable   with the way the sentence reads on the purchase of longer-term Treasury securities  I read it and   I think the markets would read it as that we have reached a decision  The way it is written now is   that we have reached the decision that we are likely to do it later  I think that is not quite where   we are So given the position we are in, I would make the following minor edits, which I think   change it a little I would say, “The Committee also is prepared to purchase longer-term   Treasury securities”—now I change a few words here—“if circumstances were to evolve in a   way that such transactions would be particularly effective,” because, again, I think as written it   says “if evolving circumstances indicate”  I think they read that to say, “We presume   circumstances will be evolving, and we will take these actions”  I guess it may be more   conditional and take us slightly out of the box in which we find ourselves  So, again, my        January 27–28, 2009 197 of 267  suggestion would be, “If circumstances were to evolve in a way that indicates that such   transactions would be particularly effective,” though I think it is ideal that we not find ourselves   in the situation of pondering and debating in the public square  Given where we are, I think that   is the best alternative we can do at this moment  Thank you     How about “later”?  [Laughter]     It is always winter somewhere  [Laughter]     I think the Lacker suggestion is “if circumstances were to indicate that”     The delta is, Are the evolving circumstances going to evolve as we   presume, in which case we have pre-committed to it?  Or is our decision going to be based on   whether the evolving circumstances change in one way, which then triggers our “yes”?                  January 27–28, 2009 206 of 267    May I use a life line? [Laughter]  Brian, do you read it, as written, to say   that we have reached a decision and our decision is contingent upon facts of the world in the   future or that we have reached a decision and, if the world proceeds as we expect it will, then we   will do this?  I am not sure I picked up from your introduction which you think you and markets   would read     I would say that Treasury markets are sort of 50/50 on when we are going   to go forward So this is really the question Does it go 55/45 or vice versa?  It is hard to know   I think the sense is that the more they read the “if” to be an “if,” the more conditional it is and the   more consensus there is around the table, Mr Chairman  So it is really just whether we think   that there is sufficient conditionality as written or whether the Lacker–Warsh thing adds to the   conditionality              January 27–28, 2009 207 of 267    To conflate game shows, I don’t want to be voted off the island    [Laughter]      Thank you, Mr Chairman  Let me just echo the comment you made at   the outset, which I think Governor Duke and others have made  It will sound in the spirit of   piling on, because this is obviously an incredibly tough situation and we’re all doing our very   best I think in terms of market expectations that you and, I think, Bill referenced—these   expectations have been raised about what is going to be announced on Monday  My sense is that   this program is both more and less than they’re expecting  More in that it is broader and more   comprehensive; less in that it’s less clear what this is going to mean in effect and with respect to   timing  So I’d say that while the questions are being asked about how this works in practice, we   are likely to have markets test that weakness, test that ambiguity, and I suspect they will do that           February 7, 2009 32 of 65  in this upcoming week, particularly with respect to some of our most systemically important    institutions So I think for them this will be exceptionally problematic  I hope that this is better   received than my instincts and the instincts of some others on this call suggest, but I do think that   we need to be as prepared as we can be to respond to these questions   With respect to how the Congress might react, I think that’s an additional difficulty  In   some ways, I think this proposal is encouraging the Congress to engage in these discussions,   engage on lending, engage on capital, which, again, I think will add uncertainty to markets over   the course of the next several trading days   A couple of other concerns along those lines While these questions are being raised, it   will be more difficult, not less, for capital markets to get traction separate and apart from   financial institution weakness, so I think that some of the improvements that we’ve seen from   some of the facilities that have been announced and implemented in New York by Bill and his   colleagues might be under increased difficulty during this period  And then finally, just as a note   of caution, I think even apart from those institutions that are going to have the biggest questions   with respect to control and creeping nationalization and the intent of the US government, I think   there will be implications for the healthier ones who are their competitors, implications for their   business model and their deposit base, which we’re going to be put in the position of having to   address   So I wish I had easy answers to it, but my sense would be that, in the course of the   discussions with Treasury between now and Monday morning, there are really two ways to go    One is to go narrower at the first and be more specific about particular programs and set   expectations about when they will announce the rest  The other is to try to put some time   parameters around when they’re going to answer questions subsequently—so that we don’t just        February 7, 2009 33 of 65  have a series of leaks and bleeding information that finds its way into the newspapers  I think   the Fed has been remarkably quiet and confidential during this  My sense is Treasury has, as   well But, if the last week is any indication, the sort of false starts and messages that come from    this process are going to create difficulties  So let me stop there, but just raise my concerns there   as well      Thank you, Mr Chairman  Let me confine my remarks to the large-scale   asset purchases I must admit, I am quite uncomfortable with the idea of purchasing long-term   Treasuries in size As the papers described to us, the benefits could well be quite small  My   sense is the costs might not be  This is an idea that we’ve been discussing for a few months, and   as I think about the need that we all feel to escalate, my sense is it has gotten more attractive now   because we have run out of some very good alternatives   Let me highlight some of these concerns  First, I think the nature of the Treasury market   is, frankly, quite different from the nature of the GSE markets that we’ve already entertained—   and I think I’d be comfortable entertaining those more  The long-term Treasury markets are   functioning reasonably well; they’re highly liquid and the desire for risk-free assets is still quite   high My sense is, notwithstanding those facts, at this particular moment in time, Mr Chairman,   there are serious questions being raised by market participants and market commentators about   the government’s ability to fund new higher expected levels of Treasury issuance—that is, they   may or may not, in the market’s view, be able to find buyers at market-clearing prices  Then if   the Fed is perceived to be monetizing debt and serving as a buyer of last resort in the name of   lowering risk-free rates, we could end up with higher rates and less credibility as a central bank    My own sense is this could be self-defeating              March 17–18, 2009 81 of 266  Very recent discussions that Nathan Sheets and I had with certain large non-US buyers   of Treasury securities confirmed these suspicions  They note that at times like this we are one   government, and if the Treasury and the Federal Reserve have to collude to somehow solve the   issuance problem, it could be signaling greater problems about our ability to fund ourselves  So I   would say my concerns are particularly pronounced at a time like this   Now, of course, all central banks are struggling with arrangements between the fiscal   authorities and the monetary authorities, as we are  There’s no easy way around it  I think the   accord is certainly a step in the right direction  But I fear that if we are perceived to be colluding   with the Treasury around this idea, in the name of saving 25 or 30 or 40 basis points in the short   term, we’re running serious risks  Even if our actions lowered long-term risk-free rates for a   time, and we got a pop—and I suspect we would get a pop—it does strike me the spillover   benefits to lower rates on a broader range of securities are likely to be small, probably smaller   than the models would suggest  The availability of financing is unlikely to change by virtue of   our actions Our actions don’t appear to me to change the universe of institutions or the universe   of assets that are financeable, and credit markets would not open to anyone or anything new    The best that could be said is that we are lowering rates on riskier securities by a very small   fraction, and that amount is likely to be overwhelmed by daily moves in risk premiums, as has   been evidenced in the last few days, with costs that, as I mentioned, could be quite large   With respect to the UK example, which has gotten quite a bit of attention overseas, I   think there’s a little less there than meets the eye  My own sense is, this is more a story of   liquidity, by virtue of the government entering markets that are considerably less liquid than   Treasuries, and it’s also a bit of a story of a much more activist central bank in the UK than the   markets had become accustomed to  So I think that’s probably playing some role as well           March 17–18, 2009 82 of 266  In light of the choices we have, I think it would be preferable at this point to increase our   emphasis on mortgage-backed securities, as has been described  I think we could continue to   argue that that is solving a very serious problem, which is that market functioning is still more   impaired in that market than we think is ideal  They are wards of the state, yet they are trading   as very poor, imperfect substitutes for the Treasuries  I think that would be a better option to   take at this time  Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Let me discuss four points  first, the   economy in the near term with an emphasis on non-US; second, medium-term implications of   all these policy responses for the trend growth in productivity; third, financial markets; and   fourth, briefly, financial institutions   On the economy, the real economy is deteriorating globally, as everyone has said  I think   the hard question is whether the pace of deterioration is slowing, and I suspect the answer is, “no,   it’s not”  National capitals, including our own, do not seem to be capable in times like this, for   many of the reasons Don has described, of slowing that deterioration  If anything, some actions   seem to be giving rise to more uncertainty and greater weakness  Dave Stockton talked in detail   about the data on spending and production, which continue to be poor, revealing the weakness in   our economy and labor markets to be broad and deep  In the rest of the world, the deterioration,   as has been discussed, is probably broader, probably deeper, and, more troubling still, probably               March 17–18, 2009 151 of 266  even less likely to receive effective responses  The second-derivative question there is clear  If   anything, the problems overseas are accelerating  The total collapse in global trade is well   understood at this point   The hard piece for me to get my arms around is  What are the second- and third-order   effects of this weakness in global markets, in global economies, and what could lead in the near   term to significant political, policy, and balance-of-power challenges around the world?  Are we   entering a period of instability that makes the rest of the world’s economies even more   vulnerable than they have been in recent years to exogenous shocks? And I don’t think it takes   an incredible imagination to think about what those could be  The unwinding of fiscal   imbalances is happening fast, but the deterioration across our economies is happening even   faster The delta, I suspect, is a breakdown in confidence and the risk of policy failures which   are exacerbating the situation  Perhaps it’s true that the current account surplus countries are at   greater risk than the deficit countries   The G-20 meetings of this last weekend were, I would say, different in a couple respects   from prior international meetings  For example, six months ago there continued to be a sort of   schadenfreude about the US, some sense that people think the US is getting what it deserves    That is nowhere in the room at this point  There is a worldwide need for US leadership, a need   for the US economy to recover with great strength, and a rooting for the US  I think most of   the other G-20 members were of the view that if the US does not get this thing turned around,   they are going to be in a very dire situation, even more dire than under current prospects  In   addition, I thought that the most interesting topic was what was discussed only in the most   hushed tones at these meetings, and that was Eastern Europe  It was still not allowed to be   discussed broadly because I think the fears were so, so significant  Almost every other issue was        March 17–18, 2009 152 of 266  put squarely on the table for a broad discussion, but the banking problems in Eastern Europe   were hidden from public view, and that was more troubling than I had thought even before I   went into the meeting   Second, in terms of the medium-term economy here in the US, I thought that the   adverse supply condition scenario in the Greenbook was quite indicative of more damaging risks    The misallocation of labor and capital across the economy merits some responsibility for this   recession, and getting that allocation back to equilibrium is what recessions are all about  It’s not   obvious that is happening, at least at this point  Capital is not finding its way to anything close to   its most efficient uses  Labor markets are not able to dynamically adjust  And these problems   are likely to be particularly pervasive as the path to a new architecture for credit intermediation   remains unclear  I think over time the real risk is that we are going to end up with less trend   productivity, less growth, and a higher NAIRU Policy actions seem unconducive to restoration   of the growth rates that we have come to expect in recent years   Third, let me talk about financial markets  I think financial market functioning is as poor   as Governor Kohn described Policy uncertainty has become the watchword, not just for the real   economy, but for financial markets; and I suspect that when we look at CDS spreads for large   financial institutions, notwithstanding the commitments that this institution and the Treasury   have given, what markets have come to determine is that the Congress will be calling the shots,   and that is a problem  I think markets are very uncertain, when there are 435 leaders in one body   and 100 in another, about exactly what might come out of that, and the idea that there might be   one party in control of government does not seem to be enough to drive leadership in a single   direction Thus, I’m not taking too much signal from the improvement in markets in recent days    Backlogs around financings are perhaps better than they were a week or two ago, and, in fact, a        March 17–18, 2009 153 of 266  large pharmaceutical company last night priced a range of debt securities at impressive spreads    I’m really suspicious about whether a deal like that will be able to be done in the next couple of   weeks, and so I think the backlogs are a big question   Let me turn then finally to financial institutions as they relate to financial markets  I   concur wholeheartedly with what President Rosengren said earlier  I worry very much that the   policy response that’s going to come from Washington in the next several days and weeks will   not be well received, will require another pivot, and there might well be litigation around that  I   think that is very, very damaging  I think we are entering a period in the next couple of weeks   that could well determine the strength in the economy in the next couple of quarters, and I think,   as Governor Kohn said, expectations in the real economy are confused because government   actions in the name of boldness seem to be quite ambiguous  That is a very, very difficult   combination  Thank you, Mr Chairman     “Increasing the rate of purchases”  I think that’s what you are trying to   get the markets to gather     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Just a few points first  Given the policy   uncertainty that we’ve all described that is out there in the world, it strikes me our preferences   here in this room should be putting a greater emphasis on things that are clear and purposeful   versus those that are big and bold and more  Clear, purposeful, big, bold, and more—if you   could pull it all together in one fell swoop, that would be fine, but absent that, I would put the   preference on clear and purposeful   We’ve talked a lot about the makeup of our balance sheet  I would just reiterate a truism   which I think still has merit—our biggest asset here is our credibility, which is a function of a lot   of things, including clarity, success, and trying to speak as much as we practicably can with one        March 17–18, 2009 211 of 266  voice; and that will obviously govern my vote in support of the consensus emerging from this   discussion   Having said that, I continue to have a strong preference for avoiding Treasuries for   reasons I described yesterday and given that, since December, markets seem to see us as   alternately having some affection and disaffection for purchasing Treasuries for reasons that   have been hard to understand I think we need to be prepared to address that issue if, as I expect,   we include Treasury purchases in our statement today   In terms of the size of these various elements, I think the only thing worse than buying   Treasuries is to buy them in such a tepid way that we don’t have any effect  I think if we’re in,   we’re in We’re crossing the Rubicon  And I take very little comfort from the idea that we   would be somehow testing this out just a bit  So I think, in effect, what we’re really all saying,   Mr Chairman, is we are balance-sheet-constrained  There is only so much of these new assets,   whether they be mortgage-backed or Treasuries, that we are comfortable with, given the risks to   our flexibility So I am troubled that the $300 billion will be perceived to be relatively light  But   given people’s preferences around here, I won’t spend more time on that   In terms of some of the language, I concur with the emerging consensus that we should   delete some of the carnage in describing the economy on the grounds that it is well understood    I’ve got next to nothing to offer on style between prime and nonprime   And on the Plosser–Bullard proposals, I think that it’s a pretty interesting framework  I   don’t think it’s ready for prime time, so I’d associate myself with what President Stern said, that   it would be a useful way in which we could start to think in anticipation of our next meeting    But I don’t think at this moment we can easily capture that in a way which goes back to first   principles of being clear and precise  Thank you           March 17–18, 2009 212 of 266     Thank you, Mr Chairman  After the despair at our last meeting, we may   have expected to find ourselves with locusts, floods, and plagues  [Laughter] So I suspect the   swine flu pandemic and the leaked stress-test results do seem like veritable green shoots in   comparison  [Laughter] May that be the ninth and last reference to green shoots today, unless   my colleagues choose to reference that as well   I think, as the Greenbook and Dave suggested, that the most significant change since the   last time we met is in the tone, tenor, and level of financial markets  But I hesitate to take too   much definitive comfort from these improvements and recognize, of course, that the financial   markets and the real economy are relating to one another  But, again, a lot seems to be hinging   on continued improvements in these markets  So let me talk first about financial market   developments; second, briefly about financial firms and stress tests; third, about the economy;   and, fourth, briefly about inflation   First, on the financial market side, we have seen since the lows on March 9 a $3 trillion   addition to the net worth of US households Globally, the addition to net worth is probably   around $9 trillion I tend to think that that is more constructive, more important to outcomes,   than stimulus packages that we and others could have constructed  If that trend continues, then   the Greenbook might end up looking calm in comparison, but I am probably not as bullish as   that I think that the change in net worth, the change in market cap, is indicative of principally an   unwinding of some fear, an unwinding of some risk premium, and maybe a little better, the   market’s view of improved economic prospects  But the benefits of the equity market        April 28–29, 2009 86 of 201  improvements aren’t confined to wealth  We see second-order improvements in confidence,   even though it is at low levels  That is coming back slowly, but seemingly surely, to various   measures of business confidence and consumer confidence  Again, if that trend holds, we will be   in awfully good shape   Let me look, after the equity markets, to a market that I haven’t referenced for some time,   which is the convertible market  The convertible markets are booming  Keep in mind, as Trish   and others probably discussed previously, convertible markets are a very hot or a very cold   market  The market right now is exceptionally hot  Why is that?  I think it tells us something   about investor preferences Investors have seen markets move 20, 25, 30 percent in equity    They say, “Well, I want a bit of an equity appreciation”  At the same time, they are still a little   risk averse, so they want that downside protection, all of which is making the convertible market   the market of choice  We see a range of companies, both high-quality names and lesser names,   using the convertible market to raise meaningful capital  I would say that the pipelines in the   convertible market are as large as they have been in eighteen months or two years, and those   markets are robust, even in this upcoming week    I think the Greenbook talked in detail about the fixed-income markets, which continue to   show some improvement, making all-in financing costs lower than I think many, including   myself, would have expected them to have been when we last met  I also see renewed interest in   financial institutions issuing non-TLGP paper, which I think is a good sign, first, to try to prove   that they are okay, different, and better, but also they are starting to feel more comfortable that   the government backstops won’t be around forever, and they want to differentiate themselves   With that, let me turn to financial firms and stress tests, my second point of focus  Prior   to the stress-test results, we have seen a race by the relatively strong to access these markets               April 28–29, 2009 87 of 201  The capital that Goldman Sachs raised some weeks ago was much discussed, and just this   morning Northern Trust raised $750 million of equity capital  After a greenshoe option is   triggered by the underwriter, it will be something closer to $900 million  Now, the book at   Northern Trust—which markets perceive to be a relatively strong mix between a recurring   revenue business and an old-fashioned bank but maybe still a bit more the former—was good,   healthy, but not massively oversubscribed  I think they raised this capital at around $50 a share,   trading a couple of dollars higher going into the pricing this morning  That does tell me that   there are markets—that is, there is demand for high-quality names, but it is not an insatiable   demand  It is not massive  Given Northern Trust’s success, we should feel that, if what we do is   effective on the stress tests, the markets will be open for some, but not all, of the names that are   seeking private capital In addition, Northern Trust, Credit Suisse, and BB&T are in the market   today raising debt at yield spreads that are remarkable—275 to 325 over 5-year and 10-year   money Again, this is very encouraging, probably more encouraging than I would have   suspected at the last FOMC meeting   Let me turn to the aptly named stress tests  Depending on execution, they could   undermine some of the progress that is at the center of the improvements over the past several   weeks I say that because, historically, financial firms are a higher beta move on broader   markets  They have tended to track the S&P historically, at least over the last 20 years, with   higher peaks and lower valleys But they tend to be related to it  In fact, in the last six weeks,   bank stocks and financial firms generally have outperformed the broader markets  To the extent   that the financial firms suffer, I would expect them to bring down a lot of firms—or at least bring   down their market capital—that are unrelated to the banking business  I will highlight several   key issues on the stress tests, just asking the questions, but I think we have all debated them at            April 28–29, 2009 88 of 201  some length  One, will regulators or markets be the predominant determinants of the fate of   these 19 firms?  Two, will the firms in need of capital have six months to raise private capital or   six days?  Third, is the specter of government capital confidence inducing or panic inducing?   Fourth, and probably most meaningful for the broader economy, what is the resulting   competitive landscape, and what is the impact of that landscape on the real economy?   With that, let me turn to a third point, which is the real economy itself  I am probably a   little more anxious than the Greenbook about the economy and would leave in some of Dave’s   and the team’s add factors that made the judgmental forecast a little darker than model   predictions for just a bit longer because of the uncertainty that is in store for us over the next few   weeks In addition, I would expect the cap-ex downside risks to be greater than the Greenbook   estimates  I would expect the turn in inventories from liquidation to modest growth to perhaps   help the arithmetic of second-half growth but provide very little comfort beyond that  I would   also expect less improvement in PCE than the Greenbook, but I will have to admit that it is hard   to judge Over the long term, I continue to expect weaker GDP than the Greenbook and higher   unemployment, and I suspect that is mostly because I expect a higher NAIRU and lower   potential GDP in the outyears for a whole range of reasons, but maybe most simply said, because   articles of faith of how this economy works have been up-ended or are in the process of being   undermined  So I am just not sure how quickly we get back to trend or whether the old trend is   at all indicative of the new   On foreign growth, I think that the forecast from Nathan and his team, though   encouraging, likely overstates the return of these non-US economies to growth  Whatever the   path is for the United States, I expect the path for the advanced foreign economies overseas to be   slower and the return to be less pronounced In the back of my mind, the problems facing the           April 28–29, 2009 89 of 201  United Kingdom, Japan, and some other countries—and I hesitate to think that we would ever   want to be trading places or seats with them—are fundamental and much harder to get out of   after a period like this   Finally, on inflation, I continue to be more worried about upside risks to inflation than   downside risks As a result, I would expect the removal of the extraordinary policy   accommodation to be at a rate faster than the Greenbook suggests and be at slower-than-current   market expectations  And I expect that core inflation will remain somewhat higher than in the   Greenbook over the forecast period Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Just a quick intervention  First, I was   extremely uncomfortable with the Treasury purchases when we last met  I continue to be   extremely uncomfortable with them  I won’t relitigate that here for the reasons I articulated last   time; plus, I don’t like losing  I don’t want to lose again  [Laughter] So as Sun Tzu said, I will   step back from that  It is no surprise, then, that I oppose an increase in our Treasury purchases   beyond what we did last time  In terms of the discussion about markets and their expectations   that we had earlier in this round, Mr Chairman, I think we should not be surprised that markets   want more; and the more we give, the more they will want  Having a strong, large, and credible   buyer of Treasury securities is all to the good for a Treasury desk, and so I don’t think we should   be surprised by that at all With that large caveat, I favor alternative B  I think that we should be   patient I think we should be the adults in town  We should favor as much policy certainty as we        April 28–29, 2009 145 of 201  possibly can have We have an opportunity here not to be lurchy, not to be jumpy, and I think   alternative B captures that   I have one other area of discomfort with alternative B that I would raise  In paragraph 3,   Mr Chairman, after we denote in detail the numbers of our purchases, which really are just a   restatement of what we did previously, we then go on to say, “The Committee stands ready to   adjust the timing and overall amounts of its purchases    in view of the evolving economic   outlook” I think that the markets are unlikely to view that language neutrally  The sentence is   new from what we said in March, and it looks to me as though, when last time we said that we   stood ready to do something, we were standing ready to buy Treasuries if circumstances evolved,   which we ultimately did  I view that as being quite forward leaning  In fact, it probably does   match market expectations, which Trish rightly described  But it tends to pre-judge that   outcome  At least if I am properly hearing our colleagues around the table, it is not a judgment   that we want to make  And I continue to think that the last sentence in paragraph 3—where we   say, “The Committee will continue to carefully monitor the size and composition”—certainly   gives us that flexibility That is the same sentence that we used in March, which gave us that   flexibility So I must say that I don’t really understand the rationale for including this new   sentence about standing ready, particularly the reference to overall amounts of those purchases,   until we have gone much further  So that is a particular area of discomfort on alternative B   Finally, in the debate that is brewing about the limits of monetary policy in this cycle, I   think I would associate myself with President Stern and suggest that we have accomplished   much On balance, what we have done over these past 18 months has been remarkable  If the   next 18 months force the same kind of innovation and creativity by the Federal Reserve, we can   almost guarantee that those projections we have submitted here in April aren’t coming to pass         April 28–29, 2009 146 of 201  So this might be a proper time for us to be a bit more patient and to be a bit more hesitant to   continue to push the envelope, and we will see whether or not the projections come to pass    Thank you     In light of our behavior and the language around our behavior   historically, I think that markets would read this as going in one direction and the one direction is   far more likely up  Again, I think the overall amount certainly triggers it  And I must say that I   don’t understand what that sentence does that isn’t accomplished in the final sentence        April 28–29, 2009 152 of 201    Yes, I do think that helps     Yes     I think except for the audit fees      Mr Chairman, let me try to be brief but address a couple of the topics   that were raised in the so-called question part of the discussion  And then I’ll try to go through   the topics that you mentioned briefly   First, the remittance discussion, where I think we put that in legal terms—Seth was asked   for decided legal judgments—and we put it in political terms  I think most of the remittance   discussion actually is about credibility  In the event bad things happen and we end up with   losses that are enduring, what does that do to the credibility of Fed actions?  The Fed’s ability to   affect these markets typically comes not because of the size of the actions, but because of who is   taking them  So I think that credibility could suffer in those circumstances, and I’ll try to use   that credibility idea to consider whether we are crowding in other investors to these markets or   crowding out other investors for the balance of my discussion on your third point on asset   purchases   The Desk asked for our views on several topics  First, on the policy objectives of the   asset purchases, I think markets have heard us say different things about what our objective   function is Mine would be to improve market functioning, to bring liquidity to markets that are   not trading, to narrow bid–asked spreads, and the like  This would suggest having the Desk   devote its resources to securities, such as off-the-run securities, that are less liquid  I think   markets have heard other objectives from us, although not explicit objectives, such as to set price   levels across Treasuries or MBS I think we have rightly steered away from it  But they think   that we are still cognizant of prices at some level and that we are trying to move rates lower  So   the first question the Desk asked is  Could we collectively be clear on an objective function?  I   think we could, and I would suggest that your Humphrey-Hawkins testimony and Monetary   Policy Report might be the best means of doing so           June 23–24, 2009 73 of 261  The second question raised by the Desk was about expanding asset purchases  I’m   exceptionally uncomfortable with expanding asset purchases, particularly now  The Desk, I   think, had a preference, understandably, for increasing Treasuries  That doesn’t fit my preferred   objective, which is that we’re entering markets to improve market functioning  So, on that basis,   I think that market was working well before we got in it, and I’d say it’s still working well  But   if we got into it in significant size, I could see it actually working less well  Had risk-free rates   fallen markedly since we started purchasing Treasuries, Mr Chairman, I would have expected   some to say  “Well, then we should do more of it”  But risk-free rates have increased since we   started purchasing, yet I hear some say, “Well, we should do more of it”  So I’m not sure what   fact scenario would have suggested doing less of it, and it makes me a little uncomfortable  I   think Brian Sack did a great job of explaining how all-in costs of capital for real private   companies in this market have come down, and meaningfully so  I don’t think that has much, if   anything, to do with our Treasury purchases  It could have much to do with the suite of things   that we’ve done in the last 20 months, but I think it gives too much credit to suggest that   somehow that’s related to the purchases of Treasuries  I don’t think that our science is so good   that we know that increasing the size of our Treasury purchases to $450 billion, but not to   $750 billion, would have a modest, marginally positive effect  It’s not at all obvious to me   where risk-free rates would be had we avoided buying Treasuries; they might have been higher   or they might have been lower  But I must say I’m not convinced, and as a result, not at all   comfortable expanding further   In terms of the expanding purchases of agencies, I think the Desk rightly warns us that   doing so could actually do some harm to that market  Given how big we are to the new issuance   market there, I think we might well have already done some harm  That is, we entered that        June 23–24, 2009 74 of 261  market when it wasn’t functioning, and we helped improve market functioning  But to the extent   that we’re 70 or 80 percent of certain classes of securities, I would say that that two-sided market   is not forming well, and I would be very hesitant to go further there   The third question raised by the Desk  What about flexibility between and among asset   classes, that is, what if we just pool all of this stuff together and say we’re smart and we’re going   to use the following criteria?  I think that would be read by markets to mean that we’re   increasing potentially the purchases of Treasuries  I think that would risk crowding out those   investors who would think that there are strange things afoot, so I don’t think that’s a prudent   idea In terms of flexibility within asset classes, I think markets have learned that we’re not as   responsive to changes in rates as they would like, and my own sense would be it’s a noble goal to   have flexibility, but flexibility in a vacuum will lead to continued ambiguity or accentuated   ambiguity  So I don’t think that that’s a great way forward   In terms of increasing flexibility to be more responsive to market rates, I just don’t think   we should be fighting against the tape here  I’m not sure we know what the real market-clearing   rates are for some of these things  In terms of securities lending, which I think has been much   abused outside of the Federal Reserve and poorly understood by market participants, I share   Brian’s view that our being in the securities lending business could actually be useful to solve   what I would consider to be the preeminent policy objective of helping market functioning   improve   So that’s just a quick list of some of the things that you asked us to address, Mr   Chairman  On Brian Madigan’s modifications of various liquidity facilities, I think it is   confidence-inducing, not risk-inducing, for the world to know that we are thinking about exits    Even those market participants who think that the economy could well unwind again will believe              June 23–24, 2009 75 of 261  that we can be more comfortable improvising in a forward-leaning way if we can at the same   time be thinking about how we get out of this when conditions warrant  Without going into   detail on Brian’s list, I think it’s constructive, and I think that the Thursday press release is likely   to be in some ways more impactful to market’s understanding of our way forward than our   FOMC statement on Wednesday  Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I thought I would talk briefly about the real   economy, then financial markets, and then inflation, in that order   On the real economy, in terms of near-term growth and employment prospects, like many   of you, I think GDP growth looks shaky through year-end  The arithmetic of GDP may yield a   positive quarter or two, but I see very little evidence that that will be enduring, or at least   something that is a strong foundation on which to build  President Fisher was much chagrined   yesterday to park his shiny new car next to what he described as my clunker, and he suggested   that I take the government up on its generous $4,500 voucher  I’ve decided my answer is “yes,”   so I’ll do my part, I think, in the third quarter  [Laughter]   Unemployment is walking, if not running, away, as Presidents Rosengren and Yellen   suggested I suspect that the trend in unemployment is likely to create a political demand for   consideration of a new fiscal package  I think the debate on that will be hugely consequential,   not necessarily in terms of the economy, but in terms of getting further market attention on fiscal   sustainability   Downside risks to this rather weak forecast, I think, are in place, both with respect to   non-US growth and non-US financial market improvements, to which I think President   Dudley made good reference  In terms of medium-term growth prospects, I also see downside           June 23–24, 2009 150 of 261  risks as pro-stability policies proliferate  I think unemployment is likely to be more   determinative of the shape of this recovery than the path of housing prices or other asset prices,   and I share the views expressed by many that NAIRU looks as if it’s trending higher  I raise that   not really to quibble about the size of the output gap, but rather to suggest that the reallocation   between capital and labor is likely to last longer and that the incomes in this economy in the   medium term are probably less reliable, given the emerging mix of macroeconomic policies  I   compliment Dave and his staff for continued work on the labor market damage scenario, which, I   think, is more real than we wish to imagine   Internationally, it strikes me that there is much more complacency about where things   stand on the global economy than I would have expected  When we talk to bank regulators and   large banks elsewhere around the world, there’s almost a nostalgia about the events of last fall    And many of them have not gone through the capital-raising that our banks have  I think we are   rightly uncertain, as both Bill and Don suggested, about the risks to US institutions  But I think   the risks look to me at least as high, if not higher, for banks elsewhere in the world, and I’m   really struck by the fact that they are seeming to race back to the good old days at capital levels   that look to me quite low, with expectations for GDP growth in their home countries which, I   think, are likely to disappoint   Decoupling, which, I thought, we had proved over the course of the last year was a myth   proliferated by Wall Street, seems to have found its way back into financial markets and to   economists traveling around the world  There is a view that, well, even if the US bumbles   along, China has figured out how to be a strong growth engine for Asia, and Europe is getting   traction in and of itself In my view, we have one global integrated economy, and those who              June 23–24, 2009 151 of 261  think that somehow these other engines of growth are sufficient to get us through this near-term   weakness, I think, are likely to be disappointed   On the financial market side, the capital-raising that came out of the stress test results is   nothing short of impressive  That is $75 billion to keep us away from Sunday night meetings, so   that has got to make us feel a little bit better  The capital and corporate equity and debt markets   are as open as they’ve been since this crisis began  But having said all of that, I must say I’m a   little troubled that markets don’t seem to be discriminating  I’d be more confident if there were   more differentiation between and among assets in the US or between US assets and non-US   assets It looks to me as though the kind of market discipline, which I have described as being   back and punitive, seems to have stepped back for a while  And there are a whole lot of   lemmings that seem to be chasing indexes and buying into everything  So I’m not as   comfortable as I wish I were about this bounce off the bottom in asset prices everywhere around   the world since the March 9 lows   As I think was described by Bill and others, what we’re seeing in these markets I would   rationalize as an abatement of the panic, rather than a sign of robust recovery  These asset prices   strike me as not yet having found a new sustainable equilibrium, so the summer could test the   value of these asset prices I put a little emphasis on this, because it does strike me that the   increase of, say, 30 percent on average in asset values from spring until now might be more   consequential than all of the fiscal stimulus packages in trying to help get this economy going   again And to the extent that those wealth effects are reversed, I think that’s likely to be hugely   consequential           June 23–24, 2009 152 of 261  We talked a little bit yesterday about Treasury markets  I would only say that in the   intermeeting period I think the move up in Treasury yields is for both benign and less benign   reasons—it’s hard for me to differentiate exactly which carries the day   Finally, on the inflation front, as many have suggested, I think the dashboard indicates   some normalization of inflation readings consistent with marking down prospects of deflation,   rightly in my view  We can see higher inflation compensation in the TIPS market and elsewhere    Still, inflation expectations remain seemingly well anchored, even though we have now seen in   markets both inflation and deflation scares that have gotten their attention and maybe gotten   some of ours, too   I’d just end with a sort of thought experiment, much of which we could carry on in   Round 2 If we had this weak current economy and this set of projections that we’ve all   forwarded for consideration and public disclosure, but had not had the panic and the   extraordinary fear-inducing moments of the last year, where would policy be?  Would our   prospects for policy be different?  Or are we keeping our policy accommodation at the   extraordinary levels in part because of what we’ve endured?  I’m not sure I know the answers to   those questions, but they are things I will continue to think about  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I have three points  First, I think it is likely   we’ll need to remove our policy accommodation sooner than the Greenbook indicates, but I think        June 23–24, 2009 192 of 261  it’s unlikely we’ll begin to remove it as quickly as markets currently suggest  Second, given the   commitments that we have made, notwithstanding the “up to” language, on the asset purchases,   while I’m not in favor of extending that obligation, I do think we should work to achieve that   existing commitment, for credibility purposes  Third, I support alternative B and will just make   a few comments on language With respect to the last sentence, I think it is essential that   markets understand that we are taking these exit considerations seriously  I think that is good   both for actions that we could take that are even more aggressive—that they know we’re taking it   with full understanding and confidence that we can exit—and for actions that we have already   undertaken   Having said that, I don’t think this is the right place to be making that argument  I don’t   think our experience in the last few years in using this statement for nuance or for volume   control has proven to be the most effective way of doing so  I think we have ample opportunities   through you, Mr Chairman, to be very clear about the need for exit and these considerations    So, on balance, though I’m sympathetic to the truth of it, I think it would be more prudent for   you to make this point clear and consistent in your Monetary Policy Report and other speaking   opportunities If the bracketed sentence were in, we’d be proving a little too much  To me, the   fact that we’re now entering this into the statement does have the feel of sort of protesting  So on   balance, I would favor not doing it, though I am, of course, comfortable with the substance   I just want to flag the penultimate sentence  “The Federal Reserve is monitoring the size   and composition of its balance sheet”  I like it, and I think it helps for the announcement that we   make on Thursday, about Brian Madigan’s recommendations, which is pretty important  I think   it’s nice that we have a bridge to that, so that market participants and reporters alike don’t think           June 23–24, 2009 193 of 261  that we have, in their view, yet again surprised them on what the substance is  Thank you, Mr   Chairman      Thank you, Mr Chairman  On a couple of the ideas that are being   discussed with respect to excess reserve balances, the GSEs—either in Chris’s context as   potential additional counterparties or in your context, Jamie—could be useful here  What if the   status of the GSEs changed during the period in which we need to conduct these operations?  I   think in all likelihood the GSEs will be in the same muddled mess they are in now, and the   Congress and the Administration will leave them as they are in effective conservatorship forever    But what happens if in fact that is wrong and the GSEs end up finding themselves either more or   less wards of the state with a different mission and capital structure?  Does the prospect of the   change in that potentially limit our options—again, depending on when this period of draining   excess reserves comes into being?     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I did some thinking overnight about the   assessment of financial markets that Brian Sack highlighted yesterday, and I realized that        August 11–12, 2009 101 of 165  markets haven’t seemed so good or seemed so self-satisfied since, I don’t know, the spring of   2007 [Laughter] So I thought we should all take some good caution from that   Let me put an exclamation mark around some of the points that Brian made in describing   the remarkable move across equity and credit markets  First, on the equity market front, more   industries, more companies, and more subsectors have participated in this rally and the   expectation of recovery The breadth of this move across assets and across geographies has been   far more durable than I would have expected when we last met  The credit market improvements   have been even more significant  We have seen the positive sentiment move down the capital   structure The bank loan syndication market, which had all but disappeared, to where obituaries   had been written about it, is building remarkably over August  It wouldn’t surprise me at all if,   come the post–Labor Day rush to the capital markets, we see the bank loan market coming back   after the improvements we have seen in the last several months in high yields, convertibles, and   preferreds, again attesting to remarkable improvements in credit markets  Now, in some ways   these improvements have been made possible by an increase in the emergence of investable   assets So re-risking is the new de-risking  Re-risking is the new fad in financial markets  Fund   flows, particularly toward riskier assets, are impressive, and I think we have to continue to watch   this trend and this development   If I were to assess where we stand here in August against what our expectations of the   financial markets could have been over the last few quarters, I can’t help but think that we are   very much at the high end of what might have been reasonably achievable  How much credit is   owed to the Fed and how much credit is owed to the self-corrective nature of these markets or to   some good fortune is hard to judge                 August 11–12, 2009 102 of 165  Let me turn now to the trends in these financial markets and what they might suggest for   the real economy  Amid this rally, I think it is possible that this breadth of improved market   activity ends abruptly We don’t want to suffer from a failure of imagination, and I think we   could envision a series of exogenous shocks that bring many of these improvements to end more   quickly My own sense is that the prospects of those shocks are more likely outside the United   States, particularly outside the US banking sector, but not impossible here But given the rally   in these asset prices, they seem to be able to cover up for a lot of sins on balance sheets of banks   overseas So I think the prospects that I worried about six weeks ago—of a surprise that causes   these markets to retreat—are lower but still not negligible   Well, it would be nice if these trends were to continue unabated  But my sense would be   that straight-line, undifferentiated moves in financial markets tend not to end well  What we   might be enduring over the next few months might be some period of pause, some period of   patience and consolidation that could give this rally some longer legs  If the next six months   look like the last three or four, then it does strike me as possible that there is an upside, not only   in financial markets but in the real economy, along the lines of what Governor Tarullo   highlighted yesterday   So fundamentally, one central question for us is whether financial market trends persist long   enough and strong enough so as to markedly drive sustainable gains in the real economy  That is,   will the wealth effects of improved balance sheets both to consumers and businesses offset the weak   outcomes that were highlighted in the Greenbook and by the discussion yesterday?   Let me turn now to the real side  I broadly share the Greenbook’s view of the real economy   over the next six quarters, though I suspect that we will see pretty significant volatility quarter over   quarter in GDP  But I think the Greenbook strikes it about right  You take some account of the                          August 11–12, 2009 103 of 165  positive incoming financial market data but recognize that they cannot mask the weak incomes and   the slow trajectory for improvement in labor markets  Weak real disposable incomes coming from   weak labor markets and the problems that small businesses will no doubt confront in the next   18 months, as highlighted by Governor Kohn, suggest to me that we run the risk of more-persistent   weakness on the income side than the upside improvements in balance sheets and household net   worth   So after these six quarters of somewhat bumpy but real improvement, what is next?  I   suspect that the predominant risk in the medium term is for slower growth and weaker labor markets   than we have long grown accustomed to coming out of recoveries  The headwinds posed by   financial markets have probably turned into crosscurrents in figuring the direction of the real   economy, making our jobs around this table even more difficult than usual  Prudence probably   requires us to take less signal from the improved financial market conditions and to seek further   evidence not only of improved corporate profits but also of revenue growth  As I think President   Fisher said yesterday, the most telling tale for the future, at least of the equity markets and the real   economy, will be revenue growth  Outside of financials, is there top-line growth from the rest of the   Fortune 500?  Does that suggest some top-line growth from small businesses that is telling us that   the economy is gaining some enduring strength not because of or supported by government   programs but because of the improvements on the real side of the economy?   In the course of the last 18 months, we have debated first the prospects of recession and now   the prospects of recovery  I think around this table we have struggled with trying to understand   what has gone on During the recession, we first asked ourselves some 18 or 20 months ago what   was the breadth of the weak signs that we were seeing  Then we turned to a discussion of what was   the depth of the real recession that we were confronting  Then late in the cycle, even now, we are                                  August 11–12, 2009 104 of 165  talking about what was the length of this recession  And I suspect that these same words—breadth,   depth, and length—end up capturing our discussions in the next 18 months  What is the breadth of   the improvements—the breadth of the green shoots—that we try to envision as we think of an   economy coming out of recession?  What is, in this case, the height—that is, what can this economy   aspire to?  What can it drive?  And as questions of double dips happen as some of the fiscal and   monetary stimulus and some of the extraordinary actions tend to abate, the question will be, What is   the length of this recovery? I think it will make our challenge over the period in front of us as   difficult as that over the past 20 months   A couple of final items  First, on the international front, I was encouraged by Nathan’s   description of the improvements, particularly in the emerging markets  But I have to admit being   less persuaded that there will be a V-shaped recovery, particularly in places outside China  I am   less persuaded that there will be a V-shaped recovery or anything even like a U-shaped recovery in   Europe and among many of our trading partners absent a strong US recovery  Europe is likely to   be materially weaker than the United States and emerge later from recession   And a final note on inflation, after having heard a broad discussion around this table   Inflation measures do appear quite satisfactory for now  The situation certainly bears watching  My   own sense is that, while expectations of inflation remain firmly anchored, the Fed has played in the   last several weeks an important role in describing our conviction that we have the tools to exit from   the extraordinary practices we put in place and that the Fed will be central to those expectations   over the next 20 months, putting further burden on folks around this table  Thank you, Mr   Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I, too, support alternative B as revised  Let   me confine my remarks to the asset-purchase discussion in that alternative  First, with respect to   the Treasury purchases, I think that the Treasury purchase experiment has been a testament to the   strengths of this institution  I think we have had differences of opinion going back to discussions   of last December on the merits of this program  We debated it, we all marshaled our arguments,   and we all decided at least publicly to support this experiment  I think the stars have given us an   opportunity to deftly exit the Treasury purchases  Alternative B as revised gives us the   flexibility, if circumstances warrant, to hold hands yet again, but I’d consider the prospects of   that to be quite unlikely The data of the intermeeting months on the Treasury purchases,   particularly given the question of fiscal sustainability coming from the other branch of   government, have made this particularly problematic for us to undertake successfully  I do think     August 11–12, 2009 141 of 165  the benefits have been outweighed by the costs, but we do have an opportunity to end it in way   that lives up to the commitment that we made some months ago but doesn’t go beyond that  I   think alternative B as revised also does provide that flexibility should the situation change   On the tapering question that President Evans raised, my own sense is that it would not   be necessary, if we had only Treasuries as part of our asset purchase, to go with the tapering    Even out of an abundance of caution I don’t think that it would be necessary  The reason that I   suspect it’s a prudent move for us now is that it will be a signal to markets that, when we do   undertake the mortgage-backed security discussion probably at our next meeting, they will have   seen some bread crumbs as to how we could think about exiting or at least about cutting back on   these So all in all, I would favor the tapering approach, not because of Treasuries but because of   the signaling effect on MBS   On the mortgage-backed securities, as President Yellen suggested, I think that we should   take advantage of the option value and defer our discussion on that  I would be interested in   staff’s thoughts in advance of that meeting as to what the net benefits are of our continued   presence in that market  So while I do think there were marginal benefits, maybe even   meaningful benefits, at the beginning of the MBS program, we are well past the point of   diminishing returns on that  I look forward to a broader discussion come September      There was discussion in a memo about when we get to exit, and whether   we should supplement those actions with asset sales  There was also a discussion with plenty of        September 22–23, 2009 54 of 212  caveats about what kind of losses could be realized on that portfolio if rates were to go up 100   basis points My first instinct was, “Boy, we could hedge that perfectly”  [Laughter] But then I   realized the imprudence of that  If we don’t sell those securities, but, in a continued vanguard of   transparency, the world is aware of these embedded losses, do we know how that would impact   our reporting?  What kind of regime, both from a GAAP sense and also a public disclosure   sense, would govern us? Is it the sale of these long-term assets that is the question, or is it the   embedded losses that could potentially be the question?     Just as a follow-up, Mr Chairman, I have an accounting question  I take   what you say and it makes sense, but suppose we were to sell assets that were some subset of the   overall pool and substantially similar to assets we didn’t sell  Even though we’re in this cost   accounting regime, I wondered whether or not some more explicit imputed loss would be   attributed, if not in the consolidated financial statements, then in the balance sheet  If we were   in the world of a real bank and those unsold assets were similar, then you’d be stuck with that   problem  But, again, I don’t know if from a government GAAP perspective that’s a real   accounting problem or if from a political economy or transparency perspective that begs the   question     Thank you, Mr Chairman  For the first time in a long while, I have more   conviction about what is going to happen in the next two or three quarters than I do over the next   two or three years For the past couple of years, and especially last year, we wondered what was   at our doorstep Now we can look to the medium-term forecast and say, “Well, this stuff will all   work out” I would say in some ways this is as it should be  Near-term prospects and   projections should be clearer to policymakers, and I think for the first time, at least for me, they   are   In terms of the trajectory of the economy, though, I would say I also feel better about the   next few quarters than I do the next few years  The reason for that improvement in conviction   and in its strength on the real side of the economy has a lot to do with the asset price   improvements and has considerably to do in addition, as Dave Stockton said yesterday, with   inventories, as well as with the mix of fiscal and monetary measures, which are certainly helping   the arithmetic of near-term GDP  I think the Greenbook is right in suggesting—and not being as   dismissive as many of us, myself included, would have been six or nine months ago—the chance   of a positive feedback loop that takes us out of where we are with greater strength and   conviction Economies have been underestimated in the post–war era, and maybe we’re   underestimating the resiliency of this one    How durable is this improvement beyond the near term?  We’ve all heard stories  I heard   many of them from you yesterday about Fortune 500 CEOs  If I go back to the 2001–2002   recession and recovery, these CEOs were lousy indicators about the turns in the economy  So I   guess I’m not that troubled that they continue to have their heads in their hands  I think the   difference this time, and the reason why this time they could be right, is that you’ve got to look   long and hard to find real anecdotes of small businesses that are seeing opportunities  Given           September 22–23, 2009 114 of 212  what Don talked about in terms of the bank lending, and the ability of small businesses to access   credit, to access capital, and to get their own animal spirits back, it may be that businesses large   and small are still suffering from a bit of pessimism, while we need them to be much more on   their front foot   Another question about the durability of the improvement and whether it will find   medium-term forecasts as good as the Greenbook suggests is the state of private final demand in   2010 It’s hard to know whether the handoffs from the public sector stimulus to the private   sector improvements will happen as smoothly and in as linear a fashion as the Greenbook   suggests Also, it’s hard to know whether recent improvements in industrial production are   sustainable     And on the consumer income issue that many people have talked about, the question is    Will incomes be sufficient to fund consumption amid this specter of large unemployment?    Personally, I’m more worried about low income, excluding transfer payments, than I am low   consumption per se  And, if the unemployment levels stay as high as they are, will there be   enough impetus in incomes, particularly if our asset prices smooth out over time, to fund the kind   of consumption levels that are consistent with a reasonably positive Greenbook-type forecast?   My medium-term forecast, as a result of all of that, is improved somewhat, but it’s not   marked up as much as the Greenbook  I think the risks are predominantly, but not exclusively, to   the downside The risk is that potential economic growth and employment may have faltered,   making this recession in some sense more costly than the recent loss of jobs and output alone  I   think the continuing questions of the fiscal sustainability and markets’ acceptance of continuing   Treasury issuance are real risk factors to the medium-term forecasts            September 22–23, 2009 115 of 212  Let me turn, then, to financial markets before talking about inflation  On the financial   market front, I’d describe my own views, at least in terms of near-term financial market prices   and market functioning, as tactically long but strategically short  What do I mean by that?   There’s still a ton of momentum in these markets  As I said when we met last, about six weeks   ago, though I was a skeptic about the degree of improvements in the spring and the summer, this   thing has so much going for it in terms of momentum, in terms of money coming off the   sidelines, in terms of institutional and retail investors who don’t want to miss the next leg, that it   strikes me as imprudent, at least in the very near term, to try to stand in front of this wave and   not get blown over Zero rates seem to be having some hand in driving this reflation in asset   prices   But, why am I strategically short, or at least strategically nervous?  I worry about the   sustainability of these improvements in markets, given the questions we’ve all talked about on   the real side of the economy  Many are saying, “Well, this time I will get out just in time,” and   that reminds us of what we heard not too long ago  Still, on net, consumer net worth has rallied   with asset prices, and it is probably up another couple trillion dollars when we see the ultimate   data from the third quarter, with the corresponding wealth and confidence effects   What are market price signals telling us?  Market prices might be as unclear as they’ve   been in a very long time, even though on the real economy side we feel better  It’s tougher to   judge what these markets are telling us because of a few changes  one, seeming changes in   investor preferences and asset allocation; two, changes in the financial architecture, which I have   talked about before; and, three, our extraordinary participation as the government in these   markets  How much of the difficulty in handling these market signals is driven by our   participation, explicitly and implicitly, is hard to tell  I think the Chairman mentioned yesterday           September 22–23, 2009 116 of 212  this odd constellation of market signals since we last met as a Committee—stock prices are up,   bond yields are down, Treasury yields are down, the foreign exchange value of the dollar is   down, commodity prices are up That is hard for me to reconcile I could tell a long and twisted   story, but it’s not a terribly convincing one, and it would certainly be nothing more than a   rationalization   But let me start on the simplest pieces of it, and those are stocks and bonds  Why are   they both performing as smartly?  I would say markets might be at a transitional point—some   kind of barbell—and thinking about asset allocation  They’ve seen equity markets move against   them, they’re looking for alpha, they’re looking for returns, and so they’re going out and buying   equities But just in case they’re wrong, they want to make sure that they hold on to enough   cash—which is near and dear to their hearts—so that if the world were to somehow end again,   they would have that Intermediate risks and intermediate credits seem to me to be looked upon   somewhat more negatively by marginal investors   My last point on financial markets is on Treasury and Treasury market signals and what   they’re telling us They do seem to be incredibly supportive of massive issuance  It reminds me   in some ways of risk measures, where risk is highest when measures of risk are actually lowest    The Treasury markets seem to be telling us that the supply will have infinite demand, but that   should make us nervous  It does strike me that the Treasury market won’t get slowly but surely   uncomfortable with these debt-to-GDP ratios, but rather that it might come in a hurry  If it does,   I think the consequences, both for the real economy and the challenges we face in monetary   policy, will become quite remarkable   Now, when might that moment come?  I don’t know  But I would say that the debt-limit   issue that the Congress and the Administration will be debating, most likely over the course of     September 22–23, 2009 117 of 212  November, might well be that catalyst  This debt-limit discussion has had a partisan nature to it   going back about 20 to 25 years, but I wonder whether or not there is just enough in the air about   fiscal sustainability that we should pay particular attention to what the Treasury markets are   telling us in the forthcoming period   Finally, on inflation, I have to agree with the emerging consensus among many folks in   this room about the pressure on wages, given various measures of slack  Going against that   theme, though, it does strike me that if the dollar continues to weaken against foreign currencies,   and, for whatever reason, whether because of global final demand or something else,   commodities continue to strengthen, these crosscurrents will be hitting each other  How they net   out for measures of inflation and inflation expectations strikes me as a paramount challenge for   policymaking  Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll support alternative B with some   suggestions, but I’ll confine most of my remarks to the mortgage markets  Let me begin by   talking about this odd market dynamic, which, I think, is leading to much of the discussion   around the table The mortgage market strikes me as neither particularly sustainable in its   current form nor two-sided, in the sense of matching private parties who meet at some market   clearing price And the blame for that is not even predominantly because of the Federal   Reserve’s role in the market     When I think about the mortgage market ecosystem, I break it into three parts  The   mortgage origination market, even dominated by three or four banks with different degrees of   implicit and explicit support, is by far and away the most competitive market in this ecosystem   compared with what I’m going to talk about next  In between the originators and the holders of   these portfolios, we have this odd duopoly of government guarantors that are now competing   with a new entity, the Federal Housing Administration, all of whom have confused and   overlapping objective functions and confused exit regimes  They can’t say what they’re solving   for, whether it’s minimizing draws from Treasury, maximizing the support of Congress, or        September 22–23, 2009 167 of 212  minimizing or changing the number of folks that go into foreclosure; the guarantors are in   between this bizarre group of mortgage originators and buyers  And who are the buyers?  Well,   the buyers are us, that is, the Federal Reserve, the Treasury Department, and Fannie and Freddie,   who have mixed views about whether they’re also going to be portfolio buyers of whole   mortgages or mortgage-backed securities  Taking all this together, I think we shouldn’t be   surprised that we’re having a hard time figuring out what the incremental change in spreads   would be based on whether we do “up to” or not “up to” at various sizes   All of these pieces are subject to debate  Markets are trying to figure out who’s going to   do what to whom and what the consequences of this bizarre ecosystem are, and noting that this   market is not clearing in any effective way  I would say again that we have participated in but   are not predominant in that rather unfavorable diagnosis   In light of that dynamic and what’s in the realm of the possible, we can talk about losses   on our portfolio, and we can talk about complications for the exit strategy  But I think, as one of   the prior speakers made clear, that, for the purposes of this discussion, we can stipulate that we   can and will figure it out I have great confidence in that   It strikes me that the central question is  What can we do to provide whatever help is in   the realm of the possible to this targeted mortgage market?  I think it’s likely that, given the   uncertainties that we’ve all spoken about regarding the real economy and financial markets in   2010, we’re going to have to provide support as best we can throughout much of the year  This   isn’t support such that we say, “Boy, once we’re done with the first quarter, all will be rosy   thereafter” As a way to frame what the operative choices are in front of us, I ask myself  What   is most conducive to bringing private buyers back into this confused market in as seamless a way   as possible?  Now, we shouldn’t be surprised that markets want more  Again, I said this with                 September 22–23, 2009 168 of 212  Treasuries, and it’s equally true here because we’re doing more  They want more purchases,   more certainty, more commitment, and I think that that is as expected  What should we want?  I   think we should be solving for bringing real investors back into this market to give it any chance   of pricing mortgages at rates that are conducive to recovery  So I think that brings us to the   operative questions mostly in paragraph 3   With respect to the “up to” language, I learned from one of you that, in the academy, they   say the debates are so angry because the stakes are so small  I think that’s true on the “up to”   language here Markets expect we’re going to do $125 trillion  If we leave “up to” in there,   they’re going to expect it, and if we take it out, they expect it, so I can’t get all that energized   over where to cast my vote in this very close call  Because they already expect we’re going to do   the whole thing and because we are reasonably comfortable with the progress from the last   FOMC meeting to this one, I would have a mild preference for leaving “up to” in there, and I   think that the differences in market practicality here are really quite small   What about the timing?  When should we end this or complete this exercise?  I am   generally in the category of flexibility, given these uncertainties, but taken to its extreme, I think   the flexibility would give not only the Desk some concerns about what exactly they’re solving   for, but also the markets  Therefore, while I’m sympathetic to the idea of extending this out, in   general I think if we want market investors to get back in and to prepare to get back in, we   should tell them when we’re planning on exiting this thing, because I think we’re going to have   cliff effects at any point that we complete these purchases  I suspect that we should give them as   much notice as possible  My preference, as a result, would be to say that we are going to   complete or execute this by the end of the second quarter of 2010, giving full warning to them   and to all of us about how to proceed        September 22–23, 2009 169 of 212  As a final comment, Mr Chairman, on the agency debt, I think the staff has been   incredibly up front with us that we’re really making that market even harder to operate   effectively  I think the benefits that we are drawing from continuing to be in that market are   particularly limited, if not zero  So if I had the pen, I would actually end the increases in the   agency debt side I don’t think that’s the center of consensus around the table  So just to be   practical, you can leave that as “up to” as well  Thank you      Sure Let me just add to what sounds like maybe a growing chorus on   the currency swaps  I certainly favor the currency swaps  With the four central banks, in terms     November 3–4, 2009 40 of 201  of the size, it strikes me that it should be just big enough to be a useful, well-practiced engine on   both sides And frankly, I don’t know whether it needs to be as big as in the proposal to   accomplish that objective  If we found ourselves in a crisis, we could always amplify those to a   greater extent So in some ways I wonder whether the numbers that were proposed were, in an   ambiguous world, large enough that it is certainly more than some kind of testing program but   not large enough to make a huge difference in the context of a global financial panic  I don’t   have better numbers in mind, but I think the idea of being operational with those four makes   sense   With respect to the NAFA issue, I think it would probably make the most sense for us to   let the temporary swaps extinguish on their own accord in February and put the new swaps in   accord with the four, and then sometime later, after we are done hearing pleadings from the   Singaporeans and the Koreans, then decide what we want to do in the context of this NAFA   piece But I wouldn’t want to conflate that issue with the swap line because that in some ways   begs the question, with the Koreans in particular, from whom we hear quite a bit   With respect to the reverse repo issue and the small banks, I guess this is really a question   for Chris Burke and for Bill Dudley and the team, which is, Would there be a large financial   institution that would be willing to do the work on this for us?  To see whether they would be   responsible, for a fee, for aggregating the small institutions, verifying their interest in whether   they, in aggregate, could be of some real use, given what we are trying to accomplish  Because   if I think about the relative scarcity of our resources, it could potentially be a good piece of   business for someone, and that someone might not be us     Thank you, Mr Chairman  As I said when we last met, I expected more   strength in the next couple of quarters than in the next couple of years, and I still believe that  I’m   skeptical of linear improvements that are outlined in the Greenbook in a world that looks as though   it is filled with all sorts of nonlinear risks  The extraordinary stimulus from public authorities—                           November 3–4, 2009 105 of 201  fiscal, monetary, and other—and the even more extraordinary run in financial markets have   substantially improved the likely arithmetic of GDP in the next couple of quarters  But if we don’t   see more-impressive signs of improved income and jobs and more impressive signs of business   fixed investment—particularly now when market-induced stimulus, government-induced stimulus,   and a cyclical improvement in the economy are peaking—then I have to admit to being more   cautious about growth prospects in the second half of 2010 and in 2011   Let me spend a little time on the real economy and then turn to financial markets and   financial institutions and maybe a last word on inflation  On the real economy, obviously, as many   of you have discussed, the data are mixed but trending toward recovering, but it still looks like a   subpar recovery  I continue to think that we should be seeing more-substantial improvement sooner   in order to get more comfortable that we have a durable recovery at hand  I am not as persuaded as   the Greenbook forecast suggests that the handoff from the public sector to the private sector will   happen as seamlessly or as steadily as predicted  Now, there is certainly plenty of good news that   we can talk about  The Fortune 500 nonfinancials are in great shape  strong balance sheets; better   position coming out of this recession than in the last two, for certain; highly productive, significant   operating leverage; and still awaiting top-line growth, and if it comes, that would have a huge   impact on their willingness to invest   The ISM and other surveys show manufacturing improving with inventories rebuilding  But   on the other side, real incomes are still declining even as PCE was bolstered by car and housing   subsidies The job engine to me looks stalled or maybe worse, and global trade appears to me still   years away from reaching its prior peak  And we are still seeing constrained credit availability to   small businesses and households, as Governor Kohn talked about, and little impetus for increases in   business fixed investment                             November 3–4, 2009 106 of 201  It is normally the case that improvements in share prices drive CEOs to be much more   forward leaning on cap-ex than they appear to be at the present time  And now when I talk about   financial markets, I would suggest that the Greenbook supposition, which I think is right—which is   that further improvements in the real economy are contingent on further improvements in financial   markets—looks to me to be anything but a sure bet  I think the schizophrenia that we have seen in   the markets, particularly in the last couple of weeks, with preoccupation with one issue one day and   with another issue the next day reminds us that the revaluation process of every asset everywhere in   the world is still incomplete  I try not to over-read or under-read what financial markets have been   telling us in the last couple of weeks  One over-read of this new move down in markets and   increased volatility is that, “Oh, you know, the markets got ahead of themselves and there is a big   correction in front of us”  To under-read it would say, “Well, markets go up and markets go down,   and there’s not much to worry about”   My own sense is that we’re probably in a new phase in financial market developments    Financial market improvements from here will be more driven by policy and by economic   fundamentals and less driven by the kind of asset reallocations that we’ve seen and the catching-up   by active investors who are trying to catch up with indexes  The one-way upward move by   financial markets from March lows in all likelihood looks substantially complete both in the United   States and elsewhere  It is hard to predict where these markets will go, but I would suggest that real   economic fundamentals and the contour of public policies will probably knock these markets   around for a while, and so I am hesitant to suggest that the next several months will look as   satisfying as the last several months in these markets   At the time of the last FOMC, I said that markets were nondistinguishing—they were   willing to fund virtually all issuers throughout the world—that the openness in these markets was                    November 3–4, 2009 107 of 201  remarkable, and that those issuers that took advantage would be quite fortunate  I said that others   will regret standing on the sidelines  From the March lows until the last FOMC meeting, we saw a   $4 trillion increase in the value of publicly traded US assets  That is of significant consequence to   the real economy and could help and is helping offset weak incomes  I think the next $4 trillion will   be a lot harder to come by   We can no longer count on the “melting-up” in these markets to do the hard work of helping   repair balance sheets of financial institutions and households  Still, in all likelihood in this move up,   the first $4 trillion is likely to stick around for a while  So I don’t want to suggest that we’re not   going to get ongoing benefits, but I do think that the financial market trajectory is likely to get   tougher I am a little disappointed that this move in these asset prices hasn’t done more to help the   real economy get back on its front foot  I’m a little disappointed that it hasn’t helped durable final   demand  And I think the fourth-quarter data will be very instructive  If the fourth-quarter GDP   arithmetic still shows an incredible reliance on government-induced stimulus, even after this rally,   then again, I hesitate about how optimistic to be on projections in the outyears   The haves and have-nots in financial markets are likely to be more obvious in the weeks and   months ahead  As Brian Sack said in his introduction, this change in market sentiment, this   retrenchment, is probably healthy for the long term; but the increasing gloss of asset values will   wear thin, and broken business models and underachievement by many firms may be met with a   skeptical, even punitive, eye by market participants  And we are likely to see a change in   correlation among asset prices that was confounding many of us when we last met   Let me turn finally to financial institutions and then a brief word on inflation  The global   financial architecture remains unclear  Impediments to financial institutions’ getting back to the   business of banking are meaningful  What we are seeing in some parts of the world, particularly                        November 3–4, 2009 108 of 201  Europe and the United Kingdom, are discussions both at the behest of governments and in some   cases at the behest of shareholders to decide whether some of these large financial institutions   should be broken up  In the United States, neither markets nor most government actors are   demanding resizing or rescoping of large financial institutions  But as we approach an even-  numbered year, an election year in Washington, I will be surprised if there isn’t more scrutiny   around that deconglomeration hypothesis  In the near term, equity and credit markets are likely to   be more distinguishing, as I mentioned, and there is great interest in providing capital to these   financial institutions so long as the capital is in the last round  The success of US banks in funding   themselves is really about convincing markets that this is the last equity raise they’ll need to do, and   the extent to which they can pull that off or not strikes me as more challenging than it was six weeks   ago   On the inflation front, the weakness on the real side of the economy is certainly driving   wages down, is certainly having an impact on what we’re seeing from our inflation readings, both   recent and going forward  This change in wage–price levels, however, may be partially offset by   relatively higher import prices, including year-over-year increases in energy and other commodities    I think we have a natural experiment that is likely to confront us in the upcoming couple of quarters,   and it will be important to gauge whether changes in headline prices due in part to rises in energy   and other commodity costs at a time of large central bank balances, at a time of an unsustainable   fiscal picture, and at a time of debt limit discussions that are likely to preoccupy the floor of the US   Senate, whether all of that in a natural experiment finds its way into core prices or affects broader   measures of inflation expectations  So I think we might have a good look on whether headline   prices somehow converge to core or whether core drifts toward headline  I think that will be an              November 3–4, 2009 109 of 201  interesting point of contact for us to think about the risks to the inflation outlook going forward    Thank you       Thank you, Mr Chairman  Let me talk about two things with respect to   policy first, the mortgage-backed securities, which have been much discussed, and second, the   third paragraph and the suggestions therein  First, on the MBS—no surprise  I’m pleased that   we’re ending and announcing the end of our purchases with respect to both MBS and agency debt    On the agency debt side, I don’t think it’s likely to be misunderstood or misinterpreted, but back-  channel communications there could be constructive  With respect to the mortgage-backed   securities, I think we may well have overstayed and outstayed our welcome, but at least providing   clarity that we are at this moment completing our purchases early next year is useful  It may turn   out that rates move even over the intermeeting period, as Brian Sack and Bill Dudley suggested, in   anticipation of the end of that program  I think they are anticipating some move, and from our   perspective, it’s okay It will be interesting to see what the fiscal and political authorities think   about our comfort with that move in thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages and what sorts of responses                       November 3–4, 2009 162 of 201  they either ask of us or ask of themselves there  As I think we all know, the form and function of   the GSEs is likely to get more attention come next year   The exit problems that we’re talking about with respect to mortgage-backed securities   factored into some of our thinking about the purchases after these markets started functioning  I   guess you should add me to the camp of those who are certainly open minded and even forward   leaning about thinking about the net benefits of bringing some liquidity and duration back to those   markets at the appropriate time, which is not now  And Mr Chairman, I think it is at least as   important that we don’t signal that $1 trillion or $125 trillion of MBS are permanently off the   market  I think that is likely to be unconstructive and restricting of our options going forward if   markets come to that view  So not only for our own internal purposes of thinking about it but also   given the uncertainties about the mortgage finance market, I think making sure that’s one of a   number of alternatives that we talk about more publicly at this point would be useful   Turning to policy in the third paragraph, I think that the additions and the “including” phrase   are actually quite useful They amplify the conditions that underscore our condition-dependent   forecast I noted and giggled like many of you when Brian showed the number of speeches by   FOMC members in this intermeeting period, and I guess I’d make a couple notes about it  First, I   saw remarkable accord then and, frankly, around this table about the conduct of policy  I think,   with the exception of the President who represents the Game 6 loser of the World Series,   [laughter]—      —that there is at least to this point remarkable accord that rates are low and   will need to stay very low for quite some time  I’d say that there’s a second bit of agreement among   those thirty speeches and that is that we are all very humble about what the risks of that forecast are,                          November 3–4, 2009 163 of 201  very humble and uncertain about the 2010–11 forecast  Where there are differences, they are over   what we think the risks are when we get ready to change regimes  What are the risks on the   inflation front or on the output front or some other exogenous variable?  And I’ve been impressed   by the markets through these 30 speeches  Markets did not bring forward, not even a little bit, the   time at which policy could become less accommodative     What did we see though?  Markets became less certain about the degree of what that move   might be, and I think in some ways their variance on the speed of that policy accommodation   matches at least what I’ve heard today  I don’t view that as a troubling development at all  I think   what we’re doing in amplifying the economic conditions and referencing utilization, inflation   trends, and inflation expectations is making very clear to them that those are uncertainties of ours   and theirs, and we aren’t trying to prejudge what their own judgments on those should be  So I   think that the market for information is improving and will be improved by our being just a little   more explicit on those fronts, and I think that variance is, frankly, quite a useful thing   With respect to the question of whether we should use the word “including,” I do think it’s   useful  While everything, I suppose, could be reduced to these three phrases that speak to our dual   mandate, I wouldn’t want markets to have the impression that we are immune to what could be   going on in the world geopolitically with respect to the foreign exchange value of the dollar or with   respect to asset prices  So I think it is credibility enhancing to suggest that we understand the   uncertainties in this world, and I would strongly support including it  I don’t think that by using the   word “including” we’re suggesting there is some secret condition that we are hiding from their   view  It’s just acknowledging those uncertainties  With that, I support alternative B as drafted    While I think it will get a reasonable amount of attention on these three phases, I consider it                     November 3–4, 2009 164 of 201  consistent with intermeeting speeches and also consistent with the discussions we’ve had today    Thank you      Second     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Let me spend most of my time on financial   markets, with just a few words on the real economy, which I think are consistent with many of   yours At the last couple of FOMC meetings I, like several of you, argued that the next few   quarters were going to be considerably stronger than the next few years  I think we finally have   some data that bear that out  First, the remarkable melting up in credit and financial markets,   which we have all been noting for quite some time, seems to be doing remarkable things to help   get this economy going over the near term  Second, is the jobs front, which President Yellen and   many of you talked about  I think the job creation story is both a function of near-term prospects   and medium-term prospects, and if medium-term prospects are as uncertain as many of us have   described, then we should not be so surprised that the job engine is—“effectively dead” perhaps   overstates—effectively impaired for some time   While it’s difficult not to see some good news in the most recent labor market prints and   unemployment prints, let me try  Firings have certainly leveled out, but I do think what’s   happening on the small business stuff is more than just politicians approaching even-numbered           December 15–16, 2009 82 of 247  years—it does appear to be much more substantial than that  And the probability, as President   Yellen said, that workers who lose jobs will spend more time out of work and the harm that   could be doing to a generation of underemployed workers early in their careers strikes me as   something that could well be structural and a cause for real concern   I remain concerned about other possible outcomes to the real economy in late 2010 and   beyond While the productivity surge has been more impressive than I thought it would be, it’s   hard to know how much of these improvements are cyclical and how much of them are structural   and enduring Historically, early-stage spurts in productivity have been followed by rising   unemployment, but maybe this time it’s different  Maybe, amid the range of uncertainties,   employment and even hours worked may be slower to rebound, which could extend the period of   strong productivity gains and productivity-driven growth without doing much to make us feel   much better about the labor market situation   On the financial market side, let me make reference to three themes  At the last FOMC   meeting, I think, we discussed the fact that the financial markets seem to be nearing an important   inflection point with some real possible impacts on the broad economy  So key theme number   one Is Dubai really about Dubai, and Greece really about Greece?  I think there are dozens of   Dubais out there, that is, entities with the implicit support of their sovereigns, and I think the   relevant question is Are the expected consolidated debt-to-GDP ratios consistent or inconsistent   with current funding costs?  Markets for now seem to be largely comfortable with sovereign   credits generally and with sovereign support of off-balance-sheet liabilities  Think of Abu Dhabi   and Dubai, think of the EU and Greece, and there are very few spillovers across markets  CDS   for some of the sovereigns, as Brian mentioned at the outset, seem to be moving a bit, but I think   we should be extremely worried about some nonlinear moves  So I am skeptical that the current     December 15–16, 2009 83 of 247  comfort in financial markets will hold  Bond market prices globally may be masking disturbing   trends, and, while the official statistics on government debt-to-GDP ratios and associated   measures of liabilities are growing, if we added these implicit liabilities, the numbers really   could be quite staggering   Think about the US circumstance  If we added the liabilities of Fannie and Freddie to   the debt-to-GDP ratio here, our sovereign debt-to-GDP would double overnight  Then if you go   out into the medium term, the numbers become even more alarming  I don’t mean to take us   back to the early days of the panic, but what if markets come to think of these off-balance-sheet   liabilities as the SIVs off-balance-sheet entities, but this time of the official sector?  The average   terms of many sovereigns’ funding, including our Treasury, have shortened throughout much of   2009, and the problems of maturity mismatch are not unique to the private sector or unique to the   US government  So I wonder whether governments are properly gauging their true medium-  term costs of funding; and if complacency is, in fact, finding its way into financial markets, we   cannot discount the prospect of some of these nonlinear outcomes in the financial markets, which   would certainly do great harm to the economy   Key theme number two, old money chasing old products  So what’s that reference?  It   looks to me as though what we are seeing in asset allocation is fund flows coming out of the   money market and money market mutual funds and other assets that are yielding close to   nothing, investors that are tired of earning zero as they see markets melting up around them, and   they are investing that in assets  But most of these assets are not new assets  There’s not a   tremendous supply of new issuance coming to market—frankly, there’s less new supply than I   would have thought Brian talked about the new supply of mortgage-backed securities being   relatively scant  I think that is true across a range of markets  In some ways, we are seeing older     December 15–16, 2009 84 of 247  vintages of assets getting bid up  If I compare the refrains from the recent boom in asset prices   with current conditions, we can all remember a couple of years ago folks showing up and saying,   “I have got $3,000 to pay for my mortgage payment this month  How much house can I get?”    The 2009–2010 version of that is an investor showing up and saying, “I need LIBOR plus 400    What am I buying today?” So I would prefer, in general, to be seeing new money evaluating new   products rather than old money chasing old products, but I think that’s a sense of where we are   But all my themes aren’t negative  So let me leave with a final positive theme in   financial markets  As Brian said at the outset, we have seen a couple of differing moves both in   the foreign exchange value of the dollar and in commodity prices  We saw this one-way bet on   dollar and commodity prices, a weaker dollar, higher gold, higher metals, for much of the   intermeeting period, but it has reversed over the course of the last ten days or so  I happen to   think that reversal is healthy  I happen to think that a two-way market across these key asset   classes is probably a good thing A stronger dollar, commodities a bit weaker in the last ten   days, and reaction to recent stronger data in the US on payrolls and consumer spending, and   more worries about European prospects tell me these markets are acting a little bit more as we   had long thought they would  They seem somewhat healthier in responding to relative growth   rates and expectations of relative rate differentials, with the US, frankly, standing up relatively   favorably against the UK and the European Union  Before the last 10 days, many of these   commodities were near multidecade highs  Risks of one-way bets and even bubble conditions in   certain assets, as a result, may be mitigated if what we’re seeing is something more than a head   fake I think those trends on the dollar and commodities are important to watch  I think they   likely offer an important view on what happens to inflation expectations going forward  Thank   you, Mr Chairman        December 15–16, 2009 85 of 247    A little extra pressure for your pithy summary of yesterday’s discussion    [Laughter]     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Four quick points  First, I support alternative   B with the Fisher-Kohn amendment about the reluctance by businesses to add head count  While   I’m sympathetic to the views President Lacker described on the incremental net benefits of our   MBS purchases, which I have discussed for some time, we’ve now said that we were going to do   it, and there’s nothing that we’ve learned between the last meeting and this meeting that would   cause me to say that now is the right time to say, “Just kidding”  So I think we should live up to   what we said, because it would be, I think, a confusing retrenchment to go back to a smaller   purchase level, even though, as a first impression many months ago, I would have been   sympathetic to that view   Second, I support ending the existing liquidity facilities, and I guess I’m of the view that   we shouldn’t relegate that to a separate statement  We should make it a virtue  We put these   facilities in place They did all that we expected them to do and probably more  They’ve served   their purpose It is time for them to move on, and I think we shouldn’t be sheepish about that  I   take that last line as seriously, I think, as President Yellen does  When we say that we’re   “prepared to modify,” I don’t think that’s boilerplate at all  I think that says we’re still very   attentive to what’s going on So, with respect to TALF or any other facilities, we need to be   more aggressive as the financial conditions and economic conditions warrant  I think we’re   prepared to do so, but I don’t think we should shy away from that       December 15–16, 2009 129 of 247  Third, on the question about the language around the purchases of securities, I’d like to   make two points on what President Kocherlakota said  First, I just like saying that,   “Kocherlakota”  [Laughter] By next meeting I will be able to say the whole name without—    So that’s my first highly value-added point on the suggestion  My second is that I think we   should think about how to describe this mix of redemptions and purchases  I’m not sure this is   the right moment, but I think he does spark a pretty interesting thought  And just one other word   for consideration if we take this discussion up in January, rather than choosing purchases or   holdings, I wonder whether “portfolio” is better “Portfolio” takes into account that mix of what   you might be adding and what you might be subtracting—it has an allocation point associated   with it So I don’t know the perfect words, but I think it’s an interesting discussion   And finally, I support Brian Sack’s recommendation on the runoff of MBS as an interim   solution I think it might be an interim solution that, at least in my eyes, lasts for more than this   intermeeting period, but at least for now, I think that’s a prudent idea  Thank you      Second     Second     Second     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Brian, when looking at the spreads in charts   15 and 16 that we’ve been talking about, MBS and agencies, we can tell a bunch of different   stories in explaining why these spreads continue to tighten even as the tapering is going on  I   wonder what the spreads are for Federal Home Loan Bank paper or Farmer Mac paper as   securities where the government is most certainly involved and which have different degrees of   explicit or implicit support but where the Fed is less involved  I wonder if there were any   lessons learned from a comparison of Fannie and Freddie paper to those or any other sort of   quasi public-backed entities     Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  First, on the housekeeping items, on the   discount window, I share the consensus that most have spoken about  I think markets will   perceive that a bit as though it is a FIFO—first-in, first-out—issue  We will have to   communicate what it means, which is to say that, in spite of our best efforts to separate liquidity   policy and monetary policy, I still think that market participants are going to view this, rightly or   January 26–27, 2010 82 of 260    wrongly, in the eyes of people around the table to be a next and meaningful step  So we just   need to judge accordingly  On the TAF recommendation, I concur   In terms of the broader strategies for removing accommodation, Mr Chairman, let me   cherry-pick a couple of goals that have been described today, both in the materials and at the   table  In a time when there is a tremendous amount of policy uncertainty here in town broadly   and the economy has a lot of uncertainty, I am more attracted to policy prescriptions that provide   as much clarity as soon as we can so that we aren’t adding to that uncertainty  I think of our   preeminent goals here as ensuring our credibility so that  we can increase control and the   perception of control over policy rates; we can be perceived to be able to effectively tighten   financial conditions; and we can find our way back to a balance sheet and a regime that preceded   this crisis  Those are difficult, and there are tradeoffs  But those are my priorities in terms of   goals   In terms of overall disposition, in which I think the memos really rang true—and I think   the memos, at least for me, were particularly useful in being very explicit about what we know   and what we don’t know  that is, the substitutability between our balance sheet and short-term   rates is imperfect  The ambiguity of what we were buying when we were buying these long-term   assets, ambiguity on what we are buying when we reduce them, suggests to me that it is not a   dimmer switch that we are controlling well but more like an on/off switch made with a couple of   levers  But we are not as certain as possible on that  So if you take that disposition when   conducting policy, I think we have to err on the side of mitigating that ambiguity as much as   practicable for reasons of our own credibility and effectiveness  That prejudices me to want to   shrink reserves somewhat sooner and with more force than redemptions alone would allow, so   that when we move our policy rate we are more confident as to its effects   January 26–27, 2010 83 of 260    With respect to asset sales, I obviously wasn’t crazy about the purchase of the last several   hundred billion of them  So, at some level, I would be thrilled just to exit them quickly and with   force  But I am reminded of that brokerage firm commercial, I think from President Bullard’s   home state, where the fellow buys the piece of art and then immediately sells it  [Laughter]  And   I think the policy reaction function, if we were to exit with any dramatic swiftness after this huge   increase, would suggest that the policy process seems confused and confusing  So as attractive   as that might be, and hasty, I think it is probably not the best course forward  I think a more   reasonable course forward is to begin sales in the second half of this year as a supplement to our   redemptions, by which we would pre-commit to modest levels of sales that could grow over   time, perhaps along the lines of what Narayana suggested  But I think an important distinction   for certainty is that it would be the baseline forecast  There would be a high but rebuttable   presumption that the sales under that forecast could change over time, but I think that would   bring clarity in the mortgage finance markets and clarity in terms of the size of our balance sheet    It seems uncomfortable to me that the balance sheet would shrink simply by the rate at which   redemptions and prepayments come in on the mortgage-backed securities portfolio  It doesn’t   seem to me to be a pro-active way of making policy     With respect to redemptions more broadly, I would redeem all agency and MBS and   some of the Treasuries  On the sequencing question, I favor the ex ante strategy—that is, I   recommend using these tools prior to an increase in the interest rate on excess reserves  I think it   is useful on the inflation expectations questions that continue to be alive and well  And it   certainly does raise a communications challenge, but I think it is one that we can deal with   January 26–27, 2010 84 of 260    On the question of volume, Mr Chairman, I must say I don’t really have a magic number    But I would be inclined to push down excess reserves so we can be more effective when we   decide we have to make more-meaningful steps to remove policy accommodation   On the question of the long-run balance sheet in the steady state, I think we should “try to   go home again”  It is difficult, but I think that we should try to, and I think we should be pretty   explicit publicly about that desire  I am concerned about the efficacy of our operating target  I   think it is useful to have a market interest rate as an operating target  I am not wed to the federal   funds rate per se but don’t yet see a suitable alternative   And on your final question with respect to the long-run operating framework, I don’t   think we need to come out with a grand design  So what I’m suggesting is that we need to   provide clarity and not be a source of policy uncertainty  But I think from your first op-ed piece   in which you outlined an exit strategy, we have pretty smartly gone through the liquidity   facilities  I think we are smartly now going through the next of these  I don’t mean to suggest   that we should unwrap the final game plan until we are totally complete with it, but I think this   next chapter over probably the next two meetings will be useful, so that our credibility on exit   will be superior and will continue to give us the benefit of the doubt as we move forward through   what is no doubt going to be a tough economic environment  Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I am going to try to answer two questions in   my discussion today  One is a familiar one  What is the most significant development since we   last met?  And the second is, Who knew free money would be so popular?  [Laughter]   So I stared at my screen and tried to answer that first question on the most significant   development since we last met, and Don, as usual, stole my homework assignment  The most   significant development is Washington  The most significant development is the path and   variance around policy in the intermeeting period with, I think, very real consequences for the   real economy  The negative feedback loop afflicts the political economy much as it afflicts the   real economy  It is said in Washington that even-numbered years, of which we are now early in   one, bring strange things, and 2010 is proving to be persuasive evidence for that old maxim  I’m   not making a statement principally about policy direction  I’m making a statement here   principally about policy variance  I’m also not making a statement about gridlock, which tends   not to be terribly bad news generally for real economies or financial markets  But I am talking   about a variance in policies that can be extremely harmful   January 26–27, 2010 153 of 260    I would underscore the reason for concern here with two emphases  One, particularly   now when the economy is at this transitional point, if the Greenbook forecast is right and the   baton is passed ably from the public sector to the private sector, we shouldn’t be surprised that   this is a time of Washington policy variance  But I think it’s maybe more important than ever    The second reason for heightened concern is that Washington has positioned itself so centrally in   this narrative that the heightened policy variance is bound to retard the natural recovery in   growth and employment even more than usual  We say around this table often that policy needs   to be anchored, and the reaction function of policymakers needs to be clearly understood for   policy to be effective  Well, that’s not unique to monetary policy, and there are real implications   of this kind of variance for regulatory policy, fiscal policy, and trade policy  And in that I would   reference what Governor Kohn said about the state of policies everywhere else around the world    All of this, I think, makes the job ahead for us in predicting the turn in the real economy and the   inflation prospects very significant  So let me give a couple of examples     First, regulatory policy, which again Don referenced  Without assigning particular merit   to policy proposals, the changing goalposts of what is being billed as comprehensive,   fundamental regulatory reform strike me as not helpful to the financial architecture  Financial   firms, perhaps more than other sectors, need policy to be anchored  This may be even more   important than that it’s optimally decided  And if the credit channel to small businesses, which   is going to be so important for job creation, is having a harder time taking advantage of highly   accommodative policies and putting them into action, we run grave risks of delaying the onset of   meaningful job growth in the recovery  Over the medium term this could lead to a higher   NAIRU if uncertainty drives more-persistent structural unemployment, but I think in the short   term it could really have grave risks for the transition happening in the real economy   January 26–27, 2010 154 of 260    Second, let me turn to fiscal policy and the questions of variance  Market participants   appear to be every bit reevaluating sovereign risks across a number of countries  The recognition   of large off-balance-sheet, contingent liabilities could make ratios of official debt to GDP move   higher virtually overnight  Now, recognizing that this is arithmetic, these off-balance-sheet   liabilities—whether you’re thinking in the United States of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac or   you’re thinking of the European Union of what would happen if Greece weren’t to do the right   things—markets could come to view sovereign risks differently  I suspect that sovereign debt   markets are likely to be subjected to higher volatility until policy questions are answered, and the   potential for nonlinear outcomes is real  As I have said before, if Dubai is about Dubai, and   Greece is about Greece, and Fannie and Freddie are about Fannie and Freddie, then we have   nothing to worry about   Okay  The second question—Who knew that free money would be so popular?  I’ll talk   about two things  financial markets and inflation  If you think broadly about the intermeeting   period—and maybe I would have to except the last week or two, when financial market prices   seem to have leveled out and fallen and seem to have become a little more discriminating, which   is generally a good thing—it still looks as though high-yield and leveraged-loan spreads and   credit spreads generally continue to trend lower  Volatility measures are up since we last met, so   that if you look at the VIX and at some measures of volatility in the credit markets, I think there   is further upside risk in the volatility of asset prices separate and apart from what their actual   levels ought to be, which has caused me to further mark down my estimates of GDP and   employment growth in the forecast period   What about inflation prospects?  I think I share what I have heard to be a bit of an   emerging and concerning consensus  That is, while I would note personally that the dollar sank   January 26–27, 2010 155 of 260    relative to the euro, dollar stability broadly against foreign currencies is an encouraging sign and   should help mitigate some of the trends on import prices, but it’s hard for me to ignore the move   in nonfuel commodity prices, and it bears watching much as others have said  The trend of some   of these inflation measures, particularly in a constellation of policy uncertainty around fiscal   policy here and everywhere around the world and the misperception that somehow this policy   uncertainty will affect the Federal Reserve, which is something that I think all of us will fight   vigorously against, does raise the question about inflation expectations and puts a special burden   on all of us  If policy rates were to stay as accommodative as the Greenbook suggests, given   these policy uncertainties, I would be surprised if inflation and inflation expectations stayed at   levels consistent with price stability in the forecast period  Thank you     Thanks, Mr Chairman  Bill, one question on paragraph 2, the inflation   paragraph  What do you think is the difference in the language that is proposed in alternative B,   “inflation is likely to be subdued,” versus the language I think we used for a while “expects,”   “inflation is expected to be subdued”?  Is that supposed to be revealing a little less certainty, or is   that thought to be consistent?     Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Though to much derision, I recall someone in   Washington saying that you go to war with the army you’ve got, not the army you want  Maybe   the same is true of statements  [Laughter]  So that should maybe govern a bit of our thinking   After lecturing in a prior round about policy certainty, I think it would be ill-timed for us   to drop in ideas on which we may well have begun a rigorous debate but not a debate that we   have sufficiently socialized  And that theory of the case I think will underscore some of my   January 26–27, 2010 194 of 260    comments  I think the point that Don was making earlier wasn’t that we are stuck with policy   inertia but that we are stuck with policies that we have been teaching markets about and we   should change our statement as facts change and our judgments change, but we shouldn’t be   perceived to be wandering too far from what they have been led to believe     On the inflation paragraph, I know people are pretty keen now to drop that first sentence,   and I think with understandable reasons  It might not be popular  I would actually tend to   broaden it and say, “Some commodity prices have risen in recent months,” and then end the   paragraph just as we have it  That is, an acknowledgement of facts that I believe have been the   case—Nathan can correct me on that—but show that we’re not overly troubled by it  It is just   along the lines of what we were trying to say on energy prices, but the facts changed on us on   recent trading days  So that would be one suggestion, Mr Chairman   On the purchases holdings question, I am as uncomfortable with our mortgage-backed   securities holdings, purchases, whatever they’re called, as anybody in the room  I think the   minutes are likely to do a pretty good job of starting to socialize the debate that we had   yesterday  I think changing that word at a time like this is likely to be saying both too little and   too much, and I would rather it come to the fore through minutes and through discussions that   are held more publicly  So I think “purchases,” because I think it’s factually accurate now,   might be relevant, and at our next meeting we can get into whether “holdings” or “portfolio”   might better reference what we are intending to do   With respect to the TAF, I think, again, that facts have continued to evolve in a way that   we want, and so I like Bill English’s proposed suggestion, “The amounts provided under the   TAF are in the process of winding down,” and then we go through a recitation of the dates  I   think that is accurate, true  I would be fine saying, “And it is over” as a final statement, and that   January 26–27, 2010 195 of 260    should be the last auction  I don’t think that is so significant, but I would modify it, as Bill did,   “It is in the process of winding down,” which I think is one notch higher than what we had said   in the earlier statement   On the “extended period” language, sort of using the Rumsfeld reference, I would say   changing that now would be nuclear  It would be perceived to be not conventional arms, but a   clear signal  I suspect that conventional arms might be more useful, and the conventional arms   are through the unwinding of these facilities and through a broader discussion outside the   statement about various views on timing that we have  I would be more troubled by “extended   period” if markets’ expectations of policy looked more like the Japan curve than the curve for the   United States, the European Central Bank, and the Bank of England  So I don’t think markets   have misinterpreted that to be a permanent period at all  I think Charlie’s reference to six months   seems backed up by Eurodollar futures and other market prices  So I don’t think it seems overly   constraining, and I would rather work toward that objective than remove those words at present   One final word, Mr Chairman, on what has gotten some attention the last two days on   the survey question from New York to economists and others about what they think we’re going   to do  I don’t think this is a problem with the authors of the survey, but I think what we really   did was to give a bunch of people a take-home test, and it looks as though some of them passed   and some of them failed  What we are really interested in is, What do you think we should do?    What we are not as interested in, it strikes me, is, Based on the musings you have heard from   people around the table, how well did you follow that?  [Laughter]  So I don’t think that the   survey should be overly read, and I wouldn’t take that to mean that markets would be deeply   disturbed if we went with the reverse tapering  I think that survey might be proving a lot of   January 26–27, 2010 196 of 260    things, but it is not antithetical to the strategy that we might be converging on slowly after this   meeting  Thank you      Thank you  Two questions that I’ll pose as questions  [Laughter]  First,   on the RCAs, Jamie, if the intent of the statute from the Congress is that you can’t pay interest on   March 16, 2010 24 of 146    excess reserves to the GSEs and we design a product that effectively lets them get some piece of   that, is that consistent in the eyes of the working group with what the legislative directive is?     My second question is for Brian, and I should know the answer to it and   don’t  It’s about the CDS on New York and California, as an example  If states can’t go   bankrupt, what triggers the CDS contract?  Just nonpayment for a while?     Thank you   March 16, 2010 25 of 146      Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’m not from the south, and those from the   south had witty aphorisms to begin  I’m a Yankee, and I went to a public school in upstate New   York, and it was a rambunctious crowd at school  We were all bussed in from smaller towns to   go there  And so I can only begin by saying what the principal would say on the loudspeaker    March 16, 2010 70 of 146    After the Pledge of Allegiance he would tell us, “Don’t just say something—sit there”    [Laughter]  So let me try to accomplish that   I think there are a couple of differences in amplitude of concerns from when we last met,   though, like most of you, my modal forecast, which is a little less optimistic than the Greenbook,   still hasn’t changed much  So let me talk a little bit about those risks are, and then, second, I’ll   provide an obvious insight on the nature of this cyclical recovery   First, I think the European economic risks, as Nathan discussed, are rising as much as we   feared  The cyclical story there is not pretty—the recoveries are remarkably weak, even given   massive monetary stimulus  I think the near-term trends there are quite troubling  And potential   economic growth seems to be falling as well, with rising protectionism, political infighting, a   more fragile banking system than many in Europe may have been willing to admit during the   darkest days of our turmoil, perhaps a mistaken understanding of what ails their economy, and   further extensions of implicit guarantees, all of which have to be doing harm to their   productivity, their unemployment rate, and to their growth  I would say that Greece is indicative   of European troubles, not the source of European troubles  I take much less comfort than other   observers cited in the papers about these “successful debt offerings” from Greece due to its new   austerity program  For example, what if we said that there were successful bank offerings after   the TLGP came into being?  We’d say, “Well, there aren’t successful offerings by all these   banks  These are guarantees that the government put in place”  And if I look for new investors   in these so-called successful debt offerings, they’re almost impossible to find  The investors in   these offerings are the same large institutions that hold lots of old vintage paper who are buying   new vintage paper as if to protect the value of the old   March 16, 2010 71 of 146    I think the open question is  Will the whistle be blown on the strength of European   financial institutions, or won’t it?  I did share the conventional view that they might just be able   to pull it off with less capital than US financial institutions before the crisis and after  But, as   we learned in the US, once the pressures in markets build, it’s not obvious that you can get   away with disclosures that are not up to best practices around the world and to levels of capital,   which, I think on an apples-to-apples basis, look rather poor   The periphery, as staff here describes—Portugal, Italy, Spain, and Greece—looks to me   to be expanding  The Greek spreads are likely to stay elevated as issuance continues  Even   when these spreads come down, we see new sellers in that market, making it impossible for them   to come down on a dependable basis  So I don’t suspect that we’re going to see Greek spreads or   spreads of some of the other peripheral nations narrow too dramatically  There could be   narrowing, but it could happen because the German and French debt securities actually rise in   price   So European weakness, in general, is bad news for US prospects directly, and indirectly   I think there’s a real risk of some shock that could find its way into our economy  Markets in the   US somehow believe that these shocks are very much of a piece with the events of 2008 or   2009, and that those are behind us  I’m not convinced  If I look at 2010, I think there’s a risk of   some meaningful discontinuities  If you look at sovereign credits, currencies, political regimes,   there are plenty of sources of what could cause that  Take government borrowing, which looks   to be exploding in 2010  There should be somewhere between $3 and $4 trillion of new net   issuance from sovereigns this year  That’s three to four times the average of the level of issuance   from 2002 to 2008  I think the prospects of what could otherwise be dismissed as sloppy   auctions could end up leading markets to get much more concerned  Regarding US   March 16, 2010 72 of 146    relationships with our big trading partners, an important issue during a period of global   recession, I think they aren’t what they could be or should be  The greater rhetoric we’re hearing   from countries that are having their own domestic problems and trying to direct those at the US   speaks to some internal weaknesses that we shouldn’t take lightly  So a shock in the world this   year is more likely than markets expect, and I think such a shock is more likely to originate   outside the US than inside   Now to my second and final point, which is the cyclical recovery  It may just be that this   recovery is driven by big firms and not small  And the nature of the cyclical recovery might look   different from we’ve grown accustomed to, based on past recessions  Big firms look more   poised to lead, not lag  Big firms’ cap-ex seems to be improving smartly, more smartly than   smaller firms  February US tax revenues were up for the first time since April 2008—it’s hard   to get more detailed data, but it looks as if it’s largely due to large corporate profits  Big   business is leading small business on cap-ex and on confidence  One thing that’s harder for us to   wrestle with is the implication of that for the labor markets  It’s more likely that we’ll see   continued cyclical upsurge in productivity coming from these big firms than some robust change   in economic growth prospects  But this development of the nature of the cyclical recovery   certainly bears watching, and I’d be more comfortable if we saw small businesses entering with   the same kind of confidence that we’ve seen in the last quarter from the big businesses  Thank   you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I, too, support alternative B, although I would   say that I think that the formulation we have in alternative B, come our April meeting, might   well be outstaying its welcome  I think the bracketed language is accurate in and of itself but is   likely to be quite confusing, and for that reason, I think it should be struck   March 16, 2010 112 of 146    Let me turn, then, to a view on rates  I think that the view on rates expressed in the   Greenbook would be a surprise to the markets, if that ended up being the policy view  And it   would be, frankly, a surprise to me  I think the language we have in alternative B on   “exceptionally low” and “extended period” served a very useful purpose for us when we put it in,   so we shouldn’t be troubled by its existence now  It showed a demonstrated perseverance on   these rates  I think that it now looks to markets to be somewhat more like an on/off switch than   the dimmer switch we wish it were  So my sense is that we’re going to have to use that; that is,   we may now be stuck with this brutal on/off switch   But we very effectively brought the discussion of liquidity facilities into the statement    We then wound them down in the statement, and we carried on a very useful dialogue with   markets  I think, come our April meeting, with the likely continuation of “exceptionally low”   and “extended period,” we should then bring in the balance sheet discussion of Treasury   redemptions and the discussion of MBS sales  I think that is a fertile way to do it  That lets us   be more flexible in the statement without ripping the tough bandage off interest rates, which   markets have now assigned to this language  I think the Committee is not ready to have that   discussion now  We certainly don’t have consensus now  But I think that’s the germane   discussion  C′ and versions thereof could be quite credible for us to adopt as spring gets going   My last point, Mr Chairman, is on Tom’s suggestion on structural imbalances  I would   say that, while I’m sympathetic to the idea that the Division of Supervision and Regulation has a   role to play, I’m uncomfortable overburdening supervision and regulation with that responsibility   alone  The way I would describe the near- and medium-term challenges with exceptionally low,   even negative, real rates is not so much that another bubble is on the doorstep, but that we likely   are having, even in real time, some misallocation of capital, some misallocation of credit  I don’t   March 16, 2010 113 of 146    think supervisors and regulators are ideally situated to deal with it, and I don’t think that the   reference to structural imbalances really captures that essence, which strikes me as the bread   crumbs to some longer-term asset bubble problems  Thank you     Right  I think Brian’s suggestion is to just add the third clause      Not for long   April 27–28, 2010 34 of 206                     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Let me add my thanks for the memos  I think   the reward you get for the great memos is trying to make sense of what we’ve heard so far when   you write the minutes   Let me see if I can’t try to summarize it in some broad view before going to specifics,   some of which I think are covered by what was already said this earlier this afternoon  First, I   think it’s more important that the broad outlines of an asset plan strategy be understood than that   a specific asset management plan be announced I think that really puts the emphasis on   communications, perhaps for this FOMC cycle  Second, I think we should be as clear as   possible about our redemption and sales strategy as we possibly can  No less and no more  That   means that the purpose of the communication should be to see where we can agree around the   table at least in a broad consensus  Third, if properly communicated, financial markets seem to   me readily able to incorporate clear, credible, properly sized, prospective communications about   asset sales  The improvements in the financial markets should make us more comfortable that, if   we do our jobs in communicating the kinds of asset sales that we’ve described, they should be   well received in the markets   Fourth, it strikes me that the impact of the last dollar of MBS purchases or, say, the last   $100 billion of MBS purchases, was rather small in financial markets in terms of overall effect  I   think the effect of the first dollar, or $100 billion, of sales of these assets is also likely to be quite   small, if properly understood  I think that private market participants appear right now to look   quite kindly on this kind of asset  These government-backed, mortgage-backed securities strike   me as being somewhere in the sweet spot of what investors are looking for  This obviously can   change, but that should give us incremental comfort if we choose to start to socialize our strategy   at this moment  Fifth, in my view, more broadly, there are likely net benefits of slowly and   April 27–28, 2010 51 of 206                   steadily disposing of these assets, or at least signaling as we come out of this meeting an   openness to doing so, and that could precede changes in the policy rate  Sixth, even assuming an   active program of asset sales above and beyond what I’d recommend—I’m thinking about option   5—the high end of staff work suggests that the term premiums could be as much as 80 basis   points  I share the view of others that that well overstates the likely impact  But even if that’s   the case, it was striking to me—and I’ll share a view that President Lacker expressed—that it   takes a lot of work to move the needle in terms of real economic effect  So while this is a very   consequential decision we’re making on asset sales, I think the consequences of the   communication are greater  If the communications were botched, it would likely have real   consequences in financial markets and the real economy  So I’ll put the emphasis back there   What should we guard against?  I think as a seventh point I would say we should guard   against option 5 being perceived as being too anxious to engage in rapid fire sales of assets  I   think we should also guard against option 1, the idea that we’re very comfortable holding these   assets for the next couple of decades, making these housing assets part of our permanent   portfolio, or allowing normal maturity schedules to dictate our holdings  Another thing we   should guard against is confusing markets  I think markets, through no fault of anyone around   this table, are uncertain about what our relative preferences are between policy rates, balance   sheet size, and asset mix  I think they’re also confused about the timing  If we could come out   of this FOMC meeting or the next with some overall sense of the best way forward, I think we’d   be doing ourselves and markets and the real economy some good   As an eighth and final point before turning to specifics, it strikes me, based on what I’ve   heard so far today, that it’s best to chart a thoughtful, steady, middle ground that crowds in   private investors, who are probably more interested in holding these assets than we are   April 27–28, 2010 52 of 206                   What does that mean in terms of strategy?  I favor outlining a broad strategy of asset   sales outside the four corners of the statement—most likely in the minutes and in the speeches   from many of our colleagues—that accomplishes three things  First, it envisions circumstances   where asset sales might, but only might, precede changes in the policy rate  Second, asset sales   are done in a way that is slow, steady, prospective, predictable, and presumed to continue absent   a material change in economic conditions  And finally, in the broad strategy of asset sales, we   avoid at this moment pre-committing to a date for the program to kick off   I think that, perhaps, as we get through the next couple of meetings, if we get more   comfortable with the contour of the economy, as we’ll discuss in the economic go-round   tomorrow, we could get more comfortable with signaling what the date could be  But I’m not   sure as of this minute that I’d want to nail that down or put that in stone   On the question you asked, Mr Chairman, about reinvesting the proceeds of maturing   Treasuries, I am comfortable, at least in isolation, putting that in the statement at this meeting    But I think that goes against what is more likely to be the key takeaway that we want it to be, and   I worry that, even though I favor that section in paragraph 4 as a matter of policy, it gets in the   way of our broader communications coming out of this meeting  I would say it’s probably not   worth it for now  We can talk more about that tomorrow  Thank you    Sixty months, I think     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I would discard my prepared remarks, but I   don’t have any  [Laughter]  So I will underscore my old remarks today  I have two themes, one   of which we talked about briefly yesterday and then again this morning, and that’s the situation   in Greece; the other is the domestic economy   First, it is striking to me how long it has taken policymakers around the world to take this   Greece situation seriously  Going back many, many months in many nations’ capitals across   almost all financial markets and across major multinational businesses, this Greece situation has   April 27–28, 2010 120 of 206                   been constantly dismissed as a unique situation to a southern European country that hasn’t had   its finances straight in a couple thousand years, so things now aren’t that different, and I think   that that misunderstanding will turn out to be quite severe for Europe, with a real possibility of   impacts here in the US  I also happen to think that part of the reason that it has taken the world   so long to think about Greece is a misunderstanding of the narrative of the last couple of years  I   think Europeans have believed that this is still largely about the US and subprime mortgages    That misunderstanding of the narrative by politicians across the world, and by policymakers and   economists, I think, led them to be far too complacent about their fiscal problems and about the   European Union   I think the situation is every bit as serious as financial markets do—I’ve thought that, as   you know, for a long time  I think that the banking situation in Europe is very tenuous  I think   that the difference—and, in some ways, it’s more troubling now than it was a year ago—is that   the markets could get very crowded in the next several months  For example, think about   sovereigns that need to go to the market for debt issuance and about the recapitalization of the   banking sector outside of the US—Chinese banks are coming back into markets in size;   Japanese banks are; most of the Asian banks are; and, I think, through some pressure, European   banks will  This market will get very crowded  Whether there is sufficient demand at something   like current market prices I think is less certain than I wish it were  So I think the Greek   situation is very serious, and it’s quite important for us to take quite seriously the prospects of   nonlinear outcomes both for Europe and for the US   There’s a preoccupation now in markets about spreads between riskier countries and   those that are more austere, like the Germans  At some point there will certainly be flights to   safety, and that could continue to push German yields down, and even do some favors for   April 27–28, 2010 121 of 206                   Treasury issuance in the near term  But I think that the hard question will be whether, over the   not too distant horizon, we might see a step function move in sovereign credits from the safest   sovereigns in the world, and that isn’t so far out in my expectations over the course of the next   several quarters  So I think it’s possible that German and French money will get quite a bit more   expensive, even after the situation improves a bit  Markets are going to continue to test these   implied guarantees, and I don’t think there’s a policy response at this point that is up to that   challenge  In sum, that situation is serious, and I think we are prudent to be perhaps even a little   more cautious in making sure that, as the world is looking around for certainty, as the world is   looking around to make sure that they understand first principles and understand that   policymakers respond, we go to great lengths to communicate and not to surprise, at least in this   environment between now and June   Let me go from a bit of darkness to a bit of light  I’ve been of the view, maybe since last   fall—I think I’ve said at every FOMC meeting—that I feel a lot better about the next few   quarters than the next few years, and I think the data have borne that out  I think we are in the   throes of a cyclical recovery  It certainly could be cast aside by what’s going on in Europe, but I   take a touch more signal, even given the gravity of that situation, from the recent evidence both   on the real side and in financial markets in the US  I think this GDP recovery probably has a   quarter or two more in it than the Greenbook and the Blue Chip suggest  Whether this recovery   is ultimately durable, whether we see labor incomes ultimately rise, whether the unemployment   rate comes down with more speed, it looks to me as if GDP math looks better in the US over at   least the second and maybe the third quarter than some expectations  It looks to me as if it might   be a recovery led by big business and high finance, a recovery which isn’t ultimately durable, but   is durable until the bill comes due, and it might not come due for a couple of quarters   April 27–28, 2010 122 of 206                   Financial market performance, I think, is probably the linchpin to this  If US financial   markets can stay resistant to the viruses around the world, then I’d put the “over” on an   over/under bet on what GDP performance, at least, is going to do  As I’ve mentioned before,   corporate profits and balance sheets among the Fortune 1000—outside of financial services—is   nothing short of extraordinary, and big business CEO confidence in the last couple of months has   surged, even as we see small businesses that are still struggling   So the nature of this recovery strikes me as quite different from what we’ve experienced   in prior recessions, and I won’t read into this as much as some forecasters may about what this   tells us about 2011 and 2012, but I’d say it still probably tells us something pretty positive about   2010  The PCE that we saw in March surprised markets on the upside, and from the discussions   I’ve had with a couple of big credit card companies, April looks just as strong if not stronger    They’re as puzzled as I think many of us are, but the facts are the facts, and I think consumption   in April looks better than okay  Tax revenues to a range of states have surprised in the last 60   days on the upside  Tax revenues to the federal government have also surprised  We can tell   stories about it, but my experience, at least coming out of the last recession, is that tax revenues   were a really, really good guide that something real was going on, an improvement  Consumer   confidence continues to trend higher  Consumer durables look better than we expected    Business cap-ex trends are positive, all of which suggests to me that, if we can avoid getting hit   by the European virus over the course of the next several months, we might see GDP prints that   are well above consensus, but financial markets will give us some indication of this, I think, in   the next few weeks  My suspicion is that we will have a special video conference call before our   next June meeting to survey results, which is probably not the greatest thing to be projecting, but   I wouldn’t bet against that   April 27–28, 2010 123 of 206                   I think the challenges beyond the next couple quarters in the US are very real  Small   businesses and small banks continue to be struggling  I don’t think there’s much in the   regulatory reform bill that would suggest that that will change, and I don’t think that there’s that   much that governments are going to be able to do to change that in the near term   So I’m light about the US the next couple of quarters  I’m dark about Europe in the   next couple of quarters  Just as a way to try to reconcile this, I can’t help but think back to our   own recent experience  If we think back to how we were feeling around this table in late 2007   through the first half of 2008, we were feeling very serious about what the situations were, even   before Lehman Brothers, and the Europeans said, “Well, this is all about the US  Things here   are just swell”  These policies converge  These economies converge, and this one will, too  So   I don’t want to take too much signal from what is going on  I want us to be very aware of the   risks  But we might well sneak ahead for a couple of quarters before the bill comes due  Thank   you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Let me start with a couple of substantive   notes before turning to the statement  The first I’ll mention is asset sales  The way I think about   our asset purchases is that we bought assets people didn’t want at prices they wouldn’t pay  To   the extent that markets are now interested in buying these assets at prices that are substantially   similar to prices at which we’d be willing to sell, we should take them up on that rare   opportunity  So I’m an opportunistic seller of assets, just as a substantive matter  I don’t think   that the unwinding of our balance sheet would constitute a material tightening of monetary   April 27–28, 2010 163 of 206                   policy so long as we followed the Bernanke adjectives  gradual, well communicated, well   understood, no fire sales, all the things we talked about yesterday   Second is the “extended period” language  I don’t feel constrained by what that does to   our options going forward  I think that, if conditions change, we can change policies as quickly   as we need to  So the literalist in me is uncomfortable, and that might be true for others around   this table, but I must say that I think markets have come, after a long period of deliberation, to   understand what that means  I do have sympathy with the view expressed by a few around this   table that if we are too loose for too long, we could see bubbles  I would state it maybe even   more simply, and it’s the hard question I think we’re going to need to analyze in the next few   months  Are we seeing misallocations of capital, even if they’re short of bubbles?  In particular,   I would keep good track of what’s happening to funds that are racing out of money market   mutual funds yielding nothing and where they’re going next  I would say that, to the extent we   see material misallocations of capital and we have not yet moved policy, it should concern us    At this point, those misallocations are hard to see, though it’s not impossible to come up with an   anecdote about them   Let me turn now to the tactics and process and parlance of how we move forward  I can   support alternative B, and I do think we are wise to await further resolution, as it were, of the   European shock  I don’t think we’re really giving up much by waiting until June, but I think we   should be using the period between now and June, principally in the minutes, to see whether we   can’t describe what our policy alternatives might be in June and thereafter  I think that I heard   some kind of broad consensus consistent with what Narayana said about how we think about   asset sales vis-à-vis the rest of our policy tools  I hope that we are not conflating two policy   tools into one  I don’t think it’s prudent for us to say that we’ll only move one after we’ve   April 27–28, 2010 164 of 206                   moved the other  I think there are too many nonlinear events, too many changes in mortgage   finance—too many that might hit us  It would be better to think about asset sales and   communicate our plans for asset sales in the context of what’s going on in the real economy and   financial markets   As a result, I’m more agnostic about whether that will precede or follow changes in the   policy rates  I think that if markets understood that consensus, which is not focused on LIFO or   FIFO or anything else, but which instead is focused on what we really see in the economy, then   we would be doing ourselves and markets a good favor  One of the few benefits of the   extraordinary period we’ve been in is that we’ve created lots of products  It turns out that they   gave us lots of options on ways to unwind the liquidity measures we’ve put in place  I think it’s   giving us some greater room, some greater flexibility, in the conduct of monetary policy, and I   wouldn’t want to conflate them  I would tie them to real economic and financial conditions, and   I think laying down a goal post of five years as a medium-term prospect sounds fine  We don’t   have to say, nor should we say, when that process begins   Finally, on redemptions, again, I think we should be communicating the robustness of our   discussion on redemptions, because what matters most about that is what it signals  I think the   minutes and our speeches can help us, but I would be presumptively in favor of Treasury   redemptions pending further analysis and our June discussion  Thank you, Mr Chairman      Thank you, Mr Chairman  I have just a few comments  First, to state   what everyone has been saying, this is a mess  I would say this is as fundamental a weekend for   the global financial architecture as any we have had over the last few years  I think for some   difficult risks to the system we need systemic risk councils and triangles, and the like, to get to   the bottom of them  This wasn’t one of them  So it’s disappointing that we find ourselves   collectively in a global economic mire at this point  I would say that policymakers, particularly   in Europe, have underestimated the risks of spending by those who can ill afford it, have been   made complacent by low sovereign costs of credit, and did not take advantage of the window of   opportunity that our firms did to recapitalize  So I think the banking system in Europe will now   get asked the hardest questions  And I think that, unlike the US experience, the question in   markets will be whether the sovereigns have the ability, the financial wherewithal, to write the   kinds of checks that the United States at least underwrote some time ago  I think the risks in the   near term are probably mostly about a disorderly move in the euro and a walk-back from   May 9, 2010 38 of 42             exposure to European financial institutions, even those that were thought to be tiered into a   stronger category   With respect to the moves by the European Central Bank, if they come about as Jean-  Claude said to Ben earlier today, then they bring to my mind the well-known bazooka that we   heard about a couple of years ago at the end of the last Administration  I would be surprised if   this bazooka isn’t tested, and that’s a huge challenge  That the ECB is willing to do this, I think,   shows how seriously they assess the risks   I think talk will quickly turn to the “malicious shorts” that brought this on Europe, and   they will likely look to US financial institutions that had the gall to hedge themselves over the   last weeks and months as somehow precipitating this  So I think our financial institutions will be   part of this narrative, even if from a prudential perspective we would think that for them to pare   back their exposures as risks mounted was perfectly appropriate   The ECB is putting itself in a position of having to be a transitional authority; but I think   markets will wonder, “As a transitional authority to what?”  These sovereigns are going to have   very tough questions, and I would tend to think that the political challenges among many of these   member states will be massive   On the swaps themselves, I think what we’ve all said is that we’re making this decision   based on what is in the best interest of the US economy  We’re certainly sensitive to the   integrated nature of our financial markets and global economies, but I think I’d put myself in the   category of thinking that this is important to do for our own sake   With respect to the communications of this, I think it’s important to describe our role as   supportive but secondary  This is not the antidote to problems in Europe or the US, and I think   we ought not to oversell its relative import  The half-life of policy initiatives out of Europe in   May 9, 2010 39 of 42             this cycle has been falling  I wouldn’t expect that to change with dramatic speed, so we should   be in the business here of under-promising, but being as supportive as we can in the interests of   the US  Finally, I think we’re going to see massive flows into US safe-haven securities, for   liquidity at least as much as for safety, but we should not be lulled into that false sense of   complacency that others have   I think this is a very tough period in front of us, and I regret to say that I suspect we will   have another videoconference before our next regularly scheduled FOMC meeting  Thank you     Regrettably      Thank you, Mr Chairman  Three questions, I think, have been raised    One, on the coupon swaps, let me just underscore what Brian said, which is that this is very   June 22–23, 2010 39 of 213             ordinary, customary, boring, not very exciting or surprising news to people in markets—these   things do happen all the time  So in that way I’m in total agreement with him and the New York   folks  I would just point out that I don’t think that this is a one-off problem  If only we had   bought one class of securities instead of another, then things would be fine  This is symptomatic    This is indicative of a very messed up mortgage finance system and of extraordinary efforts by   all sorts of government actors, including the Federal Reserve, to intervene in it  So, while we’re   clearing up this symptom, and I think that we should, I wouldn’t be dismissive of this problem,   and I’d suggest that we’ll see different strings of it manifest themselves in different ways over   the course of the next couple of years   Second, on the redemption policy, I favor option 2 in substance  I think that gives to   Brian, who has to deal with all of us, a little bit more flexibility than option 1 does, so I think   that’s necessary to ensure that we can functionally provide what he and the Desk need to   provide  So option 2 is fine  In terms of the communication of option 2, I would add that to the   burdens we are going to put on the Chairman for Humphrey-Hawkins  I think that if the   Chairman can lay out at a high level what the music is, then Brian and the New York Desk can   play out the lyrics as to the technical issue of what’s going on and do that in a way which is not   scary  I think all of us around this table, myself included, do tend to make a lot out of the   communications challenges and what markets want and need, but these markets can be led, and   they can be led ably to good places, so we ought not be intimidated by that prospect   On the subject of asset sales, Mr Chairman, I think I’m going to take your counsel and   not re-litigate the discussion we had last time  I’ll just make two points in light of more recent   events coming out of Europe  First, I think Europe should remind us of the need to have   optionality associated with all that we’re going to do under a narrative that is playing out with   June 22–23, 2010 40 of 213             markets  The downside risks that are now obvious in Europe, which were feared and understood   six weeks ago, should remind us of the multiple policy tools that we now have, and, speaking for   myself, I think that we should keep plenty of flexibility about the deployment of those tools    Some of those are little water pistols, and some of those are nuclear weapons, and I wouldn’t   want to confuse them and say we’ve got this big closet and it’s just filled with a bunch of guns    So my own view would be that, when we think about the size and composition of our balance   sheet, we would be well served to keep that separate from, but certainly related to, our decision   on policy rates  I think the minutes accurately reflected where we were last time  I think that   optionality would be a good thing for us to get back to in future discussions, but we’re probably   not going to be able to accomplish that today     The second new news, it strikes me, out of Europe that informs this decision is that the   problems there, which are very significant, have had a far more material impact on risk-free   rates—on the Treasury curve and on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages for folks that are buying a first   house—than a trillion dollars of assets that this Committee has undertaken  I just want to put   that which we’re debating in the broader context  Europe should remind us that what we’re   contemplating is relatively small  I have great confidence that it can be properly communicated   both in the forthcoming discussions the Chairman has in Humphrey-Hawkins and beyond    Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’m glad Governor Kohn can end on such a   gleeful note  [Laughter]     Amid these bouts of financial turmoil, mixed data, and new questions   about the future of the European project, there are two questions that seem to rise above all   others  First, is the real economy in the US going to deliver on the promise of an effective   handoff from government stimulus to self-sustaining private demand?  Second, and no less   consequential, as previewed yesterday, why isn’t the Tealbook teal?  [Laughter]  One of these   questions is unanswerable; the other merely unanswered  The trick will be deciding from the   balance of my comments which is which   First, on the economic forecast, at every FOMC meeting since last September, I’ve been   saying that I feel a lot better about the next few quarters than the next few years  I’m afraid to   report today that those few quarters are now over—we’re now in the next few years  I am quite   cautious about the path outlined even in the Tealbook  My own projections continue to be below   the central tendency on GDP growth—I project a very moderate rate of growth, with a low level   of output and very, very slow job creation  We have seen encouraging data on industrial   production, but the idea of a “hockey stick” shape on our GDP forecast seems overly hopeful to   me  Let me highlight three concerns on the real side of the economy   The first is business spending  I am less confident that anticipated double-digit growth in   equipment and software spending will make the necessary contributions to GDP to make the   Tealbook forecast a reality  It strikes me that this business spending is a critical linchpin to these   forecasts, and I worry that large corporations will not readily redeploy their large excess cash   cushions into new cap-ex  For whatever reason, whether it be the new volatility in financial   June 22–23, 2010 106 of 213             markets, memories of what’s transpired in the last couple of years, or concerns about uncertainty   in the rules of the game, there’s very little impetus for these guys to get on their front foot and to   step up their cap-ex budgets  I think that that would be great news if it happened, but it’s not   obvious to me it will   Second, on the employment front, the growth in average hourly earnings and hours   worked could well be an indicator that job creation is “on the come,” but it could indicate instead   that structural unemployment will prove more persistent and that those who are not gainfully   employed might find themselves in the wrong bucket here for quite some time  I’m concerned   that small companies without access to the capital markets will not get into the game with any   kind of force and will not help drive an employment rebound  I think the divergence between the   ISM surveys and the NFIB surveys are as pronounced as I have ever witnessed, and I think they   are capturing something real about the differences in views between large and small businesses   Third, as raised quite, quite well by the alternative simulation in the Tealbook, I’m   concerned that potential growth is lower and the NAIRU is higher than the staff’s forecast   Let me turn now to the financial markets, which, I think, pose further downside risks    The Tealbook, like many forecasts in the financial markets, suggests that the financial repair   process steadily continues It strikes me that this is a large and uncertain assumption over the   course of the next few quarters  If the financial market repair process is halting, it could have   significant implications for global economic growth   Let me highlight some of the risks within the financial markets  The first is institutional   investors—they strike me as lurching, not searching, for a new equilibrium  I think Don rightly   pointed out that, on any given day on any given week, we see institutional investors risking and   de-risking at the faintest sign of news  This is not an encouraging development, and I think the   June 22–23, 2010 107 of 213             remarkably high correlations we’re seeing across asset classes globally should give us pause   about how durably the financial market repair process continues   Second, retail investors appear to be stepping back from the equity markets with even   greater force than during the panic of 2008  They’re showing fear of getting back into these   markets  This might be fleeting—it may be that they are scared now, but when the equity   markets turn again, they won’t be able to help themselves and will just say, “if there’s only one   more bubble, let me ride it”  But I think that the retail investor behavior over the course of the   last month is striking, even more so than we saw in the darkest days of the crisis  Because asset   prices haven’t moved in aggregate much from their peaks—perhaps down 10 percent from their   peaks of four or six weeks ago—I think many of those retail investors have just decided this is   not a fair game, and they are going to exit these markets  That is a disturbing trend that I think   has some very real consequences if it plays out   The third concern regarding the financial markets are US financial firms themselves  I   think they are likely to report second-quarter profits that are below expectations and   meaningfully so  If you look over the course of the last couple of weeks as we get to the end of   the second quarter, analysts’ estimates for big banks’ profits have come down, but I don’t think   they’ve come down as far as will be realized  I think we will see big banks trying to talk down   their numbers before they announce second-quarter profits in the third week of this upcoming   month  That could well be a surprise, and I think the implications for bank capital and for bank   businesses could be quite discomforting  Even our relatively strong banks have had a reasonably   tough time funding themselves on an unsecured basis in three-, five-, and ten-year terms, and   that’s a development that should give us all some concern, reminding us of some pretty tough   periods behind us   June 22–23, 2010 108 of 213             Fourth, I think we’re seeing volatility of volatility—a second derivative phenomenon    Tying the financial markets back to the real economy, this volatility makes me concerned about   the resilience of the production improvements we’ve seen and the hoped for improvements in   business fixed investment over the course of the next year   Finally, I’ll mention the financial architecture  I think there’s this expectation, however   misplaced, that, once the regulatory reform bill gets to the Rose Garden, there will be clarity in   the financial architecture, and, in particular, clarity on the rules of the road  But that’s not even   the end of the beginning  Many of these questions are going to be punted to us and other   regulators, both in the US and across the globe, and I’m not sure markets fully anticipate how   much uncertainty will remain   So, while I’ve been of the view that the financial market improvements over the last year   have been helping the real side of the economy, I suspect that they will no longer be as   convincingly useful to get the real economy to go forward   Let me turn finally to the euro zone  Many of us reasonably anticipated the problems in   Europe for several months, and I think the situation there remains very, very unsettled  Even if   Europe can muddle through the summer, it is still an open question whether the politics in   Europe will allow the political leaders to “double down” on the commitments that they have   made over the course of the last month  European leaders are going to have probably their most   consequential meeting in October, at which they’re going to revisit commitments and evaluate   financial markets  In September, before they go into those October meetings of the European   Council members, they’ll all be putting out their proposals  I don’t know whether the politics in   the stronger countries in Europe will permit their leaders in very uneasy coalitions to say as   robustly and squarely as many markets would wish that they stand completely behind their   June 22–23, 2010 109 of 213             commitments; that is, their taxpayers will be bailing out those who, in the eyes of the political   masters, are less deserving  It’s possible that, as the economies in Europe diverge in the forecast   period, countries like Germany will be able to export their way into some GDP successes and   bring down their unemployment rates a bit, and this could lead to tensions within the euro zone   where some of the competitors look at that and say, “I’m not getting any of those   improvements”  Does that delta in their real economies make coherence and convergence on   policy more difficult or less?  I think the European problems are very serious  Markets appear to   me willing to continue to test perceived weakness, to test ambiguity  Going through the summer   and into the fall, I think markets are going to be parsing the words of politicians across the   continent and will be wondering whether the commitments they’ve made are going to hold true   Finally, just a brief word on inflation prospects as measured  Near-term indicators, as   everyone has discussed, appear quite benign—there’s a little risk of near-term price increases    Import prices appear to be tame  But, unlike some who are now more concerned about deflation   risks, I do see differences in prices across countries and across particular commodities, as an   example  It doesn’t seem to me as though we are all that close to a downward price spiral, with   falling prices begetting further price falls and constituting anything like deflation  It looks to me   as though many of these prices are responding to real developments  Inflation expectations   continue to be anchored, and that’s a subject that still bears careful watching, but I haven’t   changed my views on inflation prospects dramatically  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Given the current situation, I support   alternative B and the coupon swap as requested by Brian and the Desk   June 22–23, 2010 154 of 213             In terms of the statement itself, I think paragraph 1 will sound to markets a little stronger   than expectations—not a lot, but a little  There’s some language in it that makes me feel a little   uncomfortable  Describing the E&S spending as appearing to rise at a robust pace sounds a little   ahead of where our discussion has been  But I don’t want to micromanage the statement   In terms of the other policy considerations, building on what you said, Mr Chairman,   about diminishing returns of the QE regime, I would say we are past the point of diminishing   returns  The judgments we made on the size of our asset purchases were made amid a ton of   uncertainty  I don’t think any of us knew with precision what that optimal point was  Looking   back, it appears to me as though we went past the point where we were getting net benefits  That   judgment, and the different judgments we have on that question, should inform our moves in   either direction for policy going forward, whether there’s more that should be done through the   balance sheet or whether there should be a period of what I describe as opportunistic divestment   of some of our MBS holdings, perhaps akin to opportunistic disinflation from central bank   meetings of the past   In order to have that discussion, though, about trying to find what the equilibrium level of   our balance sheet is, it strikes me that the most important discussion, both for us and for the   public to understand, is that we have multiple tools, not one  I continue to believe that, if we   were to announce at this moment that we were shrinking our balance sheet, it would likely bring   forward expectations of a policy shift, because the public thinks that the size of the balance sheet   is directly linked to policy rates  I don’t think that’s a proper understanding, so my policy   predilection would be to try to describe as clearly as we can that we have multiple policy tools,   and, consistent with the minutes from last time and your discussion, Mr Chairman, it is still the   case, I think, for most around the table that the policy rate is the predominant tool   June 22–23, 2010 155 of 213             But there are other tools that might move, and we could imagine circumstances where the   size and composition of the balance sheet might move in ways that doesn’t or ought not bring the   policy rate expectations forward or back  So I’ll say just a word on each of the three policies—  size, composition, and policy rate—from my own perspective   In terms of size, as you said, Mr Chairman, it’s hard to know what we’d buy if we   wanted to expand the balance sheet, and what benefits we would get  In terms of composition, I   think that if we were to make a decision to buy Treasuries under an LSAP program, the   consequences for our credibility, given the current fiscal question, would be very significant, so I   would be quite allergic to that, given what we know now  Finally, on the policy rate, I hope and   expect that the Tealbook is wrong, that is, I hope that policy moves with greater force and greater   speed than anticipated in the Tealbook  But, again, given my own sense of when it’s going to   move, and given the market’s reaction and understanding of what “extended period” means,   “extended period” is fine in the statement as written   Just a final point  I’ll join many of my colleagues in saying that the work done by staff in   preparation for this meeting was really helpful, really extraordinary  But I would also say that   the staff work is a shared burden for all of us and for all of our staffs  And I think there is   incredible talent around the System, and it is very well funded  So, as we think about new   projects, I think that our staff here will continue to be doing a ton of work to prepare for these   meetings, but I don’t think the burden should rest totally with them  And I’d encourage my   colleagues to think about work that can be done to inform your own thinking and the broader   thinking by your own teams  Thank you       I took that just to mean there were a lot of mixed nuts hanging around   you  [Laughter]     Thank you, Mr Chairman  In the intermeeting period, there has been   quite a bit of chatter based on economic and financial market developments, and I have been   troubled by some of it  Let me take on, if I could, the four points of chatter from folks outside of   this building  I will try not to be too critical of them, because Governor Kohn will soon be   among them [laughter] trafficking in many of these same things   The first bit of chatter that I will try to debunk is the outside world’s view that the modal   forecast for US GDP growth over the longer-term horizon has to be materially lower due to the   soft data in the second quarter  I don’t think that’s right  I don’t think that what I’ve learned in   the last six weeks has made me change fundamentally my view of the state of this economy  I   have been less optimistic than the Tealbook and remain so, but the story of a sluggish, subpar   recovery remains the base case, I think, for almost all of us  So I think we’ve got to remind   ourselves, and maybe remind them, of the difference between a cyclical recovery and a secular   growth story  If the second quarter had turned out to be well above trend, that certainly would   have been good news for all involved, but it still wouldn’t be revealing much about what this   economy is capable of doing in terms of longer-term GDP growth or the natural rate of   unemployment   Second, there is an emerging group in the outside world saying that deflation is a growing   risk  However, if we look at the path of commodity prices, anchored inflation expectations, a   weaker dollar with expectations that that trajectory continues, and upward revisions to many   price measures, none of these give evidence signifying that deflation risks are on the horizon  In   August 10, 2010 66 of 160             addition, I have had a lot of discussions with both price setters and price takers in this   intermeeting period—though I’m sure my list is not as robust as President Fisher’s  When I   describe to them the risks of deflation, the story I hear back is actually one about disinflation    Then, when we discuss the difference between cyclical disinflation the next couple of years and   real deflation risks out over the horizon, they all say—whether they had said there is a deflation   problem or not—“Oh, yeah, it does turn out that, ultimately, I will have labor wages going back   up; I expect the rest of my input costs to go up”  In sum, I haven’t found an anecdote from any   of a large number of business folks that somehow vouches for or sanctifies this deflation risk   thesis, which has captured the attention of financial markets  I think we should be leery of, and   alert to those out there pushing it for their own purposes   Third, there seems to be increasing chatter that financial markets are in need of Fed   action—the financial markets are waiting for the Fed to act  I disagree with that as well    Financial markets seem to be acting smartly and rationally in response to real economic data    The Tealbook reports that Treasury markets have moved 20 to 40 basis points in light of these   incoming data and, of course, in light of expectations about policy  That is a more powerful   stimulus than we are contemplating or, frankly, capable of delivering  In addition, financial   markets seem to be working with the language we have had on the table and responding   appropriately  They have moved out the timing of a change in the federal funds rate, and capital   markets more broadly seem to be repairing themselves slowly but surely, not just in the US but   in Europe as well   Fourth, there is chatter, particularly here in Washington, that the Fed is the only game in   town—the Fed can’t just sit there, the Fed has to act, because, after all, we have given up on the   constructiveness of  other policies  I also take significant issue with this growing view  Of   August 10, 2010 67 of 160             course, the Fed remains powerful in dealing with unexpected shocks, and we have proven our   ability and willingness to do so  But we are not likely at this point, in my judgment, to be able to   improve GDP growth and employment trends materially by acting alone  We do no service to   the public if we overstate our ability to do that  I will say more on this in the policy round   To give a fair description of economic developments since we last met, let me make four   other points, which I think are encouraging  I don’t mean to say that there hasn’t been some   news in the opposite direction, but I want to make sure these get some attention   First, the credit situation has turned in the United States  I think this is the first meeting   since the crisis began where I feel that I can say this  If we look at bank credit, the credit card   companies, financial institutions, and actual corporations, I can’t help but come to the view that   bank credit quality appears much improved—I think that the big drawdown of reserves into   earnings by many of our banks is not some gimmick  This improvement in bank credit and   credit more generally is a necessary precondition to getting this economy to turn   Second, the deleveraging of banks, businesses, and consumers has progressed   significantly, as evidenced by these excess cash cushions and high saving rates  And if what   matters most of all for us is not what the next couple of quarters look like, but what the next few   years look like, this is good news  It means that, when the animal spirits turn and policy   becomes more growth-oriented, there is plenty of amplitude for a robust recovery   Third, while I think that Nathan rightly reports that the global trade picture has detracted   from near-term measures of the arithmetic of GDP, I also think the fact that global trade is back   with force is very good news for the US and very good news for the global economy  We will   have some quarters where this will be helping GDP and some where it will be hurting, but, for   those like me, who very much feared that the Europe situation could well deteriorate, I have to   August 10, 2010 68 of 160             kick my stubborn self and say they seem to have gotten through it  Now, I won’t say that those   tail risks are gone—I’m stubborn enough to believe that they could reemerge in September or   October  But I think the global economic and global trade picture is a better one, even a   materially better one, compared to when we last evaluated it   Fourth, the data on the real side have not been uniformly weak  If you look at US   multinationals, excluding financial services companies, profits have been robust, and so has   revenue growth  If you push beyond what some of these fellows say on their earnings calls,   where they are very cautious on the second half, most report that they are still seeing a   reasonably strong backlog of orders  They are not sure where it is coming from—Europe looks   pretty good  In the United States, particularly in the technology industry, and some others, they   are sheepish, but the backlogs and the revenues don’t look nearly as bad as the economists in the   outside world would have us believe  So that’s just for purposes of balance in the discussion in   the policy round  Thank you, Mr Chairman     That will cost you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Governor Kohn knows the great affection   that I have towards him, and he has done an excellent job today of making it harder for me to   miss him when he’s gone  [Laughter]     He rightly stated that the burden on the Federal Reserve is to “take   actions because we can”  I must say that I read into his comments the view, which is a   reasonable one, that there is dignity in failure—“we should try because we can”     I must say, I honestly see no such dignity  We cannot afford to fail  We   are the grownups in town  We are the last folks, rightly or wrongly, fairly or unfairly, in a global   economy that demands institutional credibility, and we should be thinking long about the   decisions that we make   Governor Kohn today said that we should take a measured response, and I would ask you   to think whether you think alternative B is a measured response or not  If alternative B were   understood the way President Pianalto just described it—a maintaining of the current SOMA   portfolio—that could well be a measured response to a markdown in the portfolio  That is not, in   my judgment, how it will be understood  Looking at the language in the preceding paragraphs   and ending with the language in paragraph 4, the understanding will be that we have decided that   we must cross the Rubicon and get back into the Treasury markets  If that is the intent of my   colleagues, well, then, that’s one thing  But if, in fact, we view the decision to make a big   purchase of Treasuries as having a high hurdle, and we are not yet convinced that the conditions   allow us to clear that hurdle,  then I think we run grave risks of misleading the public and   misleading the pundits  They will take the music and lyrics incorporated in alternative B and   August 10, 2010 126 of 160             say, “I see  I see where they’re going, and this isn’t about a passive move that they’re making to   restrain the tightening from the prepayments in MBS  This is a doubling down”   Let me go to specifics  In paragraph 1, the changes are fine  I do think it’s a good scene-  setter  I do think the paragraph accurately captures the views around this table about the   downshift in the economy  I think it’s appropriate and expected   In paragraph 2, I think the language that Governor Kohn proposed in brackets, in   combination with paragraph 4, will add an exclamation point to our concerns not only about   employment, but also about deflation risks, and I think it’s an exclamation point that it would be   imprudent for us to carry on with today   In paragraph 3, I am grateful for the changes over the past 24 hours  I think that language   has come to work, and the idea that we would do harm to that policy reaction function with   markets struck me as imprudent, so I think paragraph 3 is working as is   So what about paragraph 4?  If paragraph 4 were understood the way President Pianalto   described it, if it were perceived as a one-off move that is not indicative of where policy is going   to go, then, if we subject paragraph 4 to my benefit–cost test, I’d say, well, the benefits are really   quite small, but they could be a few basis points, and the costs aren’t that big—after all, we’re   already in the mortgage-backed securities market  But, as I said, I think that, as written, that’s   not how paragraph 4 will be understood, given the various commentaries  I think it will be taken   as indicative of a path of policy and as a low hurdle for increasing our Treasuries  I do not   construe the hurdle as low From what I heard in the first round today, I thought for many of you   it was a relatively high hurdle, and I think it’s important that the minutes reflect the collective   judgment of this group   August 10, 2010 127 of 160             In light of where we are, given the time and divergence of views around the table, I   would suggest that, by taking the proceeds from the accelerated prepayments in MBS and   redeploying them in the MBS market, we will have the best chance of preserving our optionality,   so that, come September, and subsequent meetings, if we determine that we need to go all-in, we   will still have plenty of flexibility to do so  To go all-in now, I think would be an error, because,   in my judgment, we do not have sufficiently rigorous analysis and understanding of how markets   are going to take this Treasury purchase and of what we’re going to do about it, which could then   force our hands at subsequent meetings   I must say, so what about this purchase of MBS?  I am puzzled by the Desk’s reference to   the harm and dysfunction that could happen in the mortgage finance markets  I took it as a bit of   jujitsu  I had been screaming about the harm and the dysfunction in the mortgage finance market   since we initiated this program, and most of those views were dismissed  Now, we all learned   from this experience  I’m sure that the mortgage finance market is subject to tons of   dysfunction—Fed buying is not the least source of dysfunction in that market  If we reinvest our   proceeds coming out of MBS and put them back into MBS, it won’t be incrementally much more   dysfunctional than it is with three banks originating 60 percent of all the assets, those being   guaranteed by two GSEs effectively backed by the government with a large majority of the high   coupons bought by the Federal Reserve  The incremental increase in dysfunction here is de   minimis  So given the choice, and trying to bring some comity to our discussions, reinvestment   in MBS strikes me as a more prudent alternative  And will the world say “Aha, they’re keeping   the portfolio as is, and they’ve maintained the flexibility to do more”?  Sure, they will   Why am I as allergic to Treasuries as I suggest today?  First, I think the Treasury market   is doing everything for us that we want it to do, and I don’t know why we would want to call that   August 10, 2010 128 of 160             into question  Those markets are working well, not just in terms of market functioning but also   in terms of prices  Second, I would say that before we get into this market, we should know with   some degree of conviction where we want to go  I don’t know myself, and I haven’t heard tons   of conviction from my colleagues  Finally, I would say that it does strike me that the Treasury   market is a different market  It is special  It is perceived that way  And so I put an extra degree   of caution on entering those markets, given where we are  So my proposal, Mr Chairman,   would be to use the agency MBS and the alternative bracketed language as a way to tone down   and preserve optionality going forward  Thank you     To keep constant     Mr Chairman, if you leave the first phrase as it is, and then, instead of   “maintain,” because we’re trying to strengthen that a little bit, we might say “The Committee   will keep constant the Federal Reserve’s holdings”  I know that means “maintain,” but “keep   constant” sounds a little bit more affirmative to me  It sounds a little more like this is a discrete   act about making sure we deal with this a bit     I don’t know how you do that  Again, I would say this is just a nuance   August 10, 2010 139 of 160                So moved     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Brian, what’s the Desk’s view, based on   either the lessons we’ve learned in the MBS market or from a broader perspective, of the level of   LSAPs relative to the pool of, let’s say, longer-term Treasuries, where we might be running risks   of getting in the way of market functioning?  Are there rules of thumb?  Are there levels at   which, putting policy considerations aside, you’d get less comfortable and the Desk would feel   as though we’re just matching bids and asks with each other in that market?     So moved     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Let me begin where Dave Stockton ended,   which is that we shouldn’t be too surprised by the broad arc of the economy  The panic and the   subsequent financial crisis are having and have had persistent effects, effects that, even at the   time they were occurring, we were going to have a hard time gauging  In addition,   macroeconomic policies—some mix of trade, regulatory, and fiscal policies—have not been   growth-friendly going back a few years  So we are bearing the consequences of these two   fundamental factors   Demand has certainly been affected by these factors, and there have been a series of   attempts over the last few years to plug the hole from demand  But perhaps more consequential,   in my view, is the harm that’s been done to aggregate supply  NAIRU has, in fact, moved up   more, I suspect, than the staff has taken on board, but I certainly share those initial estimates    Potential GDP, I think, has most likely fallen, and the path to get to these new targets is likely to   be quite slow and painful   Incoming data continue to be mixed, with real-time indicators, ex housing, surprising to   the upside in the last few weeks and surprising to the downside in the period before that  My   sense is that the very near-term data will continue to be a bit better than staff expectations, but   that doesn’t fundamentally change my view of the economic outlook in the medium term  My   own second-half forecast comes close to, perhaps a bit shy of the Tealbook, with improvement in   2011 and 2012 also at a slower pace   Still, as Bill Dudley just described, I think the prospects of a double dip are quite   unlikely  We would need a significant adverse shock, but we should be careful what we’re   wishing for  There’s still a lot of dry tinder out there, and I’m thinking in particular about the   September 21, 2010 61 of 151             risks that are still paramount in the money market mutual fund industry and risks that Europe’s   problems could resurface   I don’t fully subscribe to the recent literature on economic crises, particularly the   implication that we are inevitably stuck in a low-growth, high-unemployment environment  This   doesn’t strike me as inevitable  It’s a consequence of policy choices, of which monetary policy   may be, in fact, the least consequential   On the inflation front, we’re witnessing cyclical disinflation at about a level that we   would expect and that’s broadly consistent with model-based outcomes  I still think deflation   risks are not significant nor should they weigh importantly on our policy judgments in the next   round   At the same time, I would say it’s not obvious to me that the extra half a point or point of   inflation and corresponding changes to nominal GDP would have a materially positive impact on   the real economy  There’s been some discussion about inflation expectations and what signal we   should be taking from changes in them, particularly in the TIPS market  I would add an   additional dose of caution in trying to divine too much from the changes in the five-year, five-  year forward and associated measures  It’s not obvious to me that marginal investors understand   what the Fed’s preferences are for TIPS securities relative to nominal Treasuries  And unless   and until we communicate that, I take the indications from these measures with a bigger grain of   salt than usual   Let me turn finally to financial market developments  I think both Brian and Bill have   talked about the sensitivity of financial markets to incoming data  You know, never have such   little changes in data done so much to change asset values to benefit so few  High-frequency   indicators have certainly turned up in the last few weeks  Industrial commodity prices are up    September 21, 2010 62 of 151             Equity prices are up  Credit spreads continue to be narrow, and, as Brian described, corporate   issuance continues to be impressive   Having said all that, I still don’t think that we have found some new market equilibrium   for these financial prices  We still are not in a place where financial market prices are durable   and we can count on them—and that’s a comment not just on US markets, but on markets   globally  I think the consequence of that is important to our policy discussions in the next round    The critical question is whether these markets are increasingly integrated or whether these   markets are, indeed, separate  Markets appear to be moving back, albeit slowly, to a state in   which we have a better sense of what they are telling us; that is, markets that can be more readily   arbitraged between one another  However, the Fed’s balance sheet strategy relies in part on the   presumption that different financial assets are imperfect substitutes in investors’ portfolios  If   this financial repair process continues, if markets do become more integrated, if the   improvements do turn out to be more durable, we might find that the salient presumption is less   true, having some real consequence for our decision on further asset purchases  Thank you, Mr   Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  While I enjoy an unconstrained discussion as   much as the next guy [laughter], I will confine myself to what seems to be in the realm of the   reasonable, Mr Chairman, for the purposes of advancing towards our deadline here  Let me   make four points about the framework and then turn to the alternatives   First, the portfolio-balance sheet channel that you described in Jackson Hole is operative   and effective even if no new policy announcements are made at any meeting   Second, it strikes me that it’s not the size or composition of the balance sheet that   matters  It’s the effects of that balance sheet on markets and the resulting accommodation  On   that point, the effects of any given balance sheet in markets that are as sensitive as we described   earlier are well worth continuing to understand as we go forward  So it’s not a bigger balance   sheet that’s necessary to provide more accommodation in these markets   Third, I think that the benefit-cost framework of the new regime that we’ve discussed is   critical not only to the judgments we form, but also to our communication about the regime  To   have a meaningful chance of being effective, the new regime must be built, communicated, and   understood  So, like many others here, I think it would be prudent to give this another six weeks,   at least, to take shape  The staff estimates of the gross benefits of an extra $500 billion are now   much closer to what my estimates have been since we began this process, and they can’t help but   make us feel underwhelmed  On the cost side of the framework, I would say that estimates of   the uncertainty and associated risks should not be assumed away, even if they’re difficult for us   to ascertain  If we’ve learned anything in the last few years, it’s that policy should be highly   September 21, 2010 111 of 151             attuned to low-probability high-impact events  Given the fear that I have, and that I think many   of you have, there is a nontrivial chance of further shocks to global economic systems  My sense   is that policymakers would want to use their tools at times of maximum efficacy, and I don’t   believe that is the case today   A fourth point on the framework and balance sheet is that the weighing of benefits and   cost should take account of the circumstances  I think of this as situational awareness  If the   fiscal trajectory were going in a different direction, it would give us, in my view, more degrees   of freedom in thinking about how aggressive we can be on balance sheets  I would say an   objective assessment of prices and the risks around inflation is hard for us to pin down  If   deflation risks were more significant than I currently judge, my own assessment towards balance   sheet expansion would be materially different  If markets were in disarray, I would also measure   the likely benefits higher  Our policy efficacy in periods of extraordinary times is quite different,   it strikes me, from the policy efficacy during benign periods, even if the benign periods involve a   suboptimal recovery   Let me turn now to alternative B  I think the alternative B handed around the table now   is an improvement over the alternative B in the Tealbook  My concern with the earlier version is   that it basically said that “the conditions precedent for further action have now been established”    But it did not ultimately announce the decision to deploy those assets  It’s as if the missiles are   ready, but we’re still waiting for the launch codes, and I think that would have been confusing to   markets  The current version of alternative B does a bit better job of saying that we remain   open-minded on the data, both on the inflation front and on the employment front, and it does   preserve optionality for us and does not overpromise to markets that this judgment is, in fact,   locked and loaded   September 21, 2010 112 of 151             I would consider it an improvement of this version of alternative B if we were to soften   paragraph 4 modestly  While President Kocherlakota and others have offered some ideas about   how to do that in a way that doesn’t defeat the purpose of our discussion today, my suggestion   would simply be to change the word “as” to “if”  So paragraph 4 would read, “The Committee   will continue to monitor the economic outlook and financial developments and is prepared to   provide additional accommodation if needed to support economic recovery,” etc  That adds   some conditionality that I think a large majority of folks around here want, and, by using the   word “prepared,” I still think it does show that we have made some progress in comparison to   where we were some weeks ago, but, again, it’s not locked and loaded  That’s just a suggestion,   but in either version, I could support alternative B with that suggestion  Thank you      Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll begin by saying that, on substance, I find   myself increasingly out of step with the views of the Committee  My own views haven’t changed   much since we met last time, but, after hearing comments from others in the intermeeting period, I   think there is a growing divide  I’m going to try to answer the questions, but they do seem, as a   couple of people suggested, to point towards a more aggressive policy action  I don’t mean to dwell   on the underlying substance, but it will creep into these remarks a little bit   I think the big question, which stands on top of the four that were listed, is  What’s the   objective of the new framework?  Newness in and of itself doesn’t seem to me to be a sufficient   virtue  So I’ve been able to gather a couple of objectives of changing frameworks at this time  The   first purportedly is to demonstrate a clearer commitment to a desired inflation level  In this case, I   tend to think we run the risk of “protesting too much” by waving our arms around with renewed   commitments—I thought the old commitment was pretty serious  I’m confident that we have the   strong will and capability and leadership to deal with risks to price stability, should they arise  So   that makes me a little less inclined to a dramatic new framework, unless we consider ourselves fully   ready and on board   October 15, 2010 49 of 62             The second objective of a new framework would be to communicate clearly the economic   circumstances that would drive our balance sheet expansion, which would then transmit presumed   benefits to the real economy  I’m not sure how well the illustrative statements accomplish that   objective  It’s not the fault of the statements, mind you  Rather, I think the problem is that none of   us are all that comfortable with our level of understanding of the dynamics between changes in the   balance sheet and resulting changes in economic performance   Let me turn to the questions  Question 1  Which alternative way of specifying monetary   policy appeals to you?  Let me dismiss a couple of them  I do not favor the adoption of an explicit   inflation objective and quantitative judgment about maximum employment  I think we shouldn’t   expect our credibility to be enhanced on inflation from a more explicit target  Inflation expectations   are a function of how we act and are perceived to act  They aren’t strengthened by making   midcourse changes in policy formulation that make more explicit the issues that folks and markets   already well appreciate  It also strikes me as a particularly bad time to change a framework  This is   not our moment of maximum certainty on prices, so perhaps we’re trying to do too much   What about maximum sustainable employment?  At this moment, it doesn’t strike me as   predominantly determined by the stance of monetary policy, whereas price stability does  And   introducing them both explicitly into our framework suggests to me an apples-to-apples comparison   that belies the reality  Moreover, putting the unemployment rate or the NAIRU in our statement   strikes me as putting still more burden on ourselves, and I think there is agreement among a large   majority of us that that burden needs to be shared more broadly among other policymakers, and I   worry about letting them off the hook  What about price- level targeting?  I don’t favor that either    I think it could be too easily perceived as changing the goalposts and allowing higher inflation on a   more permanent basis, even though the literature and staff memo presume it would be temporary  I   October 15, 2010 50 of 62             guess that leaves us with the third alternative, the qualitative dual mandate approach  To me, it’s   certainly the least objectionable, but I don’t really see compelling reasons why it is preferred over   our current standard or framework  But I suppose there are various gradations in between that we   could all grow comfortable with   Question 2  If additional policy accommodation is needed, would you favor additional   LSAPs?  In a word  No, not now  I won’t dwell, Mr Chairman, on the risk-reward tradeoff  My   sense is that none of us really know the probabilities of the downside risks associated with a second   round of quantitative easing, but I do think we have an idea of how bad the situation could get if   those downside risks materialized  How bad would it be in foreign exchange markets?  How bad   would it be for capital flows to the US?  What would other policymakers around the world do to   react and overcompensate?  What would the impact on headline commodity prices be?  What about   removing the burden from our fiscal authorities?  I can go on and on   Unlike some others, I’m not terribly heartened by the market movements since our last   meeting  They certainly prove that the Federal Reserve can move market prices, but, other than   that, it doesn’t tell me too much  It’s these prices over the long horizon, it’s the anxieties that could   build over time, that are really more of a concern   But I think your second question in number 2 is a good one  “What other tool do you think   would be more effective?”  My first instinctive answer, Mr Chairman, is that there are a lot of   tools—they’re just not principally related to what the Federal Reserve does  But what about us?    That doesn’t mean we should just sit here and do nothing  I must say, I strongly support the idea   that providing forward guidance, without an absolute commitment on a second round of quantitative   easing, paves the way for us to take action, if necessary  I, for one, could be very supportive of   more quantitative easing if the inflation picture warranted it or if an exogenous shock warranted it;   October 15, 2010 51 of 62             as before, we would be well placed to take these actions  But I don’t think undertaking more   quantitative easing in advance of such events does much to dissipate the prospects of those shocks   Question 3  What about larger discrete adjustments or smaller more continuous ones?  In all   candor, I would say my answer to that is burdened by my policy disposition  If the FOMC does   decide to go in the direction of expanding our balance sheet, it strikes me that, if the additional   purchases are more limited, more circumscribed, then that provides us some more flexibility—not a   lot but some more—allowing us the opportunity to walk back should there be a shock along the   lines that many of us have talked about  I realize that some may say, “Well, markets have now   come to expect very big numbers  Markets have come to expect some version of ‘shock and awe’”    But I think we don’t have “shock and awe” left at this point  And it seems to me that, almost   regardless of what we do, markets will be “disappointed” by what ends up happening after our next   meeting  So I think it’s best to preserve our options, and, if risks become more obvious after our   November meeting, our having taken more limited actions does provide you, Mr Chairman, and the   rest of us with the proper ability to turn back   Question 4  Are the sample statements good models?  Well, I think the statements are quite   provocative  I would say that draft statement 1 expresses more serious concerns about deflation   risks than I believe are warranted  But, again, I think the problem isn’t in the statements or the   structures  I think the problems really are in our understanding, namely, what is our objective, how   is that accomplishing it, and what weights do we put on the benefits and the costs?   Lastly, on the question of press conferences, my own view is much closer to Governor   Yellen’s  I think a press briefing, where you choose the venue and time, minimizing the chance for   reporters to play a game of “gotcha,” might be the best way forward  It preserves the ability to go   more broadly with press conferences in the future  I think the purpose of the press briefing isn’t to   October 15, 2010 52 of 62             show that we’re out there and happy to take all comers—I think you do that frequently—but rather   the purpose of the press briefing is to describe what we’ve done, why we’ve done it, and I think   doing it in a way that’s quiet and around a table—perhaps on the record, perhaps off—is the best   way to go for now  Thank you       Brian, given the understandable preference for Treasury purchases in   roughly the 3- to 10-year range, what’s your view on the widening gap between 10- and 30-year   rates, which flows out of that preference?  Is this a source of concern?  What do we think are the   implications for corporate finance more broadly?  That is, given that we’re driving down rates   for 5- and 10-year Treasuries, are we changing issuers’ own thinking about where they want to   fund and for what sort of term and duration?     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Like many of you, I will start narrowly and   then go broader  The report on economic activity in my neighborhood in Georgetown is strong    [Laughter]  Also, President Dudley mentioned that he visited upstate New York, where I’m   from, and he noted that the economy there appeared to be “hunkered down”  That’s not a near-  term phenomenon—it’s been going on for about 40 years  [Laughter]  He also noted that the   economy there was at a tipping point, and that is true, but the only way it ever tips is over  So,   Governor Raskin, I did that just so you could see a contrast between Governor Yellen’s formal,   proper, prepared remarks and my more ad hoc remarks, and you can decide which one is your   model   I’ll comment on three subjects  first, financial markets, which I think have changed most   since we met in a meeting here last time; second, inflation; and third, the economy   Since our last scheduled FOMC meeting, financial market prices have moved up, in large   part, because of their expectations about all of us  I take that kind of move differently from one   in which the market seemed to be responding to real data on either the global economy or the   US economy  Let me offer five takeaways from that  First, we should not be either surprised   or particularly comforted that we can move asset prices around  Our communications have   proved that we have the power to do that  That doesn’t mean that the direction in which they’re   moving is good or bad, but I don’t take a three- or four- or five-week summary and take   immediate comfort   November 2–3, 2010 81 of 238             Second, the Tealbook indicates significant benefits—over and above prior Tealbook   versions—to the real economy from these policy-induced, intermeeting, “improvements” in   foreign exchange, equity, and credit markets  Purportedly, these benefits come through wealth   effects and, maybe most importantly, through export channels to the real economy  And the   Tealbook expects these trends to continue with some force  I must admit to being uneasy about   these trend lines going forward—I’m less certain of the resulting benefits, leery of the potential   costs, and far less inclined to believe that these moves are necessarily persistent and durable    And with respect to the foreign exchange markets, it’s still not obvious to me whether these   moves are, in fact, more dangerous than desirable over the medium term   Third, the Tealbook does not extrapolate the recent increases in market prices for   commodities into the future—instead, it follows the typical convention of tracking down quotes   from futures markets and, as a result, has nonfuel commodity prices moving broadly down from   these levels next year  This is a key assumption in the model  I’m skeptical that these recent   increases in commodity prices are all to the good, that is, that they’re all helping nominal growth   or helping the state of the US economy, and I’m far less sure that the prices of these   commodities will fall accordingly to the Tealbook estimates   Fourth—the credit markets  The credit markets are flying  Brian accurately reported in   his discussion at the beginning that spreads are compressing, new issuers who did not have   access now do, the all-in cost of funding is falling fast, and the queues are lining up outside of   Wall Street firms to access these markets  If you look at the high-yield market, you see new   volumes, you see improved prices and improved terms  As a result, many businesses that, 6 or   12 months ago, I would have described as having broken capital structures and facing a   bankruptcy process are now seeing those deals being delayed, deferred, or renegotiated; and   November 2–3, 2010 82 of 238             there are many sponsors of these in the corporate world and in the real estate world who could   not be happier at the prospects of easier monetary policy  I haven’t heard such positive reports   about the credit market since early 2007, and that didn’t seem to go so well   Fifth—the stock market  It is, of course, good news that equity prices have moved up,   but I’m less convinced of their durability if this achievement is mostly because of what we’re   doing here in the FOMC rather than because of what’s going on in the real economy  To sum   up, I take a less positive signal than the Tealbook does that what we’ve seen in the intermeeting   period is as durable as we would need it to be to produce all the benefits to the real economy that   the Tealbook suggests   Let me turn to inflation  Recent measures of inflation look low and stable to me, and the   recent trends for non-US growth, oil, commodities, and the dollar, suggest to me pressures that   will push prices higher in 2011 than the Tealbook suggests  The Tealbook has prices of core   imports up 5 percent this quarter and projects that nonfuel commodity prices will increase at an   annual rate of 30 percent this quarter—that is a move up of 20 percentage points above the prior   Tealbook, a very notable change—and the Tealbook assumes that movements in the prices of   energy and imports will only have minor implications for domestic inflation  That may be, but   I’m less certain   Let me make a second point on inflation, consistent with what some of you have already   said  My dialogues with business leaders have turned markedly—that is, even with large pools   of unemployed that are ostensibly keeping wage pressures low, nonwage costs are finally   working their way through the system  The pass-through of commodity prices into final goods in   consumer and industrial sectors is real, and it does impact my view of the inflation pressures in   2011  Moreover, anecdotes of increases in commercial and residential rents, increases in prices   November 2–3, 2010 83 of 238             for rental cars, increases in prices for airline fares, and increases in room rates across hotels is a   more significant change from the providers and leaders in this industry than any that I’ve seen in   my time at the Federal Reserve  It’s true that those are just finding their way into the system   now, and they could well be overwhelmed by what’s happening on the wage side, but, again, I   must admit to not being so sure  What’s the driver of this change in rents?  What’s the driver of   the change in airline prices?  I would say it’s mostly restricted supply  It’s mostly no new   buildings and shopping centers coming on line for reasons we’ve all discussed—very few new   market entrants, considerably less competition in some of these businesses  So I believe that   many of these costs will find their way into sales prices—but time will tell   The third and final point on inflation, Mr Chairman, is about inflation expectations    They’ve moved up, and they’ve moved around quite a bit, and I wouldn’t be surprised if they   moved up a bit more  Policy seems to be encouraging that, and, while some take comfort in that,   I must say I measure that comfort with a little bit of concern as well   Now let me turn to the economy  The US economy continues to be mired in a sluggish   recovery  The adjectives that many of you used are adjectives that I would use, but I would   suggest that the ability of us around the table to have a material effect on that contour is   overstated  Changes in fiscal, regulatory, and trade policies, which are long in the making and   which have been unfriendly to economic growth for several years, are, I think, the most   responsible party  And I do not expect the economy to turn durably in a more constructive   direction until these other macroeconomic policies stop being so growth-defeating   My own projections for economic growth and employment continue, for about the tenth   meeting, to put me among the most pessimistic about near-term economic growth  Harm is   being done to the supply side of the economy, and I share the staff’s view that the NAIRU has   November 2–3, 2010 84 of 238             moved up  I don’t know how permanent that will be—I think that’s a function of what happens   with these other policies, and I fear that potential GDP has really slipped   The Fed is capable of a lot of things, but it’s not capable, in my view, of moving the dial   tremendously on economic growth from here  In that sense, it makes our current situation quite   different from the situation when we were deeply involved in addressing the crisis, and the risk-  reward tradeoff using nonstandard tools is different from when we use conventional policy    Thank you     Thanks, Brian  I have a couple of questions  First, the way you describe   the 35 percent cap seems a little different from what’s in the statement you distributed  As I   understand it, you don’t anticipate going above the cap, but you’re saying it might happen on   occasion, in which case you just want to make sure you have the flexibility to deal with that    The statement says that we’re suspending the per-issue limit and that some holdings will be   allowed to move up “only incrementally,” and I’m not sure that conveys the same thought  Can   you help me understand how you and the Desk will act on these Treasuries so that you’re not   restrained, yet you also don’t signal to markets that there is no longer a cap?  That is, can this   language be toughened?  For example, could you say in this statement, “We are going to suspend   the 35 percent limit  We still expect, by and large, to comply with it, but we have asked for and   received flexibility as needed to move above it for the following reasons?”  I worry a bit that this   could get misperceived and the Desk might be seen as entering these markets and in some ways   threatening to be more of a price-maker than a price-taker  Maybe you can help me understand   what you think your practice will be and whether this language can be made less open-ended and   still let you do your job     This is all about operations, and I honestly don’t mean to be litigating the   policy question now, which we’re going to come to later  Is there a way to describe this that still   seems to put bounds as well as to communicate your expectations to the market?  That is,   suppose you said something like, “our expectations are to be consistent generally with the   35 percent limit,” which markets have long understood, and then put a semicolon or comma and   then describe ways in which you have been given license from the FOMC to go above it in   certain cases  I think that would give the notion that this is not a grand change in practice, so that   markets wouldn’t feel as though New York is unconstrained  I just worry that, as written, it   looks as though the Desk will, frankly, use more liberties than you anticipate necessarily needing   to and wanting to use   November 2–3, 2010 117 of 238               Yes     Again, I just encourage you to think about the language in the statement    Think about the FAQs, and see if you can’t constrain yourself with the language in a way that   gives you the flexibility you need to take whatever judgments the Committee comes to  Just as   an open point, and I’m happy to be helpful   Second, on the listing of the purchases as $110 billion per month and a total size of $850   to $900 billion in the statement, I have one cosmetic suggestion  I understand that that is a   function of two things  your expectation of what the Committee will authorize today, along with   November 2–3, 2010 118 of 238             the reinvestments  But the numbers that are in the FOMC statement and the numbers here are   different, that is, the FOMC statement just talks about the additions  So in your statement I   encourage you to disaggregate it into the two pieces  My suggestion would be simply to break   down the $110 billion per month into its two constituent components and to break down the $850   to $900 billion into its two constituent components, just so that people see the connection   between what we are authorizing and what you’re doing and so that it doesn’t look as though the   FOMC is giving one message and the Desk is giving a separate message to dealers who have   expectations closer $1 trillion than to $500 billion     Yeah, but I think the $75 billion doesn’t show up     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll begin with my views on policy  I’ll end   with a discussion of my vote  In between, I’ll discuss some of the broad themes you and others   raised about of why we’re moving in this direction and try to provide a countervailing view  I’ll   talk about some of the additional risks to this approach that haven’t been mentioned in any great   detail, and I will ask for a modest change in the statement   First, my views on policy  As I said when we met by videoconference, my views are   increasingly out of step with the views of most people around this table  The path that you’re   leading us to, Mr Chairman, is not my preferred path forward  I think we are removing much of   the burden from those that could actually help reach these objectives, particular the growth and   employment objectives, and we are putting that onus strangely on ourselves rather than letting it   rest where it should lie  We are too accepting of dangerous policies from others that have been   long in the making, and we should put the burden on them   I can think, Mr Chairman, of a tough weekend that the Europeans had, particularly your   counterpart at the ECB, in the spring or summer, when we all knew that the European Central   Bank, rightly or wrongly, was going to take action  But Jean-Claude Trichet did not take action   until very late that Sunday night, until the fiscal authorities did their part  He thought that if on   Friday night he were to say all of the things he’d be willing to do, he’d be taking the burden off   the fiscal authorities  He chose to wait  I think we would be far better off waiting  If we   proceed on this path, as I suspect we will, I would still encourage you to put the burden where it   rightly belongs, which is on other policymakers here in Washington, and to do so in a way that is   respectful of different lines of responsibility   Like some around the table, I think the risk-reward trade-off in this exercise is poor  The   benefits strike me as small and fleeting  The risks strike me as unknown, uncertain, and   November 2–3, 2010 176 of 238             potentially large  If this were some one-off game and we were in the final state, I suspect we   could get away with it  There wouldn’t be huge benefits  There wouldn’t be any reputational   consequences  There’d be no effect on others, and we could take all of their behavior as given    But it is not  This is a game that will be run many times over in the ensuing months and, I’m   afraid, years, and if we run this game long enough, the risks that I and some others have talked   about, I’m afraid, will materialize  Thus, if you do take us in this direction, the policy must be to   see if we can’t get in this game and out of this game before these risks materialize   Let me talk broadly about a few themes about why some think this will be effective, and   provide my own views  I won’t talk in the language of the academy, but I will talk in the   language of markets   I’ve heard three themes  One is that we’re going to get financial markets to provide a lot   more benefit to the real economy, and we’ll get a virtuous circle  Higher asset prices will end up   driving more consumer wealth, more confidence  Business leaders and consumers will feel   better, and that will find its way into the real economy  In my view, that’s a risky proposition  I   do not think of financial markets and the real economy as separate, as exogenous to one another    They are two ways of looking at the same underlying phenomena   And my own view, Mr Chairman, is that sometimes financial markets get ahead of the   real economy  Sometimes the real economy gets ahead of financial markets  But when one gets   too far away from the other, it is usually pretty ugly when they ultimately converge, and I am   skeptical that we can persuade and convince asset prices to do the hard work that needs to be   done on the real economy side for anything more, perhaps, than a fleeting period  I am skeptical   that further lowering risk-free rates across the curve will last long enough for these confidence   and wealth effects to find their way into the real economy   November 2–3, 2010 177 of 238             My own take on the capital markets, Mr Chairman, as you know, is that we’ve had these   “risk on” and “risk off” days  Markets don’t seem to me to be making hard decisions that they   like this asset and not that, that they like this country and not that, that they like this industry and   not that  Instead, they seem to be making judgments based on us  They seem to be full of   confidence some days, and in full retreat on others  So I worry about putting too much burden   on the financial markets to do the work of dragging up the real economy  I think that is a risky   proposition   Second, there’s an argument about increasing inflation and the benefits that could bring    In my view, this attacks a risk that is not predominant with a tool that is not fine-tuned in an   environment that is not conducive  I’ll call this argument the nominal revenue argument  This   argument says that, with higher inflation, businesses are going to have higher revenues  They’re   going to feel better because their top line is moving  They’re then going to be more inclined to   invest more  They’re going to grow capital expenditures  This will happen everywhere around   the economy, and we’ll be in a better place  I don’t believe it  I don’t believe that will lead to   lower unemployment  I don’t think those CEOs will be fooled that their costs haven’t increased   as much as their revenue  I think they’ll be very focused on their profit margins  And, as some   have said, I don’t think that we really do have much of a deflation problem  If the judgment of   the majority of this group is that we do, it strikes me that there are better tools, more effective   tools, for raising inflation and inflation expectations than buying these longer-term assets  I can   imagine that a speech or two by the Chairman of the Federal Reserve—with your credibility,   your insight, and your persuasive abilities—would do much of the hard work that this balance   sheet expansion is doing   November 2–3, 2010 178 of 238             The third argument that I’ve heard is about foreign exchange, and I think even those who   do believe that there are real benefits in terms of net exports from weakening the foreign   exchange value of the dollar, are hesitant and rightly so to say those words in public venues    They don’t consider that to be politically correct  I think there’s a good reason for that  I think   it’s a dangerous policy  I think it is risky pool playing in the foreign exchange markets, asking   them to do so much of our work when the world’s recovery is resting on this  I think this is a   particularly risky strategy when you have the world’s reserve currency  If we were monetary   policymakers in the UK or other places, and it turned out that we got a little ahead of ourselves,   so that gilts weren’t valued as much as we had thought they would be, well, the gilt market   would be a little bit confused for a while, but it wouldn’t change fundamentally the value   underpinning every asset everywhere in the world  So I worry about playing in these markets  I   don’t think that that’s one that’s likely to yield benefits  While there could be some   improvement in net exports—and I don’t want to dismiss that—I think these other risks are much   more significant, and I think about investment that goes in the opposite direction of these net   exports  If the world comes to not believing in the underlying value of our currency, then at   some point the world will say, “That is not where I want to be investing my excess reserves and   excess cash”   Those are brief responses to, I think, well-intended arguments in terms of channels by   which this could work  Let me make a few other points about tools and risks  As I mentioned, I   think we’re underestimating the risks of interfering in size and in force in the longer-term   Treasury market, and I think that Brian and his colleagues have a very difficult job to try to be   price-takers and not price-makers in these markets  As I mentioned, this is not a one-off game    We’ve already seen examples of ad hoc interventions by policymakers around the world that can   November 2–3, 2010 179 of 238             interrupt capital flows and cause some retrenchment from globally integrated monetary and trade   architectures, and I think this is very risky  I think the adoption of nonstandard tools introduces   new uncertainties about the conduct of policy, which I haven’t heard reasonably and finely   understood by this group  In addition, by using such expansionary policies now, we are risking   leaving ourselves ill-prepared for an exogenous global shock which I cannot anticipate  It might   have nothing to do with the policies that we’re putting in place, but, boy, oh, boy, I don’t know   how we’d respond if a shock happened anywhere else around the world   Let me raise two more concerns before going to the statement  One is the stagecraft  I   would say that all of us want the policy that comes out of the Fed to be successful  Part of that   policy success depends on what a former member of this group called “theater” and what I’d call   “stagecraft”  I don’t think the stagecraft over the last six weeks has been optimal, and I look to   Governor Yellen’s subcommittee to see if we can’t improve that, because I wouldn’t dismiss the   importance of the formation of these views and communication of these views to the ultimate   success of our policies   Second, I’d like to build on a point that Narayana and a couple of others made about exit    The exit plan is not fully understood by me  It’s not obvious to me when we will stop expanding   the balance sheet  It’s not obvious to me what will satisfy our conditions of saying, “Yes, this   worked,” or, “No, that didn’t work”  Instead I fear that, if the unemployment rate remains, in the   language of the moment, “unacceptably high,” it’s not obvious to me that this Committee has   explained to markets why they would no longer be willing to go down this path of QE2 and   beyond   Let me turn to the statement and see whether I can’t make a modest proposal to try to   bridge some of these risks in what is, in my view, a very suboptimal set of outcomes  I won’t   November 2–3, 2010 180 of 238             focus on a lot of the suggestions that have been put forward, though I’m sympathetic to them    Very simply, in paragraph 3, I would suggest that you would have a better chance of succeeding   and that we have a better chance of communicating if we were simply to reverse the order of the   operative sentence on asset purchases  I don’t think this makes a ton of difference, but it   certainly would make me more comfortable  So I would rewrite the final sentence of   paragraph 3 as follows “In addition, the Committee intends to purchase additional long-term   Treasury securities at an average pace of about $75 billion, which is intended to constitute a total   increase of $600 billion by the end of the second quarter of 2011”   Now, I don’t like anything about alternative B  I am not in love with this sentence in any   formation, but I think that change at least captures what I take away as maybe my own reading of   alternative B, which is that we’re going to move at $75 billion a month, and adheres to your   suggestion yesterday, Mr Chairman, which I took very seriously, that we are going to try to   monitor these risks and we are going to be very attentive to developments  By putting that first,   it strikes me that you’re giving yourself at least the option that you will be prepared to take   action if these risks materialize  The $600 billion then is the summation of that expectation, but I   do think it would go some way toward suggesting that this thing is not on total autopilot, given   the risks that I see   I won’t comment in any great detail on what others have put forward on the statement  I   do consider the use of the word “unacceptably” in paragraph 2 to be really odd and not   something that we could well explain  So I don’t think that that’s useful  I’m also sympathetic   to Richard’s suggestions on inflation, mostly because I don’t think we want to suggest we have a   ton of work to do on the inflation front   November 2–3, 2010 181 of 238             So having given you my views, having told you I think probably more than you or   anyone wants to know about my sense of the risks, and having made a modest suggestion to   alternative B, let me try to talk a little bit about my vote  How in light of all this do I justify not   dissenting?  If I were in your chair, I would not be leading the Committee in this direction, and   frankly, if I were in the chair of most people around this room, I would dissent  My respect for   you during this last four and a half years is incredibly high  I am awed by the burdens that you   are confronting, and I wouldn’t want to undermine at this important moment the chance that this   program could be successful  I know a lot of people around this table feel total conviction on the   opposite side of where I do   I think this is called the Bernanke Fed for a reason  I’ve got a lot of confidence that if the   risks that I talk about materialize, you will not hesitate and you will change your view, you will   change this experiment  That’s not just a hypothetical—when we did the LSAPs the first time,   we did a $300 billion Treasury purchase, which I did not think was a good idea, and you stopped   it because it was not working, and we pivoted to these mortgage-backed securities  There, again,   I had my own misgivings, but I think that was more fertile ground  As I had mentioned then and   frequently since, that market was broken long before we ever found it  So, I think you did some   good there in the crisis, and I’ve seen your willingness to change your view, and I will count on   that if these risks that I talk about, however unlikely, do end up materializing   Let me talk about what could change my support for alternative B, which, as I’ve   indicated, I offer with the greatest reluctance  If inflation were to move up and were to be   broadly consistent with the implicit inflation target in different people’s minds around this room,   even if unemployment were unacceptably high, I think that would be time to stop this program    If inflation expectations were to move out of the range that they have been in for a long time, that   November 2–3, 2010 182 of 238             would be a reason to end this program, even if unemployment were exceptionally high and GDP   were well below what we think the economy is ultimately capable of  And if these other risks   that I talked about did materialize in the foreign exchange markets, I’m confident that you would   be unafraid to change your views on that   What about the wording in alternative B?  The version of alternative B that I can, with the   greatest reluctance, not dissent from suggests that the LSAP program is, in fact, limited, that the   judgments that are being made on this incremental $75 billion are circumscribed, and that the   program is subject to serious regular review  I must admit that I don’t like the phrase   “continuous review” because I don’t like the idea that it is every day that markets might worry   whether our views change  So “regular review” or “periodic review,” which might coincide with   FOMC meetings, but obviously could coincide with market events, strikes me as a little better    Ultimately, I think that’s subject to rigorous review, and if this program were to end at $300   billion instead of $600 billion, as the first attempt did, then I suspect we probably haven’t done   too much harm   So if my reading of this and my reading of your willingness, Mr Chairman, to change   course is right, and if these judgments were to materialize and the reaction function of this   Committee were to change, then I can support it  I will have no choice but to dissent, I think, at   future meetings if these risks materialize and if these benefits don’t end up coming  This is   maybe a little bit more than you wanted to know on my personal struggle on this and also on the   risks that I see  Thank you     Or “unacceptably slow”  [Laughter]     You had “including,” not “concerning” in your version, Mr Chairman,   because that’s not the only piece—     Are there things we’re missing that are not included in that new phrase?     I’m fine with Narayana’s suggestion—I think it’s great  I just wouldn’t   want to limit the range of things the public understands to be part of our reaction function  We   should have our eyes wide open, and, if Narayana thinks it’s prudent, as do you, to reference one   of those, that’s fine, but it shouldn’t be to the exclusion of a broader set of issues     We’ve already said twice in the statement that the objectives are inflation   and economic growth     Just one question  What’s wrong with my proposal, if we’re using the   identical words?  Teach me—what’s your hesitation?     I don’t really understand  I’m not suggesting that we exclude putting a   number in  I’m only suggesting that we begin by stating what we are now committing to do,   November 2–3, 2010 204 of 238             with the same verbiage on intents and expectations; that is, this is what we have decided to do   today, and the news is the $75 billion per month  I don’t really understand why it defeats the   purpose of your and the majority’s objective by simply saying “beginning with what we have   decided to do today,” with your very expectation of what is going to happen by the end of the   second quarter     I think it makes it clear that, should the risks materialize, however remote   they may be, the path could change     Well, I think for all the fights that we’ve had about the right policy, the   delta between your ask and my ask is de minimis, so neither of us should be prepared to go crazy   about it  [Laughter]  But I would say it does indicate to me, if I understand the fierce views held   by many, a certain lack of comfort with revisiting this, because I’m talking about the exact same   words  I won’t fall on my sword over it, but I must say I’m puzzled by why this would be   something that causes concern, with the exact same words and the exact same numbers  I think   it tries to put the emphasis on what I took from your statements yesterday and today, which is   that you’re going to review this regularly, and, if the risks arise, you’re going to stop  Instead, by   leading with $600 billion, it says “It will be $600 billion, and now I’m going to tell you how   we’re going to get there”  I think those are different messages  I won’t change my vote because   of it, but I must say I’m concerned by the fervor on the other side of the question   November 2–3, 2010 205 of 238               Sure  “In addition, the Committee intends to purchase additional long-  term Treasury securities at an average pace of about $75 billion per month, which is intended to   constitute a total of $600 billion by the end of the second quarter of 2011”     I mean, I didn’t change any words, so it’s hard for me to understand that     Because I think what we’re trying to announce is what we’re doing,   right?  And what we’re doing, by virtue of this action, is this amount  Again, I’d say there is not   a huge difference between us, and I appreciate your moving the other sentence up, but the   fervency of the Bernanke-Dudley views on this does strike me as suggesting a difference      Thank you, Mr Chairman  I don’t think the most important development   since we last met is the improvement in the real economic data, though that is certainly   significant  I also don’t think it’s the continuing strains in Europe, which many of us have talked   about for a long time, though that also is significant  I think the most important development   since we last met is the change, level, and uncertainty with respect to longer-term Treasuries    The 10-year Treasury, the benchmark security, seems to have awakened from its slumber, and I   suspect that we will be talking about the uncertainty in the rate increasingly going forward   Now, for those of us who were supportive of the last round of policy action, it is tempting   to say that all that has happened is all to the good and was perfectly predictable  For those of us   who were uncomfortable with our last policy action, it is tempting to ascribe all bad facts and   circumstances to it  I think that we all, myself included, need to resist that temptation  The   move in Treasuries is difficult to disaggregate, but, in my view, it is most likely a mix of both   benign and possibly less benign circumstances, and it bears significant watching   Let me try to make three objective, dispassionate assessments about why the level and   uncertainty of long-term Treasuries matters  First, I think it matters because it is the most   December 14, 2010 61 of 127             important asset anywhere in the world, and this value, this price, this uncertainty impacts every   price everywhere in the world  Second, I think the value of the 10-year Treasury has a   significant impact on other sovereign costs, particularly other stronger advanced foreign   economies—I’m thinking about Germany, France, Britain, and others  There’s a huge   correlation between movements in our own sovereign rates and theirs  As we think about the   funding costs for the periphery, it’s not just the spreads that will bear watching, but also the all-in   funding costs   Third, and probably of most import to all of us around the table, the move in Treasuries   matters because central banks’ ability to control, to impact, to manipulate, to influence, rates   along the Treasury curve, now appears more limited than the world had grown accustomed to   over the course of the last several years  At least some market participants thought that we   would be able to have a huge bearing on these rates in the next several years, and I think that   notion is likely to be revisited in real time  We can push asset prices around for a while, but   ultimately markets are going to determine these prices, and, I suspect, in the world of Treasuries,   markets are increasingly going to be setting those prices, and we will be observing them  So I   think it’s that development which bears watching  Markets and real economic actors will have to   adjust to the fact that the Fed’s actions are less determinative of this 10-year rate, and it bears   watching by all of us as we think about policy, both today and in the coming meetings  Thank   you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Given where the Committee finds itself   today, I can accept alternative B  Let me just make a couple of brief comments  First, I’m   comforted by the Committee’s commitment to subjecting the asset purchases to regular review,   but I don’t think that that means that at every meeting we should be tweaking or micromanaging   the asset purchase amount  I think that, in all likelihood, the most important policy judgment this   Committee will face next will be what to do after June  Obviously, we’ll have to debate that well   in advance of the end of the $600 billion purchases, but that is where the action is   During the intermeeting period, there were some interpretations of market chatter about   whether this Committee would fulfill its stated goal of purchasing $75 billion of Treasuries a   month and live up to the $600 billion headline number  I think that is a serious misreading of   December 14, 2010 99 of 127             what the market chatter and questions were about  Markets have wondered during this period   whether we would be doing more once the QE2 program ends  That continues to be their   question  As a result, I think we should be very careful about not prejudging that question  It   will be tempting, particularly in the new year, as we’re all speaking and communicating to   markets and giving our assessments on the economy, to put a thumb on the scale showing a bias,   describing what we’re comfortable or uncomfortable about  I think we’d be making a serious   mistake by starting to influence what the asset purchase profile or other policy options that   Narayana talked about might be once that period arrives  I think we would do ourselves far   greater favors by not being terribly newsy on what happens thereafter, and by being reasonably   stealthy about what our dispassionate analysis is yet suggesting, giving it more time   And so what should we be doing during the period of January, February, and March?  My   vote would be to describe what policy actions more broadly could be done by the US   government to help the economy grow at the level that we would all hope  So that’s a hope and   an expectation, because I worry that we could otherwise fall into a trap of again trying to make   news in the winter when we really aren’t yet, at least in my view, in a position to be making any   final decisions on what would happen in the post-June period  Thank you      Thank you, Mr Chairman  Brian, regarding the Treasury purchases, you   noted in the memo that we had, ex ante, understood that we would be breaching the old   35 percent rule of thumb, and in certain issues you found that we might be as high as 70 or   75 percent  My question is  Are those higher percents clustered in a certain place along the   Treasury curve, or are they randomly around the areas that we’re buying?  I ask, because there   would be greater concern if they were all around a particular term that would be of interest to   investors, for example, if they were all seven or eight years, whereas, if we were making the   market but doing so with issues spread more broadly over the curve, it would be less worrisome     As I understand it, the losses that could ultimately generate this deferred   asset would be losses that eat through the income and are the realized losses on the assets that are   actually sold  This doesn’t account for imputed losses on assets comparable with those that were   sold, if they were somehow marked to market at that point  The question that comes out of this   is  Do you think markets would, if we are in that sale mode, look through the assets that are not   marked to market and query whether or not there are higher embedded losses that they should   look through in order to evaluate the capital adequacy, to the extent that it matters, of the Fed’s   balance sheet?     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Like many of you, I am encouraged not only   by the improved economic data but also by the new tone in Washington  I’m sure many of you   saw that last night the Congress had people sitting cross-party, cross-philosophy, and, in doing   so, I think they’re following our lead  After all, we’ve got Narayana and Charlie sitting next to   each other, and Janet and me sitting next to each other  As for Jeff, we’ve got him surrounded    [Laughter]  I’m not sure whether that new tone of civility is going to carry through the balance of   our discussion today   January 25–26, 2011 128 of 282              In preparing my remarks, I had at first entitled them, “No Nation Is an Island”  But then I   realized that some nations actually are islands [laughter], so I put a new title to my remarks    “The US Is Not an Island”  Let me talk about the US economy first as if it were an island,   because my sense is that developments in the United States would be considered quite   encouraging in that case  We look a bit stronger and a bit more settled from the perspective of   markets and the economy and politics  But beyond the island, the rest of the world looks   decidedly less settled, decidedly less strong  Focusing first on the United States, the   improvements on the real side of the economy appear to be real  I take a little less momentum   from recent data in the fourth quarter into my 2011 forecast, in part because of the arithmetic of   the GDP forecast that staff rightly took us through regarding net exports and so on  Still, there   are encouraging signs that the Tealbook forecasts going back a couple of sessions seem to be   more on point than off  Having said that, I’m still a bit more cautious than they are  Yet, I’m   impressed by tax revenues that are flowing into the federal government and into states and   municipalities, and I expect the deleveraging headwind to subside materially in 2011   I will spend most of my remarks, though, on the risks to this improving modal forecast,   given the current global policy conjuncture  Four risks come to mind  The first is geopolitics  I   see an incredibly unhealthy brew of divergent recoveries across the world, increases in food and   commodity prices, and, frankly, power vacuums in certain countries and certain regions    Second, as I will discuss in more detail, inflation—it’s getting hard and harder, in my view, to   deny inflation risks, if not real inflation problems, among many of our trading partners, and   that’s likely to lessen the flexibility that monetary policy has, at least in the eyes of many market   participants  Third, as I will also discuss in more detail, is sovereign funding costs  The costs of   capital for the countries that have been better prepared, better insulated, such as the United   January 25–26, 2011 129 of 282              States, Germany, and France, might well be the story of 2011  Fourth, as many people, including   Vice Chairman Dudley, described, is the European crisis  Before I get into those risks, I have to   note the improvements in financial markets, which continue to be highly supportive of the real   economy  Now, if any of those trends were upset, I think the consequences for the real economy   would be significant   If you view the Treasury yield curve as a rough and ready indicator for the state of the   domestic, or even the global, economy, you would have to note a few remarkable things  One is   the run-up in yields and the steepness of the curve, which is probably mostly about good   economic developments  The spread between the 30-year bond and the 2-year note has reached   its widest level in history in the intermeeting period, and that has certainly gotten my attention    At 398 basis points, that spread has surpassed the previous peak of February 2010 and has put   peaks from earlier recoveries in the rearview mirror  Now, at some level, this could mean a   robust recovery  It could mean that the markets are gaining confidence, that the risks of deflation   and double dip recessions are de minimis, and that’s a view I share   Why do I worry?  Because it also could be something else  It’s still hard for me to divine   what the Treasury curve is telling us  If term premiums were to move beyond the current levels,   which, according to memos from Nellie Liang and the group, appear normal, it could turn out   that sovereign funding costs for the advanced foreign economies like the United States move up   in 2011, not just as a sign of improved economic fundamentals  What else could cause the   spreads to widen?  Inflation risk premiums could  If they were to move up materially, output   gaps notwithstanding, Treasury curve steepening could make the recovery harder to pull off   Let me turn to some of those global risks  I would say, in sum, that the upside inflation   risks in the medium term are materially greater than the risks around GDP  Inflation risks are   January 25–26, 2011 130 of 282              spreading from the smaller emerging markets to the BRICs and the advanced foreign economies,   and the question is  Will they spread to us?  Start some months ago, even quarters ago, with the   situation in Vietnam and Indonesia  Then, take the narrative through increases in inflation risks   in Brazil, Russia, India, China, and, more recently, South Korea  Think about the policy   conundrums in the United Kingdom  Think about policy risks for the European Central Bank    You see many policy authorities taking ad hoc measures, in addition to policy rate changes, to try   to contain this surge in inflation  Some are successful and some are likely to have far less   positive consequences  I think markets perceive that policymakers are losing the flexibility to   respond should these inflation risks become more significant   None of the cases I’ve mentioned are perfect analogies to the situation in the United   States, but choosing a country that actually is an island—the United Kingdom—might be the   best example we can find  In spite of large spare capacity, austerity in fiscal projections, and a   series of one-off factors that are no doubt driving headline inflation, inflation risks have many   worried  Governor King gave a strident and, I daresay, strong defense of the United Kingdom’s   monetary policy yesterday, but he was forced to acknowledge that, over the course of the last   46 months, inflation has been above the Bank of England’s target for 41 of those months  At   some point, he seemed to acknowledge that that could likely move up expectations, and he   would be prepared to take action  He noted upside risks to inflation, and I think many in markets   are taking that speech to suggest that he might need to do some modest monetary tightening,   even though that involves huge communication challenges and could do some harm to the   growth trajectory in the United Kingdom   I say this not because they’re in a situation that’s impossible  I say this not because the   analogy between them and us is perfect  But if you think about the good, healthy debates at the   January 25–26, 2011 131 of 282              Bank of England going back some months about whether they should engage in their own   version of QE2 and how divided they were, I suspect that that option is, at least given the current   set of facts, off the table  I think that should remind us that we need to be cautious, that we need   to be watching the data, and that the situation in front of us, even if the economy improves with   the vigor that the Tealbook suggests, could be one that is quite a difficult challenge for   policymakers   Finally, a risk related to continental Europe  One challenge that has been touched on   both by staff and many of you is the refinancings that are necessary in Europe over the course of   2011  They have $13 trillion that must be rolled over in the next 12 months  Most of that is   front-loaded, and most of that is funded in the short term  Market commentators seem to have   taken great comfort from the fact that many of those countries that need to roll over much of   their funding have been “successful” in doing so  But if you look closely at the successes in   funding by some of the peripheral countries, you might take far less comfort  First, many of the   buyers of the securities are many of the same institutions that give us concern  Second, many of   those that are buying the debt are doing so based on the implicit guarantee that the stronger   countries would be there to bail them out if anything went wrong  A couple of you noted that, to   the extent that the US economy only slowly but surely improves, we could see the European   problems find their way into our economy through financial markets  I think that is the most   likely channel for harm to the United States   Another takeaway for me from the European situation is that the core of Europe matters   most in 2011, that is, the situation in France and Germany  I think the reason that markets were   so nervous in the spring about problems in the periphery is that they weren’t sure whether   Germany was going to step up and foot the bill  Markets have now become convinced that   January 25–26, 2011 132 of 282              Germany has rededicated itself to the euro, that Germany has decided against some of the   screams within the political classes, and that it will defend the euro, so that now markets are less   nervous about problems in the periphery  I think that will hold true unless German sovereign   rates move away from them not because of improved economics, but because the contingent   liabilities of the periphery have to be paid for by someone, and markets demand that out of the   long end of the German yield curve  If that should occur, I would expect that the German   political leadership would have to revisit this cause  I can’t predict that it will occur, but, if it   does, I could see a scenario where sovereign rates at the long end move up pretty significantly in   most countries around the world   In addition, it’s not just core countries that will matter in 2011, but also core banks  I   think Eric made proper reference to the “strong banks” in Spain as one example  The CDS   spreads for a couple of the strong banks have moved  Regulators still seem to believe that they   are going to be just fine, that the bank restructurings that are necessary in Spain and in Germany   are not among the core institutions  But if that assumption turns out to be faulty, if it turns out   that these institutions do not have either the quality or the quantity of capital that they purport to   have, I would say all bets are off and the situation in Europe could become very significant   With that preoccupation with the downside risks, I will end where I began by saying the   data have been more comforting for us in the US, but our gaze will probably have to look over a   couple of oceans to decide whether our 2011 projections come true as many of us hope  Thank   you     We’re going to get to that in the communications section  [Laughter]     Thank you, Mr Chairman  President Bullard said that he hoped there   was no such thing as QE3  I don’t think I heard that the way he intended it, but it did pique my   interest  [Laughter]  Not to re-litigate old battles here—I suspect many of us have not changed   our ex ante views in light of incoming information—but my sense is that we would not be the   first in Washington to declare a highly debatable policy an enviable success and end it in due   course   On what basis could we say it was a success?  We could, I think rightly, look at the   change in the deflation risks and—much more so than any great successes on financial markets   or employment or GDP—take perhaps more credit for the change in inflation risks between the   January 25–26, 2011 181 of 282              time we announced the program and the time that we pivoted away from it  So I think that is the   way we hope that the $600 billion program is “successfully” accomplished, and we move on    The name of the game strikes me as always having been about what’s next  It was rarely a   question of whether we were going to do what we said we were going to do  I think we are   going to live up to our word and do the $600 billion, but the markets are still questioning what   happens next  In light of that, Mr Chairman, I favor alternative B   Regarding the language in paragraph 1, let me start by saying that I think President   Kocherlakota described a sequencing we all had in mind some time ago as we were provisionally   thinking about exit  Perhaps at the March meeting, or at a meeting thereafter, we might want to   describe the pivot in a way that markets could come to understand without adding unnecessary   uncertainty  One way to do this is to make the first paragraph quite a bit more upbeat than   paragraph 1 in alternative B, even if the rest of the language in the statement were exactly as it is   now  That would, I think, be a very useful way to signal to markets that we have with some   conviction changed our view to the upside on the status of growth, and would make them aware   that there is a very serious debate about policy going forward  So with that chess move in front   of us, it strikes me, frankly, that alternative B as written might be a little more cautious than   current market expectations  Markets seem to be more enamored with the recent economic data   than I sense that this group is  If we left the first paragraph of B as it is now and the data come in   on the upside, as we would hope between now and March, that might give us a very nice way to   describe in some careful, methodical way our change in views  Partly for that reason, and partly   because I think the consensus in this room is closer to paragraph 1 in B than in C, I’d favor B as   it is now with a view towards exit and next steps   January 25–26, 2011 182 of 282              On paragraph 3, Mr Chairman, I think staff has now rewritten this $80 billion per month   in a way such that it shows that the $80 billion is the arithmetic that comes out of the steady   commitment to do $600 billion  So I’m certainly open to the suggestion of President Fisher to   end the sentence at “2011,” but if New York and Brian and the guys feel that the per month basis   is the way in which they’ve communicated it and they’d rather that communication come from   us than the New York Desk, I think we’ve at least mitigated the risk that they overread what the   $80 billion per month is  To the extent we do add that new red language with $80 billion per   month, I think that’s additional impetus not to change another word in paragraph 3  So I prefer   the bracketed language to the new language therein  I support alternative B with those   suggestions     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I have a few broad comments  First, I view   this subcommittee that Governor Yellen is heading as important and the successor to a long set   of communications discussions  I don’t view the discussion that we’re having or should be   having as the “gotcha” committee because of particular ill things that we’re trying to root out  If   that comes out of a broader discussion of how we best communicate and what things are to be   avoided, that’s fine, but I don’t think that this should be reflected as somehow catching bad guys,   and that’s what is occupying our time   Second, I favor constitutions, not penal codes  I think the penal code concept suggests   somehow that there has been a grievous breach in decorum, respect, comity, civility  I haven’t   seen any of that, even in the big fights we’ve had over LSAPs  I think we run real risks to the   January 25–26, 2011 222 of 282              integrity of this organization if we decide that we’re going to set up controls, audits, systems,   processes, and procedures  We would look a lot like other agencies and a lot less like the Federal   Reserve a couple of years after that  So put me in the camp of constitutions  Constitutions aren’t   something that people can disobey  Constitutions matter  They impact people’s behavior    Views and interpretations of constitutions are important, but I think they’re very different from   penal codes  If you look at countries that start out with 10-page constitutions and then have   thousands of pages—I’m thinking of particular countries in South America—you see republics   that are breaking apart at the seams   Third, I think we’ve got different classes of counterparties, each of which demands a   different set of judgments  For example, regarding market participants, I agree with Charlie   Evans that you can get a lot out of having a discussion with them, so it strikes me as a discussion   that should be encouraged and not discouraged  That doesn’t mean there shouldn’t be rules of   the road  Another class is the people who stand between us and the real world to communicate—  I get nothing out of those discussions, though I see what they get  As a result, I would bring   different rules of the road to the frequency and necessity of those sorts of conversations  Finally,   there’s the press  I think that’s a different discussion from the one we’ve been having and it   should be thought of differently with different rules  I don’t have any perfect solutions but I   wouldn’t conflate the press with intermediaries who stand between us and financial markets   I have just two more  Fourth, the Chairman is different from the rest of us  And it strikes   me that not only is this Chairman different, but Chairmen are different, and we should think   about the discretion they might need, because their communication of policy is fundamentally   different from that of Governors and Presidents  As a result, I think we wouldn’t want to   constrain the Chairman with rules, particularly at times of crisis   January 25–26, 2011 223 of 282              Fifth, I think Bill rightly brings up the point of material, non-public information  Let me   combine that with the discussion about the need to communicate more, to tell people more about   what we think  In my view, the world hears from a lot of us all the time, and there’s a big   difference between the frequency of communication and their understanding of how we’re   thinking about policy  I don’t happen to share the view that more is always and everywhere   better  If I can only say to group X what I said in a public speech, then, for those of us who tend   to speak less frequently, you feel compelled to get your evolving set of thoughts on the record on   a monthly basis, otherwise you run afoul of the penal code  I don’t think that that’s necessarily   good  I trust everyone around here to make his or her own judgments about how frequently they   should speak, and I wouldn’t want to tie private comments to the most recent things that were   said in the speech to the local Rotary  Thank you
