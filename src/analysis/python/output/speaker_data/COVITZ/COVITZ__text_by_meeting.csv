8610,2008-12-15,COVITZ,"3  Thank you  I will be using the packet of charts that starts with  the staff presentation on financial markets  The charts for the other two presentations  are included in this packet and follow mine  As shown in the top left panel of your  first exhibit, long-term nominal Treasury yields posted their largest intermeeting  decline in over twenty years  The primary explanation for this decline, outlined to the  right, is that investors markedly revised down their economic outlook, leading both to  a lower expected path of monetary policy and to continued flight to high-quality  assets and away from securities with credit and liquidity risk  Yields also fell  following Fed communications regarding alternative monetary policy tools, such as  the purchase of long-term Treasury securities, agency debt, and mortgage-backed  securities      One measure of flight to quality, shown in the middle left panel, is the covariance   of percent changes in stock prices and Treasury yields  When investors pull back  from risk-taking, stock prices fall, and so do Treasury yields, resulting in a positive  covariance between the two  When flight-to-quality effects are substantial, prices in  both markets are volatile, making the covariance particularly large  In recent months,  the covariance soared to well beyond its 2002 peak  Since the October FOMC, it has  come down somewhat but remains extremely elevated, an indication of continued and  substantial flight to quality  Another perspective on investor perceptions is provided  by the equity risk premium, shown by the red shaded region in the panel to the right  and measured as the difference between a trend year-ahead earnings-to-price ratio on  S&P 500 stocks and a real long-run Treasury yield  This measure ballooned in mid- November as stock prices and Treasury yields fell and then narrowed a bit over the  past month, as indicated by the plus signs  Even so, the risk premium remains  extraordinarily wide     Yield spreads on 10-year corporate bonds, shown in the bottom left panel,   increased further over the intermeeting period  The spread on high-yield bonds (the  red line) topped 1,600 basis points, and the spread on BBB-rated bonds (the black  line) exceeded 600 basis points  The BBB spread is now comparable to average  levels recorded on similarly rated bonds during the Great Depression  Changes in  corporate bond spreads can be decomposed into changes in one-year forward spreads   As shown in the panel to the right, the 117 basis point intermeeting increase in the 10- year BBB spread reflects increases in forward spreads across the term structure,  consistent with investor flight to quality and away from risk  In addition, the forward  spreads ending in two years and five years increased more than the spread ending in  10 years, suggesting that investors have become more concerned about credit risk in                                                     3 The materials used by Mr Covitz, Ms Aaronson, and Mr Ahmed are attached to this transcript (appendix 3)   December 15–16, 2008 104 of 284    the medium term—that is, more concerned about the possibility of a protracted  economic downturn     Your next exhibit examines recent conditions in the commercial paper market    As shown in the top left panel, outstanding financial CP and ABCP (the black and red  lines) dropped in September and October but since then have partially rebounded  In  contrast, nonfinancial commercial paper outstanding (the blue line) has been  relatively flat, although nonfinancial programs rated A2/P2 (not shown) have  contracted roughly 40 percent since early September  The noticeable increases in  financial CP and ABCP around the time of the last FOMC meeting reflect the  implementation of the Federal Reserve’s commercial paper funding facility (CPFF),  which ramped up quickly and now holds roughly $300 billion of highly rated  commercial paper  The recent stability is also likely due to flows back into prime  money market funds since early November (shown by the red bars above the zero line  in the panel to the right)  According to recent surveys of money-fund managers,  prime funds have substantially increased their holdings of ABCP, reportedly  reflecting the confidence provided by the asset-backed commercial paper money  market mutual fund liquidity facility (AMLF), which stands ready to provide banking  organizations with nonrecourse loans to fund purchases of highly rated ABCP from  2a-7 money funds     Turning to pricing, the middle left panel shows that the spread on overnight   A2/P2-rated nonfinancial CP (the blue line) trended down over the intermeeting  period  About half of the reduction in A2/P2 spreads reflects a sample shift toward  higher quality overnight issuers, while the other half of the spread reduction is due to  improvements in pricing for a constant sample of issuers, suggesting a positive  spillover from sectors of the market directly affected by the Fed liquidity programs   The overnight ABCP spread (the red line) also declined, on net, over the intermeeting  period  In contrast, overnight yields on CP from highly rated nonfinancial and  financial programs (not shown) have traded at levels close to the effective federal  funds rate for the past several weeks     To examine year-end pressures, the panel to the right shows the gap between   thirty-day and overnight A2/P2 yields  This gap has been volatile but has trended up  since late November, when the 30-day rate from our smoothed yield curve began to  reflect trades that crossed year-end  Year-end funding pressures are explored further  in the bottom left panel  The red bars show average percentages of paper that were  placed over year-end as of mid-December from 2003 to 2007  The corresponding  percentages for 2008 are denoted in blue  The first two bars indicate that, with  respect to getting past year-end, programs rated above A2/P2 as a group are ahead of  their average pace over the previous five years  In contrast, the second two bars show  that lower-rated programs are behind  Overall, as outlined in the bullet points to the  right, conditions in the commercial paper market appear to have been stabilized by  the various policy interventions in this market  Even conditions in the nonfinancial  A2/P2 sector, which falls outside the government liquidity and guarantee programs,   December 15–16, 2008 105 of 284    have improved, but the sector remains strained  Year-end pressures appear  substantial for lower-rated programs       The remainder of my briefing reviews funding flows in longer-term markets,   starting with financing for nonfinancial businesses  As shown by the red portions of  the bars in the top left panel of exhibit 3, investment-grade bond issuance has held up  fairly well in recent months, while speculative-grade issuance, shown by the blue  portions of the bars, has dwindled to nothing  This pace of financing does not appear  to pose substantial near-term funding pressures for the nonfinancial corporate sector  as a whole  As shown by the blue bars to the right, the volume of speculative-grade  bonds due to mature is relatively light in 2009 and 2010 before it moves up somewhat  in 2011  Moreover, the pace of investment-grade bonds that will mature in coming  years, denoted by the red bars, is comparable to recent issuance levels  In addition, as  shown in the middle left panel, liquid asset ratios for firms rated speculative- and  investment-grade remain relatively high      Perhaps more troubling for nonfinancial businesses is that funding from banks has   slowed  As shown in the middle right panel, C&I loans expanded rapidly in  September and October reportedly reflecting, to a substantial extent, a wave of  drawdowns on existing lines of credit  However, the expansion of C&I loans halted  in November  Equally striking, the plot in the bottom left panel shows that the  change in commercial mortgage debt, based on flow of funds data, turned  substantially negative in the third quarter, as the outstanding amounts both at banks  and in securitizations fell  Overall, nonfinancial business borrowing, shown on the  bottom right, has slowed sharply this year, and with financial conditions expected to  remain tight and investment projected to be weak, the staff forecast calls for  borrowing to remain very tepid through at least 2010     Household credit is the subject of my final exhibit  Mortgage debt, shown by the   blue line in the top left panel, is estimated to have contracted in the second and third  quarters, in combination with the continued decline in house prices, shown by the thin  black line  We have very little data for mortgage debt in the fourth quarter, but MBS  issuance in October, shown to the right, was somewhat below the already low third- quarter level  Other types of household debt have also begun to contract  As shown  in the middle left panel, revolving and nonrevolving consumer credit rose only a bit  in the third quarter and then fell in October  While the slowdown in consumer credit  likely reflects, in part, a reduction in demand, the secondary market for such credit  has also become substantially impaired  As shown to the right, issuance of ABS  backed by auto and credit card loans slowed markedly in the third quarter and was  near zero in October and November, as quoted spreads on BBB and AAA ABS (not  shown) soared  Results from the Michigan survey, shown in the bottom left panel,  suggest that the contraction in household debt reflects both the reduced supply of  credit and weak demand  As shown by the black line, an unprecedented share of  households has pointed in recent months to tighter credit as the reason that it has not  been a good time to purchase an automobile  At the same time, the percentage citing  concerns about the economy, plotted in red, has increased to the top of its historical   December 15–16, 2008 106 of 284    range and remains the reason mentioned most often by respondents as a deterrent to  purchasing an automobile  With financial markets under stress, consumer credit  likely will need to be funded mainly on bank balance sheets in coming quarters   However, as shown in the panel to the right, banks’ unused loan commitments for  both households and businesses have declined substantially this year, as net new  commitments have not kept up with drawdowns on existing lines—another indication  of the tighter supply of bank credit  Stephanie will now continue with our  presentation      As you go out the term, it is even more    I don’t know those data    I’m Dan Covitz    I think it is very difficult to interpret it that way because the intervention   did happen and the bulk of the improvements happened subsequent to the intervention    I think that the decline in the A2/P2 overnight suggests improvement  But   there is some concern about sample selection, and you have to worry about that at the same time  It   could be just that you are getting higher-quality issuers in the A2/P2 sector  But it turns out you’re   not  It turns out that it explains only about half of that decline    In the CP market itself?    You could think about what the default risk is, say, for the corporate sector    You could break down a pretty simple model of defaults conditional upon our outlook for the   economy, and that would have the default rate rising   December 15–16, 2008 122 of 284     You don’t, but you can take a guess at what you think that is, and it is   higher  It is not at Great Depression levels under any of the models I’ve looked at  It’s not even at   the levels of default rates in 2002    The way that I’m referring to it is just that risk premiums are really, really   large  I’m not saying that they are necessarily irrational  I am just saying that they are really, really   large  "
9225,2011-06-21,COVITZ,"  My remarks will focus on the staff’s assessment of the stability of  the US financial system  On balance, while the system has healed significantly in  the past few years, we see some risks and vulnerabilities The upper-left panel of  exhibit 10 plots an index that aims to measure the resemblance of financial market  conditions to those that have prevailed during periods of financial market stress, such  as during the recessions in 2001 and 2008, and around WorldCom’s default in 2002   This index is notably lower than it was last spring when stresses erupted in Europe,  though it has jumped recently, reflecting mostly an increased correlation in asset  prices   As shown to the right, the leverage of households and nonfinancial businesses has  been moderating  The ratio of private-sector debt to GDP (the blue region) has fallen   However, this ratio for federal government debt (the red region) has risen sharply,  and problems related to the debt ceiling are, of course, a risk to financial stability, as  Brian already discussed   Two additional measures, shown in the middle panels, indicate that the  economy’s reliance on relatively unstable forms of short-term debt has abated  substantially over the past few years  The first such measure, shown on the left, is the  share of banking assets funded with nondeposit short-term debt  This measure has  fallen to its lowest level in over a decade, suggesting that banks now employ a more  stable mix of funding than they did in the years leading up to the financial crisis   The second measure, plotted to the right, is a staff estimate of the share of  nonfinancial sector liabilities that is ultimately funded by nondeposit short-term debt   For example, in the case of a mortgage, the share would be the lender’s portion of  funding from nondeposit short-term debt, such as unsecured commercial paper issued  to money market funds  Or, if the mortgage was securitized, the share would be the  MBS investor’s portion of such funding, where MBS investors could include  insurance companies and ABCP programs  The plot shows that this share has  declined to its lowest level in over a decade   Despite the reduced reliance on nondeposit short-term funding, however, the staff  believes that a disruption in short-term funding markets is a primary risk to financial  stability, an event more likely because of the exposures of US prime money market  mutual funds (MMFs) to Europe  As shown in the bottom-left panel, aggregate  exposures of prime MMFs to fiscally vulnerable European countries such as Spain,  Italy, and Ireland—the red, black, and blue lines, respectively—fell late last year and  since then have remained relatively low  However, even the diminished exposures to  these countries can be potentially problematic for individual MMFs  As shown to the  right, new publicly available data indicate that most funds have little to no exposure  to Spain, but about 75 funds have exposures to Spain alone that exceed 50 basis   June 21–22, 2011 80 of 282              points of the respective fund’s assets, large enough such that defaults on Spanish  paper could by themselves cause these MMFs to “break the buck”  And past  experience has shown that one MMF breaking the buck may be sufficient to set off a  wave of runs   Moreover, returning to the left panel, exposures to the rest of Europe (the green  line) have hovered near a striking 60 percent of fund assets  And the risk is very  concentrated  Indeed, about 15 percent of total US prime money fund assets are the  liabilities of the three French banks whose long-term debt was recently put on watch  for ratings downgrades due to their exposures to Greece     Your next exhibit presents market indicators of the financial condition and  systemic risk of domestic LISCC firms  Stock prices for the firms, plotted in the  upper-left panel, have dropped about 10 to 15 percent over the intermeeting period,  adding to already substantial losses earlier this year  Share prices for these firms have  been weighed down recently by the weaker-than-expected economic data, heightened  concerns about the cumulative effects of proposed regulations, and continued  mortgage servicing and foreclosure problems   As shown to the right, CDS spreads for LISCC firms have moved up over the  intermeeting period  The increases are more notable for Bank of America (the red  line) and Citigroup (the green line), likely reflecting, in part, Moody’s announcement  on June 2 that it was putting the long- and short-term ratings of the two holding  companies on watch for downgrades because of reduced expectations of government  support   The “heat map” in the middle-left panel presents five measures of downside risk  for domestic LISCC firms  In the table, yellow shading denotes a level between the  75th and 90th percentiles in the direction of greater risk, where the percentile is  determined by the distribution of a particular measure for each firm over the past five  years; orange shading denotes a level between the 90th and 95th percentiles; and red  shading denotes a level above the 95th percentile  As shown in the first row, all five  measures for Bank of America are above their respective 75th percentiles, and its  expected default frequency (EDF) and relative EDF (a comparison with a larger set of  A-rated financial firms) are above their 95th percentiles  Morgan Stanley and  Goldman Sachs, the next two rows, each have three measures that are above their  75th percentiles, while the map shows few signs of trouble for the rest of the domestic  LISCC firms  Of course, downside risks implied by market indicators might be  muted by anticipated government support   Three downside risks to LISCC firms are noted in the middle-right panel  One is  an actual downgrade to the short-term ratings of Bank of America or Citigroup, as  this would reduce their access to the commercial paper market and preclude them  from providing credit and liquidity lines to commercial paper programs  A second  risk is that the US housing market deteriorates substantially further, which could  lead to substantial additional losses on first and second liens and amplify mortgage  servicing problems  A third concern is an escalation of the fiscal strains in peripheral   June 21–22, 2011 81 of 282              Europe  Confidential supervisory data, collected in recent months, confirm that the  direct net exposures of LISCC firms to Greece, and to Ireland and Portugal, are  limited  However, exposures to Spain are more material  For instance, three large  LISCC firms have direct net exposures to Spain that total about $25 billion, or  7 percent of their Tier 1 common equity  Moreover, US firms have substantial  direct exposures to the rest of Europe, and sizable indirect exposures through the  MMFs that the US firms sponsor   The bottom two panels provide a perspective on the systemic risk of LISCC firms   As noted in the lower-left panel, the conditional value at risk (CoVaR) is a market- based estimate of the downside risk to the financial sector, conditional on a stress  event for a firm  To illustrate recent trends, the panel to the right plots the staff’s  estimate of CoVaR through May of this year, summed for the domestic LISCC firms   As can be seen, this measure remains elevated relative to pre-crisis levels in early  2007 but well below peak levels in 2008  Current levels suggest that investors  perceive that a stress event for these firms, an event in the worst 5 percent of  realizations, would cost the financial sector about $50 billion    Your next exhibit highlights some emerging risks to financial stability from  pressures on asset valuations  As discussed in recent memos sent to the FOMC, the  staff sees signs of valuation pressures in the high-yield corporate bond and leveraged- loan markets  To illustrate such pressures, the upper-left panel plots both near- and  far-term forward spreads on high-yield bonds  While near-term spreads (the red line)  are well above levels typically seen during expansionary periods and have risen  recently, far-term forward spreads (the black line) are near the bottom of their  historical range  This term structure of credit spreads suggests that investors are not  sanguine about credit risk over the next few years, but they are accepting unusually  low levels of compensation for credit risk far into the future  In addition, high-yield  corporate bond issuance (the red bars in the panel to the right) has been extremely  elevated of late, consistent with issuers viewing current pricing as quite favorable   Leveraged-loan issuance has also been robust this year  As shown by the bars in  the middle-left panel, volumes issued to institutional investors, such as CLOs and  insurance companies, have been approaching levels last seen in the years leading up  to the financial crisis   The staff also sees signs of valuation pressures in a number of other markets  As  noted to the right, real house prices in Taiwan and Hong Kong continue to rise rapidly  despite actions taken by authorities to restrain further increases  In addition, some  equity markets in Latin America have elevated price-to-earnings ratios, and in  emerging Asia may reflect what appear to be overly optimistic earnings outlooks  In  domestic markets, valuation metrics for small capitalization stocks are elevated  relative to those for larger firms, and IPO volumes have increased somewhat  Farm  land valuations in the US also appear high, though farm real estate debt in dollar  terms has remained well below its levels in the early 1980s, a period in which farm  land was thought to have been overvalued   June 21–22, 2011 82 of 282              Despite these signs, it seems unlikely that even a fairly rapid correction in  valuations, at this time, would trigger a disorderly deleveraging process  As shown in  the bottom-left panel, the majority of dealers in the Senior Credit Officers Opinion  Survey (SCOOS), which was completed in early June, reported that the current use of  leverage by their “most favored” hedge funds has been somewhat middling—well  below pre-crisis highs and well above post-crisis lows  In addition, conversations  with dealers since early June suggest a noticeable pullback in leverage and risk-taking  in recent weeks, which should help to ease valuation pressures   One additional emerging risk to financial stability is from the development of new  products  As outlined in the lower-right panel, these innovations appear to have  arisen in response to proposed liquidity regulations inducing banks to lengthen  liabilities and new liquidity rules further restricting MMF investments in longer-term  securities  For example, putable CDs allow banks to issue long-maturity securities,  while investors have the option to shorten the maturities, and extendable repurchase  agreements allow investors to purchase what appear to be short-maturity securities  but give the banks the option to lengthen the maturities  Going forward, monitoring  these products will be an important part of our overall effort to better understand and  track maturity transformation and liquidity in the US financial system  Seth  Carpenter will continue the presentation    I think probably yes, but I’m not sure exactly which functions they   wouldn’t be able to conduct and which functions they would be able to conduct  It’s pretty clear   that if they no longer have an A1/P1 rating, their ability to support entities—provide liquidity   support or credit support—would go away right away  I think in the past when something like   this has happened, and providers of support have been downgraded to tier 2 status, the rating   agencies give the structures a little time to actually make that adjustment  They don’t instantly   say, “Okay  All of these structures are downgraded right away”  But ultimately they would be  "
