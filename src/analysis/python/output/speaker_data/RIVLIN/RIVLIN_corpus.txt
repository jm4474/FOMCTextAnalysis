 I have been on the job exactly five days, so I am not going to say a great deal, in part for that reason and in part because an awful lot has already been said with which I agree But I think you will have to admit that Larry and I chose a remarkably good time to join the Federal Reserve and the FOMC This is the most favorable set of economic statistics and projections that I can remember and that I think most people around the table can remember To have healthy growth and no clear sign of inflation is quite remarkable, and as I listened to the comments around the table everybody seemed to be straining to explain to themselves and to each other why it is so good when we all thought that this probably could not really happen My own views fit very closely with the projection in the Greenbook That is partly because the Administration from which I am a recent refugee has a forecast that is very similar to the one in the Greenbook When the Administration is so close to the Federal Reserve, everybody ought to be reassured that there isn't some kind of hanky-panky going on!  To draw on my recent area of so-called expertise, I do find the Fed staff a little pessimistic about the outlook for the federal deficit in 1997 The 1996 deficit is certainly going to be better than anybody predicted The $125 to $130 billion range now looks good to everyone The 1997 deficit will certainly be higher, but I think it is unlikely to be as much higher as the Fed staff projects; they have a $163 billion deficit I think it is very possible that we will get a major new effort at deficit reduction, if not before the election certainly shortly after it, no matter who wins That might  -40-    7/2-3/96  not be soon enough to affect fiscal year 1997 very much, but it could have a strong effect in demonstrating the outlook for declining outyear deficits, which the markets certainly would view as a favorable thing Besides that, I am simply in the same place as my colleagues Everything depends on whether this slowdown in the second half of the year actually materializes The recent statistics do not show that yet, clearly, and the upside risk is certainly there But it is impressive how difficult it is to find any real evidence, either statistical or even anecdotal, that there are strong wage pressures or even more so that there are upward movements in prices Indeed, as several people have noted, the general inflation trend has been down So, I will watch with eagerness as this story unfolds over the next few months I just do not think we know yet whether the good news can hold or whether we are in for some unpleasant shocks   Very quickly It seems to me that we have made a lot of progress despite the fact that we started with the wrong question [Laughter] With all due respect, the question, should price stability be THE goal of the Federal Reserve--meaning the only goal--is not the right question, as President Boehne and others have said Implicitly, the goal has got to be either maximum sustainable growth or, as I would put it, raising the standard of living of average Americans The only way we know how to do that is through raising productivity Now, most of us read the evidence as indicating that high inflation is detrimental to that end, but there is an empirical question as to whether the costs outweigh the benefits of getting out the last bit of inflation Janet has made a persuasive case, I think, that there are potential costs and we need to learn more about them in getting from 2 percent to zero inflation I think we should be very humble before we say very much about the effects on savings in going from 2 or 3 percent to zero inflation It is very easy to show that reducing inflation increases the rate of return to savings That is very easy Wayne Angell does it in The Wall Street Journal this morning, and Larry Lindsey was giving us other calculations But the empirical evidence that people actually save more when the rate of return goes up has been lacking We have tried all sorts of experiments through the tax system and through raising interest rates and through all sorts of other things, and we have not seen clear evidence that people save more So, I think we should be really humble about alleging that there are big advantages to be  -61-    7/2-3/96  gained through the saving rate in squeezing out the last bit of inflation   I, too, am somewhat uncomfortable with the whole discussion, as I think everybody is I would go along with your recommendation, but I think we ought to think seriously over the next few meetings about whether ranges are in any sense an effective policy tool or whether we are going to have a continued discussion at each meeting about the symbolism of something that really is not being used as a policy tool anymore   I am very comfortable with your recommendation, Mr Chairman It is extremely hard for us to explain the current set of facts to ourselves with the models that all of us have been using, implicitly or explicitly I am intrigued by your construct, but very frankly none of us really knows what is happening It seems to me that moving now to tighten policy would demonstrate that the Federal Reserve has a knee-jerk reaction to growth even when we have not seen any clear evidence of increases in compensation, let alone in prices I think it would be a mistake if we were to tighten because the economy is stronger It is unclear to me what an asymmetric directive conveys I asked several people, including you, and I got very different and confusing answers and now I do not want to know exactly! [Laughter] My personal guess is that we will be in the same quandary in August We will have more information, but we will still be unsure about exactly what is happening But I see no reason not to admit to ourselves that we could have a shock that would occur in the intermeeting period that would cause you to do what I assume you would do anyway, namely get on the phone and say, what do we do now? So, I would go along happily with your recommendation   On a very basic level, it seems to me that we ought to welcome the respect and the leadership role that the world, as Mr McDonough pointed out, seems very willing to accord us and we ought to work as closely as possible with the other major central banks to keep things on an even keel and avoid financial crises For that purpose, it seems to me that, as the world gets more complicated, we probably are going to need a quite flexible set of instruments and a quite flexible set of groupings of countries that we deal with in different ways I am persuaded by the staff paper that the current swaps are probably an obsolete instrument, but I would be very worried  -102-    7/2-3/96  about eliminating them before we are much surer about the kind of structure we want going forward I think we need to rethink that very carefully, and we need to do it in the light of a couple sets of political sensitivities  One set is the concerns of our friends and allies around the world who are very worried, as I perceive it, that the United States may be withdrawing from the world They believe that we have an inward-looking, to-hell-with-the-rest-of-the-world stance at the moment and that we are drawing back on foreign aid and not paying our bills that are due to international organizations If we were to get rid of our swap lines, that might be seen as one more indication that we are withdrawing from the world I do not think anybody around this table wants to do that The other set of political sensitivities is exactly the one to which those people are responding--the Congressional set of fears that somehow we are going to become more entangled So, as we structure a new set of relationships, I think we have to be very careful, first, that they are not seen as foreign aid but as mutual arrangements among central banks to avoid world crisis They must not be viewed as give-aways because that would create some problem for anything that is an extension of credit Second, these arrangements should not be seen as obscure, as the mysterious getting together of central bankers who might be thought to be up to no good Politically, it seems to me that we have a very sensitive set of issues that we have to work our way through very carefully I for one would think the first thing is to do no harm and not overturn the existing arrangements even though they may not be very modern ones   Let me put a slightly more positive cast on the same facts It seems to me that we are being a little hard on ourselves Actually, we should be fairly pleased not only with the way the economy is performing, but with our general understanding of it as expressed at the last meeting There may have been no defini- tive data during the intermeeting period, but at least there have been no surprises Everything that has come in has been pretty consistent with what we thought In July, we knew that the economy clearly was growing above its potential, that labor markets were very tight, that there was beginning to be some indication of wage acceleration but offset by the behavior of benefit costs, and that there was little or no evidence of accelerating price inflation We were all a little queasy about the forecast of a slowdown because we could not see the slowdown anywhere in the available data It was not happening yet, and there were two big questions One was, would the slowdown in fact  -34-    8/20/96  occur and begin to be evident? And the more fundamental question was, could we continue to run labor markets this tight without incurring accelerating inflation? To put it more technically, was there a NAIRU and where was it? Was it indeed lower than we had thought? The inflation risk was clearly there It seems to me that by August most of the statistics have come in on the track that we thought they would The evidence of a slowdown also seems to be supported by the anecdotal or regional information that we have heard around the table Labor markets are still tight, and we have had a little more evidence of wage pressures but no evidence yet of price pressures The minimum wage is a new law as of today when the President signs it, but it really is not new information We knew about the minimum wage when we were here last time, indeed since spring If it was not built into the actual Fed forecast, it certainly should have been on our minds when we were talking about what to do because we knew the minimum wage legislation was going to happen So, it does seem to me that we structured the problem about right We see an economy probably growing at about what we think is potential We still do not know whether we can sustain the currently low level of unemployment for very long without escalating wage pressures  I was struck by the fact that President McDonough was the only one who mentioned the other big bill being signed by the President this week, namely, welfare reform That legislation not only threatens to put a good deal of pressure on state governments, and not just in New York, but it also puts in strong relief the problem of how tight labor markets can be If we are going to be successful in integrating some of the welfare population into the labor force, it is important that we keep labor markets pretty tight So, erring on the side of not precipitating a recession, without taking on a serious risk of inflation, still seems particularly important for that reason, not just right now but over the next several years My reading is that we still have the big question, given that the expansion is slowing, as to whether labor markets are too tight The wage information is inconclusive, and I see no reason for losing our nerve when we see things coming in about on the track that we expected   I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman It seems to me that to move up now, when we did not in July and when we have seen evidence of the slowing of the economy, would be a very hard thing to explain and would risk a different kind of credibility You said in your Humphrey-Hawkins testimony that we expected the economy to slow Now we are seeing that it is, and suddenly we would be moving in a direction not suggested by that slowing Clearly the risks of inflation are there We have to remain vigilant I still believe it is possible that we will not have to move; I do not think that is the general view around this table The general view seems to be that it is a question of when rather than whether We will know more as time goes on It is more likely that we will have to move at some time if this economy does not slow more than predicted by the Greenbook, but I believe we have time to make that decision   Just based on our own experience, I suspect they will have long wrangles in the context of the stability pact about what counts and what does not It isn't until you have budget sanctions that you even have to face up to those questions It is    9/24/96  possible that European markets are simply not very sophisticated about budgets yet, and that what counts and what does not is something on which they have not really focused   We had to make rules about asset sales   The worried faces around this table, I think we should remind ourselves, are worrying about the best set of problems that we could think of having Central bankers all around the world would wish for this set of statistics I think that Mike Prell and some others, who have rightly emphasized the uncertainty and the difficulty of forecasting at this particular moment, have overdone it a bit In fact, the developments of the intermeeting period, reinforcing those of the previous intermeeting period, have given us reason for some confidence in our sense of what is happening in the economy and in our ability to forecast reasonably well at least in the short run  There were three things that we thought we knew One was that the economy was growing strongly but that the expansion was likely to slow The data are certainly consistent with that expected slowdown, especially on the consumer side, although it is not certain, as nothing is ever certain, that the slowdown will last The labor markets have proved tighter than we thought, but tight labor markets are something we ought to want, generally speaking We ought to want the incentives that tight labor markets create both for employers to be as efficient as possible and for employers and employees to focus on upgrading the skills of new and old workers We need that badly  Second, we thought we knew that wages would begin to creep up in the tight labor market, mitigating the long stagnation in wages that we have had This has indeed begun to happen, raising the cost of labor despite the slower growth in the cost of benefits  Third, we thought that these wage increases would begin to be passed along in price increases if the slowdown in the expansion did not begin to take the edge off the robustness of the economy in time to keep inflation under control We thought the risk was clearly on the up side and that we should stand ready to move quickly to forestall price inflation if the economy proved more robust than we thought  I said at the last meeting that we might not find the answers all that quickly, and the evidence around the table is that we have not The behavior of prices has, as people have pointed out, been surprisingly good It seems to me that we are still in the situation  -22-    9/24/96  we were in at the time of the last meeting of watching very carefully the potential for inflation I agree with Governor Yellen that we are in a danger zone, but we have not seen higher inflation yet We should be pleased, in fact, that things are turning out as well as they are and that we have understood the current situation as well as we have   Mr Chairman, I strongly support your recommendation both with respect to current monetary policy and with respect to asymmetry I am intrigued, as others I think are, by your disaggregation of the productivity data because it provides us with at least a partial explanation of the mystery of why wages have been rising, profits have been holding, and price inflation has not been going up I hope you will give us a chance to see all of this and work on it further I still think it is appropriate to worry very strongly about inflation If we get adverse information in the next few weeks, I think we should be prepared to reconsider   Once again we find ourselves in a very good situation and one that is remarkably uniform, as the stories around the table suggest Tight labor markets, which have a potential for making a considerable contribution to the long-run efficiency of this economy, provide an opportunity for people of modest skills to increase those skills and move up to jobs that provide moderate increases in income If the shortages of people with computer skills result in more people obtaining computer skills, we will be a lot better off going forward If Bob McTeer's young interviewer learns to pronounce "conservative," she may well get a better job, and all of this is to the good  At the same time, we have the slowing in the expansion that we predicted and little evidence of rising inflation The economy is generating the kind of mixed signals that we really like to have, although they make us a little uncomfortable as forecasters because it is more difficult to tell what will happen next I could build a case, and I think we all could, for the expectation that the economy will rebound more rapidly than we would like it to and that the mystifyingly proper behavior of inflation, as several members have suggested, may be only temporary The consumer may come roaring back during the holidays and beyond I could also build a case for excessive slowing, and some have suggested that The consumer may remain cautious in the face of rising debt, and the clearly over- valued stock market might head down, perhaps sharply Much depends on post-election political developments If we get strong evidence, which we might get fairly quickly, of a bipartisan will to continue the deficit reduction process, that could reassure both consumers and the financial markets and give us lower long-term rates as a solid basis for the continuation of moderate growth That would be the best gift that the newly elected candidates in both the White House and the Congress could deliver But it will not be easy It will be a lot harder to make further progress on the deficit than it was in the last several years  In sum, the Greenbook forecast looks as good as any to me The risks, as several people have pointed out, seem a lot more symmetrical now than at the time of the last meeting, but I would expect to be back in a month looking at very much the same problem   I support "B" asymmetric, but like President Jordan I do not feel nearly as "asymmetric" as I did at the time of the last meeting, and if we were not already there, I think moving to  -34-    11/13/96  it would be questionable But since we are and we have a winning formula, let's stick with it   I hope this does not mean the end of the Jackson Hole conferences   I do not know whether we have been smart or lucky, but we do seem to be blessed with a nearly ideal economy that is growing at a rate very close to potential I have no reason to quarrel with the Greenbook forecast Certainly, there is reason for concern about future inflation, given the tight labor markets and the beginnings of accelerating wage increases But I think we ought to remember that if we can keep labor markets tight, in the long run we may be increasing the potential of the economy to grow without inflation If tight labor markets encourage training, give more job experience to workers who would not otherwise have had it, encourage investment in efficient equipment and productivity-enhancing processes --and there is a good deal of evidence to think that this does happen --then we are improving our potential for economic growth without inflation in the future The wage increases that we are beginning to see at the low end of the wage scale also augur well in the sense that they will encourage the transition from welfare to work, which hopefully will be made over the next several years, and will give us some new workers with job experience Clearly, the most worrisome problem on the horizon is the stock market, but I am not sure how that will work out It could contribute to an upward bounce in consumer spending, which was suggested by some of you, or to a significant correction that will reduce confidence and cut spending in the future  I share the staff's optimism about the prospects for a budget agreement, and I want to underline that because I have been fussing at them for about six months for being too pessimistic They have finally gotten a little more optimistic about the budget outlook, which I think is right I believe the Congress and the President will get together over the next few months and work out a deal that will keep the deficit from rising in 1997 and bring it down more significantly in 1998  -22-    12/17/96  The main element has to be a Medicare agreement on reduced reimbursement rates, possibly a means testing of the Part B premium, and some more aggressive action on Medicare fraud; such action already seems to be paying off quite well The Congress and the Administra- tion could get hung up on what to do about Medicaid, but I sense less intensity in the Congressional Republicans' demands for block grants as the states begin to realize that they have taken on a lot already We may actually see some softening of the harsh treatment of legal immigrants under welfare reform, but I do not expect that that will mean a lot more spending, although some easing for disabled legal immigrants seems likely We also may see more near-term cuts in discretionary spending, creating a more realistic track over time for spending The previous spending agreements had unrealistic trajectories in that they had precipitous declines in discretionary spending in the period close to the year 2002  I think that there is even a chance that the President and the Congress might tackle the longer-run Social Security problem by taking advantage of the Boskin Report and solving what is a relatively easy long-run Social Security problem with some downward shift in the CPI adjustment, probably not 11 percent but maybe half of that, and some future benefit cuts in the form of a higher retirement age If that were to happen, and I admit that is pretty optimistic, it is not clear what the near-term effect would be Spending would be reduced some as the benefits were pared back slightly, but it might have a positive effect on confidence If it is true that consumers are spending less and saving more because they are worried about Social Security and their long-term retirement incomes, we might actually see a positive effect on consumption   His 10 years did not include the means testing   I agree and especially with the Vice Chair's formulation of it I do not see any reason for a move at the moment We are doing fine, but the risks are clearly on the up side, though they may be less so than we thought when we launched into the asymmetric pattern They are not enough less to convince me that we should revert to symmetry, although I must say that I find the meaning of these asymmetries a little mysterious   It is my pleasant duty to open the meeting and to ask if there are  nominations for Chair of the FOMC Governor Kelley   Is there a second?  SPEAKER(?) Second   We have a second All in favor?  SEVERAL Aye   Opposed? Mr Chairman, you have won!   Shall I proceed?   Is there a nomination for Vice Chair of the Federal Open Market  Committee?   President McDonough Now there is an original idea! [Laughter]    2/4-5/97   All in favor?  SEVERAL Aye   All opposed? The ayes have it Congratulations, Mr McDonough  Back to you, Mr Chairman   I nominate Peter   That seems like an excellent idea to me   That is a new low in economist jokes [Laughter]   I would dearly love to say something startlingly different, but I think I  would have to be living in a different country We really do seem to have accumulating evidence  of a quite consistent picture The strong growth in the fourth quarter, like the strong growth in  the second quarter, clearly will not continue and will be followed by a significantly weaker first  quarter This back-and-forth pattern not only in growth but in some other statistics is  superficially confusing, but overall we are getting a remarkably consistent picture of healthy and  very broadly based economic growth, geographically and industrially It is a more solid picture  than I think we felt we had six months ago, but it is no roaring boom either Tight labor markets  are reported almost everywhere, wages are creeping up, increases in benefit costs are leveling out  but the growth in such costs is likely to turn up and to rise more sharply as we get to the end of  the shift in the provision of health services to managed care The productivity data remain  significantly mysterious; the low increases do not seem to fit with other indicators  I have no major quarrel with the staff analysis or forecast I might be a tad more  optimistic about the prospects for relatively gimmick-free deficit reductions than they say they  are, including something in the legislation that would contain significant Medicare and Medicaid  restraints that might continue into the future That certainly would be a desirable outcome and  the bond markets probably would respond to it I think, incidentally, that this good news might  be threatened by the passage of a balanced budget amendment I agree with the staff that the  amendment is not likely to pass, and that probably would be a good outcome I would be    2/4-5/97  surprised if the unemployment rate got down quite as low as the staff forecast indicates On the  other hand, I share some of the nervousness about oil prices, which might feed into slightly  higher inflation than the staff forecast  The question before us as it was the last time is really how long we can expect this  very favorable set of indicators to continue I would agree that the risks are on the upside, but  nothing suggests an imminent danger of inflation taking off So "wait and see" is a plausible  strategy, but if we really believe the staff forecast, and on the basis of what almost everybody has  articulated around this table we do not differ all that much, the real question is whether we are  taking a risk of waiting too long to tighten The question remains Is this low inflation with tight  labor markets sustainable; is it a new situation that could persist; or is it some kind of temporary  adjustment at the end of which more normal relationships will reassert themselves? If the latter  is what is going to occur, we should be thinking ahead to what those normal relationships have  always been   I think it is really simple It seems to me that unless we made terribly  sophisticated arguments, moving to a higher range would be interpreted as less vigilance against  inflation and that is not where we are   I also support your recommendation for "B" asymmetric I would  include a strong expression in your Humphrey-Hawkins testimony of our concern about the  sustainability of low inflation with tight labor markets I believe this is the best informed group  about the American economy that one could possibly assemble anywhere, with the benefit of the  best statistical analysis and a real feel for the economy from around the country And yet we  come back in the end to our gut feeling about what is happening That feeling has changed since  the last meeting You pointed out that evidence of higher inflation is not very solidly based on  the statistics, and the question is whether we are sure that we have to worry about the  sustainability of this growth and its consistency with price stability I cannot be sure, but I think    2/4-5/97  everybody around the table would agree that the prudent thing to do if we had to do something  today would be to move, and yet there are reasons for waiting a little longer  With respect to your Humphrey-Hawkins testimony, I think a lot of very important  things have been said around this table about how to couch it and how to communicate the  importance of sustainable growth I am not worried about our wasting credibility asset I think  our credibility and your personal credibility are so high right now that if you write strong  Humphrey-Hawkins testimony, you may get a correction in both the equity markets and the bond  markets that will make us less certain when we come back here in March that we need to do  anything [Laughter] We may be able to accomplish our objective without moving the funds  rate After all, what is important is controlling the economy But that is a problem we will have  to deal with when we meet again in March   We have all been watching this remarkable economy with some  puzzlement for the last several months Until now, the signs of strength in the private  domestic economy always seemed to be mixed with some signals that the expansion might be  slowing down What strikes me at this point is that the signs of a slowdown are nearly  absent Virtually all the statistics at the national level point to continued strength This  pattern is reflected almost uniformly in the reports from around the nation, although the  report for Atlanta sounds a little different Labor markets are tight; employment is moving  up; labor participation is high; the workweek is longer; initial unemployment claims are  down; all these indicators reinforce the good jobs picture Consumer spending is strong;  inventories are lean; business investment, housing, and nonresidential construction, you  name it, look good It just does not look like an economy that is running out of steam  There are two elements of restraint One is the federal budget, which is modestly  restrictive I think the outlook for fiscal policy is probably the biggest difference between this  year and back in 1965 I remain fairly optimistic that we will get a budget deal, but we  probably will not get it until August or September There is no pressure of an election to keep  the Congress from trying hard to finish its work and get home, so the debates will probably  string out But I think the budget deal will get done without a government shutdown and  without a continuing resolution, and the agreement is likely to include a modest CPI fix,  agreed to very quickly at the very end of the legislative process In that regard, I think there    3/25/97  was an overreaction to the President's rejection of the commission idea With all due respect  to the Chairman, they do not need a commission; they just need to fix the CPI My guess is  that they will do something   The long-run effect depends on whether the budget legislation  includes significant reductions in the growth of Medicaid and Medicare I think the chances  are quite good that it will Nevertheless, the effects will be mostly psychological and  possibly not particularly strong even there The real effect of having a deal is not going to be  very great in the near term  The other negative that has been mentioned and is much bigger in its effect is net  exports This clearly is helping restrain the economy at the moment, but it is exacerbating  the long-run problem of the current account deficit for which we have no obvious solution at  the moment The case for viewing this economy as just a little too robust to be sustainable is  the clearest one that I have seen since I have served on the Board; admittedly that has not  been very long A small move to restrain growth and the future acceleration of inflation that  seems increasingly likely could prolong this remarkable expansion, and that seems to me to  be what we ought to want to do I do not see very much downside risk If we had a sharper,  better policy instrument that operated more immediately, we could certainly afford to wait,  but unfortunately we do not   I would strongly support this set of moves--the 25 basis points and  a symmetric directive I think what we say about our action is terribly important, not just in  the announcement but what we all say about it over the next few days I believe the key  words should be that we want to sustain the growth of the economy and to sustain our ability  to have tight labor markets There is an enormous benefit, which we are seeing, in having  tight labor markets, and I think we ought to say that sustaining them is our goal I also would  support a symmetric directive because I think there is significant uncertainty about whether  we will want to move again in May We do not want to stack the deck   I had the same reaction It was a little heavy on inflation, and since  we do not have any, I don't think we want to be stressing that quite so much   Yes, or some other verbal means of emphasizing growth a little  more, inflation a little less   It is there   Peter, what do you think you learned from the April surprises  affecting the federal funds rate, or what do you think you need to learn before next April?   It seems to me that we are witnessing a very impressive  performance by the US economy Everything that has been said around this table today and  for quite some time is testimony to the basic strength and resilience of the economy and its  ability to restructure itself But we really do not know very much about how it is doing that  This is going to be a plea for trying to find out more  Over the last few months, the economy has seemed to be handling the tightness of  labor markets remarkably well We need more information about exactly what is happening  to different kinds of wages in different labor markets We do not know a lot about that The  anecdotes convey the impression that labor markets are tight everywhere, employers are very  short of technically skilled and especially computer skilled people, and they are going after  them any way they can But basically, given what has happened over the last few months,  we have to conclude that we have very flexible labor markets and a very flexible economy    5/20/97  Companies are doing a lot of training; they are doing a lot of upgrading; they are doing a lot  of job reorganization; they are substituting capital for labor They are doing something right  or this tight labor market would have gotten out of hand long before now But we do not  know very much about all of that  I met with Bill McDonough's boards, including the Buffalo board, and I was struck  by the comments of one director--I think it was the chairman of the Buffalo branch--who was  complaining that Columbus, Ohio had held a job fair in Buffalo [Laughter] That is too bad  for Buffalo, I guess, but it is exactly the kind of thing that ought to be happening Columbus  is doing the right thing People are moving around; employers are looking for employees  either by recruiting them to come to their workplace or by moving their operations to other  places Something is working quite well here, but we clearly do not know enough about it  We also don't know enough about what is happening to productivity, which is the other side  of the same coin The anecdotes are much more positive than the staff forecast of a return to  trend would indicate The staff is quite rightly worrying that as employers dip down into the  unemployment pool, they will have less skilled workers, and that may take us back to a  slower productivity growth trend I'm not sure there are enough of those people; I suspect  that their number is too marginal in relation to the overall number of workers to outweigh  what may be happening to productivity generally as this flexible economy adjusts to the  shortages in skills But the fact is that we do not know If my assumption is right that we are  going to be struggling with these questions for some time to come, then clearly we should  think about how we could get data that could fill the gap between aggregate statistics like the  employment cost index, which don't tell us a great deal, and the anecdotes that we trade  around the table    5/20/97  It seems to me, as it seems to almost everybody, that the risks clearly are on the  upside with respect to inflation and that the question to be discussed later in this meeting is  whether we move now or move later It seems to me that we sent a very valuable signal in  March, namely that the Fed is awake and watching The question is whether it would be  better to send the signal now that we are still watching or leave it out there to be used later  One final word about the other piece of good news, the budget deal I am more  positive than some in the press have been on the importance of this deal The cynics seem so  eager to be cynical that they point out that the deal does not involve a big cut in spending, but  that is partly because we have done so well already The deficit was down to 1 percent of  GDP, so there was no need to cut spending much further It is also because the big core  pieces of the reductions are cuts in future rates of growth in Medicare, but it was extremely  important to do that It does not make it less effective that those are reductions in future rates  of growth The third point is that the spending cuts are to some extent offset by increases in  spending for education, but this is an opportune time to do that Such spending will involve  more than just the national government, obviously, but if we as a nation can improve  education and training over the next several years, we will be in better shape to take  advantage of this huge opportunity that is presented to us by the very tight labor markets   I agree I think your analysis is very appealing I hope it is right; it  will take us a little while to find out I believe we all agree that the risks are still on the  upside, that the economy is very strong, and that we probably will have to move again In  my view, the psychological argument is very much in favor of not moving now because the  markets and other Fed watchers would interpret another move at this time as the end of the  story, especially with the expansion softening We will have a much bigger psychological  effect if we do not move at this point, and I would support your recommendation, Mr  Chairman   I had somewhat the same instinct to look back that Cathy Minehan had,  but because this is my first anniversary meeting, so to speak, I looked back to my first meeting in  July a year ago In the Greenbook for that meeting, the following points were made GDP was  growing at a rate well above trend, but the rate of expansion was expected to slow to trend and,  indeed, second-quarter growth last year turned out to be even stronger than the Greenbook  predicted Consumption, investment, and housing were all described as strong but expected to  slow Last year's Greenbook had a tone of some surprise at the strength especially of  consumption and housing Labor markets were described as very tight, but demand for labor  was expected to moderate The unemployment rate was then 54 percent, and it was expected to  level out at around 55 percent Concern was expressed about prospective wage increases,  employment cost increases, a rise in the minimum wage and its impact on wages more generally  --the minimum wage legislation had not passed yet, but it was expected to--and about  prospective increases in the CPI But the actual CPI forecast was shaded down a little on the  basis of then-recent experience In addition, it was boldly stated that the stock market was  seriously overvalued  A year later, what have we seen? We have seen the GDP experience some slow  quarters and some fast ones, but on balance it has been stronger than was forecast a year ago It  is still expected to slow to trend but not quite as rapidly as was thought last year Labor markets    7/1-2/97  are even tighter than anticipated and actually are expected to get a little more so, with the  unemployment rate leveling out at about 45 percent instead of about 55 percent Concern is  still being expressed about the outlook for wage increases, employment cost increases, another  round of minimum wage hikes, and prospective increases in the CPI But the forecast of the CPI  is again being shaded down a bit The stock market is being described even more emphatically  and for good reasons as seriously overvalued We now have a forecast of a decline in stock  prices, but not a very imminent one  What have we learned over the past year? I think we have learned to be cautious The  tone of the current Greenbook is considerably less sure of itself than it was a year ago We have  learned that the economy is less inflation-prone than we thought After another year of low  inflation, we can be more confident that expected inflation will be low But the risks of inflation  are still there, and almost everybody around the table is emphasizing those risks I think it can be  said that the cost of waiting has proved to be less than anticipated We are all aware of that, but  there is also a view that we may be about to run out of time We have learned that tight labor  markets have benefits They cause people to use labor very effectively, and we have heard  examples of that around the table even at this meeting  We have not made a lot of progress toward solving the fundamental puzzles The  question of why wages and benefits are not rising faster is still there, and the job insecurity  hypothesis propounded by the Chairman a year or so ago seems perhaps a little less plausible  after a year of more plentiful jobs The puzzle of why prices are not rising more, given the labor  cost increases, is still there One of the strongest contributions clearly has been the downward  pressure of import prices stemming from the strong dollar, but that effect seems to be coming to    7/1-2/97  an end We do not have a very good analytical explanation for the anecdotes we keep hearing  Those include the perceived inability of firms to make price increases stick, even in thoroughly  domestic markets and quite local markets That puzzle is still mystifyingly there Productivity  remains a puzzle The circumstantial evidence still points to an acceleration in productivity  growth, possibly associated mainly with the large investments in computers and associated  changes in production processes, with other types of capacity increases, with the tight labor  markets themselves, and with a greater flexibility in the use of labor But we really do not know,  and the usual statistics are not helping us at all I think we come down to a contest between the  optimists and the pessimists I tend to be one of the optimists I think we still have to be very  vigilant about inflation, but I would be inclined like Ed Boehne to be a little more on the side of  wait-and-see I do not think we have made a lot of progress on the analysis that will tell us more  than we get from being optimists or pessimists   I, too, thought it was an excellent and stimulating paper I don't think  we've had a dissenting vote on that score We do have to think a lot about where we put our  marginal research effort I guess the paper convinced me that I would not put it on refining  measures of inflation The broad measures are plausible and they all tend to move together in  any event I would concentrate on studying the costs and benefits of inflation because I do not  think we have been able to demonstrate convincingly that the benefits outweigh the costs when  we try to reduce inflation from a level near the current range  To go back to Susan Phillips' point, I have the feeling that part of the criticism that we  get for being too focused on inflation is that we have not explained it very well in the past, and    7/1-2/97  we have not offered supporting evidence very well In my view, our credibility would be  enhanced, not undermined, by a serious discussion Humphrey-Hawkins may not be the right  venue for it, but the more we inform the public that there are some real issues here and we really  are thinking about them, the more credibility I think we will have   There is a causality question here You also have to look at whether  low unemployment gives you high productivity growth and what the tradeoff is   I, too, would go along with alternative I, but I think we should not do it  just to kick a difficult decision down the road The next few months may actually be an easier    7/1-2/97  period in which to explain a change in thinking than later when one might imagine that we may  be doing something really unpopular at a time when the economy is not doing very well and we  are being blamed for it One can think of a lot worse moments for explaining things than we  have now  The second point is that it is very easy to say that we are raising interest rates, if we  have to do that, to sustain growth in the economy and jobs But that explanation will not be  credible unless we make the connections clear This was Tom Melzer's point We risk having  people ask what we are talking about and totally tuning out unless we get that explanation across   But remember, she had to think of something to say this morning  [Laughter]    7/1-2/97    I like the recommended wording I think it is simpler and clearer   I strongly support your recommendation You amused me yesterday  by saying I was too agnostic You sound rather agnostic yourself at the moment about knowing  what is actually happening   Fair enough I think in view of the uncertainty and the fact that there  clearly is not enormous pressure to do something, doing nothing is the wise course But the risks  are, as you say, still on the high side   Unless their negotiating success leads to greater organizing success in  some of the non-union companies   I have always been an optimist I think I was born that way, but I find  myself stuck between the old and the new paradigms at the moment and not helped very much by  the flow of data The good features of this economy have been emphasized by all of us for several  meetings in a row I believe we are now beyond the point where we are just getting short-run good  news We have had a solid economic performance for long enough to be quite reassured in a basic  sense about the strength and competitiveness of the US economy, and that is a good thing The  continuing tight labor markets, without accelerating inflation, are terrific We certainly have lots of    8/19/97  evidence of the increasing competitiveness of US industry at home and abroad, which is  reassuring The fact that exports have held up so well in the face of the high dollar is really a quite  good thing We have had continued and balanced growth across regions and industries It's getting  harder and harder to figure out with our eyes closed who is talking around this table because the  reports are quite uniform On top of that, we have generally good news in agriculture and  commodities, and prospects for growth in all our markets abroad should keep the favorable export  story going even if the dollar fails to reverse course  There still seems to be a major mystery about what is going on, especially about  productivity That is not helping us to decide among paradigms, which actually, Peter, I find you  have very usefully organized as a set of boxes So, I think all of us have to conclude that the risks  are more on the high side I'm not so much worried about the possibility that the economy may  overheat and that we will face the prospect of higher inflation because I think we know what to do  about that We have a tool; it is just a question of when to use it  The bigger problem for the US economy, which was reinforced in my mind by the  Humphrey-Hawkins experience--both the Chairman's and the one I shared with Larry Meyer and  Bill McDonough--is the problem of the distribution of the gains from this very good economy It is  hard to refute the evidence that the gains are very heavily concentrated in the top 25 percent of the  income distribution, and I find that very worrisome There is a real problem for social cohesion  There is a potential problem, at least, for economic stability if we get more strikes and labor unrest,  perhaps even as a result of what may be perceived as the success of the UPS strike It is a serious  problem, it seems to me, for people who talk about the economy, including or perhaps especially  representatives of the Federal Reserve If we talk about all the good things that we see happening  and crow about the excellence of the economy, we risk sounding insensitive and out of touch with    8/19/97  average people or even the majority of the population On the other hand, if we recognize the  problem of concentration of gains at the top of the income distribution, that would lead to the  reasonable question regarding what we propose to do about it, since we do not command the tools  that can help We can talk in general terms about other kinds of policies, about education and  training, but it seems to me that we have to be very careful when we talk about this economy, given  the limited tools of monetary policy at our disposal   The first mention of NAIRU today!   No lunch would be the consequence! [Laughter]   I will second the honorary motion   Can I make it legal by moving the Boehne motion?   So do I   It had some success   Like Ed Boehne and a few others, I feel moved to say a few things about  new and old paradigms If one listens to the economic and financial press and sometimes to the  conversation around this table, one gets the impression that there are only two possible  explanations for what is happening at the moment One is that the economy's functioning has not  really changed much over the last 20 to 30 years In this view, economists' models with the  parameters fitted to the data of the last couple of decades are still good predictors; it is just that  something temporary or several temporary factors are giving us more favorable results right now  When these temporary factors turn around, everything will snap back into place In particular,  inflation and low productivity growth, the bugaboos of the US economy since the late 1960s or  early 1970s, will be plaguing us as much as ever  The alternative explanation is that there is a new era or new paradigm, which actually  seems to mean no paradigm In this view, it is possible "to have the cake and eat it too" without  worrying about productivity or inflation because the former will be rapid and the latter nonexistent  In this view, economists are to be ignored if they say anything cautionary about overheating or  bubbles in asset values or wages outrunning productivity growth The atmosphere has gotten a  little like the policy discussions of the early 1980s, which I remember very clearly In that period,  the so-called supply side economists overwhelmed the essential kernel of truth in their thesis that  incentives, including tax incentives, matter to economic performance They made absurd claims  about the magnitude of the likely effects on labor supply or the saving rate of small, marginal    9/30/97  changes in tax rates Those who warned that high deficits generated by cutting tax rates without  cutting spending might lead to either inflation or, with a responsible Federal Reserve, to higher  interest rates and a punishingly high dollar were labeled as old paradigm Keynesians who were not  to be paid much mind It was not a helpful debate, and it led to bad policy and an undermining of  confidence in the economics profession Both are things that ought to be avoided [Laughter]  At the moment, it seems to me that we ought to be focusing not on new or old paradigms  but on the fact, and it is a fact, that while economists have learned a great deal about how the  economy works over the last two or three decades, it is demonstrably functioning better than any of  us thought it would Now, good fiscal policy and good monetary policy clearly get some of the  credit for this, but there is accumulating evidence that the economy is more flexible and responsive  and less inflation-prone than it used to be To my mind, one of the most gratifying charts in the  Greenbook, meeting after meeting, is the inventory-sales ratio chart, especially in manufacturing,  which keeps trending down and suggests that manufacturers really have learned something about  inventory management  More fundamentally, the surprising thing about the economy at the moment is the  uniformity in the activity levels across the country and across sectors of the economy Labor  markets seem to be almost uniformly tight Twelve people around this table said almost exactly the  same thing--not quite, but very close We do not really understand why this is true, but one has to  suspect that there is more flexibility both in labor markets and in production location than there  used to be Workers move to jobs and jobs move to workers; capital moves more easily nationally  and internationally; and production can be located and expanded in different places, including  overseas and across the Mexican border, more readily than it used to be We have heard some    9/30/97  wonderful examples of this today--Cathy Minehan's Bombay back office for Boston area hospitals,  as well as the maquiladora process  The other surprising development is the apparent increase in productivity growth at a  time when the economy has been growing for a long period and the boom might be expected to be  running out of steam Economists have always given two reasons for the observed slowdown in  productivity at the peak of the cycle The first one never seemed to me to make very much sense,  but we all used to say to each other that we were scraping the bottom of the labor market and  bringing in less skilled, less experienced people That was undoubtedly true, but a drop from 5-1/2  percent to 4-1/2 percent in the unemployment rate, while a big drop in unemployment, means an  increase of only a little more than 1 percent in the employed labor force And it is hard to believe  that this 1 percent of the workforce, however inept and inexperienced, could really drag down  productivity all that much  The other explanation that one still hears is that old, less efficient capacity is brought on  line When the old boiler that does not have to be used until the firm is facing severe capacity  constraints is finally brought on line, it obviously is less productive That also seems to make less  and less sense after a period of very high investment accompanied by rapid technological change  It may be that the tight labor markets in the current environment actually provide incentives for  increasing productivity  None of this seems to be a reason for arguing that economists do not know anything or  that staff is irrelevant It does seem to provide a rationale for at least a tentative hypothesis that the  US economy is less inflation-prone today than it was in the 1970s and 1980s for a lot of reasons  relating to globalization, information technology, pro-competitive developments, and the safety  valve that recent immigration might have given us in the labor market Econometrics is a very    9/30/97  useful thing, but it is inherently conservative in the sense that when parameters shift, the equations  pick this up with a very considerable lag At the moment, it is very hard to defend the proposition  that economists "know" in some sense that an economy operating below 5-1/2 percent  unemployment is taking on a serious risk of wage and price increases We have been operating in  that range now for quite a while, and we have not seen either rapid acceleration in wages or any  increase in prices We still have declining core inflation  The temporary factor most frequently invoked to explain this is the high dollar, but that  is not a fully plausible explanation even in an economy that is much more open than it used to be  This is not a plea for new era thinking in the sense of throwing caution to the wind It is a plea for  economists to stop being defensive and to try to figure out more carefully, as the staff here is  actually doing, how this dynamic economy is really working   I agree with the policy recommendation and also with Bill McDonough's  notion that we should be talking more about why we think the risks are on the upside That said,    9/30/97  however, I think I am a little less convinced than you that we will have to move in November or  December   All right, you said 50/50; I heard something stronger than 50/50 I would  say the odds are perhaps a little less than that That is because I am persuaded that we are dealing  with a much less inflation-prone economy than we were, and I am a little less persuaded by the  biology argument in part because it depends on a fixed labor force I'm not sure that our labor--   All right, it depends on a fixed population   Okay, but that is what I am questioning If some of our labor force is in  Bombay or Mexico, and we have much more flexibility in outsourcing and even in calling on high-  skilled people in distant places, then this argument is a little less overwhelming I guess I also have  been a little more skeptical about the job insecurity explanation of why we have had such limited  wage increases That puts a lot of the explanation on the worker side I think we also have had a  strong disinclination on the employer side to grant wage increases because of the correct perception  that the economy is very competitive for numerous reasons, including the reasons we have been  talking about That said, I think we need to accumulate more evidence before taking action, but  your policy recommendation is the right one for today   This question reflects my lack of understanding, but are you creating  any legal problems for us here? If a team is dropped from the league, can they sue the  commissioner?   You are a businessman, but they think of you as the government   This is a version of Tom Hoenig's question I was quite surprised by  the projected falloff in productivity growth in your forecast for 1998 We have had a gratifying  improvement now for four years, and you reflect that experience in your estimate of increased  trend growth, but then you have a big drop in 1998 to an increase in output of 07 percent per  hour Can you say a few words about why you think it will drop that much?   It's not just a movement toward the trend line; it falls below   Where do we apply?  SEVERAL Yes   We find ourselves in a new situation For many months, we as a group  have recorded our awe and wonder at the continued strong performance of the US economy and  our varying degrees of concern about future wage and price inflation We have shared our  evolving theories about why there has been so little increase in wages in the face of low  unemployment and why there has been no price pressure at all And we have shared our guesses  The Chairman does not like me to use the word "guesses" so I will not use it publicly anymore,  [Laughter] but it's okay to use it here   We have shared our guesses about when the world as we thought we  knew it was likely to reappear But we have not worried much about the rest of the world except  to note that global competitiveness and the strong dollar were helping us fight inflation, and that  the dollar was unlikely to go on rising much longer Otherwise, the world economies seemed to  be just perking along, indeed growing well enough to buy increasing amounts of our exports and  all too willing to feed the voracious American appetite for imports This month, however, we  have been forcefully reminded that the increasing interconnections of global economies and    11/12/97 79  capital markets were not just some cliche we all put in our speeches Those interconnections are  real and have added greatly to the uncertainty about our own economic future  As I look at the Greenbook, I find myself a bit more optimistic than the Greenbook  staff about the domestic economy and a bit more pessimistic about the international situation  My optimism about the domestic economy relates mostly to productivity The Greenbook  assumes that at least a substantial fraction of the recent good news on productivity is temporary  and that it will revert to trend quite forcefully in 1998 because of the slowing of growth and  because of very tight labor markets I increasingly think it is possible that the confluence of tight  labor markets, high investment, and technological change have come together to give us at least  a sustained spurt in productivity increases So, I am less sure than the Greenbook seems to be  that we will need to raise interest rates in the near term  Incidentally, I imagine myself making a speech a couple of years from now that would  talk about what we did on the assumption that the Greenbook lays it out absolutely right It is a  hard speech to make It says we raised interest rates, we tanked the stock market, we cut the  growth rate to less than half what we ourselves thought the potential growth rate was, we raised  unemployment, and yes by then we are admitting that we overshot because we are beginning to  lower the interest rate again We did this because we were worried about inflation, which even  in the Greenbook forecast was quite modest Then we have to explain that although we were on  the forefront of arguing that the CPI was overstated and should be corrected, it is really  misleading to leave that correction in when we look at inflation So, I would find this a very  hard speech to make, but maybe we will not have to [Laughter]    11/12/97  On the other hand, as I said, my pessimism about the rest of the world is a little greater  than the Greenbook's This is based on no real knowledge, just a feeling that there is a great  potential for snowballing weakness around the world and that our immune systems in the United  States may not be quite as good as we thought We might get that stock market correction not by  raising interest rates but simply by the contagion from abroad If I am right, we also might face a  much greater potential conflict between our domestic and our foreign responsibilities over time  We will be wondering what we ought to do if the US economy is still growing very strongly  and the rest of the world is a lot weaker   So do I   I think it was brave of the staff to produce a Greenbook forecast at all  The increased uncertainty about world events in the short interval between meetings certainly    12/16/97 45  has widened our confidence intervals quite a lot, even though we don't know exactly what our  confidence intervals are!  My own hunches are that the domestic economy may prove stronger and more  resilient than the Greenbook suggests, and others around the table have voiced that feeling I  sense that we now have some momentum in wage increases, especially at the low end of the  wage spectrum, and I'm not sure that declining inflation matters that much for wage increases  We may have achieved the Chairman's definition of price stability It occurs when inflation does  not play into business and consumer calculations I also am more skeptical than the staff that the  minimum wage has had a lot to do with the wage increases that we have seen I'm more inclined  to attribute the increases to tight labor markets If that is true, the absence of another minimum  wage increase going forward will not have as much of a restraining effect as the staff seems to  anticipate I also think we could see health cost increases adding more to labor costs than the  Greenbook predicts, though we have not seen that happen yet Especially with somewhat higher  wages, consumer spending may prove stronger than is projected in the Greenbook I am a little  skeptical of a significant negative wealth effect if the stock market does what we all hope it will  do, namely, reflect real earnings prospects company by company and drift down at a moderate  rate That kind of outcome may not have a major negative wealth effect There also may be a  little more momentum in business investment than the staff is estimating I would not expect,  however, that a slightly stronger economy would give us significantly higher inflation Cheaper  imports, including the flood of goods we will be getting from Asia, are certainly going to hold  down price increases, and productivity growth may hold up a little better than the Greenbook  suggests    12/16/97  I, too, am mystified by the deflation question that we get every time we make a  speech I have concluded, unlike Ed Boehne, that the question should not be taken too seriously  That's because when I ask those who pose the question what they really mean by it, I often do  not get a very good answer They may have in mind something they read on the front page of  the Wall Street Journal that sounds like a good question to ask a speaker from the Federal  Reserve The prospect that prices actually will go down in the face of what we normally see as  continuing strength in the economy strikes me as bizarre  On the foreign front I, too, thought Bill McDonough's analysis was extremely cogent  I spent a week  in Europe listening to the remarks of Japanese finance ministry and central bank officials  concerning what they are going to do about their economy The explanations were not  reassuring One of our European colleagues asked me if I thought they didn't understand the  problem or if they just didn't have the political will to do what was needed I said that I did not  know But, there is still a great deal of uncertainty about whether they can come to grips with  their problem There are, of course, possibilities that we could fall off the precipice  internationally or even conceivably domestically if an international rout had a sudden effect on  the US stock market and consumer confidence, the kind of Gulf War phenomenon that nobody  expected but that did happen I think that is unlikely On balance, I am not that far from the  Greenbook forecast, although my confidence interval on anything that might be said about the  next few weeks is very wide   Ted Truman, to his credit, did not say "worst" case He referred to a  "worse" case   I, too, support the "B" symmetric I don't think there is any case for  moving rates down Were it not for the Asian problem, one could make a case for moving rates  up, but I'm not sure I would be totally persuaded by that case, given the CPI and the  productivity information But we do have the Asian problem and we do not know how severe its  effects will be So, it seems to me that "B" symmetric is the right thing to do   Thank you This is the election you all have been eagerly waiting  for! The floor is open for nominations for Chairman of the Federal Open Market  Committee Is there a nomination? [Laughter]   Alan Greenspan That is a good idea   Are there any further nominations? All in favor say "aye"  SEVERAL "Aye"   Now the floor is open for nominations for the Vice Chair of the  Federal Open Market Committee Are there any nominations?   Are there any further nominations? All in favor signal "aye"  SEVERAL "Aye"    2/3-4/98   The deed is done   As a lot of people have noted, the Committee is faced with an  unusual degree of uncertainty We all said that to each other in December but it is more  true now Uncertainty does not make today's decision harder; in fact, it makes it easier  The fact that there is no imminent danger of inflation or recession makes it easy to justify  leaving the monetary policy levers where they are until more evidence accumulates  bearing on the question of which way we might want to move them Uncertainty at this  level, however, does mean that we are likely to be facing very tough decisions in the next  few months The question is in which direction  I can live with the Greenbook forecast, but I can also imagine the economy  proving to be a good deal stronger than the staff projects Consumer demand could prove  even more resilient than they are projecting based on strong wage growth, attractive    2/3-4/98  interest rates for financing homes, durables, and cars, and continued strength in the stock  market Yesterday's stock market increase seemed irrational to me since the best that  could be said about the Asian crisis is that it may have bottomed out and that its currently  predicted slowing effects on the US economy and the rest of the world may not worsen  any further However, my thinking that market behavior is irrational, or indeed even the  Chairman thinking out loud in the same vein, does not guarantee that such behavior will  not continue Favorable financing and general optimism also could keep business  investment stronger than projected  If the economy does prove stronger in the near term than the staff anticipates, we  could be faced with a difficult dilemma as early as next month, especially if the big  increase in the ECI at the end of 1997 turns out not to be a blip attributable to  extraordinary bonuses for real estate agents and stockbrokers but the beginning of a  broad-based acceleration in labor compensation Some of the comments around the table  seem to support that possibility A decision to increase the federal funds rate would be  difficult to defend publicly because the downward pressures from declining import prices  would still be constraining inflation Productivity might still be exceeding expectations  and the prospect of a slowdown in the economy from the net export drag and slower  inventory accumulation would still be highly likely even if it were not showing up in the  current data If all this happens, we will have to face up to a hard choice about raising  rates in March I do not know how we would come out, but I think Al Broaddus would  be a lot less lonely! [Laughter]  Conversely, I can imagine the US economy looking substantially weaker than the  Greenbook forecast over the next few months This scenario would depend largely on    2/3-4/98  psychological factors and not on anything likely to be picked up in models The list of  downside factors includes some potential setbacks in Asia, such as the lack of political  will to carry out the reforms in Korea or Japan or a new round of devaluations, possibly  sparked by China and Hong Kong giving in to pressures to devalue Other downside  factors might involve a spate of poor US corporate earnings reports that triggered a steep  drop in the US stock market and a fall in consumer and business confidence, negative  domestic political developments, or escalating tensions in the Middle East Any of these  triggers would precipitate a steeper-than-anticipated reduction in US growth and even a  negative downward spiral that would threaten a world recession I view this scenario as a  lot less likely but a lot more dangerous than the first The Fed might be called on to act  quickly but decisively to contain the damage and try to restore healthy growth The one  thing the world cannot afford right now is a stalling US engine  The hard decision, especially if events prove only mildly more negative than now  expected, will be to distinguish between a stall and a return to sustainable growth I for  one believe that the economy's recent history strongly suggests two conclusions One,  that the US economy is a lot less inflation-prone in the face of tight labor markets than  we used to think it was Second, that tight labor markets have important positive effects  on individual incentives to work and acquire skills and experience and on business  incentives to invest in productivity-enhancing processes and capital improvements  Hence, I believe the Fed should be prepared to act quickly and decisively to limit damage  from slow growth and rising unemployment   Despite the enormous ingenuity of the staff, I don't think we  understand these M relationships very well at all My guess is that our understanding will  not get much better We may get some comforting returns for a while to some  relationships with which we are familiar, but that might not last I think the optimum  position would be to tell the Congress honestly that we don't understand the Ms very  well We do not, in fact, discuss monetary policy in terms of the Ms between Humphrey-  Hawkins meetings Don Kohn dutifully mentions them because he thinks he ought to, but  that is not the way we think about monetary policy I don't think we want to take on that  crusade at the moment For that reason, I would stay with alternative I because I think it  will involve the least complicated discussion with the Congress about why we are  adopting particular ranges I don't think we have a good rationale for changing them,  although moving to a consistent set of ranges would be rather nice But if I had my  druthers I would be consistent in not talking about the Ms at all   I would prefer alternative zero, but as a practical matter I am opting  for alternative I   I strongly support "B" symmetric as the best policy at the moment   Mike, excuse me, but what were your academics saying a year ago?   I think the FOMC is in a difficult spot though I don't expect we will  get much sympathy [Laughter] Our difficulties, as Bill Poole just pointed out, stem not because  anything bad is happening but precisely because so little bad is happening The economy is  performing as well as it ever has and probably as well as any economy ever has, which is a mind  boggling thought People are producing and consuming and working and investing at higher  levels than anywhere before Better than that, the economy's adjustment mechanisms seem to be  working better than they ever have, here or elsewhere Capacity has expanded and modernized  at the same time Companies have learned how to manage inventories Labor markets seem to  be functioning well in moving people to where they are needed most Shortages, bottlenecks,  strikes--imbalances that characterized boom periods in the past--do not seem evident, although    3/31/98  we all have been looking hard to find some of these imbalances Even world events are  supporting the good performance of the US economy That is especially true, again as Bill  Poole just pointed out, with respect to the price of oil The latter seems to have fallen far enough  to help our oil-consuming industries, which are most of our industries, without hurting our  oil-producing sector so much as to create widespread problems, although Bob McTeer has  pointed to some problems It is hard to find any villains in this piece when one looks at the usual  suspects Even politicians seem to be behaving reasonably well  Some reports around this table, quite a few actually, point to speculative building We  have not yet had an evident boom in nonresidential construction, although we may There are a  lot of reports of labor shortages but also considerable evidence that the response has been  flexible, targeted compensation increases coupled with cost-cutting in nonlabor areas There also  are reports that companies are leaving jobs unfilled or even expanding in different locations  rather than bidding wages up Only the stock market seems out of line, and there is some  evidence even there that investors are responding sensibly to earnings declines in particular  stocks The view that equities are a good long-run investment might indicate that investors  would not panic in the event of a significant stock market correction All of this makes  policymaking quite hard for us  Our job is to keep the good news flowing, and we are quite sure that the economy  cannot expand much longer at its current pace without running out of workers and setting off a  process of labor cost increases followed by price increases So, we would like to take out some  insurance by slowing things down a tad But it is not clear that we have a policy instrument that  will do that The real federal funds rate is already quite high; raising it a notch or two might not  raise long rates for some of the reasons that have been mentioned It might not have much of an    3/31/98  effect Conversely, there may be some danger that an increase would be seen as too strong a  signal, especially to the stock market, and might induce some panic selling since we have not  signaled that we were about to do anything like that I lean to the notion that it probably would  not have much effect, but there's no way to guarantee that outcome  By May, we might be either more or less worried about overheating If, as the staff  projects, the expansion slows because of the Asian effects and for other reasons, the prospects of  overheating might seem less serious But the risk that it will not slow and that labor cost  pressures will be building even more is certainly there and has been voiced around this table  The good news, it seems to me, is that there is almost no evidence that we could get surprised by  a rapid spurt of inflation If anything seems clear about the economy, it is that its adjustment  mechanisms are well oiled at the moment so that we are unlikely to be surprised by sudden  lurches That is comforting if we decide to do nothing   It sounded okay!   Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation, but I think we should  remind ourselves that, with the exception of Bill Poole, we have all been here before The  situation has changed and we have a new view of the outlook It is not inconceivable that we  will be back in six weeks when something, presumably developments in Asia, has weakened the  expansion and we may not be quite as sure as we seem to be today that everything is moving in  the direction of an overly strong economy But I certainly agree that that is how it looks today  I also have a lot of sympathy with the suggestion to announce our asymmetry decision  immediately I think we all wish that we had already adopted that policy so that we could say  something about asymmetry in our announcement today But if we change our announcement  policy in midstream without any prior discussion, it probably would be better to raise the fed  funds rate today than to do this peculiar and unexpected thing  I also would like to stress the importance not just of your making a policy speech, but  that there be a series of policy speeches with all of us weaving into our remarks more about how  we feel I would suggest that the emphasis should be on our worries about speculation, loose  credit, and other concerns that people can relate to rather than saying that we think the economy  ought to be restrained because we are very worried about tight labor markets and poor people  earning more money That sounds silly when you say it that way, but sometimes we come across  as though our real worries are tight labor markets rather than the objective, as Bill McDonough  said earlier, of keeping the labor markets tight and retaining the benefits of full employment for  the future   I am substantially where Roger Ferguson is, and I'm not sure I can put  the case any better; he presented it very well We have a very difficult problem We have had an  extremely strong economy, which continues to be strong It has been an extraordinary  performance Every time we meet we have a few more anecdotes about the tightness in labor  markets, and we are beginning to get more and more signs of tightness of other sorts some  speculative building, some land price increases, evidence of that kind But I believe we have  learned a few things about the economy in the last couple of years that lead me to be reluctant to  move quickly One is that the economy clearly is not as inflation prone at low levels of  unemployment as we thought it was Some of the reasons may be temporary and we need to watch  to see if they are turning around The rising dollar, the falling oil prices, and the slow growth in the  costs of health care benefits may all be exerting beneficial effects on inflation that are not going to    5/19/98  last But some of the reasons seem to be much more lasting I believe that there has been a  productivity upshift, probably from a combination of technological developments, new  management reforms and attitudes, deregulation, global competition, lower inflation expectations,  and new ways that businesses are reacting to labor scarcities  The second thing I believe we have learned is that tight labor markets do us a lot of  good They generate more experienced workers, more training, more education, more opportunities  for promotion, and more incentives to invest in oneself and in one's workers That investment in  skills actually is happening and should pay off in productivity improvements in the future The low  unemployment levels seem to generate pressure for capital deepening, which may have an  unusually high payoff in the present state of our technology None of this means that there are no  limits, as Roger Ferguson put it The economy cannot continue to grow at the first-quarter pace  without running out of workers and generating serious wage and eventually price pressures  I would be very worried but for the prospect that the expansion will slow for the  reasons that are set forth in the Greenbook I tend to think that the Greenbook is a bit optimistic  about Asia We may not see a rout but more deterioration in Indonesia, Korea, and possibly also in  Japan  That leaves the stock market, which clearly is too high I'm not sure that anything we  might do here would provide a good signal, nor is signaling the stock market an appropriate way to  use monetary policy I am inclined to the view that we will get a correction as earnings deteriorate  and, if I'm right about Asia, as that source of deterioration sinks in So, I would join those who  would urge that we wait yet another six weeks and see where we are because I think a tightening  might prove unnecessary   Mr Chairman, I concur with both parts of your recommendation I do  not think we ought to move today My reasons relate to Asia, but not in terms of the impact of our  move on Asia Rather, it is because I expect the deteriorating situation in Asia to have more of an  impact on our economy than we seem to be anticipating and possibly to make a move unnecessary  Nevertheless, I agree that the risks are on the upside Even so, I do not share the view of Presidents  Poole and Minehan that there is much of a risk of waiting too long It is not my perception that the  US economy is some tight spring ready to pop The economy has a lot of inertia, as we have seen  for quite a long time I don't think the cost of waiting is likely to be that high   Maybe you should not leave!    5/19/98   I so nominate her     Did you have to eat one to find that out?   That is really serious! [Laughter]   Like many around the table, I find the Greenbook forecast very  appealing It would be nice if it were right! I think that if the forecast turned out to be right, we  would find ourselves in a situation that is extremely interesting, unusual, and uncertain but not  difficult By that I mean the soft landing would get us out of the difficult choice between our  domestic responsibilities and our international ones  We have had so much good news over the last year or so that it is nice to think that  good news is normal The domestic economy has certainly been performing extremely well by  even the most demanding standards Growth has been very strong and well balanced Labor  markets have been tighter without adverse inflation consequences for longer than any of us  would have thought possible Wages have been rising but not yet at an alarming pace, and prices  have been astonishingly well behaved so far Capacity has increased and whatever we think  about the permanence or impermanence of the productivity increase, it certainly has been there  when we needed it to help keep wage increases from pushing either prices up or profits down  The pace of growth last year and the acceleration in the first quarter of this year were clearly  unsustainable by anybody's measures There is no way we could keep adding to payrolls at that    6/30-7/1/98  rate without running out of workers and ending up with the proverbial bottlenecks that have been  so amazingly absent from the current boom  Without an impending slowdown, we clearly would be tempted or required by any  serious economic analysis to use the only tool we have to slow the expansion down But we are  saved by a forecast that shows the growth rate dropping like a rock under the combined impact  of inventory retrenchment and the worsening Asian crisis So, we have to hope that the  Greenbook is right or at least roughly right and that the slowdown will occur or indeed has  already occurred I certainly agree that the evidence points to slowing, but I am skeptical about  the break being as sharp as the staff believes My guess is that we will be back in August with a  domestic economy that is running a bit faster than we think it sustainably can and with more  signs of domestic inflation I am not too worried about that because I think the dollar also is  likely to stay strong and that the anti-inflationary inertia is currently a very potent force By that  I mean that the low inflation expectations and the pervasive belief of the business community  that they have no pricing power because market conditions are so competitive are keeping  inflation in check  If the forecast is substantially wrong and growth does not slow much, then we really  have a difficult problem The problem arises primarily because in some respects at least we are  not just the central bank of the United States We are an institution with world responsibilities,  whether we like it or not If by August or sooner, it is obvious that the US economy is  continuing to run hot, then we have a serious dilemma, especially if the world outlook is as  precarious or even more precarious than it looks now We can tell ourselves that the best thing  to do for the world as well as for ourselves is to keep the US economy growing on a sustainable  track, and therefore we better slow it down by raising rates But we would then be taking the    6/30-7/1/98  risk of making the world situation even less tenable and perhaps precipitating another round of  competitive currency devaluations that could lead to a prolonged global depression That is not  an attractive set of choices, so we had better hope that the Greenbook forecast is right  Of course, there is also the possibility raised by several around the table that the  Greenbook is wrong in the other direction The sharp slowing could cut investor and consumer  confidence The stock market could turn to rational nonexuberance and we would be faced with  a soft economy and rising unemployment That would be unfortunate but not particularly hard to  manage from a policy point of view The world would be quite happy with our cutting interest  rates   In any case, though, I think we should take up what I heard as Bill  Poole's offer to give it a very serious review [Laughter]  SPEAKER(?) That would commit him to a week of hard labor!   That's not where we are now!   There is this nice lake in Wyoming where one might do this   I, too, concur with keeping the ranges where they are The fact is that  we do look at the money supply numbers and we discuss them along with a lot of other variables,  but in my time on this Committee we have not really used them to set policy I would need a lot  of convincing to believe that we should That leaves me, of course, with some sympathy for the  Meyer projections approach, but I come out thinking that leaving well enough alone is the best  policy   Certainly nothing is ever going to be perfectly clear! I support your  recommendation, Mr Chairman As I said yesterday, I think the staff may be overestimating the  potential for a slowdown in the near term, but I also am very worried about Asia and the  possibility of a general collapse in several foreign countries I do not think we know what we  can do to avoid that, but we know that raising the federal funds rate today is not the appropriate  measure    6/30-7/1/98   I come out where Mike Kelley, Ed Boehne, and the Chairman do I did  not get there very easily It does seem to me that we have an obligation to be as clear as possible    6/30-7/1/98  and to get across to the press and the public that follows monetary policy developments that we  are dealing with hard issues, that we are balancing risks, and that no mysterious things go on  behind the walls of the temple I want people to understand what our discussions are about In  that context, I have been rather admiring of what the Brits have done in getting it all out and  talking more clearly than it seems to me we sometimes do So, I started with the notion that  maybe the first step should be to announce the tilt in a comprehensible way If it is not a signal  to the markets, to whom is it a signal? Just to us? I came to the conclusion that it is really a  signal just to us and that putting it out to the markets would have all of the difficulties that Mike  Kelley and Ed Boehne have discussed rather eloquently I believe it would end up being more  confusing than not, in part because the world changes in six weeks and we change our minds It  is not a good predictor of future policy actions largely because we often perceive things  differently by the time of the next meeting I don't think we want to be in a position of having to  explain that as well as everything else  I conclude that we are doing more or less the right thing with two exceptions I would  amend the wording of this directive I do not have a proposal right now, but it is mysterious in  the extreme with the "woulds" and the "mights" Every time I hear it, I have a little difficulty  not laughing [Laughter] I think we could do better than that if we put our minds to it The other  exception is that I don't see any harm in announcing a "no change" decision in just that way A  "no change" decision is a policy decision just like a change, and I don't see why both should not  be treated the same way We could just state what we decided at the end of the meeting in an  ordinary way rather than continuing to use the arcane expression that "the Committee met"   I agree with that   Can't we say we decided not to move the federal funds rate?   Can't we now?   I don't think what I am proposing would deceive the public   I think it just adds to the perception of a mysterious Federal Reserve   Let us try again!    6/30-7/1/98   There might be less!   He is always nice [Laughter]   We in the FOMC tend to concentrate on what has happened since we  last met, this magical period known only in this room as the intermeeting period, but I find it  interesting to go back a little further sometimes In this case, I went back to March, which is only  five months ago, and found myself very impressed, which is a compliment, folks, with the  forecasting ability of the staff The March meeting, as you remember, was held near the end of a  roaring first quarter that proved to be even stronger than we expected at that time The staff was    8/18/98  predicting, albeit somewhat diffidently, a drastic slowdown in the expansion due to inventory  deceleration and the impact of the Asian financial crisis on our net exports There was some  skepticism around this table, including my own, but in hindsight it appears that the staff made a  quite good forecast The timing was a little off; the first quarter was stronger and the second  weaker than they anticipated, but the basic forecast of slowing to less than potential for the rest of  this year and next looks increasingly right to me They also called the stock market about  right--so far Despite the reduced earnings expectations that are bound to occur with slower  growth, they expected only a modest correction in the stock market So far, that is what we have  gotten  What is evident looking back even five months is that the Asian crisis is proving to be  deeper, more intractable, and possibly more contagious than we thought it would be a few months  ago Japan is more deeply mired in political paralysis Other Asian economies, especially  Indonesia, are in more desperate shape China, including Hong Kong, Russia, and possibly Brazil,  are more fragile than we anticipated at that time  Looking ahead, it seems to me that the overheating of the US economy is likely to be  slipping into the category of past worries despite some evidence of shortages of construction and  other workers and of some materials that have been mentioned around the table We have learned  over the last couple of years that even with extremely tight labor markets, our economy is much  less prone to accelerating inflation than we thought it was Labor markets now seem likely to ease  up a bit as economic growth slows That does not necessarily mean that we will avoid an uptick  in inflation in delayed reaction to higher wages, possible increases in health care costs, and some  other factors that have been mentioned Indeed, we might be in for a bit of stagflation If that  happens, we may unfortunately have to live with it It is hard to imagine raising interest rates in    8/18/98  the face of softening employment and economic growth that is below potential What has been  learned before is that we do not have a very good tool to combat stagflation if we get it  I suspect that domestic overheating and inflation are going to be fairly low on our list of  worries over the next few months Rather, I suspect that we will be focused more and more on  how to keep the world economy--the non-European, non-North American economy--from  unraveling further and how to mitigate the damage to our own economy It is not hard to imagine  that world growth, instead of recovering modestly in 1999 as forecast in the Greenbook, might get  a good deal worse before it gets better and that recovery will be delayed at least until the year  2000 Our economy now looks strong enough to weather the storm without a recession, but its  ability to do that depends heavily on consumer confidence and the absence of a rout in the stock  market My guess now would be that we will get a series of orderly corrections in the stock  market--stair steps down to values more in line with realistic profit expectations--but market  psychology is a fragile thing  This all adds up to saying that I believe the risks are now at least as much on the  downside as on the upside and that not moving the federal funds rate is certainly the right policy  for now   I agree, Mr Chairman, that a symmetric directive makes sense at this  moment Such a directive reflects my view that we are unlikely to change monetary policy  anytime soon and that, when we do, we may move the fed funds rate up or down Now, I have  been wrong before We all have been wrong before The only argument that I see for not  changing the tilt is the fact that it does not have much operational significance and moving it  around a lot risks our looking a little silly if we turn out to be wrong about the balance of risks  So, I could go along with the strong argument for leaving the tilt where it is, but my preference  would be to adopt a symmetric directive   I think we ought to blame Alan Greenspan!   This is Alice Rivlin, I strongly agree with what Bill McDonough just  said I had come to the conclusion myself that the case for moving the rate down on Tuesday was  very strong, largely because of what is going on around the world It is not such a strong case  purely domestically, but because there is also a significant, although we hope not an  overwhelming, possibility that things might move south in the interim, communicating something  about the possibility of a policy easing move is a good thing for the Chairman to do   I agree with Option 1 as amended by Tom Hoenig I thought the staff  draft was a quite good breakthrough in terms of added clarity and straightforwardness, and Tom  has made it a bit better I suspect that what will happen if we know we are announcing the tilt is  that we will be less likely to have one We may, if there is a considerable degree of uncertainty,  take refuge in a no tilt directive, but that seems appropriate to me The only reason for having a  tilt is that we want to send a signal about which way we are leaning When we are sure enough  of that signal, we ought to say so We don't need to signal ourselves; we need to signal  somebody else So, it should be a public matter I also think it would be desirable to get the    9/29/98  minutes out sooner if we could But the important breakthrough is straightforward language on  the tilt and announcing it immediately   Let me start with the world situation Like many others, I find the  world economy both sad and scary The saddest part is that so many millions of people in  developing countries in Asia and Latin America are being thrown into desperate circumstances  just at the point when they were beginning to have hope for the long-run future Many of them  have not been in the modern world all that long They left villages and in many cases their home  countries in search of jobs in modernizing economies Now they are being thrown back into  insecurity and a struggle for bare necessities with no idea if or when the economic opportunities  for them will reopen I stress that because I think we sometimes tend to sit around this table and  act as though all the losers were investors and high flyers They definitely are not    9/29/98  The scary part is that those of us who believe strongly and rightly in the power of  capitalism to improve peoples' lives do not know where the current downslide will end or what  we can do that will effectively stop its spreading contagion We already knew, of course, that  when large amounts of capital are moving freely in search of higher returns that investors can be  victims of their own excessive optimism and then get caught in a wave of excessive pessimism  We also knew that capital flows were far greater than ever before, that world markets were more  interlinked, and that financial movements were more rapid in an age of instant global  communications But I don't think we knew how big an impact that might have We knew that  very clever self-assured people were placing huge bets with other peoples' money on  relationships that they could only guess about, that sooner or later some of them would guess  wrong, and that the consequences could be serious But now that the exuberance has turned to  pessimism and risk aversion and so many of the weaknesses in the world's financial structure  have been revealed--some we knew about and some we are just learning about--the economic  policymakers in industrial countries are struggling to figure out how best to manage the crisis  and where and how to build firebreaks in hopes of containing the meltdown so the rebuilding can  begin  That is a very difficult job, but it is not our job around this table The job of this  Committee is a much narrower one It is to keep the US economy growing at a healthy rate, not  only for the well being of Americans themselves but so we can play as strong a role as possible  in bringing the rest of the world back to economic health For the last couple of years, indeed  the whole time I have been part of this group, we have been primarily worried that the United  States was growing at an unsustainably high rate Now many of the signs point to slowdown,  although it is striking that the anecdotes about the domestic economy are a lot more negative  than the real statistics so far Nevertheless, the risks have shifted, and clearly one risk to worry    9/29/98  about is that if the United States slides into stagnation or even recession--although that is not  likely to happen soon--we will further exacerbate the world crisis  I don't think we have a hard choice today We need to take a small step in the  direction of monetary ease We need to stand ready to take more steps if necessary, but I  certainly agree with those who feel that rushing quickly ahead would gain us little and probably  would be, as Ned Gramlich said, an un-Fed-like thing to do   Only you would know that!    9/29/98   Mr Chairman, I too agree with your recommendation of a 25 basis  point reduction In my view, a larger move is unnecessary, and it likely would be interpreted as  evidence that the Fed must really be worried I don't think we want to convey that impression I  would also concur with the proposed downward tilt in the directive despite the discussion that we  had at the beginning of our meeting this morning If we were going to announce our decision on    9/29/98  the tilt today, I might be more inclined toward a symmetric directive I would worry that the  reaction to asymmetry might be to question why we didn't reduce the rate by 50 basis points if  we are that concerned   Since we decided not to publish the tilt today, I come out in favor of a  25 basis point reduction and asymmetry toward easing   How many more LTCMs are there?   I agree   If you do it right! [Laughter]   That is what stress testing is all about   This is Alice I would certainly concur with most of what I have heard  around this table   I will get closer to the mike and shout! Everything I have heard around  this table, if it can be called a table, confirms what I thought I knew, namely that the world is  very weak and getting weaker We see enormous risk aversion in financial markets all over the  world But here in the United States we have general strength in the domestic economy,  especially in the consumer sector At the same time, there is a great deal of anxiety and some  evidence of a pullback from economic activities that were going on or were expected to be going  on in the next few months  It seems to me that these developments give us an enormous chance to get ahead of the  curve, as Ed Boehne suggested early in the conversation, and to do what we can to keep a good    10/15/98  thing going in this country What worries me most and I think worries other people most is that  the real weakness in the world economy is eventually going to affect our own economy I think  we should get ahead of that by taking action as expeditiously as we can to make sure that the  US economy stays strong Now, we can wait until our next meeting, but that would involve a  long wait The risk of waiting in my view is that we may be forced into a reactive position The  beauty of doing something right now is that nothing much is happening We can look ahead as  we did before to see likely weakening in the US economy and decide what to do about it later,  but I think we should make a prompt downward rate move If we wait to see what is going to  happen in the next week or two, we might find ourselves reacting to either a sharp drop in the  stock market as earnings come in more gloomy or to a catastrophe on the international scene if  Brazil or something else goes wrong So this seems to me a good moment to make our move   I would agree with the Chairman I believe we want to send a strong  signal I don't think we should worry about the panic factor I suggested 50 basis points on the  discount rate because I thought it would give a stronger signal Indeed, if we were only going to  do 25 on the discount rate, I would be inclined to move the fed funds rate by perhaps 50 basis    10/15/98  points because I think the point is to communicate the message that we are in the action here, and  we are doing something major   Is applause appropriate?   I, too, after thinking Cathy Minehan was on the right track, am back to  Option 2 because it is simpler The subtleties of the sentence that is under consideration for  removal had escaped me, so I was in favor of taking it out I still favor dropping it unless there is  some subtlety that can and should be conveyed But if it is that subtle, and I have been here 2-1/2  years, maybe it really is unnecessary    11/17/98   We didn't know that there were no bonds in our portfolio! [Laughter]   We could, of course, unbalance the budget to make it easier  [Laughter] Peter, I was already persuaded that you have a very hard job and that you do it well,  and this little schematic of how hard it has been recently was very persuasive However, I didn't  hear anything that could be of help to you other than the possible reduction in the aversion of  depository institutions to utilizing the discount window Is that the message, or is there  something else that this Committee ought to do to make it easier for you to hold the funds rate on  its target?   I think the evidence is accumulating that the real US economy is run  by a bunch of cheerful little elves [laughter] who do not like forecasters Every so often they get  together and say, "Okay, guys, if we work real hard, maybe we can surprise them again" But  don't knock the elves; they've been doing quite a good job for most of the 1990s and we have all  benefited The US domestic economy has certainly shown heartening resilience in the face of    11/17/98  global downdrafts in the last year and particularly in the last three months, much as it showed  resilience and adaptability to upward pressures and threats of overheating in the previous couple  of years Consumers are spending cheerfully, buying houses and cars and maintaining a fairly  robust outlook on their situation In their role as small investors, some of the same people are  reinforcing their own optimism by continuing to buy stocks in companies whose near-term  earnings prospects would not seem to justify their purchase  Elsewhere in the economy, the effects of the world slowdown are evident  Agricultural prices and exports are suffering Manufacturing is feeling the difficulty, laying off  some people, and beginning to pull back on expansion plans Investors are still wary of any  risky venture despite some melting of the frozen capital markets of a few weeks ago  The elves have to do their job and we have to do ours I believe that most of the signs  point, as the Greenbook indicates, to a substantial slowing of the US economy as we go into  1999 We have an extraordinary responsibility to make sure that the US economy, as the  linchpin of the global economic system, does not slow too much That is why I believe we  should take the downside risks very seriously and reinforce our last two easing steps by taking  one more today If we did not have the world depending on us, we could afford to wait and see  whether we have done enough already But the world still looks very fragile to me, and whether  we like it or not, the US economy is carrying a heavy load in the world's recovery Asia is  barely turning up, if it is Russia is a total disaster Western European countries seem quite  myopic in their preoccupation with their own affairs, but they are revising their forecasts down  Latin America, as we have discussed, seems extremely fragile; there is hope but by no means a  certainty of staving off disaster in Brazil and another round of contagion So, it does seem to me  that we have to worry a lot about that    11/17/98  On the other side, I see little downside domestic risk in worrying too much about our  responsibilities to the world Inflation is not a near-term threat, although we may see some wage  increases The stock market is clearly a concern; we might encourage investors too much But I  still believe, experience notwithstanding, that rationality will reassert itself in the stock market as  earnings fall So, I think we have a close question today, and it may be a comforting thought that  we cannot do a lot of harm On balance, I see the risks on the downside, especially  internationally, and feel that we have a special responsibility to take them very seriously   Mr Chairman, I support both parts of your recommendation In the  interest of lunch, I will not elaborate   Let me make three general points about the situation we find ourselves  in at year-end One is that the continued sterling performance of the US economy is really  remarkable, and it is going to be worthy of some serious scholarly attention for some time to  come A year or two ago the press, economists gathered at meetings, and even the FOMC were  full of talk about a possible new era We did not all endorse it, but we all talked about it Some  of us were trying to explain how labor markets could remain so tight without causing wage    12/22/98 48  inflation to accelerate Others were suggesting that some combination of the long heralded but  unrealized impact of information technology on production plus the new competitiveness of  management had put the US economy on a higher productivity trend  Then we all got distracted by the worldwide economic crisis and our effort to maintain  our island of prosperity in the midst of global turmoil for the world's sake as well as our own  But while we were distracted, the US economy continued to chug along, pumping out goods  and services, making better and better use of limited labor supply, rewarding skill with wages  that provided incentives to acquire more skill, handing out bonuses to high performers, but not  shifting into the mode of general wage inflation Moreover, good productivity growth continued  even in manufacturing where demand slackened and payrolls were falling The urge to  modernize and computerize remained robust in the face of macroeconomic forecasts that might  have prompted retrenchment in earlier eras The US economy really does seem to be working  better than it used to work It is more flexible; it is less inflation prone The good performance  is more remarkable the longer it continues  Second point It is possible that one of the things we all thought we knew about  monetary policy has to be unlearned, namely that it operates with very long lags Jack Guynn  referred to this in the opposite direction, but I don't think he and I are saying anything  inconsistent He was reminding us that the full effects of the policy moves of the last couple of  months have not yet been felt, something we would not have needed to be reminded of a few  years ago We would not have expected the effects to be completely incorporated yet  We used to think that central bankers had to take big leaps into the dark because our  policy instrument, while powerful in the long run, affected the economy only over periods of 6 to  18 months or more But now we find ourselves with a tool that seems to work faster Our    12/22/98 49  actions in September through November are credited with strengthening--or sometimes credited  with overheating--the US economy in the current quarter, not to mention the prospects for the  first half of next year One reason is the increased importance of equity markets both in  financing business expansion and more importantly in enhancing consumer wealth I think the  wealth effect is not going to be temporary It will only become more important as prosperity and  longer lifespans combine to increase the portfolio of the average family That is not so true in  Europe yet, but it surely will be in the coming decade and elsewhere around the world as well  So, we have to learn to accept wealth impacts on consumer behavior as an increasingly important  aspect of the monetary equation  Another phenomenon that has cut the lags is the growing importance of consumer  credit and home mortgages The ease of refinancing home mortgages and home equity loans  makes the transmission of monetary policy moves into consumer behavior more direct and faster  The growth of global equity flows and sensitivity of global markets to information also  magnifies the effect of policy moves by the world's important central banks, namely us and the  soon to be created ECB So, we have a hotter instrument in our hands than we used to have and  we had better get used to it  Third point The world is still a scary place I won't argue with the Greenbook  forecast, but I believe we will all be lucky if it comes to pass While there are some upside risks,  which have been mentioned, it seems to me that the risks are mostly on the downside There is  Brazil, which is still very uncertain There is Russia, where more chaos is possible and the world  community seems absolutely paralyzed about what to do There is Japan, where the worst may  be over, but we have said that a lot of times before and the possibility of a spiral of deflation is  also there And there are countries all around the world that we have not focused on There is    12/22/98 50  also an uneasy knowledge that whatever blows up next, the turmoil will spread rapidly through  world markets in unpredictable ways So, despite my optimism about the fundamentals at home,  I think we had better look carefully for world trouble and hope that we know enough to use our  increasingly short-lagged policy tool appropriately if we have to   Mr Chairman, I concur with the "no change" and a symmetric  directive I think the risks are on both sides, but they are of a somewhat different nature The  upside risks would probably emerge gradually and not surprise us by their virulence The  downside risks, I think, are likely to be reflected in big changes if they materialize, although the  probability may be smaller   They won't sneak up on Jerry Jordan He already has them factored in  [Laughter]   I support option 3 and taking out the "in coming months" for the same  reasons that Governor Kelley and President Broaddus have stated I have a slight preference for  getting rid of the monetary aggregates sentence, but I don't feel strongly about it   Mr Chairman, I am quite strongly with the majority and I believe that  more communication to the public is better than less I view this as a step in the right direction  I would like to know how we nominate Don Kohn for the Nobel Peace Prize [Laughter]   Thank you It is not clear by what authority you were making   those announcements! [Laughter] I would like to open the floor for nominations for   Chairman of the FOMC Governor Kelley    Is there a second?   SEVERAL Second    Any discussion at this point?    All in favor say “aye”   SEVERAL Aye    Opposed?  I believe we have a Chairman    Since I still have the gavel, I will entertain nominations for Vice   Chair of the FOMC   SPEAKER(?) I nominate President McDonough of the New York Fed    Good idea     2/2-3/99 2   SEVERAL Second    Any further nominations?  All in favor say “aye”   SEVERAL Aye    Opposed?  We have a Vice Chair    I am glad I stimulated research in Atlanta I am interested in   seeing it   A couple of meetings ago I referred to the cheerful little elves who run the US   economy and get their kicks out of proving the cautious forecasters wrong The only   thing that can be said about the economic news since our last meeting is that the elves   have scored again When I heard that the estimate of the 1998 fourth-quarter GDP was   likely to be about 5 percent, I said, “Wow!” Then the official estimate turned out to be   56 percent with the possibility of an upward revision to perhaps over 6 percent   The elves clearly have been working overtime and they have gotten more   ingenious They have figured out how to control the weather, at least temporarily, and   how to keep productivity growth increasing when any reasonable elf would suspect that   all the reengineering and restructuring and computerizing that could be done had been   done already Most amazing of all, they seem to have figured out how to keep   unemployment rates lower than what the NAIRU enthusiasts have said for a long time is   the drop-dead rate, while wage increases actually have decelerated and inflation does not   seem to be a danger at present   The elves are clearly beginning to undermine the confidence of their opponents,   the Greenbook forecasters, [laughter] who are starting to doubt their own models, or at   least are getting a little defensive about them, and perhaps even doubt their common   sense To be sure, the Greenbookers are too sophisticated to fall for the elves’ more   brazen gimmicks like the weather ploy, or the bounceback from the auto strike, or   perhaps even the extraordinarily low oil price  They think those cannot be sustained, so   they are boldly forecasting a relatively quick slowdown to trend and some acceleration in   prices   But after pointing out for some time that stocks were overvalued and that the   stock market likely would come down, the Greenbookers are now saying that those   stocks are even more overvalued than the last time they looked And although they   expect profits to decline further, they do not expect stock prices to fall They will only   move sideways What can be the explanation of that? It’s only the fear that the elves   have been right so often that the Greenbookers would be embarrassed to be caught wrong   again Besides, nobody can predict the stock market     2/2-3/99 62   The question now is Have the elves run out of tricks or can they beat the game   one more time?  If it were not for the rest of the world, I would bet on the elves   However, I am not sure they speak Portuguese I am not sure they can move the   Brazilian political system into higher gear fast enough to reassure a nervous world   market I am not sure the elves, for all their ingenuity, can control the mood swings of   international investors or control the contagion that might flow from a collapse in Brazil   or from some other major negative event as yet unpredicted   So despite history, I am left thinking that the Greenbook may actually win this   time, though I must admit that I also thought that about the Atlanta Falcons [Laughter]   There is some risk that the economy may prove stronger in the early part of the year than   the Greenbook forecast I also have my doubts about whether the increase in the oil price   will be as much as they think On the other hand, the Greenbookers may have   overreacted to the elves on the stock market and could be understating the chances of a   negative wealth effect On the domestic front, I see the risks of upside and downside   surprises around the Greenbook forecast as approximately balanced However,   internationally, I see the risk as principally on the downside and possibly quite serious   As for the FOMC, I believe we should watch the game very carefully from our   comfortable seats on the sidelines but resist getting into the action Right now, any   action, or even any indication of possible action, is likely to do more harm than good    I would stay with the preliminary ranges because I don’t feel that I   have any basis for a new set of targets [Secretary’s note In the subsequent go-around,   all Board members and Reserve Bank Presidents indicated that they concurred with Ms   Rivlin’s statement]    I think it is inconceivable that you will not be asked    May I raise a technical point as a word of caution?  If we start to   indicate what we would like future Humphrey-Hawkins reports to include, in terms of   what we would want specified in the law, we will not get the last word They will Every   member of the Banking Committee is going to have an idea about what ought to be in the   law, and the easiest thing for the Chairman of that committee to do is to put them all in  I   think we should not encourage a rewriting of the law, even though I personally would   like to get rid of the monetary ranges, because once we start down that road we might end   up a lot worse off than we are now    If none of us has read it, you can rest assured very few other   people have [Laughter]    This is not so much a question as a plea for perhaps a different   structuring of the problem next time around I think the difference between the world   depicted in Charts 3 and 4 is very interesting, but it becomes dramatic only if one   assumes that we stay with the policy implied by one or the other for a very long time I   don’t know whether we are in the world of Chart 3 or Chart 4, and asking me to decide is   silly There is no way I can know that What we have to focus on, given that we don’t   know and that the truth is likely somewhere in between, is what the costs are of making a   mistake and how to move back from one to the other if we do make a mistake I don’t   know how you could help us think about that, but that is what I believe we need to be   thinking about for the next several meetings    I also strongly support your recommendation, Mr Chairman, for   the reasons ably stated by the Vice Chair But I would be a bit cautious about sending a   signal in the Humphrey-Hawkins testimony We have seen so little inflation that I’m not   sure we will see anything in the near term that could convince us that we should move up   soon    Those of you who are careful listeners will remember my   comments about the little elves who get their kicks out of confounding the experts and   modelers and doomsayers by making the US economy perform just a bit better than any   of those folks imagined that it could Well, as I read things, not only have the elves been     3/30/99 40   scoring again on all fronts, they have driven the enemy from the field Now they are   writing the Greenbook! [Laughter]    Despite Mike Prell’s denial of “new era” thinking, the   Greenbook forecast actually looks pretty good And as Cathy Minehan pointed out   earlier, a good deal of the shift in the staff’s thinking over time reflects changing views   about productivity and hence about potential growth As I read what they are saying at   the moment, it is that the economy could grow at roughly 3 percent for quite a while,   with unemployment below 45 percent and with not very visible internal pressure on   inflation, although one has to worry about risks from outside supply shocks   The favorable current picture has been detailed around the table and seems to   validate the Greenbook optimism  We have the phenomenon of growth slowing from the   improbably torrid pace of the fourth quarter to a still strong but seemingly more solid rate   at present We have continued extreme tightness in labor markets everywhere but no sign   of general wage inflation--indeed suggestions of deceleration--well predicted by our   staff, it should be said We have rapid productivity growth plus a wildly competitive   economy in which no one thinks they have any pricing power, which apparently allows   real earnings to rise and be combined with declining inflation without putting any stress   on profits We have a core CPI that has risen only about 2 percent over the last year   despite outsized jumps in tobacco prices The latter have to be considered good news if   they induce some people, particularly young people, not to smoke as much We have   other inflation indicators still falling And the outlook for the next year or two, while   showing some acceleration in inflation, is so benign that I think the elves are getting   bored or becoming bureaucratized Even the worries that Brazil might fall apart and   precipitate another overseas downward spiral, which seemed quite real at the time of the   last FOMC meeting, have receded somewhat The view has turned into some modest   optimism of “the worst may be over variety” and an expectation of slow but sure   recovery in the world economy     3/30/99 41   Are there risks? Certainly there are On the upside there is the risk that the   stock market’s apparently unwarranted continued upward price march may accelerate   again to even more bubbly heights, leading to a devastating crash when the bubble bursts   Another risk is that all the things that have held inflation in check for so long will   suddenly reverse, leading to an upward jolt to prices that might be sufficient to rekindle   inflationary expectations and leave inflation fighters playing catch-up Another is that   some unforeseen set of events in an unnamed country much bigger than Ecuador--some   have named China--will set off a new round of investor panic on the international scene   These are all possible But the risk of rapid shifts seems a little far-fetched The more   likely moderate turns for the worse that might occur seem likely to do so in the context of   a fairly firm atmosphere of confidence among investors and consumers in the United   States and of low inflation expectations so that rapid snowballing effects are unlikely   The sustained solid good news for quite a long time now on both growth and   inflation seems to me to have brought us to a point where we will have time to react even   if the good news begins to turn So I see the risks as fairly balanced, with not a great deal   of urgency for us to be preemptive   In the meantime, there is a serious task for economic analysts all around the   country--not so much at the Board, although here too--to try to find out why things are   going so well and what we can do to keep them going well That analysis must focus on   what is really happening at the firm, the household, and the market levels It is hard not   to conclude from recent events that tight labor markets are good for productivity growth,   or can be under certain circumstances What is happening to make this true?  Is it that   new management attitudes see scarce labor as an opportunity to reengineer processes or   substitute capital for labor, or both? Is it that an awareness of the importance of skill   acquisition and adaptability, combined with new techniques for training both on the job   and in newly flexible and relevant educational institutions such as community colleges,   has given new opportunities for productivity improvements?  Is it that new workers   moving into the tight labor markets have a major contingent of unusually ambitious and   upwardly mobile immigrant workers?  Does it relate to the unusual backlog of     3/30/99 42   technological innovations flowing out of new kinds of practical research and   development?  The answers are not going to be found in macro statistics or in models   We have to get into the interstices to find out what is happening and how we can keep it   going But that is not such a bad assignment for analysts--to investigate the causes of the   good news    I also concur in your recommendation, Mr Chairman I don’t   see any evidence that inflation is a clear and present danger in the United States at the   moment I concur with Ed Boehne and others that what we really should be focused on is     3/30/99 66   maximizing sustainable growth We don’t know exactly what that is And I am   unconvinced that at the moment we are operating at a rate which is unsustainably high or   that we will be in the near future I see risks on both sides I concur with your feeling   that Kosovo introduces more uncertainty, although it is not clear which way the risks   would cut I also see plenty of time for action if we turn out to be wrong So I would   stay where we are    I was quoted in a recent New Yorker article, one of the flood of   articles on our Chairman and the new era, as being “mystified in a pleasant way by the   recent performance of the economy”  I think that describes the mood that has captured   this group for quite a while now Now, we weren’t mystified about everything Much of   what was happening was explainable the global pressures on commodity prices; the   decline of agricultural prices; and the weakness of exports to Asia, which now seems to   be turning around Much of the domestic growth was explainable  the strength of   consumer demand as employment and incomes rose and stock prices soared; the housing   boom as interest rates fell; the durables boom as people furnished those houses and   bought new cars Also explainable was the downward pressure on prices from the strong   dollar and commodity prices--that fierce global and domestic competition   Other parts of the puzzle seemed less clear, basically pleasantly mysterious   Why was wage growth so subdued in the face of labor market tightness and the persistent   anecdotes around this table about reported wage increases and shortages of workers?   Above all, why did productivity accelerate so rapidly in the last two quarters?  There   were plenty of plausible reasons, but no certainty that the reasons were the right ones or   that they would last There were cyclical factors, capital deepening, the timing of the   technology revolution, and new management skills and attitudes None of it was very   conclusive but the numbers were there Through all the pleasant mystification, our   collective common sense kept saying things like “good things don’t last forever” Some   of the positive forces, such as the strong dollar, will turn around--supply and demand   laws still work Eventually we’ll run out of workers and wages will push up costs and/or   consumer prices will begin to rise for some exogenous reasons--oil or whatever--and   keep going up And then we must be prepared to act   Are we at that point or close to it?  The CPI is worrisome, but it’s only one   month’s number and we are used to a good deal of volatility in that measure Cost factors   still seem quite benign Wage growth, though, is not accelerating, at least in the statistics   Productivity is on a roll The ECI still seems to be coming down with profits rising     5/18/99 51   Market alarm at the CPI has sent long rates up a bit more, to do our work for us So the   question is Do we need to reinforce this with a hint or a tilt?  I would be inclined to   wait, but I can see the case for telling everybody that the Fed is awake    Mr Chairman, I agree with your proposal I don’t see strong   economic reasons for not waiting another month before making your proposed change   even though only a tilt is involved After all, the only really disturbing economic news is   the core CPI for one month But we may have to move in the next few months and, if so,   I have concluded that psychologically there are some good reasons for moving to a   published tilt now Indeed, if a slowdown in the expansion is in prospect and we   reinforce its probability with the higher rates and lower equity prices that might follow   our announcement of a tilt, the markets may do our work for us and we may not have to   move at all
