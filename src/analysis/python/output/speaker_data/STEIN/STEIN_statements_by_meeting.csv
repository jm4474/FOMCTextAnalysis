9406,2013-10-16,"  I just wanted to reiterate something that I thought I heard Bill English say    I don’t think the claim is that it is not affecting market prices  It’s that we are effectively taking   operational risk out of the system rather than taking default risk out of the system  And I think if   we’re doing that, and that’s the overarching principle, in some sense that’s monetary policy,   right?  These things are functioning less well as a transactions medium because of the   operational risk, and we replace them, in some sense, with something that functions better,   October 16, 2013 31 of 50    without absorbing default risk from the Treasury  I think that’s the case  I didn’t hear Bill   making a case that it was not going to affect market prices  If it didn’t affect some kind of   market prices, it would be an irrelevant proposition in the first place    First, very quickly, I also support 6 and 7, pretty much for the same   reasoning that Vice Chairman Dudley laid out, and I’d happily give my proxy on that     Let me wade into 8 and 9 and take on “loathsome”  I sort of understand that people are   extremely uncomfortable with this stuff  I have to say, I don’t fully understand the discomfort    Of course, we have to put ourselves in the state of the world in which you would need to do this    It’s a bad state of the world  You want to go at it first with option 7  That is to say, you’d like to   say, “Here, we’ll lend to you against these securities”  But imagine the state of the world in   which, for whatever operational reasons, the money funds said, “I can’t be long in this stuff  I   don’t want to borrow to be long  I just can’t hold it”  So there are just huge sales of these things    I don’t quite see the cost-benefit going the wrong way here  In other words, I’m taking the   stipulation that Bill laid out before, that it’s an operational problem  We’re not buying default   risk; we’re buying operational risk in a very, very bad state of the world  In that state of the   October 16, 2013 42 of 50    world, I would basically be willing to do it  I understand it’s optically problematic, so I wouldn’t   want to be making statements ahead of time that I was planning to do that, because you’re going   to bear all of the cost and not get the benefit  But I think in the state of the world where there are   basically huge sales of the red-zone T-bills, and we can step up and stem that to some degree, I   don’t see the problem      Yes  Please do    I understand why it’s optically bad, but I don’t quite see the economic   argument  In other words, we are all sort of on board with action 1, which is that because we   happen to have an LSAP program going, we’re pretty happy to buy defaulted coupons  But   defaulted bills, because we wouldn’t normally be buying them under the LSAP?  I don’t see   where the Rubicon is being crossed here  You know, we’re taking on some of these types of   securities    So I just don’t see—I mean, maybe then action 1 is sort of a small   “loathsome?”  "
