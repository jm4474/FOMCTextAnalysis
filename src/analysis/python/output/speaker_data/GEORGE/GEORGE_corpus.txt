  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be brief, given the comments that have   preceded  We would support policy options 1 through 5, as others have noted, and agree that   6 through 10 create higher hurdles, particularly number 9  In that regard, as others have noted,   August 1, 2011 38 of 53              we should most clearly distinguish between a lender-of-last-resort issue versus a policy action in   support of fiscal issues  Thank you     Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Given that I’ve stepped into a conversation   that’s been going on for some time, I will keep my comments brief  On the balance sheet tools   that are described by the staff, I think, as others have noted, that the benefits would be small at   this stage in the deleveraging process and uncertain, but depending on the conditions under   which we think those might be most useful, exploring those further would be warranted  That   said, the asset purchases bear the largest longer-term cost and the conditions under which we   might undertake those would be those we would need to think most carefully about   I do not believe that reducing the interest on excess reserves would be especially effective   at this point  I doubt it would stimulate bank lending, and I would be interested in knowing more   about its impact on money markets, notwithstanding President Rosengren’s reaction to that   I would prefer to consider the communication alternatives, as have been outlined in these   memos  I think maintaining a clear commitment to price stability is important, although it is not   clear that markets or the public at this point doubt our commitment or even that they doubt our   inflation objectives  The comments that have been made at this point about the use of an   unemployment rate do require that we have good communications with the public and that they   understand the context in which we would be talking about unemployment  I also have questions   about providing more-explicit, quantitative information about the Committee’s reaction function,   September 20–21, 2011 71 of 290              and in that regard, I would like to discuss further Governor Tarullo’s memo and his comments   about the importance of other variables in that reaction function, including financial stability   concerns, asset bubbles, and financial imbalances  Finally, as I’ve discussed with our staff, I   think exploring more the use of the SEP projections could have potential use for us in the   broader context of our communications going forward  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Since the last FOMC meeting, economic   activity expanded modestly while inflationary pressures eased in the Tenth District  Mining and   manufacturing job gains helped push the District’s unemployment rate lower  Strong export   demand, particularly for food and chemical products, supported manufacturing activity and   boosted factory employment almost 4 percent above year-ago levels, roughly double the national   rate  More District contacts reported labor shortages for high-skilled positions, but wage   pressures were muted  Robust global demand for commodities underpinned the District’s   economic growth  The number of active drilling rigs in the District climbed in the intermeeting   period, and contacts expect additional increases in coming months with the possibility of tight   global energy supplies and higher prices  Smaller-than-expected crop production, record-high   agricultural exports, and historically low inventories for grains are driving agricultural   commodity prices and profits higher   September 20–21, 2011 152 of 290              The surge in farm incomes is rapidly being capitalized into District farmland values,   which continue to climb at an annual rate of 20 percent  In response to the run-up in prices, land   brokers tell us that the number of scheduled farm auctions has increased in recent weeks  A   typical financing arrangement for a farm purchase is 20 percent cash, 50 percent debt against the   purchased farm, and 30 percent debt pledged against other owned assets, which typically are   another farm  We continue to watch these developments, and especially the use of leverage in   these transactions, very closely   Still, District growth has not been immune to the economic weakness  Consumer   spending slowed despite solid back-to-school shopping and auto sales, and weaker demand   slowed the expansion at District factories  Contacts expected the growth in consumer spending   and factory activity to slow further over the next few months   Turning to the national outlook, the data have painted a mixed picture  The quarter   opened with promise compared with the first half of the year, as some of the temporary factors   that weighed on economic growth have dissipated  Unfortunately, the more recent releases have   been less encouraging, and financial markets are unsettled  In terms of the most likely outcome,   I expect that the economy will avoid recession and growth will gradually pick up over the next   few years  Monetary policy is highly accommodative, and the passage of time should help repair   household balance sheets and, eventually, the housing market  But I have marked down the   strength of growth over the forecast horizon, as the labor market recovery is taking longer than   previously anticipated and fiscal policy will be a larger drag  Furthermore, the downside risks to   the growth outlook are considerable and have increased  The sovereign debt situation in Europe   is very unstable, and a full-blown financial crisis would have the potential to spill over to the   United States via interconnected financial markets  Near-term solutions to problems in our   September 20–21, 2011 153 of 290              housing market remain scarce, and the recent declines in consumer sentiment are reminiscent of   2008   The inflation picture complicates our decisions  Price pressures are broad based, and   inflation recently has been above 2 percent  With a gradually rebounding economy, a   depreciating dollar, and stable inflation expectations, I do not expect that inflation will decline   much below 2 percent over the next few years  While slow growth poses a downside risk to   inflation in the short run, higher energy and commodity prices, along with an extended period of   highly accommodative monetary policy, pose upside risks to inflation over a longer horizon   In summary, I expect the recovery to continue, with economic growth gradually picking   up the pace after a weak first half while inflation remains near 2 percent  However, the risks to   the growth outlook have moved higher and seem skewed to the downside, given the events in   Europe  Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  The economy appears to have lost some   momentum in recent months, and labor market conditions certainly are weak  Furthermore, the   downside risks to the growth outlook are considerable and have increased, especially with   respect to the situation in Europe  Yet price pressures are broad-based, and inflation has been   above 2 percent recently     September 20–21, 2011 237 of 290              Regarding the policy options, my views are influenced by three factors  First, I do see   the recovery as continuing, although at a lower level over the near term  Second, inflation is   currently elevated and does not appear to be influenced solely by temporary factors  Third,   current policy remains highly accommodative  Based on these factors, adopting additional   accommodation at this time seems somewhat premature, although I do prefer that we keep the   tools discussed under alternatives A and B on the table as we go forward  Thank you     Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I appreciate the Board staff’s analysis of   these alternative policy frameworks, as others have noted  Looking at ways to strengthen our   framework and strategies for the longer term certainly is worthwhile, given the importance of our   credibility to effective monetary policy   I do support efforts that strive to make monetary policy transparent, credible, and clearly   communicated  But in reading the alternatives and how they are interpreted in the Tealbook,   transparency appears to be equated to additional stimulus when, in fact, the two strike me as   separate concepts  In my view, adopting new strategies to achieve additional stimulus in the near   term is unlikely to accelerate the broad and necessary process of deleveraging and rebalancing   now under way in the economy without risking the low and stable inflation we have worked to   achieve, sometimes at great cost, over the past 30 years   Looking ahead to the long-term application of these alternative frameworks, I also see   potential practical problems with their implementation, even though they appear to work well in   simulations  In particular, the communication challenges associated with changing our policy   framework now would be tremendous, raising the possibility of increasing rather than decreasing   uncertainty in what are already uncertain times   Let me turn briefly to my comments on the specific questions raised  While the general   concept of flexible inflation targeting seems innocuous, there are a number of definitional issues   I find that are unresolved  How would the explicit inflation objective be defined?  What inflation   rate, what horizon, what numerical value?  And specifying an inflation target also raises the   November 1–2, 2011 64 of 282              question of how the Committee would define “maximum employment”—the other component of   the dual mandate   Second, the concept of optimal policy under commitment depends on a model, which   immediately leads to questions about how different models reflect reality, and thus, produce   different optimal policies  Some have noted how different preferences can contribute as well   For instance, I differ from the authors and would argue that inflation of 2½ percent over several   years is more costly than inflation of 1½ percent, because of the risk of longer-term inflation   expectations becoming unhinged  Commitment is elusive, because we cannot bind ourselves, or   our successors, to carry through on any forward guidance we provide today  As economic   circumstances change, the temptation to deviate in the future from today’s promises will be   significant   Regarding strategies for price-level or nominal income targeting, I am concerned with   basing policy decisions on only one or two variables  The financial crisis reminded us that   policy decisions should be based on a range of data that can inform us about the state of the   economy and the outlook  While our primary objectives are inflation and employment, financial   stability is both important and consistent with our long-run mandate  A narrower focus on   inflation and employment in the medium term could lead to a costly miss of our financial   stability objective in the longer term   Finally, I would be interested in exploring the idea of augmenting the SEP to include   more information about our expected policy paths  Adding such information to the SEP has the   potential to enhance transparency and provide more flexibility, in my view, than incorporating   specific funds rate projections associated with unemployment and inflation triggers  Since the   November 1–2, 2011 65 of 282              public is beginning to be more familiar with the SEP, the communications challenges may be   easier to overcome  Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Economic activity in the Tenth District has   continued to expand moderately, and contacts generally expect similar or perhaps slightly faster   growth ahead  Manufacturing activity picked up in September and October  Inflationary   November 1–2, 2011 156 of 282              pressures have eased a bit and are expected to be moderate in coming months as the effects of   higher commodity prices recede   Recent job growth in the District as a whole has been similar to that in the nation, but the   rate of growth continues to vary widely across District states  Energy and agriculture states have   expanded rapidly, while other District states have shown little growth, if any  Many contacts   express difficulties finding skilled workers, but wage pressures remain muted   Energy drilling continues to boost economic activity in many areas of the District  Oil   production remains highly profitable, and natural gas firms continue to have easy access to cheap   capital  Continued rapid expansion of oil production in the central United States has put more   pressure on pipelines and maintained the sizable spread between US and world oil prices  This   has caused some firms to ship oil by rail or even truck to coastal refineries rather than through   pipelines to the hub in Cushing, Oklahoma   Land values in the District continue to grow rapidly, particularly in northern parts of the   region  Non-irrigated farmland values in the third quarter were up nearly 40 percent from a year   ago in Nebraska, about 20 percent in Kansas, and over 10 percent in the rest of the District  Over   the past five years, land values have increased over 100 percent in Nebraska and almost   80 percent in the District as a whole  Moreover, institutional investors are showing increasing   interest in making these land purchases   With respect to the national economy, recent data suggest that the near-term outlook has   improved and the risk of the US economy tipping back into recession has receded  Third-  quarter real GDP growth came in stronger than I expected in September, as the temporary factors   weighing on growth dissipated   November 1–2, 2011 157 of 282              Over the medium term, my views are largely unchanged from September  I expect that   the economy will maintain the momentum evident in the third quarter and will gradually move to   a growth rate that will lead to modest reductions in the unemployment rate  Factors supporting   growth include pent-up consumer and business demand, exports, and monetary policy that is   highly accommodative  Nevertheless, several factors will weigh on growth over the next few   years, including uncertainty, ongoing deleveraging, an anemic housing market, and an increasing   drag from fiscal policy  In addition, the extended period of highly accommodative monetary   policy could lead to a buildup of financial imbalances that could threaten the longer-run stability   of the economy   On a more positive note, the near-term outlook for inflation has improved  Inflation is   likely to recede over the next several quarters to 2 percent or less  With a gradually rebounding   economy, a depreciating dollar, and inflation expectations that appear to be well anchored, there   is little risk that inflation will fall much below 2 percent over the medium term  In fact, the   extended period of highly accommodative monetary policy, combined with our long-term fiscal   imbalance and the possibility of a rebound in commodity prices, poses significant upside risk to   inflation     In summary, I expect that the recovery will continue at a moderate pace, with inflation   remaining near 2 percent  While the risks to output growth have become somewhat more   balanced, the risks to inflation remain to the upside  Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  My preference is to take no further action at   this meeting  Since September, the moderate recovery has continued, and although far from   robust, GDP growth has been resilient, and the third-quarter reading came in slightly better than I   had previously expected, thanks to strong business investment   While I understand the desire to do something to address high unemployment, I don’t   think our current problems can fundamentally be solved with monetary policy alone    November 1–2, 2011 214 of 282              Deleveraging and rebalancing take time to achieve, and monetary policy has only a limited   ability to speed these processes without risking low and stable inflation, which we have worked   hard to achieve  Moreover, we normally believe it takes some time for monetary policy   decisions to affect economic activity  The Committee has taken action at each of the past two   meetings, partly in response to a deteriorating outlook and downside risk, but conditions have not   worsened, and in fact have improved a bit, since then   So I favor no further action  I would like to leave the language unchanged and to   eliminate the word “significant” from “downside”     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Tenth District economy continues to   expand at a moderate pace  Growth in manufacturing slowed in November, but is expected to   move higher over the next six months  Drilling activity is responding to higher oil prices and   farm incomes are strong  Real hourly wages in the District were below year-ago levels, and   contacts expect only limited wage pressures in the months ahead   Over the past few months, employment growth has picked up in the Tenth District with   growth strongest in states with large exposures to energy production and agriculture    Employment growth is also returning to other areas, such as Kansas and New Mexico, where   growth was minimal earlier this year  Strong farm incomes have bolstered farm investments and   farmland sales in recent months  While farmers remain the primary purchasers of farmland,   business contacts indicate that institutional investors have lowered their return expectations for   farmland from 5 percent to 4 percent, which could foster more investor purchases in the future    With farmland values soaring and loan-to-value ratios holding steady, purchasers of farmland are   taking on considerable debt   In the national economy, recent data suggest economic conditions have improved as   temporary factors weighing on growth have dissipated  The decline in inventory investment in   the third quarter suggests businesses will need to ramp up production going forward  Conditions   in the labor market have been improving over the past three months as the pace of growth in total   hours has increased, and corporate profits are near record levels as a share of GDP, which should   support investment spending   December 13, 2011 57 of 198              Over the medium term, my views are largely unchanged from November  I expect the   economy will continue to build momentum with growth gradually increasing to a pace that   should produce further reductions in the unemployment rate  Factors supporting growth include   pent-up consumer demand, business investment to expand production, and highly   accommodative monetary policy  Several factors, however, pose headwinds and downside risk   for economic activity over the next few years  The European debt crisis, reduced federal   spending, and an impaired housing market will limit growth, with further worsening of the   European crisis posing significant downside risk   Inflation has been affected by a number of temporary factors that boosted inflation in the   first half of this year and which are now pushing it lower  After these pressures unwind, I expect   inflation will be somewhat below 2 percent in the near term, before rising toward 2 percent as the   recovery strengthens  In summary, I expect the recovery to continue, with growth rebounding   from the soft patch in the first half of this year  Risks to growth remain to the downside, while   longer-term risks to inflation remain to the upside  Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I prefer Alternative B  Data since the last   meeting suggest a continuation of the moderate recovery  Consumers and businesses are   December 13, 2011 97 of 198              spending  Auto sales have bounced back from supply chain disruptions and are at their highest   level of the year  Businesses are expected to increase production to replenish inventories that   declined in the third quarter   Of course, some sectors are not performing as well as I would like  Activity in the   housing market remains at very low levels, due in part to ongoing household deleveraging  The   unemployment rate remains higher than I would like, but declining jobless claims and increasing   employment suggest that the labor market is slowly improving  Unfortunately, neither of these   problems appears to be readily amenable to monetary policy solutions without potential tradeoffs   for inflation in the future  I expect that the current softness in inflation will be short-lived and by   the end of next year, I expect readings to move closer to 2 percent   While Europe continues to pose a significant ongoing risk to the outlook, it seems   reasonable at this juncture to wait in order to allow our past monetary policy actions to take   effect and for policymakers in Europe to work toward solutions to their problems  Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I, too, want to thank the subcommittee for   this very thoughtful work  I support a set of principles that describe our longer-run goals and   policy strategy  I would like to see the statement, however, acknowledge the interactions among   financial stability, monetary policy, and our objectives, and note that the current draft makes no   reference to financial stability  Given our discussions, including today during the policy go-  round, where we make explicit references to financial markets and financial developments, it   would seem appropriate to me for any statement to include our consideration of financial   stability  I agree that this statement should be affirmed at the annual organizational meeting each   January, and while I believe it should be a living and breathing document, it seems to me the   benefits of providing the statement would diminish rapidly if we were to change it every year to   any significant extent   Regarding the enhancements to the SEP, I remain open to making greater use of these   projections to provide additional information about our thinking  However, like some others, I   have some reservations about providing policy projections to the extent that they unintentionally   hinder our communication, both within the Committee and with the public  In our public   communication, I assume FOMC participants will discuss their preferred policy path in the same   way they now discuss their outlook for growth and inflation, which makes me ask, would doing   so lead participants to become more locked into a particular policy stance prior to each meeting?    Moreover, it seems likely that the public could focus more on the policy projections and not on   how the projections changed in response to changes in conditions and forecasts, thereby reducing   the value of providing these projections in the SEP   December 13, 2011 153 of 198              Looking at communications within the Committee, likewise, I am concerned that   participants may become more locked into a particular policy stance prior to each meeting,   thereby limiting the value of our discussions and making it even harder to reach consensus on   our policy decision  Thank you     Mr Chairman?    I, too, have no concerns with 1 through 5, but I wanted to align myself   on this issue of communications; my sense is that it is important to communicate ahead, for two   reasons  One is the confidence component of that  However pithily or broadly we could   describe the fact that we have or are discussing a range of scenarios or tools, I think that could be   helpful  The second thing that I think is important, particularly as it relates to these facilities, is   giving people a sense of how we would treat collateral  Thousands of smaller institutions have   collateral pledged, and already over the past two weeks, we have heard from them regularly   asking questions about, “How should I position myself?” “What should I do?” “How will you be   treating this collateral?”  So I think those two components—to the extent that we can be more   conclusive about how we might act and still address the broader confidence issue—could be   important to communications ahead of any actual default  Thank you
