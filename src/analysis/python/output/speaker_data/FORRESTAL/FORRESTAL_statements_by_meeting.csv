16,1987-08-18," Peter, in light of the increase in Japanese interest rates, have you detected a decline in Japanese participation in either the debt or equity markets? "
17,1987-08-18," Thank you, Mr Chairman Our forecast has changed very, very little since the last FOMC meeting We still have growth in '87 turning out to be in the 2-1/2 to 3 percent range; if there is any change in the forecast, it is that we now think we may very well get closer to the 3 percent level than to the 2-1/2; so, the forecast really is for growth to be just a tad below 3 percent If we have any differences with the Greenbook, they're very minor In '88, I think we may very well get somewhat higher growth I'm also not as optimistic about the deficit picture; I just have a gut reaction that, given the election year, and so on, it may be difficult to achieve any meaningful improvement there Last month I mentioned that we had a sizable difference of opinion with the staff about personal consumption expenditures; I see that the staff has adjusted their numbers up, but I still think they're a bit on the low side; but the staff has come a little closer to our forecast, anyhow On balance, Mr Chairman, we don't have much difference with the staff forecast on growth  As far as inflation is concerned, we have the deflator rising to about 4 percent or a little more in 1988 and, I must say, this gives me some cause for concern I think that we were all hopeful that the low numbers we saw in price gains in 1986 were permanent, but I'm beginning to think they are not; and I think that we still seem to be stuck with a trend of inflation that's somewhat higher than we would like to see At earlier meetings over the past couple of months, I was worried that economic activity could fall on the short side of the forecast Now I've changed my mind in that I think perhaps the risks are on the other side, as some other speakers have indicated Revisions to the earlier data and higher activity in the first half suggest that the appreciable decline we have seen in the unemployment rate probably is not a fluke We kept thinking that there was something wrong with those numbers and that the unemployment rate would go back up But it hasn't done that And with the rate at 6 percent, I think we are awfully close to the point where some pressure on wages is likely to emerge, as the staff has indicated So, in this environment, it seems to me that the inflationary risks of economic activity turning out higher rather than lower are fairly substantial; and it wouldn't take very much, in my judgment, for expectations to build pretty significantly for higher inflation  I'd like to say a word about the District Economic activity in the Sixth District continues to be fairly good and, in fact, it's gaining momentum The weak areas in the economy, particularly Louisiana, are beginning to show improvement partially, or perhaps primarily, due to the increase in the price of oil For example, the number of active rigs in Louisiana and in the Mississippi coast area of Alabama is the highest in two years So that is fairly good news The other thing that is perhaps interesting to note is that, whereas a few months ago, people that we talk to around the District were not reporting any significant price increases, now they are indicating that the prices of their raw materials, for example, are going up And for the first time, we're hearing people say that they are, in fact, able to pass through some of these price increases to their customers That's a significant change from reports that we had had previously "
18,1987-08-18," Mr Chairman, I was going to say that, ordinarily, I would have been in favor of some slight tightening, but I also was going to say that I would be reluctant to do that in light of the dollar's strength in the foreign exchange market However, given what you have just said, perhaps my thinking will change a little I also was going to say that I thought the strength of the dollar was temporary, so I guess the markets are proving me right in advance Given my view about the economy and what I see as the    8/18/87  potential for more inflation, particularly in early 1988, I think that we probably should make the move now, recognizing that there are some uncertainties in that forecast I wouldn't want to do anything very dramatic, but I would opt for what I would describe as alternative B-plus with borrowing at about the $600 million level That implies that I am willing to accept M2 growth that is below its range for the year; and I think it is pretty doubtful that we would be able to get it up to the bottom of the range in any case, unless we did a very pronounced easing of policy I am willing to accept lower than intended growth, certainly, in preference to easing policy at this time As far as the directive is concerned, I would suggest that we tilt slightly toward firming and keep an asymmetric directive that would enable us to firm even more, if circumstances required As for the various clauses that the staff has indicated in the Bluebook, I would stress the indications of inflationary pressures and general business activity the most and downgrade the dollar Also, I would keep that sentence in the directive that would allow for greater M2 and M3 growth--that we would tolerate that if it occurred "
70,1987-09-22," Peter, is there an expectation in the market of further tightening by the Fed? "
71,1987-09-22," The only thing that kind of jumped out at me in your forecast this time, and I guess this has been there before, is on the real export side You are showing a marked deceleration of the [trade] deficit; real net exports, for example, going from [an annual rate of $131 billion in] the third quarter of 1987 to $63 billion in the fourth quarter of 1988 Most of the other forecasts that I have seen would not indicate nearly that much progress Can you tell me what that dramatic improvement is based on? Is it basically on the export side or in the diminution of imports or a combination of both, or what?   Thank you, Mr Chairman I would start with the region, by repeating what I said last month--that economic conditions in the Sixth District are really booming and seem to be strengthening The reports that we're getting from our directors and from other business people are extremely positive at this point and very optimistic And, it's fairly much across the board For example, we are seeing increasing evidence of improvement in the tradeable goods areas, certainly in textiles We are also getting improvement in apparel production Paper production and chemicals  -19-    9/22/87  also are doing a lot better, and I might say that paper and textile mills and factories are going just flat out at the moment in our area We are now hearing about labor shortages, particularly in the textile areas, and there are some bottlenecks beginning to appear For example, we have had reports of shipments of carpeting being delayed because of labor shortages But having said that, at this point at least, we have not seen yet any pressures on wages, since labor seems to be moving from the slower-growth areas into the areas that are picking up So far, the wage pressures have not followed, at least immediately, from the labor shortages Even on the commercial structures side, we are seeing excess supplies of space being absorbed more rapidly, and that is particularly true in the fast growing states of Georgia, Florida, and Tennessee Construction figures are up also We are not only getting absorption; we are getting more construction, particularly in the hospital and warehouse operations Rising mortgage rates have cut into the housing sector, particularly in the multifamily area In Louisiana--I would single that out because we've had nothing but bad news for a couple of years in that area--we are beginning now to get some good news, marginally better news The rig count is up and all of the oil and gas support services are beginning to come back on line  Turning to the general forecast, our forecast for the last half of this year has strengthened a bit in comparison to what we had a month ago Consumption seems to have picked up somewhat more than we had anticipated and we are seeing investment respond to higher plant utilization Looking ahead to 1988, we are marginally lower than we were at the time of the last meeting, and just about in line with the Greenbook forecast The only difference we have with the staff forecast is in the area of consumption which, of course, I've mentioned a couple of times before And, as I indicated earlier, we don't see quite the level of improvement in net exports that the staff is seeing But when you net that out, we are pretty close for 1988 Also, I think it is significant, as far as our forecast is concerned, that we did not build into the forecast any tightening of monetary policy, which apparently the staff did On the price side, again, we're pretty close to the Greenbook forecast So, when I put all this together, Mr Chairman, it seems to me that the forecast is reasonable and even a little optimistic And I would agree with those who would put the risk on the upside rather than the downside  Now with respect to your question, I think there are probably ingredients of both At least from where I sit, there is some inflationary expectation in these higher rates, but to a large extent, I think they are real But having said that, it seems to me from the few market participants that I've talked to, that there may be an element of irrationality in the way the market is reacting The reactions to even minor declines in the value of the dollar are producing higher rates than might have been called for I don't know how to assess this, really; I'm just talking to a few people in the market who are sitting in Atlanta and who have made this comment They are saying, and I think there may be some validity to it, that there may be some over-reaction, although some other factors are involved Now, if that's true, I think the policy implication is upon us, because they are going to be reacting perhaps adversely to the trade numbers for August, which probably will not be very good We have just done some work which would indicate that the seasonal factors that are present in July are probably present in August as    9/22/87  well So, we may get some equally bad trade numbers And, as the Gramm-Rudman fiscal policy debate goes on in the Congress and we don't get anything out of that, I think there's going to be a reaction in the bond market as well It seems to me that the market is looking for every snippet of bad news that it can find and reacting to that, rather than trying to find something positive in the scenario "
72,1987-09-22," Mr Chairman, my preference is to maintain the current stance of monetary policy and I interpret your formulation as being somewhat of a tightening, albeit fairly slight The reason I would like to maintain a current stance at the moment is, first of all, as you've indicated, we don't really see any evidence of inflation in the numbers But, more importantly, as I think I said earlier, over the next several weeks we are going to get some numbers that might produce more volatility in the market We have this linkage, apparently, between the foreign exchange market and the bond  -36-    9/22/87  market; if we get a bad trade number again, we probably are going to see a fall in the dollar, and that will be translated into higher bond yields And that suggests to me that, at that point, we may need to tighten a little; and I would prefer to wait until that time to do anything So, my difference with you is fairly slight, I think; my formulation would be for borrowing at between $500 and $600 million, with the center of gravity probably in between there, and an asymmetric directive to take account of what I think is going to happen and our need to tighten   Yes, a tilt upward It's a ""B+"" with an asymmetric directive That's called fine tuning "
127,1987-11-03," Mr Chairman Is there, if you can tell us, any plan to reconvene the G-5 or G-7? Things have changed markedly, obviously, since the Louvre agreement I must say that the reason I ask that question is that I find it a little anomalous that we are draining reserves to defend the dollar while, at the same time, we are    11/3/87  adding reserves to add liquidity to the domestic economy Maybe it's considered to be a disorderly market at this point, or potentially disorderly, but it seems a little anomalous to me to have this divided policy in a sense   Do you think that they will be thinking about another Louvre-type meeting?   Well, I was thinking of both "
128,1987-11-03," Well, Mr Chairman, the statistical information on the evaluation of the economy in the Sixth District that we had prior to October 19th reflected continued improvement in the District Economic activity seemed to be very good pretty much across the board I would echo what Ed Boehne just said about exports they seem to be increasing, and we also are getting reports about better export performance It's very difficult at this time, I think, to assess any impact in the region of the events of a couple of weeks ago Everyone I talk to says it is business as usual, although I find that a little hard to believe because I am sure that many businesses are re-assessing their plans for the future But, at the moment, nobody has indicated to me that they have made any change in their business plans I think what they are really saying is that they feel that it is too early and they are adopting a ""wait and see"" attitude The only preliminary indication that we have that people might expect less robust activity is that many firms--the majority of those that I talked to--are, in fact, repurchasing their own stock And, of course, the Christmas sales are going to be very critical One concern I have is that I have been hearing scattered reports that deposits have been moving out of thrift institutions into the banks, reflecting greater public confidence in the FDIC than in the FSLIC and the thrifts That's not a widespread movement, but it is something that I have noted The regional banks see very little impact from the weak equity markets, given their loan portfolios and the relative strength of regional growth That was reflected in their stock declines, which were much less than for money center banks  -18-    11/3/87  Like others, I think it is very, very difficult to come up with a precise forecast on the national economy, although I think we have to make an attempt to do that in order to set policy We have moved our forecast down somewhat, although I think we would show a little greater strength than the Greenbook But it's not a matter of great difference We would move our forecast down further if we continued to see increased volatility in the markets I might just note, in passing, that we are developing an alternative forecast which is a less comprehensive one than others; I don't want to place a great deal of emphasis on it at the moment, because it only has one quarter of experience But that one quarter was very good--better than most of the comparable forecasts That model shows much less growth in the fourth quarter and through 1988 than most of the others that I've seen So we will continue to develop that model and watch it carefully But, in general, I think the Greenbook forecast is about on target "
129,1987-11-03," Well, Mr Chairman, I agree entirely with your analysis of the situation, given the uncertainty and the potential for additional instability in the market I think that alternative ""B"" is the correct alternative for policy in the short term I would target the federal funds rate at 6-3/4 percent; I wouldn't worry about borrowing In order to get the message across to the markets as to what we are doing at this very critical time, I would favor Variant I One point I would make is that the foreign exchange market developments seem to me to be more significant than indications of inflationary pressures, so I would be inclined to move that up in the hierarchy of expressions there And I think it is important to keep the language related to frequent consultations We need to let the market know that we are aggressively and actively involved in this whole situation I would prefer a tilt in the directive towards easing, which would lead me to favor asymmetrical directive language "
181,1988-03-29," Mr Chairman, when I heard Bob Heller's remarks, I too was going to say if it ain't broke don't fix it, but somebody already said that Let me start with a procedural matter First of all, I thought the memos, particularly the Meulendyke paper, were extremely useful I wasn't around here in the 1970s and I found that historical perspective very interesting I would like to suggest that somebody think about publishing that somewhere for the market to look at Having said that, let me say something nasty now, and that is, that while I enjoyed reading the memo, I didn't have much time to read it because it only reached me yesterday morning I raise that issue in the context of this discussion only because if we're going to have more frequent consultations, which hasn't been discussed, those consultations frequently will have accompanying memoranda; and if we don't get them in time to really reflect on them, they don't do us much good  But turning to the substance of the issue, it seems to me as I went through all of this, that I agree with Governor Johnson that there really is very little policy difference between targeting borrowing and targeting a funds rate I think we really are targeting the federal funds rate, but in a more general way And I'm persuaded that we should not make a change for three basic reasons, which I think have been touched on by other speakers First of all, it does seem to me that we get very useful information from the market, because of the deviation in the funds rate in relation to borrowing Many times those are market induced, and I think policymakers can learn something from what the market is telling us Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, it seems to me that by using a borrowing target as a proxy for the funds rate--or, if you like, for policy-- we're able to probe a little better than we can with a funds rate target That is to say, the uncertainty generated sometimes by the borrowing and the differential on the funds rate would enable us to reverse policy if we found that that was desirable With the funds rate targeting, we don't have that kind of flexibility So, I think we get some flexibility by using a borrowing target  The political argument has been talked about and I think we ought not to underestimate that, because if we get into a period when we have to tighten policy, it's a very difficult thing to do politically Some times it's more difficult than others I don't think that our posture in the past has been to be publicly identified with targeting interest rates--certainly not in recent years I don't think it's a good idea for us as an institution to have that on our backs As people look through the realities, obviously they'll see we really are targeting the funds rate; but I think we get some advantage by staying away from the targeting of the funds rate itself I think you have to be in the market on a regular basis too, Manley; I don't  -24-    3/29/88  think you can do it on a haphazard basis I think you have to be in the market a couple of times a day to really fine tune it   If you were targeting the funds rate   But in the--   Well, that's the other point I wanted to make If you find that you are getting major deviations, then I think you can correct that But I don't think we ought to be doing funds targeting on a regular basis Now, there are two other things that were said that I think need to be addressed It doesn't seem to me that we are in any sense misleading the markets by this policy; I don't think it's a deliberate obfuscation I think the markets understand, and we understand certainly, that monetary policy is not an exact science And I don't think that using a borrowing target is designed to mislead anybody Also, I don't think that these deviations--to use the analogy that somebody else did--are causing us to have the airplane on a crash course into the ground I don't think we're anywhere near that Nobody has mentioned the intermeeting consultation and discretion, so let me just raise that if it is an issue, Mr Chairman   You mentioned it; excuse me, I must have been asleep at that time I think it's very important for the Manager, in consultation with the Chairman, to have discretion And I, for one, would not like to limit that discretion with any kind of numerical bounds One thing I think we could do at regular meetings of the FOMC is to give some sense to the Chairman as to how we feel about deviations from policy or a reversal of policy But I think that can be done in a general way, without saying if you want to change it $100 million come to the Committee; I would leave that to the Chairman But we could have some general discussion as to when we think, in general terms, a consultation is necessary And finally, I don't think we need any more meetings of the FOMC  SPEAKER(?) Ever?   I don't think the information to be gained, on say, a monthly basis, is sufficient to have us come together to review the situation So I would like to keep our present meeting schedule, gentlemen  -25-    3/29/88   What I'm saying, basically, is just keep what we're doing because, as Bob Heller suggests, maybe we've been lucky And maybe it won't turn out to be quite as good as it has in the recent past, but I think that's something we just have to accept I'd be willing to accept those deviations "
182,1988-03-29," Mike, I heard what you said about inventories, but I guess I am a little confused about the numbers that  -37-    3/29/88  are in the Greenbook as compared to the text The numbers in the Greenbook looked fairly high to me, whereas the text seemed to indicate a slowdown, which I agree with, in inventory buildup Unless I am misinterpreting the numbers, I would have thought there would have been a greater effect on the economy from that level of inventory buildup   The better-than-average growth that we have seen around the country is also reflected in the Sixth District We have seen a remarkable resurgence in manufacturing over the past several months, but with some slowdown in retail trade, services, and housing, which I guess is pretty much the same around the country I was interested, Mr Chairman, in your comments about capacity  -43-    3/29/88  utilization because, while the evidence that I have heard from people around my District confirms a lot of what you said, there are some industries, as you indicated, that are reporting difficulties in filling orders In the paper, paperboard, and steel industries, the time frame I hear is 5-6 weeks; but interestingly, in the paper and apparel industries, I'm hearing reports that some of this ordering may be precautionary because of concerns about capacity utilization Maybe that is equivalent to the double ordering that Si Keehn talked about I think a lot of people still have some skepticism about the value of the dollar remaining where it is and the sustainability of the tradable goods sector But even with that skepticism, I think the very high capacity utilization in some industries is now causing people to take another look at the business investment situation In fact, some are doing more business fixed investment than I had been aware of before Associated with that, I guess, business loans around the District are up, on average The thing that I hear talked about more than anything else these days is price pressures There is some concern about inflation in the labor market in the District and just a general fear of inflation, which isn't really reflected in the numbers that people give you But there is this general sense that they are concerned about it Overall, in the District, our growth has been somewhat stronger than the nation and we think that it's going to retain that edge in 1988  Now with respect to the national economy, our outlook for real GNP is about the same as the Greenbook; ours is just a little lower--25 percent as opposed to your 27 percent But the composition is really quite different We show substantially less inventory accumulation, with the offset in higher personal consumption expenditures, particularly after the 1st quarter, and also more business fixed investment Our outlook for inflation is generally the same as the Board staff's I remain concerned not only about import prices, but also about pressures building in the labor market, which I've heard about in the District We haven't seen any dramatic breakout in labor costs but I think the potential is there The last time we met I guess I felt that the risks to the economy were fairly evenly balanced, but I was more concerned about the downside than the upside I've changed my mind now and I think that we face the possibility of too much growth rather than too little at this time, especially given the small amount of slack in major industries "
226,1988-05-17," Well, Mr Chairman, everything we've talked about this morning--the forecast, the employment and unemployment numbers, and the potential wage and price pressures--clearly and pretty uniformly indicates, I think, that the risk is on the upside and that we are worried about inflation But, I don't interpret the last two actions we took recently as being unsubstantial So, my preference would be to wait before we take any further action and let those two actions work their way through the economy After all, the latest action was just a little while ago Now, if we hadn't taken those actions, I'd be of a different mind But, at the moment, my strong preference is to wait--perhaps not very long--maybe three or four weeks, or something like that So, I would like to stay where we are with $400 million in borrowing, but with an asymmetrical directive I would be prepared to support an alternative which would move it up $100 million, to $500 million, with a symmetrical directive But I would have a real problem with moving all the way to alternative C at this point   Well, wouldn't we be better off to test it just for a while, before locking ourselves into a statutory requirement or market expectation? I think that makes a lot of sense "
257,1988-08-16," Well, Mr Chairman, I'm going to tell a little different story today than I usually do In fact, since I've been sitting on this Committee I have not had an opportunity to report lower economic activity in the Sixth District at any time But I'm going to make that kind of a report today because activity in the Sixth District, with the exception of Florida, is slower than in the nation I think this is partly a reflection of strength elsewhere Of course, Louisiana and Mississippi have been in the doldrums for some time, but now Georgia is beginning to experience slower growth than the rest of the country, basically because of less immigration than in the past  Having said that, several of the region's manufacturing industries are quite strong Paper and pulp products, for example, ship building, and petrochemical plants are starting modernization and expansion projects, basically in reponse to pressure on capacity They also report higher prices for materials  I've talked to a lot of business people and really pressed very hard since the last meeting on the wage question And I don't  -15-    8/16/88  think I'm really much more ahead than I was the last time in the sense that, while there is this anticipation of higher wages and a fear that it's going to happen, I'm not hearing that it actually has taken place Some of the people that I've talked to are in fact labor union people, and in the organized labor sector I don't get any report, at least in our area, of any pressure for wage increases of any kind They report to me that job security is basically the major concern of workers at the present time  However, I would also report what Si Keehn mentioned that there does seem to be a shortage of labor, particularly in the service area And a number of firms that I've talked to are having difficulty getting entry level people even though they're paying above the minimum wage Of course, in Louisiana the unemployment rate is the highest in the nation and so the expansion that we have in some industries like chemicals is taking place in a very soft market for labor In addition to this, we've had substantial layoffs and will continue to have substantial layoffs at Lockheed, where the work force is estimated to fall from 20,000 to 12,000 over the next 12 months--a very, very substantial layoff And that's occurring right now We are also getting cutbacks in the automobile plants, and TVA is cutting back in Alabama as well as in Tennessee and that's supplying labor to the region We also have a fraction of Eastern Airlines cutting--, a relatively small impact, but a negative one nonetheless  Nonresidential construction in our region is stronger than the rest of the nation; it's up about 4 percent, which perhaps is a little surprising I am a little concerned about the projects that are on the drawing boards, particularly in the city of Atlanta I'm concerned that the volume of new office space is not going to be absorbed very soon  We have fortunately had some rainfall It has been very spotty, but I think it has provided enough moisture to salvage the soybean crop, at least for the time being So we are doing a little better there  Looking at the national economy, we have no basic differences with the Greenbook forecast There's a slight difference perhaps in unemployment, which we don't expect to rise quite as much, and our inflation forecast would be marginally higher I think, however we look at it, we are looking at a very strong economy And I don't see that that is going to abate any time soon, and that obviously has implications for policy "
258,1988-08-16," Don, in connection with this issue of the deviation of the fed funds rate from the borrowing target, seasonal borrowing has been relatively high How much of the deviation do you think is caused by that? And doesn't this high seasonal component suggest that we perhaps need a higher borrowing target than we otherwise would?   Mr Chairman, it seems to me that every- thing that we've heard around the table this morning plus the incoming data suggest that if the economy continues to be very strong we are going to have to take another move fairly soon But I don't think now is the time to do it One of the concerns I would have about moving right now is not only the shock to the domestic market, but also the destabilizing effect that it might have abroad--in the sense that you might get a ratcheting of rates around the world if we were to move very quickly after the action we've just taken So I come out that we should stay where we are with the $600 million of borrowing But I feel very strongly that the language should be asymmetric With respect to the ordering of the directive, I don't really see any compelling case to change the order I don't think the relationship between the economy and the monetary aggregates has been established, and I think the order does suggest the way in which we look at things    8/16/88  for purposes of making policy While I don't feel very strongly about it, I would rather keep it the way it is   That's my problem   You want another vote? "
307,1988-09-20," Thank you, Mr Chairman I'm sorry I don't have a real estate study to talk about this morning Let me turn first to the national economy I have very little problem with the Board staff's Greenbook forecast; in fact, if we were to build in roughly the same kind of restraint that's in the Greenbook we'd be very close indeed I think all forecasts these days are a little bit  -11-    9/20/88  cloudier than usual because of the statistical difficulties with the drought, so I think we need to be a little careful about forecasts generally  I'm very happy to see the recent deceleration, although I wouldn't want to put a lot of credence in a couple of months' data But I think the thing the markets perhaps are not focusing on is that we are still growing beyond our potential And that is really what's guiding my thinking and my judgment at the present time In response to Governor Johnson, there was a discussion about the yield on the 30-year bond and long-term rates generally, and it seems to me that the market may very well be underestimating the strength of the economy and thus reducing its inflationary expectations I think there is generally a tendency among market participants and business people that I talk with to feel that a slowing economy is a slow economy I think we've gotten used to large numbers over the past several quarters and the focus is not really on the potential of the economy So, I not only agree with the forecast, Mr Chairman, but I agree with the analysis of the staff that unless the economy slows appreciably, we will have to restrain growth further--take additional [steps of] monetary restraint--by the end of the year  I don't think I need say very much about the District because not a great deal has changed since the last meeting Growth in the Sixth District remains fairly spotty The manufacturing tradeable goods sector is doing quite well, but the service sector--particularly in urban areas--is not doing well and is really quite sluggish Construction is off We used to report pretty regularly, as I said last month, that almost every state with the exception of Louisiana was doing better than the national average That has really turned around I think Florida now would be the only state that I would characterize as doing better than the national average The unemployment rate in all of our states except Florida is now above those in the rest of the country The good news part of that, I suppose, is that there's very little pressure on wages in this kind of a market I probed a lot for that among our directors and other business people; and while you hear a little bit of concern about entry-level people and trying to attract them with higher wages, basically we're not seeing any wage pressure at all The same thing is true generally of prices The price increases, where they have occurred, have been kind of spotty and in industries that are really going flat out--paperboard, paper, and so on  The good news in all of this is that Louisiana and Mississippi are doing better than they were That's basically because of some chemical production that is now occurring in Louisiana as well as the pickup in ship building Although they are doing better, we have to remember that they're coming from a very low base and they would still have to be characterized, I think, as negative growth areas On the agricultural side, higher prices for some agricultural commodities are going to improve farm incomes since the crop yields were not as affected in the southeast as they were in other areas of the country That's all I have, Mr Chairman "
308,1988-09-20," Mr Chairman, as I had tried to suggest in my earlier comments, I think the risks continue to be on the upside in the economy I think we should not be lulled by this softening at the fringe, as you put it So I would very strongly support your recommendation, particularly with respect to the asymmetric language I think that we do have a period in which we can pause and take stock of what's been happening And particularly with respect to the dollar, I think if we were to initiate additional tightening moves at this time we might get another increase in the dollar, with the danger of a ratcheting upward of rates around the world that would not be appropriate at this time So I would strongly support your recommendation "
363,1988-11-01," Mr Chairman, Ed Boehne has expressed my views very, very well I would put it perhaps just a little differently It seems to me that the actions on the Humphrey-Hawkins targets are basically actions of the Committee itself, and the change in rotation shouldn't affect the ability of the Committee to carry out the targets I think that the voting members who come on after March 1st are in a sense obliged, really, to accept and to enforce if you will the targets that have been established by the Committee But, like Ed, I don't think that this is a very big issue Were it the will of the Committee, I certainly wouldn't object I say that as one who would be affected by the change in the sense that my term would end ordinarily on March 1st As I understand it, if we adopt this change, my term would end earlier, but it's not all that significant as far as I'm concerned On the legal issue, our counsel also looked at it and agreed with the views expressed by Mr Bradfield   Well, I certainly would not object, Mr Chairman I just wanted to make the point, as Ed did, that this is a continuing body We need to stress the collegial atmosphere of this group and the fact that actions taken are actions taken by the Committee But I have no objection and I would certainly join--    11/1/88   I would agree to that   Sure   Mr Chairman, I hope President Morris isn't suggesting that we buy Mexico  SPEAKER(?) We've bought it!   Ted, in the memorandum there's a discussion of capital movements Has there been any change in that situation? Has there been more capital flight in the last few days?   The other thing about Mexico, as I suppose everybody is aware, is that there has been a series of advertisements placed in major newspapers by a committee, I forget what they call themselves, which in effect forecasts civil disobedience, civil disorder in Mexico following, or at the time of, the inauguration of the new president on December 1st I don't know how widespread those have been circulated, but I've had a lot of questions from people including my directors about that situation and its effect on the bridge loan and the repayment of the bridge loan and the World Bank loan I don't know, Ted, whether this is giving pause for any concern in Mexico or not   It's essentially a pretty destabilizing kind of-- "
364,1988-11-01," Thank you, Mr Chairman With respect to the District not very much has changed since the last meeting and so I won't spend very much time on that I will observe that the Sixth  -33-    11/1/88  District economic activity continues somewhat sluggish on average, and this reflects in part at least the softening seen in the national economy Weaknesses are basically in apparel, which has weakened somewhat since out last meeting That's also having an effect on textile output as you would expect Retail sales are fairly sluggish throughout the District with some exceptions in some of the larger metropolitan areas But the retailers are expecting some pickup and their strategy seems to be to have pretty heavy discounts and promotions at the holiday season Housing is also soft All of these weaknesses are leading to some uptick in the unemployment rate generally around the District We're getting fairly good strength in automobile sales where inventories have been very low I spoke to a Chevrolet dealer yesterday, and he said that as of the middle of September he had no 1988 cars at all, absolutely none And he's looking for a good 1989 The service sector continues to be strong in the Sixth District, and agriculture in spite of the drought has picked up and the prospects for farm income have improved considerably because we've had some late rain which has brought yields on several crops to above average levels And these prices, of course, are helping farmers  Two other things that I would mention In going around the District and talking to business people, bankers, and our directors, we see very little evidence of price increases There are some price increases coming for raw materials, but apparently many industries are not able--at this point at least in our District--to pass these through We keep asking about wage pressures and, in spite of some labor shortages, we don't see very much in the way of evidence of increased wages either in the services sector or in organized industries  On the national economy, our forecast is a bit stronger than the one shown in the Greenbook I think this is partly because we have not assumed that further restraint is put in place in 1989, as the Greenbook obviously has As a result of that, we also see higher inflation, and I would tend to agree with Frank Morris that the [Greenbook] inflation forecast is probably the best that one could come up with On the real economy side, we think consumer expenditures are going to be somewhat stronger We also think that the improvement in net exports is going to be somewhat smaller than the Board staff is forecasting Now, I think that Mike Prell put his finger on something that has been very apparent to me over the past several months and that is there seems to be a psychological mindset on the part of many people that 5 percent inflation is an acceptable level for prices I think associated with that is the feeling that is perhaps growing that the Federal Reserve in fact is satisfied and content with that level of inflation Now, I have a concern certainly about that, but I have a further concern that this LBO activity that we've seen recently--and all of us I suppose are concerned about this greater leverage throughout the economy--I hope is not being driven by assumptions that inflation will ease this debt burden in the future  There have been people saying to me that they think the Federal Reserve is going to have a very inflexible kind of policy because we can't afford to allow a recession to appear in the economy We've had the thrift industry problem; we've had the LDC problem; the deficit problem; and now we overlay this LBO situation And I think there is a feeling in the market that maybe the Fed's hands are tied  -34-    11/1/88  and we have to maintain an inflation rate to keep [the economy] from moving into a recession I hope that that's not true and I hope that somehow we can get the message across that we are not content to allow inflation to remain at its present level We'll get into the monetary prescription in just a moment I'm not arguing for a tightening of policy now, but I think in some ways we need to construct, however we can, the mechanism to get the word out that we are not going to be in the business of perpetuating inflation for the LBOs or other reasons "
365,1988-11-01," Mr Chairman, I think we're going to have to make a move fairly soon, but I don't think this is the time to do it I think the risk is still on the upside So, I would agree with your prescription And I think it's very, very important that we maintain the asymmetric directive "
424,1989-03-28," On the general subject of intervention, Sam, do you detect any change in philosophy of the present Administration with respect to intervention? Or are they continuing pretty much in the same vein as the previous Administration? "
425,1989-03-28," Mike, I was curious about the real disposable income number that you have in the Greenbook The second quarter shows considerable weakness I know the nominal personal income number doesn't change very much Is there a special factor there?   The real personal disposable income in the second quarter of '89 would be quite weak   Mr Chairman, looking first at the District, I'm glad Boeing is borrowing some of the Lockheed workers; that will be helpful There are several thousand Eastern [Airlines] people who are available as well We haven't seen very much of a change in the Sixth District since the last meeting of the Committee We are continuing to see moderately good growth, although it's somewhat  -23-    3/28/89  slower paced than the national average Capital spending plans are quite robust in those industries where capacity pressures are evident and that is certainly the case for industries like paper, chemicals, rubber, and all aspects of the transportation sector Textile manufacturers are also moving ahead with plans to increase purchases of equipment although in that case it's mostly to modernize their older facilities We do continue to have reports of shortages of skilled labor and upward [wage] pressures for skilled workers The markets are not quite as tight for unskilled people but even there we hear sporadic reports of difficulty, particularly in fast-food places and in supermarkets There is considerable concern among people I talk to about the rising cost of benefits, particularly health benefits, and the impact on total labor costs In addition to that there's a fear or concern about enactment of a higher minimum wage which would push up wages for higher paid labor as well, given the relative tightness of the labor market As for prices, on the basis of sporadic reports, the information we're getting is mixed Increases are mixed for industrial inputs, with a greater upward bias than seen a year ago And it's rather interesting to me that, in connection with prices as well as some other areas, people talk about a lower level of prices over the last month or so but when they compare their prices to a year ago they are still considerably higher  With regard to the national economy, we don't have very significant differences with the Greenbook forecast We would have a slightly higher inflation number and a lower unemployment number but those are minor differences; basically we're in agreement Judging from the Sixth District and from what I see around the nation there is some near-term deceleration in economic expansion, especially if you take into account the fact that we're at full employment and a lot of industries are going full blast and at high capacity There are two things that continue to disturb me One is that any slowing that's evident seems to be taken as a sign of real weakness in the economy I think we've gotten so used to high numbers over the past several years that when the numbers come off even a little people get panicky On the inflation side the same thing is true As I've said before, among a lot of people that I've talked to there is kind of an acceptance of inflation at the 5 percent level or even a bit higher I think that was confirmed when the CPI number the other day came in at 4 percent--which I'm not all that sanguine about--they were relieved that it wasn't at the higher end of the expected range So in general, I think we have an expectational problem in the economy and in the markets that we really have got to move against Now, I hope that the economy really is slowing But as someone said earlier we've been burned on this before Over the summer I remember a couple of times when we thought there was a slowing and it turned out not to be So, I'm skeptical that we are really seeing a sufficient slowing to stem the inflationary pressures that are there And that obviously leads me to a certain conclusion about monetary policy that I'll reserve for the later discussion "
426,1989-03-28," Well, Mr Chairman, I think that a somewhat firmer policy at the moment would be appropriate My judgment is that we are, in fact, experiencing a pause and not a sustained downturn in the economy But even if it is not a pause, even if we are seeing some real slowing, I think the risks of recession with a firmer policy are minimal The Greenbook forecast, with which I agree, is predicated upon some tightening beginning in the second quarter--some tightening from where we are at the moment--and that does not produce a recession in 1990 Moreover, it does not produce any great improvement in the inflation rate So, not only do I think that we don't need to back off, I think we need to continue our pressure on reserves in order to stay ahead of this inflation curve We ought to go ahead and do the job now and make a tightening move I wouldn't do it to any great degree but I think a funds rate around 10 percent, or whatever the equivalent borrowing is, would be appropriate My preference would be to move now by some small degree "
489,1989-05-16, Are the balances basically in yen or are they distributed more evenly?   Marks 
490,1989-05-16," Mr Chairman, the Sixth District seems to be running counter to the rest of the country at the end of last year we had a slowdown; but now, when the rest of the country is slowing, we seem to have relatively strong economic activity, although obviously it varies from sector to sector Industrial construction remains pretty healthy and that's being bolstered by declining vacancy rates and some relocations from the northeast part of the country Some of our key industries like steel and textiles are showing really quite robust health Even the apparel industry, especially women's clothing, has begun to pick up The tourism and business travel industries also are doing very well despite the impact of the Eastern Airlines strike in certain areas, particularly south Florida and Atlanta The transportation sector also is showing increased shipping activity, and activity at our District ports is quite healthy I was interested to learn that our contacts in south Florida are reporting substantially increased trade with Latin America, both on the import and on the export side Louisiana is the weak spot--our part of Louisiana anyway, Bob Oil drilling continues to lag; the number of rigs is down and is still trending lower Our contacts down there report substantial uncertainty about OPEC plans after June; also, we find that there is a shortage of drilling pipe due to strong replacement and export demands So that is having an adverse effect as well On the other other hand, we are getting some good news from Mobile Bay where there has been an expansion of natural gas production That's working to offset the weaknesses in the other energy sectors in the District The Mobile gas find, in fact, is the largest in the United States since the discovery of the Prudo Bay fields in Alaska Agriculture in our area is also reporting a pretty bright outlook We've had normal rainfall this year I don't know what the projections are for the future but I think we're looking for relatively good agricultural conditions The market for farm equipment is also very strong Retail sales are about the same as in the rest of the country Automobile sales are especially poor and I might say that for the first time in a long time I am getting telephone calls from people about the economy--unsolicited complaints about the level of automobile activity They are really crying about terribly distressed conditions, which doesn't seem to follow from the incentive pickup that we've had So, in general in the District, things are looking pretty good There isn't a great deal of evidence of a substantial slowdown; in fact, it's fairly robust Having said that, the people that we talk to, including our directors, are concerned that the evidence of deceleration in the rest of the economy might turn into an outright recession Also, they are not seeing much relief on the price side and they feel that they're not going to see any relief on the price side in the near future  With respect to the national economy, I was somewhat skeptical about the degree of the slowdown in the economy, but my skepticism has been converted to some degree by the latest data However, our forecast in Atlanta is somewhat stronger than the Greenbook forecast Even taking into account the assumptions about policy, we think we're going to have stronger investment and stronger net export growth in 1989 than is shown in the Greenbook More  -22-    5/16/89  importantly, as we look out to 1990, we see the expansion continuing at a pace only a bit slower than the present one Our unemployment rate is lower throughout, although that's probably due to labor force growth, which will slow Now, I realize that our forecast is an outlier, if you look at not only the Greenbook but the Blue Chip forecast and others But to me what is suggested by this forecast is that the inflationary momentum is still rooted in the economy and it's rooted rather deeply So I'm still inclined to think, notwithstanding the recent data, that the risk of recession is relatively low and that the risk of inflation is still relatively high Just one other anecdotal piece of information one of our contacts recently discovered that his managers are stockpiling linerboard in inventory in anticipation of price increases So, I think that this price fear is still there and that the inflationary danger is still there And I think that is really what should guide policy over the near term "
491,1989-05-16," Mr Chairman, I seem to be the only one around the table who is forecasting a stronger economy over the forecast horizon But I think that things are sufficiently uncertain at the moment that we ought to stay where we are For that reason I would opt for alternative B, which I too interpret as no change But I do feel fairly strongly that we would be sending the wrong signal to the market if we went with a symmetric directive If the economy is in fact at the point where we have been working to get it, then we ought not to move from our position prematurely And I think a symmetric directive would send that kind of signal to the markets So, I would much prefer to keep these--   Right I understand, but still I think it might have that effect We need to underline our commitment even in the future to price stability and I think that's what the asymmetric directive has done and will do even six weeks from now   Well, I guess what I'm basically concerned about is that we not move from the position of restraint that we have had If we have had some success I think we ought not to back off from that on the basis of some data that really have not been confirmed The data are fairly recent "
547,1989-08-22," Sam, are we under any particular pressure from the Japanese or the Germans to do anything in terms of monetary policy to relieve pressure on the dollar?   Well, it's just a general question I wondered if they were agitating and--   Thank you   Like Washington "
548,1989-08-22," Thank you, Mr Chairman The signs of deceleration in the Sixth District that I've been reporting recently are now very clearly visible in the economy Growth seems to be a bit weaker in the District than in the nation as a whole, and this comes after several years of much stronger than national growth and even stronger than sustainable growth However, many business people, including directors that I've spoken to in recent weeks, report that this deceleration is in line with their expectations; and most report that they don't anticipate further softening Interestingly, a number of these people--those on the manufacturing and commercial side--also report that they basically are not changing their business plans, particularly their capital investment plans We may have a little exception in the banking community where their view is tempered by the fact that their loan demand has been very soft over the summer, as contrasted with the rest of the country The weakness that we are seeing in the District pretty much mirrors what is going on in the rest of the country, and that is that the weakness is in retail sales, automobile sales, and home and office construction Retailers are reporting poor demand for durables such as appliances and electronics; and the demand for furniture, as you might expect, has moderated significantly because of the slowdown in housing activities Automobile inventories remain far higher than desired across the District Auto sales in the Southeast have been far stronger than in the nation for several years So the slow pace this year--in fact the almost depressed state of that industry--seems to have taken the dealers by surprise On the production side in autos, GM and Ford have announced that they will idle or reduce production at additional assembly lines in several weeks ahead The weakness in housing construction and autos has spilled over into the transportation industry where freight volume is down significantly, especially for trucking, and further declines are anticipated  But even in this weaker climate we do have some sources of strength, and that I suppose gives rise to this optimism on the part of people that the deceleration won't go any further Industrial construction remains quite robust and plant expansions are occurring in the chemical and plastics industry where world demand remains quite strong Firms that manufacture the equipment used to automate production also report strong orders However, the outlook for farm income is not very good at all in the District Heavy rains have affected most crops, with the exception of citrus And aside from cotton, prices for many crops grown in the region have softened so that farmers in the Southeast are finding themselves marketing reduced output at lower prices In the energy sector, activity in the oil industry remains at a low level although natural gas exploration is continuing very robust, particularly in the Mobile, Alabama area Once again, we've paid a lot of attention with our contacts to the wage and price and labor situation And with very few exceptions they are reporting very moderate wage increases The demand for labor is not particularly [strong] except at entry levels in some businesses like the fast food market And prices seem to be moderating at every  -25-    8/22/89  level So, it's a mixed situation in the District, as I indicated; there is softening but apparently, according to the contacts, we are at the bottom  Our outlook for the national economy is very close to the one shown in the Greenbook for the rest of the year and also into 1990 However, we show more improvement--although it's slight--in the trade deficit, in part because the dollar in recent months has not been as strong against the currencies of the NICs and Canada as it has been against the European and Japanese currencies We also have raised our estimates of the unemployment rate a bit higher, although they are a little lower than in the Greenbook Our forecast for inflation is somewhat higher than the Greenbook's as well Thank you "
549,1989-08-22," Mr Chairman, I agree entirely with your prescription And I, too, would favor symmetrical language I would like to make two brief comments There has been a lot of discussion by people around the table this morning about the vulnerabilities in the economy, and I certainly am concerned about those vulnerabilities But as you pointed out very well, monetary policy certainly can't do everything I think the way to avoid a recession is to have a period of subdued growth over time In that way I think we will avoid a recession over the long run If we were to stimulate the economy at this time, I'm afraid we would not only be sending the wrong signal to the marketplace but we would be having to take action later on against inflation that would be at a much higher level So, I think we have to be very careful about what kind of message we send to the markets At this point the credibility of the central bank is even more important than it ordinarily is So, I strongly recommend the status quo, which is alternative B with symmetric language "
610,1989-10-03," Peter, do you think that bias is based on domestic considerations or foreign exchange issues?   That's the question I was going to raise--no way   That's what we have done in the past "
611,1989-10-03," I'll start it, Mr Chairman Let me say at the outset that I'm very pleased that the staff has extended the forecast through 1991; I think that does give a longer-term and more strategic focus on policy With respect to the national economy, Mr Chairman, we think that the Greenbook is about right for the next few quarters in terms of real GNP We don't have any basic disagreements there Also, our outlook for inflation is a little closer now to the Board staff's than it was at the last meeting We've seen some improvements Having said that, I think that we've been helped, obviously, by some special factors along the way, and I'm not sure that those are going to continue indefinitely But more importantly-- and perhaps where we might have some slight disagreement with the staff--is that we think the unemployment number may be a little lower than the Board staff's number; and that suggests to me that pressure on wages, as Mike has indicated, might begin to appear We've had good numbers, as we've been observing, right along These compensation gains have been smaller than we might have anticipated But I do sense that there may be some deterioration in labor costs We've had an increase in strike activity in 1989, which perhaps suggests a bit more militancy on the part of unions Also, as the    10/3/89  fear of recession begins to wane, there may be more of a tendency on the part of business to accommodate some of the labor demands that I think might come along I put that together with what I see in our own District with respect to the labor situation--I think things are tight--and that's where I see the pressure That all suggests to me that it's going to be difficult to make much progress on inflation this year Our forecast would suggest that some further tightening along the road is going to be necessary if we are going to get the inflation rate down lower  Turning to the District, things have turned around a little; deceleration of economic activity has about come to an end and there's much more optimism among people generally In other words, the concern about recession has abated Construction activity remains particularly soft--both residential and office building activity We do have some better activity on the industrial construction side, which is stronger in our District than anywhere else in the nation And on the housing and real estate situation generally, we're hearing quite a lot of concern expressed about properties being put on the market as a result of the thrift insolvencies People are afraid that as these institutions come on the market there's going to be an overhang, which will affect the market adversely Automobile inventories remain a significant problem in our District They are much higher than in the rest of the nation even though recent auto sales have been better There is an interesting development in the textile area The textile producers have been doing very, very well in terms of their sales but they are very concerned about imports, which are up about 11 percent from a year ago Domestic demand for their goods has offset the danger of the imports but they're afraid that as domestic demand begins to slacken off, as they think it might, the imports will begin to affect them adversely And I think this is significant because they have been very, very aggressive, as you know, in lobbying for protectionist legislation I can't help but note that Representative Jenkins from the State of Georgia has assumed a higher profile in the Congress; he has been the one leading the charge for protectionism for the textile industry So that's a bit worrisome, I think I have just one other observation and that is that oil exploration and production in Louisiana are picking up; the number of offshore rigs has been increasing since April and that reverses a decline earlier in the year Natural gas is also doing well In agriculture the picture is mixed because there apparently has been either too much rain or too little In our case, recent heavy rains have been a negative factor in many areas of the Southeast But in general, Mr Chairman, things are looking better in the Southeast on average than they did at the time of the last FOMC meeting "
612,1989-10-03," Mr Chairman, I would certainly support your prescription for policy in the short term I think it's exactly on target with respect to the dollar Any easing at this point would be associated with dollar movement and that has very grave risks, as you stated I think we're at a point where we ought to be fairly happy with the state of the economy Clearly, there are risks and they have been articulated very well; I don't minimize them But I certainly find it very hard to imagine a stronger case for leaving policy unchanged at the moment I, too, would prefer a symmetrical directive only because I think that the risks are about evenly balanced "
670,1989-11-14," Conditions in the Sixth District haven't changed very much over the last couple of meeting periods, Mr Chairman We're chugging along at somewhat below the national average Unlike the San Francisco District, though, we are getting some kick or boost from rebuilding resulting from the Hugo hurricane even though the worst effects were in Bob Black's District The demand for building supplies and construction materials is coming not only from the Southeast but from the Caribbean as well, and that's giving a good push to transportation as well as to port activity Beyond that, we're getting pretty good export experience with chemicals and grains as well But the weaknesses in the Southeast and in the Sixth District economy are kind of overwhelming those positive things and we're seeing a rising unemployment rate--we are at about 62 percent in the District as a whole Some of that is skewed, of course, by Louisiana; but we are seeing unemployment creeping up generally in other states We have weakness in textiles because of a drop in domestic demand That is something they have been afraid of for a while; they have been sustained to some extent by foreign demand But the domestic demand now is beginning to fall off and we're getting corresponding weaknesses in apparel, carpets--carpeting, obviously, is related to the housing shortage--paper, and autos, of course In construction, even though we have a lot of overbuilding in residential and in office buildings, the financing is available and the construction continues to go on That's particularly true in Atlanta where we're getting a movement from a lot of class B buildings to class A The buildings keep going up and I just think we're going to have a pretty bad vacancy problem down the road Also, we're seeing a buildup in retail inventories and the contacts that I've been talking to don't forecast a very good Christmas season Prices and labor conditions seem to be okay We're not getting a lot of price pressures--consistent with the weakness in the economy, I suppose--and labor shortages are not significant  With respect to the national economy, we think that the economy will be somewhat stronger in the near term than the Greenbook forecast That's basically because of our forecast for net exports, which we think will be a little higher I'm not sure whether I have mentioned this before--I think perhaps I have--but I continue to be impressed by the number of people who initiate conversations with me about the softness in the economy From the auto people and construction people you can expect that, but pretty much across the board I'm getting telephone calls and people stop me on the street and they talk to me at parties about how terrible things are I think  -14-    11/14/89  some of this is exaggerated but I'm really paying attention to this I don't remember that happening before I think back particularly to 1986 or 1984 when we had some weak quarters and I didn't get this kind of outpouring of emotion about it I don't know what that tells me in real terms but it's something that clearly gives me some concern In our forecast we also see unemployment being a little flatter than the Greenbook, but basically we're in accord with the Greenbook The risk, in my view, is clearly on the down side at this point "
671,1989-11-14," Mr Chairman, I would associate myself with those who say we need to keep our eye on the long-term goal of price stability And I certainly wouldn't want to give back the gains that we've made over time However, I think we need to keep in the forefront of our minds that price stability is only one of the goals of monetary policy; it may be the primary one but I think we can't be seen as recession tolerant And like you and other speakers earlier in the day, I think the risk of recession is beginning to grow I think what we've done is sufficient for the moment; I would stand back and wait at the moment But I have a feeling that we may have to ease  -31-    11/14/89  a little more before the end of the year So, I would favor your proposal of alternative B with asymmetric language "
728,1990-03-27," Did that make them very unhappy when you told them that?   I had another question, Mr Chairman Going back to the yen Part of the weakness of the yen has been attributed to the rift between the Bank of Japan and the Ministry of Finance, beyond the more general political problem But they did do the discount rate increase of 1 percentage point Does that suggest that that rift has been healed or is that ongoing and will it prevent the Bank of Japan from taking further anti-inflationary steps?   Peter, are the market participants that you talk to expressing any concern about the Comptroller's examinations in various parts of the country? Are they talking to you about the possibilities of a credit crunch?   But the nonbankers are not focusing on it very much?   Mr Chairman? I too would support your proposal When I look at the alternatives, it's the only way to go But a point of clarification Governor Johnson posed a question about our response to concerted intervention and you said you would say ""no"" at some point I didn't quite understand   What I'm really looking for, Mr Chairman, is what are the consequences of saying ""no""? What does the Treasury do then?   Well, I would just make the point that--   They probably wouldn't push it, but before we get to that point I think it's very important to think through the implications for this institution I think you were implicitly saying, Mr Chairman, what a confrontation can mean in terms of what they do on the Hill We have enough trouble with people--   But in the broader context, what I'm getting at is that I think for the good of this institution we need to avoid a confrontation, as you said, that we probably can't win There are people who want to put the Secretary of the Treasury on this Board, or did You're going to have that throughout And if we have that kind  -72-    3/27/90  of problem with domestic policy, I think we can throw the foreign exchange thing in as well if we're in a no-win situation   Could I make just one other comment? This is more of a suggestion We have been participants in these discussions about intervention but I don't remember that we've ever had any discussion like we've had today, which takes into account the Treasury's feelings about intervention or what's going on at the G-7 I raise the question W6uld it be possible for us to have some systematic discussion at our meetings about the attitude of the Treasury and maybe some debriefings about G-7 [discussions] to the extent that that's appropriate?   I think it would be helpful to get the flavor-- "
729,1990-03-27," In the Sixth District, Mr Chairman, things really have not changed appreciably since the last meeting, but I have the sense that they're getting a little better Certainly, there's a bit more optimism among people that I talk to A lot of our contacts are reporting that business is not only better in the early part of 1990 in actual terms, but much better than they had expected But having said that, there is still a continuing concern about recession, and there's a lot of caution in the marketplace The weak spots, of course, continue to be autos and related products I think we also would have weakness in textile manufacturing, aluminum, and timber were it not for pretty strong export demand that is keeping them going If that export demand were to subside, given the state of the housing market, I think those sectors also would be in trouble Energy continues to get better In fact, we have reports now that  -24-    3/27/90  some of the companies are finding it difficult to get skilled platform workers I don't know where they've gone, but they've gone to other places and to other industries and they're not coming back We also have had reports, which I found interesting, of some foreign interest in buying US refineries Retail sales seem to be fairly good--not great, but not bad either We're not detecting any particular wage pressures or price pressures, although I put that in the context of what the expectation is I think business people are building in a 4-1/2 to 5 percent inflation level in their contracts  The big item, and it has been alluded to before in our discussion, is this fear among business people and bankers of a credit crunch I find it a little difficult to evaluate whether there really has been substantial credit rationing On the one hand, the banks in the Southeast that already have been examined are clearly increasing their provisions for loan losses and there will be some pulling back there And I think the banks that are next on the list [to be examined] are apprehensive and perhaps are taking some defensive measures by pulling back But the general sense I have is that the good loans are being made and the marginal ones perhaps are not The good bankable loans still are going forward, as far as I can tell  On the national economy, we agree with the Greenbook forecast Our forecast had been stronger earlier on than the Greenbook's, so we're in agreement with them There is still the risk of a downturn but I think the risk has shifted a little more toward inflation I'm really very disappointed, as I'm sure most of us are, about the projection for inflation Like some others, I find it very hard in the forecast horizon to see much of a depreciation of the dollar We've talked about some of the economic factors involved in that But what is uppermost in my mind are the political activities that are going on around the world that I think are affecting the dollar substantially We not only have the situations in Japan and Germany, but the situation in the United Kingdom is very uncertain at the moment And I must say that events in Eastern Europe are not turning out the way people had expected This Lithuanian development could turn the whole situation around a great deal With that kind of political uncertainty in the world, I think the dollar is still the safe haven and the place for investment So, a depreciation of the dollar is not in the cards as far as I can see--in the near term, in any event  With respect to inflation, not only are the people that I'm talking to complacent about inflation but I think that complacency is now turning into an antagonism toward Fed policy More and more I'm hearing ""Why are you guys so concerned about inflation? You're really doing a lot more harm than good"" So, while the risk of some recession may be there, as I said, the real danger is increasing inflation And I think we have a difficult job not only in containing inflation and bringing it down but also in persuading the country that this is the right road and the one we should be on "
730,1990-03-27," Mr Chairman, if I were the all powerful czar of monetary policy I would do exactly what you've prescribed I'm basically content with where we are I share the frustration about our lack of ability to move against inflation But I think we have to have patience; that's the key point in my mind For the reasons that you've mentioned, I think we have a potential for instability in the market We have fragility, we have this possibility of the credit crunch, and [we have the possibility of a problem in the] foreign exchange markets All of those things suggest to me very strongly that it is premature to move at this time It's a natural reaction on the part of human beings to want to take action when frustrated by something like this inflation rate But sometimes inaction is the better course of action, and I think that's the situation that we're in now So for that reason I would heartily endorse your prescription, and I feel that it should be a symmetric directive as well "
790,1990-05-15," Since our last meeting, Mr Chairman, the economy in the Sixth District seems to be doing a little better For example, the unemployment rate in March for all of the states combined was the lowest that we've had in 15 years That was mainly attributable to better performance in Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana, resulting from stronger agri-business as well as offshore energy exploration and development We're also benefiting in the  -14-    5/15/90  Southeast and particularly in Atlanta from job relocations, which are significant in some cases, to the area and to the city Otherwise, the weaknesses and strengths in the District are pretty much the same as in the country as a whole, and I won't repeat those We have very little real evidence to contribute from the credit availability survey last month to suggest that there were any major credit problems But I must say that the bankers in the District don't miss any opportunity to remind me about the problem that they're having They indicate that loan officers are increasingly reluctant to make commitments and to approve applications either because the bank has had, or is anticipating, an examination or because of the publicity The data for District banks do show some deceleration in loan growth, but I would repeat that we don't find evidence of any substantial problem  Business contacts, and this includes our directors, seem to me a little less concerned about a recession than earlier this year, but they are complaining that the deceleration in growth is placing them under pressure within their own businesses For the most part they have not seen price pressures accelerating and from this point they don't see inflation as a problem As I've said several times before, many of the people that I talk to are not convinced that there's anything wrong with the current inflation rate, and that continues to disturb me a little And they are worried, too, about our reaction and what will happen if we seek to bring inflation down too aggressively  Turning to the national economy, we did not as usual assume any policy change over the two-year time horizon, so our forecast is not especially comparable to the one in the Greenbook But as I look at both of those forecasts, I think our forecast has a slightly more positive and optimistic view about the underlying rate of inflation Some of the unanticipated increase in consumer prices in the first quarter we see as basically temporary and not so much of that is carried forward in comparison to the Greenbook So, we're continuing to forecast the CPI to turn out between 4 and 4-1/2 percent over the next two years Beyond that we see very little improvement and perhaps even a deterioration as we look past 1991; obviously, in the Board staff's forecast that improvement occurs later on I think the Greenbook has done a very good and very reasonable job of distributing the weaknesses that result from a policy tightening  I'm anticipating our policy discussion to some extent, but I think that a case can be made for some policy tightening at the moment One argument would be credibility to be sure Another argument that has some appeal is that it probably will be increasingly difficult to make a move later on this year Having said that, I don't think the timing is really right at the present time There are still enough pockets of weakness both nationally and regionally that the risk of a downturn could be fairly high The April data suggest to me that there's a bit more weakness out there than is built into these forecasts and other forecasts The current concern about credit availability adds to that concern And finally, it seems to me that with the budget summit that is starting today, a tightening of policy before this meeting is concluded might very well reduce the pressures on the negotiating parties to actually restrain the budget, meaning less would be done So, to me the arguments are persuasive that we ought not to move at the present time  -15-    5/15/90 "
791,1990-05-15," Mr Chairman, I think there are enough uncertainties in the economy that we should not move at this time; we ought to stay where we are So, I would support alternative B But I tend to agree with you that our next move is going to be on the up side and, therefore, I would have a slight preference for asymmetric language "
837,1990-08-21," How long have they been following it?   Longer than us?    8/21/90   Well, Si Keehn just asked my question about the budget, but perhaps I could also ask Ted about the $25 oil price assumption Does that assume increased production by the Saudis?   Also, in your description of the real GNP targets, you said something about a 50 percent decline in--   I'm sorry, a 50 basis point decline in the funds rate I didn't quite catch what you said Could you say that again?   In the Atlanta District, Mr Chairman, with the exception of exports, the tone of the reports that we're getting is very, very negative The list of the weak or the weakening sectors that I talked about at the last FOMC meeting is unchanged And I suspect from reading the Beigebook that these weak areas are very much the same as those around the country Construction activity is particularly sluggish at the present time and, unfortunately, there is a large unoccupied stock that will have to be worked off before any new activity is justified I don't hear very much about the [credit]  -17-    8/21/90  crunch anymore Clearly, the banks have tightened their underwriting standards What we are seeing, though, is a decline in consumer loans rather than construction loans And I suspect that that's more a function of demand than supply Before the Middle East problem arose, the oil and gas business in the District was beginning to expand, but the industry has been constrained by labor shortages The workers have left the area, particularly Louisiana and the Mobile area, and are not returning At the moment it's still too early to tell how much stimulus the oil component sector will get from the recent price increases The important regional industries that are maintaining their level of output are doing so only because their exports are replacing domestic sales And in this category I certainly would include wood and pulp and paper producers Agriculture is strong in the District, and sales of farm equipment are rising pretty rapidly both because of a good year domestically and also because of rising export sales In an overall sense, the slowdown may be a little more pronounced than it was in July, but I don't see any new areas of weakness emerging  One other comment that I picked up from a number of contacts, particularly people in small businesses, is that they are seeing a growing problem with receivables, which have been much harder to collect As a result, these firms are in effect financing these slow- paying customers Sentiment is very negative, I would say And, Governor Mullins, consumer confidence is very low in our District--and it's getting lower as a result of the Kuwait and Iraq situation  With respect to the national economy, I find myself in agreement with the Greenbook generally In the interest of full disclosure, I would say my staff is a little more bullish on consumer spending than I am I must say that I am increasingly pessimistic, and I was pessimistic before Kuwait, about the budget accord I would like to think that something will happen, but I'm not at all sure that's going to be the case Overall, I think that we may avoid a recession; but I am more concerned about our falling off the edge than I was at the time of the last FOMC meeting "
838,1990-08-21," Mr Chairman, in the pre-Iraq invasion environment I was beginning to feel that we were at the point where we should consider some easing of policy, and I must say that the events in the Middle East have tended to confirm my feeling that that is probably the appropriate stance for policy I'm not at all convinced that the price of oil is going to be maintained at the $25 level that' the staff is forecasting, in the context of your remarks--which I tend to agree with--that there's a 50/50 chance that we're going to get into a real shoot-out here All of that I think is going to reduce aggregate demand in the economy and it's going to have a greater effect on the real economy and on output than on prices My view is that we should do what we can to avoid a recession for reasons that we're all familiar with and that Governor LaWare articulated very well a few minutes ago I think one can argue that we can attain greater stability by moving at this point and giving greater confidence to the people at large that we are not going to be moving into a recession And I say that with full recognition of the effects on inflation and the exchange rate But having said all of that, your argument is quite persuasive As you said, it's a very, very difficult call-- probably one of the most difficult we have faced in a long time So, I can support your prescription with some reservation My preference would be to move slightly to give a psychological boost, if not a real boost, to the economy But if I were a voting member I would not dissent from your prescription "
895,1990-10-02," Was there any discussion about the possibility of recession in the United States and the potential spillover into other countries?   Could I just follow with one other question? I've seen some press reports recently that the [Delors] proposal, the parallel currency, is getting noisier   Yes I understand that it's getting more support than it did when he proposed it originally Was there any discussion or do you have any sense that this is gaining any momentum?   I take it that it's your sense that our trading partners will be following a fairly restrictive monetary policy for the foreseeable future?   Thank you   He has a new instrument They can all come back and work for Don "
896,1990-10-02," I will start off, Mr Chairman I would have to say that the business and consumer attitudes we have found in the Sixth District since our last meeting suggest a quite fragile economic outlook The people that I've talked to in the past several weeks have become increasingly negative, with just a few exceptions We have been looking with interest at the oil sector, the energy sector on the Louisiana coast, expecting that perhaps the higher oil prices might have given rise to some greater interest in investment in that sector But we have been told by our contacts in the industry that there is just too much uncertainty about the price of oil in the future So, they're not ready to embark at this point on any significant added investment  The only bright spots that I can find in our economy are for the most part in the export-producing industries The industries that are competing with imports are still shrinking, and that's particularly true in the apparel area Retailers in the district are anticipating substantial caution on the part of consumers, which I think is certainly justified Interestingly, they're delaying orders for Christmas merchandise; they think that manufacturers will need to clear out goods at lower prices later on I'm not sure that their bet is quite good on that score since manufacturers' inventories are quite lean So, it's hard to tell how their strategy will finally come out  Now, what I've been talking about is really a reflection of attitudes and anecdotal information The hard data that we get from the July numbers suggest that the District is doing fairly well in comparison to the rest of the country In the month of July, for example, unemployment fell just a little, which moved the rate a bit closer to the national average But we did get hard data for August for the state of Florida and that suggested that there is going to be a significant increase in the rate of unemployment for the month of August  Picking up on what Mike said about the credit crunch, the business contacts that we have are reporting increasingly stringent credit policies at banks While I'm not in a position to say that good projects are not finding financing, the atmosphere created by the  -18-    10/2/90  documentation that is being required is producing a cautionary effect So, the anecdotal information in the District is quite negative  As we look at the national economy, our forecast is similar to the one in the Greenbook, although we don't actually show declines in the fourth and first quarters Our services consumption sector is certainly not strong, but it's not as weak as that shown in the Greenbook and that keeps our GNP from turning negative Also, our investment spending forecast is not quite as soft Now, having said that about the Atlanta staff forecast, I want to throw in a caveat and say that I suspect that our forecast is not incorporating the anecdotal evidence that I've talked about but rather is using the hard numbers So the errors, if any, in our forecast are likely to be on the down side I think the oil shock came at a time when business confidence was already quite low, and that has caused projects which might have seemed a little doubtful to be put on the shelf There are pressures on businesses to reduce expenses and that could quickly lead to reductions in both output and employment  The other issue that is a concern is the weakness in the banking system Unfortunately, the media attention to this problem is certainly not helping And it's in the banking sector as well as the real estate sector, Martha So, I think the financial sector difficulties are probably adding to the tax-like impacts of the oil shock In these circumstances, it seems to me that one could easily come up with a negative judgment about the national economy And that is my judgment; I find myself turning quite negative "
897,1990-10-02," Don, you may have said this, but I missed it if you did If we did alternative A in one step, 50 basis points, what do you think would happen to long-term rates?   Oh, I was going to ask a question I don't want to prolong this either so I'll quickly ask the question and then make my comments Suppose they don't pass the budget resolution, when do we face sequestration?   Tuesday morning If we face sequestration and it's real and they don't change it, then the contractionary force in the economy is even greater   I don't know; that's a judgment call My point is that I think we need to be prepared for that contingency   Well, if you want to get the [policy] discussion going, let me say that I agree with your prescription As I said at the meeting last time, I think that there is greater weakness in the economy than the forecast suggests And I think that weakness was already present at mid-summer before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait So, I think it would have been appropriate to ease at that time, and I think the argument for easing at this point is even greater In the interest of time, I won't go into the whole litany of reasons why I think that Suffice it to say that I have two points I think that we have established a great deal of credibility We can continue to use that credibility, but I think it's time to use it and to exercise leadership And I think that'll be understood The thing that appeals to me about the 25 basis point move is that we can test the market a little as well and see what the reaction is before we move to the second step If we had a sharp drop in the dollar or a runup on the long end of the maturity spectrum, we'd know that So, I agree with what you're prescribing "
956,1990-11-13," Peter, there has been a lot of discussion concerning the Japanese and other foreign investors pulling back from their investments, particularly indirect investments, in the United States I'm not sure what the order of magnitude of those flows has been but if they have been substantial, why aren't we seeing some upward pressure on interest rates as a result of that?   Well, it goes to the question of the financing of the deficit, and we've talked about--   I think, too, that it has been anachronistic and irrelevant for a long period of time, and my preference would be to eliminate it But as Governor LaWare just said, if there's a particular reason to preserve in the record your discretion to have a consultation, then I think we could fashion language that doesn't really tie it to any particular economic situation but just gives you broader authority to call a consultation whenever you feel like it For example, ""The Chairman reserves the right to call for Committee consultation when in his judgment conditions warrant such consultation"" or something like that    11/13/90   Well, that's right It is implicit and that's why I favor doing away with the sentence But if anyone felt they wanted to have language, I would prefer broad language like that rather than tying it to the funds rate or to economic conditions But you're right, it is implicit "
957,1990-11-13," Thank you, Mr Chairman Economic activity in the Sixth District pretty much mirrors what has been happening in the rest of the country, as I reported last time Our retail sales have been flat on average around the District with noticeable declines in autos, household appliances, and furnishings The retailers in the District are very cautious about orders since they're not expecting a    11/13/90  good Christmas season at all We have seen discounting already, even this early in the season, so it appears that the emphasis is on tighter inventory control  On the production side, new orders have declined in a number of key industries, especially carpet and apparel But, as I believe I mentioned last time, those manufacturers who have established export markets are seeing strong sales growth As a consequence, manufacturing activity overall is continuing to expand although rather slowly, while domestic sales and employment are falling in those same [industries] The only other report I heard on strong sales was from a small businesswoman who said she's making a lot of money selling deodorant to the government for distribution to the troops in Saudi Arabia On the price front, where we can separate out the oil shock effects we find very few pressures on prices in the District outside of medical services And looking at the oil-producing area, again as we've reported several times, severe shortages of skilled laborers, particularly welders, are constraining production at the present time The premium for these workers is now upwards of 20 percent in the last two months, and with that kind of a premium attraction we're likely to get back some of those industry workers who were dropped in the last five years  In looking at some of the loan data for banks in our District I was surprised to find that, unlike the rest of the country, our consumer loans are weaker than real estate loans And that pattern has existed from April through September Real estate loans really have not changed all that much  Looking at the national economy, given all of the uncertainties surrounding these forecasts, my own feeling is that the Greenbook forecast is fairly plausible We've heard a lot of talk about whether we're in recession or not; I think that's really an irrelevant question at the moment The key issue, it seems to me, is how deep it may be if in fact we are in a recession And that's the critical question I have with respect to this forecast--whether the negative growth in the fourth and first quarters will be as mild and whether the rebound will be as much as is forecast in the Greenbook scenario For those reasons, and I'll talk about this later, I continue to favor some cushioning of the economy against a substantial downturn "
958,1990-11-13," I agree entirely, Mr Chairman, except that I think that we also have the possibility of moving another 25 basis points if the markets don't react adversely In other words, my preference would be to do 25 now and then wait for another opportunity to do another 25 "
1017,1990-12-18," Gretchen, do you think the market continues to anticipate further easing by the Fed? Is that the [unintelligible] of the market? "
1018,1990-12-18," Well, Mr Chairman, conditions in the Sixth District continue to weaken with the exception of the energy and chemical areas, which seem to be doing fairly well Most of the industries in the District are experiencing deteriorating conditions We did a recent survey of retailers about their Christmas season sales, and they say that spending is not only weak but has fallen below what had been very modest expectations to begin with And as other people have mentioned, the retailers are not really looking for any comeback after the first of the year The good news, to the extent that it is good, is that inventories at least are under tight control at this point, which is consistent with the discussion in the Greenbook We don't have the base of export activity in the District that other parts of the country have and, therefore, manufacturing activity is not good and we won't get the effect of greater export activity As a result of that, we've seen in recent weeks a stream of announcements of layoffs and plant closings That includes the banking industry and that, incidentally, is getting front page headlines--not only the condition of the financial institutions but the layoffs associated with it The business and financial contacts that I talked to in recent weeks are universally gloomy, and that includes our directors Most of them, I would say, think that this contraction is going to be a deep and lengthy one--deeper and longer  -11-    12/18/90  than the standard forecasts Worries about the banking system, as I said, get daily attention, and recent publicity about the FDIC is certainly aggravating peoples' concerns and not contributing to confidence in any great way On the credit crunch, the most recent thing I heard was at a meeting I had with about 14 or 15 business people The only thing they wanted to talk about was the lack of financing They simply can't get financing even though they have had a long association with their bank, and that is a source of great concern to them  While the situation in the Sixth District does not look at all good, our forecast for the nation is very similar to the Greenbook both with respect to GNP and inflation; and our assumption about the behavior of oil prices is very similar as well Notwithstanding that, I do think that the risks are on the down side of the forecast and I'm very concerned about the stress in the financial system that could very well restrain a rebound in activity I'm also concerned about the weakness in the monetary aggregates  Now, there are two other things that I would mention, which affect my outlook for policy Because of the credit crunch and because of the situation at financial institutions we may not be getting the same effect from monetary policy that we ordinarily would; it may be damped And that may call for a little more aggressive policy response at this particular time I think it would be a very big mistake for us to deal with the financial problems of the banking industry by exercising greater forbearance; the way to deal with this situation as well as the economy generally is to have a more aggressive monetary policy I guess I'll have a chance to say a little more about that later "
1019,1990-12-18," Well, Mr Chairman, with respect to the policy issue I start from the proposition that we're in a contraction, that the contraction is going to continue, and that the risk of a more serious downturn is present And the risk of that kind of a downturn is one that I would not like to take at this point I think it's an undue downward risk, and I would prefer that policy be contracyclical at this point rather than procyclical I think you put your finger on a very important aspect of this downturn the psychology And the psychology is universally bad Although monetary policy can't cure all of the ills in the economy and certainly can't deal with the Middle East and so on, I do think it's the only thing at this point-- unless there is a solution to the Middle East situation--that is really going to bolster the psychology So, while we do have the risk of overdoing it, I would be prepared to run that risk at this point My preference would be to move 50 basis points immediately; however, if you wanted to do it in two steps with an asymmetric directive, I wouldn't have a great problem with that If you did 50 basis points immediately, I think that to some extent technically solves the discount rate problem because the funds rate would be below the discount rate and the market would be expecting some symmetry between the two My preference in terms of policy and implementation would be to move 50 basis points [on the funds rate] and to drop the discount rate as well "
1074,1991-03-26," Well, Mr Chairman, as you indicated earlier, we have two statutory provisions that on the surface at least do seem to be in conflict But I think it would be a big mistake for us to get too bogged down in jurisdictional questions here After all, both the Board through its [oversight] of the discount rate operation and the Federal Open Market Committee [have] the same objective, and that [requires] a unified monetary policy But having said that, we obviously need to preserve our own prerogatives in these areas I think what is needed here, since these statutory provisions as I read them are somewhat in conflict, is to have a bridge between the two And that's exactly what [the staff report] suggested with this [enhanced] consultation I think that really is the way to get at it, and I would urge us to have more frequent consultations But we ought not to get too bogged down in the rights of the Board versus the rights of the Committee I think that's counterproductive "
1075,1991-03-26," Let me start with the District, if I may We're getting very mixed reports on the Sixth District Considerably more optimism has developed, as one would expect, after the ending of hostilities in the Persian Gulf Realtors are reporting that sales of single-family homes picked up in February and that inquiries and traffic have been quite strong so far this month In fact, I spoke to one of the leading realtors in Atlanta and he told me that February was one of the best months they've had in a long time That may be seasonal, of course, but the contacts that I've been talking to seem more optimistic about their prospects as long as mortgage rates don't back up much further On the commercial side, because we've had so much overbuilding and because in-migration of businesses and individuals is at a much lower pace than just a few years ago, I think construction is likely to remain weak for some time to come Reports from retailers indicate sales levels that are below those of a year ago in real terms and there's a great deal of caution about inventories Most retailers are trying to prevent inventories from rising or are trying to reduce them through aggressive promotion Trade show contacts report that orders for giftware are strong and orders for apparel and other consumer items are quite soft Auto dealers think that the worst in sales may be over and they expect a modest pickup in the months ahead  On the manufacturing side, the attitudes of manufacturers in the District are really quite negative at this point Some exports are doing reasonably well but that has had little impact in the District since the region's tradable goods sector is relatively small compared to that of the rest of the country Export growth in the pulp, paper, and chemical industries slowed over the winter and the chemical industry in particular had been a source of stimulus and strength before This is due primarily, we understand, to concerns over the war and may prove to be temporary, although we haven't heard of any renewed strength so far Convention business also weakened during the winter and reports in early March suggested no improvement in Atlanta and New Orleans where bookings are running below those of last year There is concern that pressures to cut corporate travel budgets will sustain the weakness On the other hand, contacts in Florida, and particularly in Orlando, tell us that the number of foreign visitors has picked up since the end of hostilities The oil production and exploration areas were not affected very much by the conflict in the Gulf In February the average rig count in Louisiana was up just 3 percent from a year earlier Permits were also up a little And the area is still suffering from a shortage of skilled labor; that situation has not improved  -24-    3/26/91  Reports on credit conditions suggest little easing of the tighter standards imposed by banks, although on the supply side banks are telling me that they are out in the marketplace seeking loans But most lending officers are almost totally unwilling to look at any kind of real estate related loans We had a group of high-tech people in a week or so ago, and while they all report that they're looking for an expansion in export sales, they are complaining bitterly on their own behalf and on behalf of their customers about the difficulties that they face in obtaining financing On the wage and price side, our directors are reporting very, very little pressure in either of those areas I would also just add with respect to the District that our unemployment rate went up to 69 percent, which is higher, of course, than the national average  Looking at the national economy, our forecast has been revised lower since we met last time The larger decline that we had expected in the first quarter is not fully made up over the rest of the year after the economy turns around In comparison to the Greenbook we don't see the expansion as being quite as strong over the remainder of the forecast horizon We think the rise in consumption is going to proceed at a somewhat slower pace than the staff forecast, and I think demographic factors account for a good deal of this Our outlook for prices is basically different from the Greenbook We have the CPI rising at a slower pace in 1991, and we don't get any improvement as time goes on In fact, the pace of the CPI deteriorates a bit in our forecast We are similar to the Greenbook, however, in that we do show a resumption of growth sometime during the second quarter, certainly in the second half of the year And while I'm a little more comfortable with that forecast than I was six weeks ago, I remain concerned about how much fragility there is in the economy We've had declines in asset prices and we have high debt levels; and the continued emphasis on problems with deposit insurance threatens to erode confidence somewhat The recent rise in confidence --certainly the number [released] this morning--is encouraging but I have to wonder how much of it has to do with the euphoria over our success in the Persian Gulf; I haven't yet seen it translated into any hard spending and that may not occur In addition, as was mentioned early this morning, I'm concerned also about our estimates of activity for our G-10 partners Those estimates are being revised lower, as we heard, and it seems as if we're now dependent on activity strengthening abroad as well as here in the second half Even though there's some offset from reconstruction demand in Kuwait, this may take more time to develop and it does reflect a need for capital  So, in summary, Mr Chairman, I believe that these forecasts of an impending turnaround have a fairly high probability of being right, but I'm concerned still that the risks to the outlook are on the down side "
1076,1991-03-26," Mr Chairman, I agree entirely with your recommendation that we make no policy change at this time However, given my view of the economy and the risks to the economy, I would slightly prefer an asymmetric directive in the direction of ease But it's a close call and I would certainly support a symmetric directive "
1126,1991-05-14,"Peter, what was the foreign participation, particularly Japanese, in the Treasury refinancing? "
1127,1991-05-14," Well, Mr Chairman, activity in the Atlanta District is generally the same as in the rest of the country as a whole, although I must say that the business people I've spoken to recently are somewhat less pessimistic than they were six weeks ago In the immediate Atlanta metropolitan area, the sentiment has gotten a big boost by the announcements from UPS and Holiday Inn that they are moving corporate headquarters there as well as the awarding of the fighter aircraft contract to Lockheed The most positive event that has happened is that there have been significant increases in sales of single-family homes in the last several weeks On the retail side, consistent with the report we had this morning, retailers in the District are reporting a pickup in sales in March but activity in April fell off and was below their expectations Tourism, too, has picked up as well as convention bookings in the District, and that is interesting to note, too Foreign visitors are beginning to come into the area again after the Persian Gulf situation; that's particularly true in Florida  In the manufacturing area, orders are still fairly weak, employment levels continue to be reduced, and capital expenditures are still being postponed by most business people that we talk to Exports from the District have also been weak; some are attributing that to weaker growth abroad But I think another factor to be taken into account is that military shipments from the District ports displaced regular shipments; that probably accounts for some decrease in that export activity The agricultural area is quite mixed Crop production probably will be lower this year but fruit, vegetable, and livestock should be higher Si mentioned the rains; we've also had heavy rains almost throughout the entire District and that has delayed planting in practically every state All of the states in the District have been hit, as have many others of course, by revenue shortfalls Up until now in our District the legislatures have resisted any major tax increases But if we don't get a turnaround in the economy fairly soon, I think most of the states in our District are going to have to look at major tax increases next year  The credit crunch seems to be about the same as it was at the time of our last meeting; that is to say there really doesn't seem to be much change in the standards that the banks are applying The problem, according to most bankers, is on the demand side There just isn't a great deal of demand for loans Price increases, as someone else mentioned, are minimal if not nonexistent; and that seems to be what is expected over the next several months  Looking at the national economy, we've lowered our forecast since the last meeting We're somewhat weaker in both '91 and '92 compared to the Greenbook, but not appreciably We have both consumption and exports weaker and as a result our unemployment is a bit higher But we also show a little better success on the inflation side; our inflation number is a bit lower I think the risks in the forecast are more symmetric now than they were several weeks ago-- certainly more symmetric than they were earlier I have been saying right along that I thought the risks were on the down side; I'm not so sure that they're completely on the down side now But, and I think Bob Black was alluding to this, the costs of missing are really not symmetric at all That is to say, it seems to me that the costs involved in overshooting the forecast are not very high, given the present levels of capacity and unemployment But if the economy turns    5/14/91  out to be weaker than the forecast, then I think the costs would be very, very high indeed Obviously, we need to take that into account as we set our policy recommendations "
1128,1991-05-14," I'm perfectly willing to xerox the last directive, Mr Chairman But for the record I'd like to indicate that while I believe the risks are somewhat more symmetrical than they were, I would still prefer an asymmetric directive simply because I think that if we do move between now and the next FOMC meeting, it's going to be a move toward ease And I think we ought to have that reflected, but I don't feel that strongly about it "
1175,1991-08-20," Mr Chairman, as I look back at policy over the last couple of years, I think we've done a reasonably good job with the present regime, so I don't feel any compelling need to make any change, particularly at this time with all the uncertainties that we have I do think that some flexibility in the funds rate is probably desirable And if I were pressed to do something today, I would marginally favor the first option in the Lindsey paper The other thing that occurred to me is that over the time we've been discussing this, I at least have picked up an inference--and I may be wrong--that having some flexibility in the funds rate would somehow protect us from political pressures when we have to move on the [tightening] side I don't really buy that If there is that inference, I think it's an incorrect one; we're going to get that political pressure notwithstanding what we do with the funds rate I would be interested, if it's not unduly putting Peter on the spot, to ask whether from an operational standpoint he has any preference or, to put it another way perhaps, if he has any problem with those first three alternatives Would any of those give you difficulty?   Well, I would just add one final point I thought Al Broaddus's letter was very interesting and I certainly don't think we would lose anything by embarking on the kind of research that he has indicated "
1176,1991-08-20," Mr Chairman, conditions in the Southeast pretty much parallel what is happening around the nation; the pluses and minuses in the national economy that Mike outlined are present in our [regional] economy as well We are seeing some modest growth in retail sales along with some indications of increases in orders in major industries Housing is picking up a little--at least housing starts are But I must say that there is a continuing sense of pessimism among virtually all of the business people I talk to, including directors They are really afraid now of another downturn or a double-dip People generally are also very concerned about the bank mergers and other business consolidations that are moving along so quickly and about the potential for unemployment in their own situations and among their families It seems to me that business  -23-    8/20/91  investment is virtually on hold for 1992 as a result of this pessimism among business people  On the other hand, there are some positive signs For example, industrial parts of the region appear to be a bit stronger; I wouldn't say it's great, but it is a little better Increased auto production has helped Tennessee; the Saturn plant there has picked up its production The commercial construction area seems to have hit the bottom, according to our contacts, but as we all know the vacancy rates are such that it's going to take a long time for that area to improve, and we see no evidence that the improvement is accelerating in any sense We have budgetary restraints in virtually all of the states in our District and that's leading to spending cuts And the depressed level of natural gas prices is causing cutbacks in production and layoffs in that area  The credit crunch continues to confuse me; I get differing reports from different people But cutting through all of the chaff, I think creditworthy customers will be serviced by the banks The banks, in fact, are out looking for good loans but they're not finding much demand In summary, as far as the District is concerned, people keep asking the questions Where is the recovery? And if there is a recovery, why aren't business conditions better than they seem to be?  On the national side, our forecast is very similar to the Greenbook, although we do show somewhat slower growth in the fourth quarter of this year and the first quarter of next year And even with that slower growth, our inflation number is not quite as optimistic as the staff's; we're in the range of 4 percent versus the staff's 3 to 3-1/2 percent For reasons that have been indicated by other people, I think the risks are clearly on the down side at the moment Like other people, while I don't ordinarily pay a great deal of attention to M2, I think this persistence in its weakness is telling us something that we have to be very careful about Certainly if it continues to grow at these rates, we could have some serious repercussions The financial sector also continues to concern me We have news of financial stress constantly in the newspapers Added to that now are scandals as well in the insurance companies And while it's too early to tell, if the situation in the Soviet Union continues to cause uncertainty, I think that is going to cut into consumer confidence as well Altogether, I think the risks are very clearly on the down side and we need to take that into account a little later this morning "
1177,1991-08-20," Mr Chairman, I think one can make a fairly persuasive case for easing now I would make it more on the basis of a boost to confidence and getting a little ahead of the risk and also with some element of M2 But having said that, I don't think it's a compelling argument, and I would be satisfied with the prescription you have outlined, which would be ""B"" asymmetrical I have a slight preference for version I, but I can certainly live with version II "
1228,1991-10-01," Mr Chairman, when we were together in August I reported that economic activity in the Sixth District was very slow and uneven and, unfortunately, that hasn't changed at all In fact, the people that we've been talking to over the past several weeks would describe the local economy, and to some extent the national economy, as one that really is struggling to maintain any forward momentum Retailers are experiencing flat sales; they've been very disappointed by the back-to-school season They're also seeing, of course, weakness in durables as is the trend around the country They are very concerned about sales in the upcoming Christmas holiday season and are not really expecting very much from that I would say that confidence continues to be low The sentiment in the District is reflected in the general comment we get from business people If we're really in a recovery, why doesn't it feel better?  -14-    10/1/91  On the other hand, industries that are in any way related to the export side are doing a little better; and that includes, for example, industries like chemicals and poultry processing Manufacturing inventories continue to be quite lean Another positive note is that single-family housing inventories seem to be declining, though declining at a fairly slow [pace] And building activity and sales seem to be improving a little However, in two of our major markets, Florida and Atlanta, the momentum in housing seems to be declining and there's some evidence that it might actually be stalling out Adding to the gloom generally in the area, state and local governments have experienced revenue shortfalls and are cutting expenditures quite stringently, with the exception of Louisiana, which has benefited somewhat from the oil situation There are no price increases to be reported at all  On the famous credit crunch side, that problem still seems to be with us in the Sixth District Bankers say they are willing to make loans to creditworthy borrowers but it's pretty clear to me that the standards for gauging credit quality are pretty stringent and haven't changed very much over the last several weeks So, in summary, it seems to me that the Southeast--the Sixth District--is experiencing activity very much like the nation as a whole, with the same mix of strengths and weaknesses  On the national side, we're fairly close to the Greenbook forecast, but we do show somewhat slower growth, particularly next year, and somewhat higher inflation We agree that the recovery is going to be slow; it's probably going to be pushed by manufacturing I'm somewhat concerned that our forecast--not only ours but forecasts generally--have been a bit more optimistic than the reality and I hope that upcoming forecasts will prove to be a little more realistic But as I look at the overall characteristics of the economy nationally what I see is modest growth in consumption expenditures with households and businesses constrained by high debt levels and limited income growth; a housing sector that's still adjusting to slower rates of family formations--the demographic situation we've talked about; a nonresidential market that has a three-year supply of office space; and negative fiscal impulses at both the state and the federal levels When I add that up and add to it the balance sheet position of individuals and businesses, which is retarding growth, it seems to me that the risk is somewhat on the down side And I would ask the same question that Dick Syron asked If we're going to make a mistake in policy, would it be better to err on the side of stimulating growth a little more? I would tend to come out on that side   Rental prices are still weak in the Atlanta area "
1229,1991-10-01," Mr Chairman, while I said earlier and I still continue to believe that the risk is on the down side, I certainly hope your forecast for our looking back from February and saying our policy has been right is correct I'm still rather nervous about where we are, but I would certainly at this point support your prescription for no change with an asymmetric directive "
1278,1991-11-05," Second   Could we do it early, though?   I think my question has been answered I was going to raise the question about how we would get the announcement effect out tomorrow The last time we did this there was some confusion in the market So, whatever we do, we ought to make it very clear On the broader issue, I'd go ahead and do it and risk the letters and so on I just wish we had done it early this morning! "
1279,1991-11-05," Mr Chairman, I think the best descriptive term to use for the Sixth District economy is ""quite soft,"" although there are still some signs of recovery out there Several  -10-    11/5/91  manufacturers have added to their inventories intentionally Activity on the export side continues to be fairly good, although it's off a little from what it had been Textiles have improved, and we've also seen some evidence of a few new capital projects Retailers, on the other hand, are reporting flat to only very modest increases in sales Caution by consumers, of course, is very much in their minds and they are very, very pessimistic and fearful about the Christmas season; they don't expect business to be good at all Tourism and business travel were up slightly in October and in fact are running even a little ahead of a year ago Our bank contacts are reporting very weak loan demand; on the other hand, we have potential borrowers who are continuing to complain about difficulty getting credit We continue to receive that information from people on our small business advisory group, for example  But overriding all of the statistical data about the economy is the anecdotal information, which continues to be very, very poor indeed and is quite worrisome Everywhere I go both in business meetings and even at social affairs--cocktail parties and so on--there is a real sense of doom and gloom In fact, I went to two functions over the weekend and I was sorry I went because people are just describing business as terrible or dismal, or words of that kind Interestingly, though, if you ask a lot of these people if they think lower interest rates would help their business or help the economy generally, you don't get a uniform answer that ""Yes, [the Federal Reserve] ought to be lowering rates"" Some people think that is not the answer They don't have an answer, but they don't necessarily think that lower interest rates are the solution There is, of course, continuing concern about job loss, concern about consolidation in the services industry And while unemployment hasn't risen in the District, companies are reporting an unprecedented flood of applications and resumes from people who are anticipating layoffs in their business  On the inflation side, there's no evidence of any price increases in the District from the people we talk to The agricultural side looks fairly good and that probably is the only substantially bright spot in the District This confidence issue is very perplexing to me; I'm very confused about it because it doesn't really seem to stack up against the statistical data and the hard facts that are coming in So, I guess the question that we need to ask is Is it just disappointment that business is not as good as people expect or does it really indicate that there is a slowing in the economy and we need to take that into account?  With respect to the national economy, our forecast is a bit stronger in the near term, that is, for the fourth quarter and the first quarter of next year But then we have growth decelerating a bit and are somewhat below the Greenbook forecast for the balance of 1992 If there is going to be a faltering in the economy, it seems to me that it's going to come on the consumer side as opposed to inventories That is, I think consumers may well attempt to shore up their savings and to reduce their debt throughout 1992, given their concerns about the employment situation So, in general, Mr Chairman, I think the Greenbook forecast is not a bad forecast, given all of the uncertainties in the economy, but I continue to think that the risks are on the down side and that the economy is subject to some vulnerability And for that reason, I would be in favor of some  -11-    11/5/91  immediate easing of policy, though not anything dramatic But we can get into the details of that a little later on "
1280,1991-11-05," Mr Chairman, I came into this meeting feeling that we should cut the funds rate 25 basis points I also hoped, and I still continue to hope, that that will be accompanied by a drop in the discount rate I think that would send an important and dramatic message that we really need to send As you said, the momentum of this recovery has slowed down or even stalled I pay a great deal of attention to this confidence element, and I think people really need some kind of a signal from some institution And given the impotency of fiscal policy at the moment, we're the only institution that can provide some kind of action that will help to turn confidence around Twenty-five basis points and even a drop in the discount rate may not renew confidence completely, but it will go some of the way toward helping with that and helping with the further  -30-    11/5/91  consumption and business [unintelligible] needs Finally, I agree with you entirely that the inflation risks of moving at this time are very minimal So, given the risks to a sustainable recovery, I think we need to move and 25 basis points strikes me as [appropriate]   I'd be asymmetric "
1333,1991-12-17," Mr Chairman, I think this is a clear improvement over what we have, so I would support Governor Kelley's recommendation I take Governor Angell's point; there's something to be said for that On the other hand, I don't think we're precluded from making a change if at some point we really wanted to send a signal So, I look forward to reviewing it again next year "
1334,1991-12-17," Mike, we've talked a lot about consumer confidence over the last couple of months I'm just curious How much do you take into account in your forecast the Conference Board surveys and the Michigan Survey results?   Well, maybe I should defer my comments! [Laughter] I'm not sure I can fulfill Tom's expectations, although I don't think I'll be completely negative, Tom Basically, Mr Chairman, there has been very little change over the past couple of months in the level of economic activity in the Sixth District That is to say, I think we're just bumping along the bottom; there's no acceleration, but there's no perceptible deceleration either Some of the people I've talked to over the past couple of weeks, including our directors, tend to confirm this They certainly are not very happy with the state of the economy, but they also are reporting that they don't anticipate any further declines  Retail sales are better than retailers had expected One of the things that is constraining sales in the District is low inventories, and that's especially true of discounters All of the retailers, of course, are citing very cautious spending--a cautious attitude--on the part of consumers A lot of consumers apparently are    12/17/91  waiting for further markdowns, further promotions So, as we get closer to Christmas, there's an expectation on the part of some of the retailers that they may get a surge in their sales this week or early next week We did a survey of retailers in the four states that have most of the population in our District and they're anticipating an increase of 2 to 3-1/2 percent That was [the figure] for the 23 days ending on December 7; I hope they're able to realize that for the entire season The gains are generally in nondurables, as I guess we would expect  Residential real estate activity is basically flat The commercial side is still very, very poor The commercial developers are still complaining about lack of credit But for the most part I think their not getting credit is a good thing because I don't think they are very good credit risks, at least the ones I've talked to On the other side of the fence, very large firms in the District outside of the commercial real estate area are reporting that bankers are now coming down and visiting them with some regularity, attempting to book some business Those firms, of course, are the ones that can go anywhere in the marketplace to get financing So, that's the situation in the District It's very little changed; it's basically flat for the most part  With respect to the national economy, our forecast was revised down but not quite as much as the Greenbook forecast Our forecast for the current quarter and the first quarter is somewhat higher than the Greenbook As we get out in the second half of 1992, the two forecasts are about the same, but then we show a modest deceleration as we get into 1993 The differences are basically in consumption and investment Our inflation forecast is lower this quarter and in the first quarter of next year than the Greenbook but higher over the forecast horizon I certainly agree with the comment in the Greenbook that the risks to the forecast seem to be more evenly balanced than they have been recently  What all of this suggests to me in terms of policy is that we certainly have done a lot over the past several months And I think at this point that we have to be very careful not to overdo the stimulus in the economy; we need to proceed very, very cautiously Thank you, Mr Chairman "
1335,1991-12-17," Mr Chairman, I would support your recommendation A point of clarification I assume you're talking about a 1/4 point move?  -31-    12/17/91   Well, as I said, I would support your recommendation I find myself in a bit of an anomalous position, as someone who has been urging ease for over a year, to feel a little uncomfortable with this position now But that is because I think we may have done enough at this point in time We need to keep in mind that there are very substantial lags in monetary policy and that anything we do now is not going to affect the fourth quarter and is not going to affect the first quarter As I look at the profile of the Greenbook forecast, I think it's not a bad outcome given no additional restraint And since my forecast for inflation is a bit higher in the 1993 period, I'm just a little nervous about overdoing this and making the kinds of mistakes we've made before On the other hand, the arguments for ease of the kind that you are describing certainly are reasonable We may get a very substantial psychological benefit from moving So, I would support the recommendation "
1388,1992-03-31," Mike, I'm curious to know why exactly you think that long-term rates are going to come down over the next year? Is it basically inflationary expectations?   The last couple of--   I yield to my colleague   Mr Chairman, I'm happy to say that economic conditions in the Sixth District have definitely improved since the last meeting The information that we have for the six states in our District suggests that activity is improving in all those areas with the exception of Louisiana And more importantly, the forecast seems to be that this improvement is going to continue This general improvement has been confirmed by our directors and other business contacts that I've talked to over the past several weeks They're expressing guarded optimism, but the tone is certainly a lot better and there seems to be an uptick in consumer confidence On the other hand, bankers are continuing to report very soft loan demand If there's any strength at all in loan demand, and it's very marginal, it's on the consumer side, not in business lending We've recently seen modest expansion in orders, production, and shipments by producers of apparel, household goods, and construction materials And there is a parallel development of improvement in the retail sector as well, although durable goods retailers are reporting rather weak sales But the nondurables and services are doing better Auto dealers, on the other hand, are talking about increased traffic but not increased sales  Housing, as in other parts of the country, has improved, although realtors are becoming more and more concerned about increases in mortgage rates We've had increased permits for single-family homes, and I guess associated with that lumber prices have moved up a little and builders are [now] anticipating price increases for other construction materials as well later on this spring On the commercial side, leasing rates for commercial properties have stabilized and this market seems to be in the very early stages of a recovery Another positive factor in our District is that we're not hearing of any new projects coming on stream, which is certainly a plus Tourism and business travel continue to be a bright spot for our District Convention bookings are up in several cities and Florida is seeing a quite significant increase in visitors from abroad The improved health of many of the Latin American countries is reflected in increased export sales to many of those countries Those are the positive aspects of the ledger  Obviously, we have some weak spots as well State and local governments throughout the District are still wrestling with their budget problems, and I don't really see any light at the end of that tunnel The energy sector has also been very hard hit by the mild winter, which has added further downward pressure on natural gas and oil prices And in February the rig count was down 41 percent in Louisiana from a year earlier; that compares to a decline of about 32 percent in the nation as a whole And, of course, layoffs are continuing apace in that sector in Louisiana  In addition to those price pressures for construction materials that I noted earlier, many manufacturers are anticipating some higher input prices in the second half of this year Labor markets on the other hand are still quite soft and wage pressures are quite steady; in effect, there are no wage pressures  With respect to the national economy, our forecast for real GDP is quite similar to the one in the Greenbook We're not quite as  -13-    3/31/92  strong in the first quarter, but after that we virtually converge with the Greenbook We do have unemployment coming down a little faster than the Greenbook, but our biggest difference is on the inflation side, where we see inflation moving up more rapidly than in the Greenbook Our forecast in 1993 is for inflation, as measured by the CPI, of about 4 percent In general, it seems to me that the risks are much more symmetrical than they were when we last met; they're much more balanced Obviously, as Mike indicated, we could have another false start as we did before But I personally feel much more confident that we're on a path of a more sustainable but modest recovery All of this suggests to me, Mr Chairman, that we don't need any policy adjustments at the moment Thank you "
1389,1992-03-31," Mr Chairman, I think policy really needs to stay on a steady course at the moment I, too, like many others, came prepared to argue for symmetric language because I thought the balance [of risks] was a little more evenly distributed But I don't have the same courage of my convictions as does Governor Kelley, so I tipped over to asymmetric during the course of the discussion today basically because I think the vulnerability that we have of missing on the down side is so much greater If we miss on the up side, it won't be all  -37-    3/31/92  that significant And I would just say that I would not give a great deal of weight to what Don Kohn just said about the Ms at this point I don't think we ought to be guided too much by one week's money supply numbers So, I would support ""B"" asymmetric "
1445,1992-05-19," Mr Chairman, in the Sixth District, conditions clearly have continued to improve The business people I have spoken to over the last several weeks are much more upbeat than they were and they have more confidence that the recovery is going to be sustainable I hear much less talk about a stalling of the economy or a double or triple dip, whatever you want to call it There also, I think, is a recognition among business people recently that the recovery is going to be modest They are no longer looking for that historical type of recovery that we've had  We've had gains in a number of areas in the District--retail sales among them, especially in apparel And that's in spite of the fact that we had a late Easter and some bad weather Auto sales have also been relatively good, as have other durables, particularly those related to housing Home sales have been fairly decent also and that has reduced [housing] inventories and led to greater growth in housing permits Capital spending is projected to be fairly modest, but manufacturers are reporting that orders and shipments are turning up A couple of other areas that are important to us are tourism and [convention] business, and we see gains in both of those areas  On the commercial construction question that you asked, anecdotally I've been hearing from people that commercial construction perhaps is at the low point I can say that commercial space is much less of a drag than it has been We've had some absorption of space and that is beginning to stabilize lease prices And that's pretty much [the case] around the District's major cities On the price  -15-    5/19/92  side, prices for finished goods are holding relatively steady, and in other industries we see stable input prices and no pressure on wages The two geographical areas that are dragging a little are Florida and Louisiana Florida is suffering from reductions in defense spending particularly, as well as the lower interest rates that are affecting the high number of retirees I guess there are a lot of mothers-in- law in Florida!   Louisiana continues to suffer as a result of the energy situation So, with respect to the District, Mr Chairman, things are looking relatively good and more sustainable, as I said, than they had been  With respect to the national picture, the Greenbook forecast is quite a reasonable one and, in fact, I would be very happy if we could achieve it, especially on the inflation side Our forecast is about the same as the Greenbook in terms of GDP but we see somewhat lower unemployment and higher inflation I think the difference is basically that productivity gains [are lower] and labor costs are higher in our forecast than in the Greenbook I do think the expansion is likely to endure The efforts we see on the part of people to get their balance sheets in order lay the foundation for a more sustainable expansion but, of course, we haven't seen the full effects of that, and I guess that leads to some questions about the risks to the forecast I was prepared to mention that but Mike did a very good job of detailing those risks in the forecast, so I won't go over that again  I would say with respect to the slow growth of M2 that a lot of this, if not all of it, we hear is principally the run-off of small time deposits Banks are not bidding very aggressively for funds in this current environment and that suggests the process of financial disintermediation is still constraining Putting all of this together, it seems to me that the risks in the forecast are more evenly balanced than they were They are more symmetrical, and that suggests to me that we don't need a change in policy at the moment I continue to be concerned about the outlook for inflation Maybe participants in the market are wrong, but it seems to me that the yield curve is telling us something about future prices that we need to take into account The price numbers themselves are somewhat disappointing and we don't know at this point whether we are looking at a temporary blip or whether we are on a trajectory toward a higher level of prices So, I think as we approach the policy discussion we should move very, very cautiously Thank you "
1446,1992-05-19," Mr Chairman, this is in a sense a procedural question As I read the Bluebook and the projections for the monetary aggregates, particularly the alternatives, the time frame is from March and April to June I wonder if we wouldn't be better served in the policymaking decision to have a longer time frame extending beyond June for those projections We're practically at June now I assume you have those [longer-term] projections, and it seems to me that it would be better to have a projection out perhaps to the fourth quarter   Yes, I realize this is the way it has been done for a long time   I would support alternative B with a symmetric directive "
1498,1992-08-18," Well, Mr Chairman, I've heard the rationale of disorderly markets [as the reason for intervention], but I feel constrained to say that I was extremely surprised at this intervention, particularly the second and the third [operations] Of course, I would respect the judgment of the Desk and Bill with regard to whether the markets were in fact disorderly But we've had extensive discussions over the last year or so in the Committee about the effectiveness of sterilized intervention, and I thought it was the sense of this group that, unless we were going to follow intervention with some kind of substantive monetary policy move, intervention was not the policy of the Committee I haven't been clear, Bill, whether or not this might have been instigated by the Treasury, but from your remarks I gathered that that was not entirely so What really compounds the problem with respect to our credibility is having intervention and then having that followed by the Secretary's statement that he's looking for lower interest rates That to me made us look extremely silly, to put it mildly So, Mr Chairman, I'm just confused as to what the policy of the Committee is And I guess I'd be interested in knowing what really constitutes a disorderly market in the minds of the Desk I didn't think hitting a postwar low or coming close to a postwar low with respect to the mark constituted a disorderly market, but maybe there are factors that I'm not aware of "
1499,1992-08-18," Thank you, Mr Chairman We've seen some slowing in the already modest pace of recovery in the Southeast, and the anecdotal information has become even less encouraging in recent weeks than it had been The litany of bad news would go something like this Consumer spending was not as strong in July as in previous months and auto sales in particular, which had shown some improvement, have been quite mixed in the last several weeks; manufacturers are reporting that both production and shipment levels have plateaued recently and fewer firms are reporting increases in new orders and shipments; and bank lending is very weak, and [the explanation] is on the demand side basically Incidentally, on David Mullins's question related to mortgage financing, the anecdotal information available to me would suggest that while there has been a great spurt in refinancing in the Sixth District, very little of that is going into new home purchases Growth in home sales and building has decelerated, as I've just indicated Multi-family and commercial construction remain pretty grim; they're in the doldrums One bright spot--and perhaps it's the only one in the District--is that business travel and tourism are up; that's basically in response to the airfare price wars But that, of course, is coming at great expense to the airlines, which are a significant employer in the District Foreign travel continues to be pretty good, too, as a result of the lower dollar  So, in general, a slowdown appears to be in train in the Sixth District While some optimism was evident just a few months ago, attitudes about the future have become quite negative or, to use the words somebody else just used, quite grim Business people are seeing growing evidence of caution among consumers And among consumers, there's a belief that the ongoing wave of consolidations and cost-cutting will lead to further layoffs even in industries that had been perceived to be recession-proof So, in this environment very little business expansion is being planned in the region  With respect to the national economy, like many others, we too have lowered our forecast for GDP for 1992 We do see a little stronger near-term growth than the Greenbook but not the acceleration that the Greenbook has for 1993 Our estimate of unemployment is around 7 percent at the end of next year; and consistent with that outlook, we've lowered our inflation numbers as well On balance, it seems to me the risks to the forecast are now skewed to the down side There is a lack of confidence out there and it goes beyond the political uncertainties; and that can further restrain consumer spending in the future On the export side, perhaps we're getting some help from the weaker dollar, but growth among our major trading partners could fall short of the forecast given the policies that some of our trading partners appear to be committed to  Since we have lowered our forecasts for both real GDP and inflation, it seems to me that perhaps it's time for us to reconsider our policy as well To be sure, there is a lot of stimulus in the system, measured by almost every measure except M2 But we've seen  -19-    8/18/92  over the past year or longer that it is taking more easing than we had expected to achieve any results So, I'm of the opinion, Mr Chairman, that we should at least be open to considering a move toward ease The excess supplies of resources at this point make me doubt that a significant acceleration in growth would lead quickly to increased inflation Having said that about moving toward ease, I also recognize that this probably is not the week to do it "
1500,1992-08-18," Well, Mr Chairman, I'm going to be even a little more lonesome than Dr LaWare I think your arguments are very persuasive for staying where we are However, it does seem to me that we've had considerable slippage in economic activity from the first quarter I see very few signs or areas of strength that will give us any forward momentum here I ask myself the question, first of all What good would easing do at this point? It's questionable I suppose But on the other hand, it may help, and I don't see any substantial risks; in fact, I see very little risk in moving So, I would prefer to make a move now  -41-    8/18/92   Well, we still have 2 percentage points to 0   We may need it Well, I think I would prefer to shoot the bullet now with alternative A "
1551,1992-10-06," Thank you Ted Truman already answered my question, Mr Chairman   Mr Chairman, leaving aside the effects of Hurricane Andrew, conditions in the Sixth District appear to have stabilized in the last six weeks or so That, of course, represents a change in our situation because, as you remember, I've been reporting for some time that we've had considerable deterioration in economic activity in the first half of the year, particularly on the employment side I hasten to add that the improvements that we're seeing are very marginal in nature, although I would say that the outlook does seem a little better because the imbalances in our local economy are not quite as evident as they were at the beginning of the year  Looking at some particular sectors, residential real estate is expanding modestly and we're getting reports from realtors in several cities that they experienced higher sales of single-family houses in September Rents appear to be firming in the District, although multifamily and commercial building rents are flat Construction of industrial facilities is rising, basically because, interestingly, the vacancy rate in the industrial sector in our city is below that of the national market We recently completed a survey of manufacturing plants and that survey shows some improvement in August, with more respondents reporting gains in production as well as in shipments compared to July and compared to a year earlier On the other hand, the survey does show some softness in capital spending and expenditures; they are going to be confined apparently to productivity enhancements as opposed to plant expansion or expenditures on equipment Our unemployment rate continues to be above the national average In terms of individual states, Florida has been hit pretty hard, of course, not only by the hurricane but by defense cutbacks and very slow in-migration Louisiana and Mississippi are being impacted adversely by weakness in the energy sector Despite this poor employment situation, retail sales have increased modestly but I guess the [operative] word there is ""modestly"" We, too, Governor Lindsey, are seeing sharp increases in the number of foreign visitors to the District; that has been going on for some time but has accelerated with the weakness in the dollar However, the recent hurricane in Florida has caused tourism to be off there not only in the impacted area but throughout the state as well We see bookings off, for example, in Orlando where the hurricane didn't hit As we noted in our special report on the hurricane, the District will at least temporarily be a beneficiary of the hurricane in the near term because of the concentration of industries throughout the District that are related to housing and construction Finally, we see no inflationary pressures and no price pressures at all in the District  Looking at the national economy, like the Board staff, we've lowered our forecast of real GDP over the balance of this year and into 1993, although perhaps not by quite as much as the Board staff On inflation we're pretty much the same in the near term So, basically we're comfortable with the staff's forecast, although I  -24-    10/6/92  don't feel very comfortable about any forecast these days and haven't for some time It's difficult for me to see sources of improvement in the economy anywhere in the near term The outlook for growth abroad has deteriorated steadily and certainly it's not being helped by the volatility in the foreign exchange markets and the recessionary trends in the economies of many of our trading partners Of course, as we have talked about several times, we are seeing the restructuring of balance sheets both on the part of households and corporations, but it seems to me we have a long way to go A continuation of that process is going to temper spending for some time longer, I think From people that I talk with and from what I'm observing in the press, people are very concerned and very pessimistic about the state of the federal budget deficit I think they are expecting tax increases to deal with that situation and that, too, is going to crimp incomes in the 1990s and beyond and certainly crimp spending When I put all of that together, Mr Chairman, it seems to me that the risk is very much on the down side; and we need to take that into account as we deal with monetary policy  While I have the floor, if I could go back to the hurricane for just a minute--though this is really a non-FOMC matter--I'd just very quickly like to say what I've already written to most if not all of you The people in Miami and certainly we in the District appreciate tremendously the wonderful outpouring of support of all kinds that came from around the Federal Reserve System If ever the family spirit of the System was evident, it certainly was in this period So, we thank you very much   As I was reflecting on the policy stance for this meeting last night, I thought about what I have been doing over the last three weeks and I came to the conclusion that I have been sitting in front of a screen becoming increasingly depressed almost on    10/6/92  a daily basis, perhaps even on an hourly basis, by the negative numbers that were coming in Not all of them were negative, of course, but even going back to August we had a low number for employment and industrial production Orders are down, confidence is down Exports, which had been a minor engine of growth, are off M2 is improving a little All of this led me to conclude that what we ought to do is to ease policy now As other people have said, easing policy--lowering interest rates--has helped the economy And I think additional ease would help in this particular situation I'm not sure that we're not on the edge of a downward, cumulative, spiral here It may not be upon us at this exact moment, but the potential is there So, I think we need to ease But having said that, the case you made for waiting is certainly a reasonable one; and certainly we have offsetting considerations in the international exchange market So, I would support your strong asymmetric-toward-ease directive "
1598,1992-11-17," I think we've got to preserve the deliberative nature of this body and if Governor Phillips is suggesting that we open the question of [our being subject to the] Government in the Sunshine Act, I would certainly not support that I would not be opposed to a memorandum of discussion [released] with a lag of three or four years, or something like that Nor would I be opposed to a more timely release even of the directive and the policy record But there's a more fundamental issue here that we need to be careful about We're having this discussion, it seems to me, because of one Congressman Mr Gonzalez has precipitated this in a letter to the presidents and a letter to the Chairman about videotaping Now, I realize that we have Messrs Hamilton and Dorgan and people like that [also interested in these issues] but I think we have to be very careful that we don't change the institutional nature of this body simply to accommodate a Congressman He represents San Antonio; he doesn't represent [all the] people of the United States I don't think whatever we do [in response to] Mr Gonzalez is going to satisfy him, whether we say we're going to give him a memorandum of discussion or an earlier release of the policy record He wants to politicize the Federal Reserve And I'm glad we're not on videotape at this moment when I'm saying that! So, I think we really ought to resist responding to him Now, I realize he's the chairman of the committee and if it looks as if he's gaining support, then of course we have to  -61-    11/17/92  try to be more offensive--in both senses of that term!--and try to fashion any legislation that we think might come along But if he doesn't have support We don't know what is going to happen in the new Congress Is he going to have this kind of support?  Also, I happen to think that we are accountable We probably disclose more than other central banks, and I think we can defend what we're doing right now I don't think we ought to be in a position at this moment of taking some kind of preemptive strike just to get something from Mr Gonzalez If the Congress wants to pass legislation, that's fine; but I don't think we ought to change on the basis of one Congressman And I might just add that I think it goes beyond this issue; it goes to other issues as well   No, I'm not suggesting that "
1599,1992-11-17," Thank you, Mr Chairman In the Sixth District we continue to see signs of improvement in economic activity but the pace is still very, very slow We did a recent survey of manufacturing plants for October and that showed a leveling off of activity from the third quarter, but the respondents were optimistic about their prospects for the near term at least In the housing sector, single-family home sales and construction remain fairly healthy Multifamily activity, on the other hand, was still pretty poor but it does seem to have bottomed out during the summer This also seems to be true for commercial construction, although the vacancy rates in the District are quite high; they are above the national average and considerably above in some of our key cities Retail sales have improved and retailers are optimistic about holiday sales However, because they placed their orders some months ago when they were in a more cautious mood, their inventories are quite lean, and it appears that discounts and promotions will probably be less a factor this year than they were in recent years Output of goods and services has been expanding but employment growth is low The unemployment rate is at its highest level in six years in the District, and major firms continue to announce layoffs For example, Bell South announced 5,000 layoffs, I think This, of course, is increasing uneasiness in the labor market generally We continue to see better demand for goods related to housing and construction materials in light of the national level of activity but also because of the rebuilding going on as a result of hurricane Andrew In connection with the hurricane I might add that insurance companies have raised their estimates of losses; and five insurers who represent about 60,000 policyholders in Florida have failed as a result of the hurricane That's the situation in the District, Mr Chairman; it's somewhat better than last time but still proceeding at a very slow pace    11/17/92  With respect to the national outlook, our forecast is very similar to the one shown in the Greenbook The profile over the next several quarters is somewhat different, but we come out in the same place The only other difference is a marginal one in that our inflation forecast is perhaps a little higher than the Greenbook's But it's a forecast that we would generally agree with and, especially with respect to 1994, I hope we can reach it "
1600,1992-11-17," With respect to the long-term ranges, given the forecast for M2 and velocity that we have, I think there probably is a good case to be made for lowering the ranges My preference would be not to be so dramatic as to go a full percentage point but rather a half point [on the M2 range]; that would mean a lower bound of 2 percent The timing issue is of much greater moment to me I agree with you, Mr Chairman, that it is a technical matter; in fact, I would add that it's probably as much a political matter as a technical one And I think it would be very difficult at this time to get the market to understand what the technical issue is Moreover, in my judgment, it would be sending a signal that the Federal Reserve is going to be tolerant of monetary growth insufficient to support continued momentum in the economy Now, the offset to that, of course, is that we might attempt to lower inflationary expectations I really don't find the case very persuasive to deviate from our normal procedure, and [I'd] wait until February The other advantage of [waiting] is that we wouldn't be sending a signal at this point We're still in a period of uncertainty with respect to the economy And even with the Feinman-Porter study, there is the chance that we might learn more about the monetary aggregates over the next two or three months So, I think we would be better served by waiting and taking action at that time  With respect to short-term policy, I think [economic conditions] have improved Certainly, I see it in my District; and listening to the comments around the table, there is a much more optimistic view than before But in my judgment, notwithstanding the fact that I haven't changed my forecast or I don't deviate very much from the Greenbook's forecast, the risks are on the down side I say that primarily because of the international situation--the risks that you and others have pointed to with respect to the situation in Europe and Japan, which is fraught with some danger for us For that reason, I would like to suggest that there be no change in policy at this point but that we have an asymmetric directive so that we can move in case that becomes necessary for international reasons or perhaps for domestic reasons as well, because I'm not convinced that what we've  -32-    11/17/92  seen recently is sufficient to cause us to claim that we're on the road to complete recovery "
1663,1992-12-22," Mr Chairman, I'm happy to say that the outlook for the Sixth District looks much more positive than it has for some time, and the improvement that we're seeing seems to be pretty much across the board The Christmas surge in retail sales looks quite promising; it looks to us as if the South may very well lead the nation in this area Spending is the highest in four years and is broadly based Home furnishings and durables in particular are generally quite strong Retail sales are beginning to spill over into manufacturing Inventories were quite light at the beginning of the season and now manufacturers and transporters are reporting unusually heavy activity for this late in the season Both home furnishings and white sales have a disproportionate representation in regional manufacturing and employment [growth] as a result The pickup in housing nationally is seen as well in the District; the building associated with Hurricane Andrew is helping the Sixth District Our survey of manufacturing plants was also more positive this time That survey suggests that capital goods orders are likely to increase over the next six months Moreover, more than 40 percent of the respondents expect to add workers over the next six months as compared to about one-third last month The anecdotal information that we're getting from a variety of sources suggests that consumer and business confidence has shifted noticeably since our last meeting We've pretty much stopped hearing negative remarks even from our small business advisory council members, and we are now confronted by what seem to be overly optimistic expectations--most frequently reported by retailers So, I think the pendulum has swung from perhaps overly negative to perhaps overly optimistic The inflation news continues to be relatively good in the District  To be sure, there are some negatives to report, although I don't think they are likely to tip the balance the other way In particular, on the employment side, just when we thought we had seen the end of the consolidation and cost cutting, we are now hearing of new layoffs and cutbacks, particularly by Delta Airlines, which obviously is a major employer in our District Many of our state governments are doing better than they had been, but Louisiana and Florida still face financial pressures Finally, the energy sector is still in very poor shape, and that affects the Gulf areas particularly But clearly, as I said at the outset, the situation looks much better than it did even at the last meeting, and the outlook seems encouraging    12/22/92  Looking at the national economy, over the entire forecast horizon our forecast is very similar to the Greenbook although we have growth [turning up] a little sooner Both consumer and business spending on durables is higher in the Greenbook forecast than in ours And the Greenbook sees relatively more of these durables consisting of imports than we do; as a result we have a less negative outlook for net exports even though the export growth rates are fairly close We have a lower unemployment rate throughout the forecast A difference that I've been reporting for some time is in the inflation numbers, where our forecast for inflation remains somewhat higher and is probably closer to the Blue Chip forecast When I put all of this together, it does seem to me that the expansion has greater possibilities for being sustained this time around, and I think the risks to the economy are more symmetrical than they have been for some time "
1664,1992-12-22," I think ""B"" symmetric is the appropriate policy for the moment But as we sit in the middle of that directive, I think we have to be very careful to look at both sides of the equation as it were and not give in to the euphoria that I sense is out there among people On the other hand, we also need to be very vigilant about the price situation and be prepared to move in the other direction if that becomes necessary That, it seems to me, is the challenge that faces us at the moment But ""B"" symmetric is fine with me "
1716,1993-03-23," David and Mr Chairman, I have a comment and a few questions The comment is perhaps minor in nature, but it seems to me that someone on the Hill might very well question the use of the term ""Minutes of the FOMC"" because what we're really doing is combining two documents That may or may not be a problem, but I just throw that out for consideration and discussion The question I have is whether you talked about the timing of the release in your group and whether you plan to accompany this with a press release or some explanation of what the change is   I agree with that I just wanted to make sure we focus on the fact that some of our critics might, and I use the word ""might,"" allege that we've tried to get away with something here by just combining two documents and calling them minutes "
1717,1993-03-23," Mr Chairman, the recovery in the Sixth District continues to be moderate and I would say that it's probably maturing The District is exceeding the national pace of activity For example, we see employment growth at about 2-1/2 percent in 1993; that's about twice the pace that we had last year, although it's well below the rates of growth we had in the 1980s Retail sales have been fairly strong in the District so far this year, even after we factor out the impacts of Hurricane Andrew There is increased consumer spending for a wide [range] of goods, although auto sales have been somewhat mixed in the last two or three months Single-family housing did well in the opening months of 1993 but again we expect weaker gains compared to 1992 Nonresidential construction is slowly turning around, and I think that's in contrast to other parts of the country That is due to industrial and retail development primarily As I've said before in other reports, we have certain advantages in manufacturing and other areas but those are beginning to narrow as the year goes along We're seeing this, for example, in slower apparel production It's also showing up in our manufacturing survey for February The percentage of firms that month seeing increases in activity declined a little, although the percent experiencing decreases also fell The 6-month outlook, while still positive, is not quite as bright as a month earlier A major concern in the District now is the effect of military base closings The region has suffered relatively less than others as a result of declines in defense expenditures, but we have a higher proportion of military employment than the rest of the nation On the wage and price side,  -13-    3/23/93  pressures remain generally quiescent throughout the region Labor supplies are still plentiful Factory activity is rising but firms are reporting little change in current or future employment levels; there's just no talk about adding additional employees at this point No significant price pressures for raw materials or finished goods are evident with the exception of construction materials And the spike in lumber prices has [spurred] production and inventory speculation that don't appear to be sustainable I continue to hear from bankers that they are looking for good borrowers--the emphasis being on ""good"" or credit-worthy people--and the evidence is that loan demand is up slightly So, the outlook for the region, Mr Chairman, is relatively good  Looking at the nation, we have changed our forecast very, very little since the last FOMC meeting We think also that the profile in the Greenbook is reasonable, although we would have somewhat more growth and somewhat more inflation, but the differences are marginal Having said that, I think perhaps with the relatively good news we're experiencing that it might be appropriate and prudent at this time to express some concerns for the longer term One that is on my list at least is the deterioration in the outlook for the industrialized nations Those forecasts have been constantly pushed down While there is some expectation, as Mike indicated, that this may turn around in 1993, I think the jury is still out on that with all the political and economic uncertainties overseas, particularly in Japan and western Europe The lack of progress in the GATT negotiations and in the reconciliation of differences in the NAFTA agreement are also causes for concern, especially because a worsening trade situation will undoubtedly give rise to more protectionist sentiment at home, which could have an effect on our recovery And last but not least, it seems to me that the turmoil in Russia and some other foreign activities that are going on are also threats to our economy So, while I think things are good, it would be wise for us to keep our eye on some of these developments, particularly on the external side "
1718,1993-03-23," Mr Chairman, I think it's quite appropriate that several members have raised concerns about inflation in the future After all, that is our responsibility We need to be, in your terms, ""vigilant"" But I think we need to be vigilant on both sides of the equation First of all, it seems to me that the evidence is far from persuasive that we are now in an inflationary cycle or even at the beginning of one Secondly, it also seems to me that this expansion is really quite young; I don't know whether to describe it as being at a tender age or in its adolescence, but there is still a question as to its sustaining quality, although things are certainly looking better So, having said that, it does seem to me that it is premature to make any move at this time I think it would be a serious mistake for the Committee to take action at this time, so my preference is the same as yours--that is, to have alternative B with a symmetric directive I would add that I would prefer the alternative paragraph for the directive to the one we've been using because of the uncertainties surrounding M2 and M3 "
1772,1993-05-18," Mr Chairman, what would be the trigger point for the consultation? Are you going to be waiting for the next PPI and CPI?   Mr Chairman, we're obviously operating in a very difficult environment and within parameters that may be quite different I think I could make an argument for easing on the basis of a decelerating economy just as I could for tightening in the light of the recent inflation numbers Given the amount of pessimism that is out there, given the employment situation and the high level of unemployment--even though it has come down, 7 percent is not a desirable number--a tightening action could well abort the expansion or certainly cause greater deceleration in the economy And I think we have to be as attentive to that as to the inflation numbers Now, it may be that we will have to make a move to counter inflation but before we do that I think we have to be very sure that inflation is really on an upward trend Inflationary expectations may be out there, but I certainly haven't heard anybody in our area of the country telling me that they're concerned about inflation Maybe they should be, but there isn't any concern about it I agree entirely with Governor Angell that monetary policy can harm the economy If we were to make a premature move, we could harm the economy; and I think we ought not to be doing that Again, these inflation numbers may be temporary They may not be but they could be, and I think we have to be very careful before we overreact to the inflation numbers So, I would not be in favor of any move at this time and I agree with your prescription in that regard  On symmetric versus asymmetric, in light of my views on the economy, I think we ought to have a symmetric directive The down side of having an asymmetric one is exactly as Ed Boehne described We could be viewed as overreacting to the inflation numbers if in fact they get better So, I hope if we have to take action that we do it very, very deliberatively in light of real information about a trend in the inflationary situation "
1819,1993-08-17," Gretchen, do you think the French are really serious about this imposition of exchange controls or is it just a public relations ploy to try to frighten the speculators? If they were to do this, it would seem to me to be another blow toward-- "
1820,1993-08-17," Well, I think my report will be a little happier than Bob Parry's, Mr Chairman   Except for Nevada! Having said that, though, growth in the Sixth District is continuing to decelerate Our expansion is still leading the nation but we anticipate that the margin will narrow, with the possible exception of Georgia We're estimating that at the end of July the unemployment rate for the District was just under 6 percent; but at the same time our survey of manufacturing plants in the District suggests that little or no growth in employment is likely to occur over the next six months In fact, the survey actually shows a decline, but we think there are some seasonal factors in there But the clear message is that manufacturers just are not looking to add employees at all The survey also suggests that production was weak in July even after taking account of what likely were seasonal declines in activity  The areas of strength that we're continuing to see in the Sixth District have been in retail sales, particularly in durables, and in new orders for exports, although exports are not a major part of our District output mix The strength in durables comes basically from good activity in single-family housing While the pace of sales flattened in some areas in July, it was well ahead of healthy year-ago levels The inventories of unsold new homes have been shrinking so new building has been quite brisk The inventory situation has caused resales to do better and contract prices have started to rise in several places around the District The multifamily sector is still stalled, but there has been some improvement in absorption  Just to tick off a couple of particular areas of activity in the District, the Atlanta metro area is now beginning to see the first effects of the upcoming Olympics The contracts for a couple of venues have now been let and some of the construction will begin soon Also, office space absorption in the first half of this year was twice as high as [observers] had expected Facilities and infra-structure building are continuing to add to employment  On the negative side, base closings in Florida, which is our most populous state, continue to exert a negative pull on that state's economy The pressures on state budgets are moderating, but this is largely due to special factors, particularly gambling [activity] Gambling is adding significantly to the coffers in Mississippi And as you may have read, Georgia has just started a lottery and the lottery ticket sales have been running well ahead of expectations I'm not sure that's the most desirable kind of economic activity to have, but there it is Higher natural gas prices have increased the rig count in Louisiana and they're helping that state considerably Unlike the Midwest we've been experiencing drought; and in many areas in the Southeast that's hurting agriculture, although again that's a relatively small factor in our output mix  So, on balance, conditions are reasonably good as they have been for some time Concerns that I hear basically relate more to the national and international areas than to the District Some of the    8/17/93  uncertainty surrounding the budget process has been removed with the passage of the legislation But there still is a good deal of concern about the health [care] program and the costs that may be coming along in conjunction with that There's also, interestingly, a great deal of concern about the NAFTA legislation--there's a good deal of support for NAFTA in the District--and that there may be some difficulty with passage in the Congress  Looking at the national picture, our outlook for 1993 is the same as the Greenbook's But we do see stronger real GDP and employment growth in 1994 We're estimating that business will start to add labor in the months ahead as some of these public policy uncertainties unwind and current staffing levels become too tight I think that's got to be a gambling type of forecast because we certainly don't hear very much about employment gains But the view of our staff is that there's going to come a point when business will simply not be able to continue with present levels of temporary employees and overtime We have pretty much the same outlook for inflation on average, though upward pressures begin to emerge near the end of the forecast horizon It seems clear to me that many of the fundamentals are in place for a continuation of the expansion And that will take up some of the slack in the economy and perhaps move the expansion above potential at least for a while  I think, though, that there are uncertainties surrounding the outlook On the positive side, I certainly feel a little more comfortable about the European situation I think their recovery will occur a little sooner than we had expected Also, the recent declines in long-term interest rates will certainly be beneficial On the negative side, we have the continuing uncertainties surrounding consumer and business attitudes growing out of the health care program and perhaps continuing contentious debate about the budget But the major concern that I hear relating to uncertainty is that federal spending may not be cut as much as had been hoped and that the initiatives will end up being funded by indirect taxes on business payrolls It's difficult to assess the net impact of all these factors, but I am a little concerned--or maybe more than a little concerned--that the forecast for real GDP this year has fallen by almost a full percentage point since our March meeting And the Board staff estimate for 1994 has now been reduced by an additional 1/2 percentage point since then So, in conclusion, I'm concerned that the risks to the forecast are that growth will remain sluggish for longer than we anticipate and that unemployment will continue to be at unacceptably high levels Thank you "
1821,1993-08-17," I was going to say this later but perhaps now is the point to interject [my comment], given what has been touched on here What is the purpose of the directive? In its narrowest sense we just heard that it is viewed by the market, and I think by some of us, as the [pre]disposition of the Committee to move within the intermeeting period If there's no likelihood that we're planning to move one way or the other, the logic would suggest to me that the directive should be symmetric If there is a different message to be conveyed by the directive--that in the longer term, beyond the intermeeting period, we're suggesting to the markets that the next move will probably be a move one way or the other--then an asymmetric directive I think is appropriate If there's still a further longer- term message to be conveyed by the directive--that is, that the central bank is committed to price stability--then we should always have an asymmetric directive in favor of tightening   Before we decide on whether we're going to have a symmetric or an asymmetric directive, it might be interesting to focus on what really is the purpose of [the reference to symmetry or asymmetry in] the directive Again, in that narrow sense, which is how the market interprets it, it conveys what it is likely that we will do between now and September 21st If that's the real interpretation, then it should be symmetric it seems to me   Mr Chairman, I agree with your formulation for policy, particularly the symmetric part, because I believe as do others that this is something that should be viewed as what likely will happen during the intermeeting period So, I'm for alternative ""B"" symmetric "
1874,1993-09-21," Thank you, Mr Chairman Well, for the last several meetings I have been reporting that economic activity in the Sixth District has been outperforming the rest of the country That is no longer the case because we are now seeing some deceleration in economic activity, and there now is a convergence of the District and national economies As I've said earlier, our performance during this expansion has been based mainly on housing-related activity; and as the housing cycle matures, the stimulus is tapering off Retail sales have also been quite disappointing in the District, and that's across the board, even though we've had a continuation of rebuilding from the hurricane and that's still positive But retailers now are reporting poor sales at the end of the summer, and they're very cautious in their orders for the holiday season On the other hand, auto sales have been quite good; the only constraint really to auto sales has been the lack of supply Inventories have been low due to the fact that the 1994 models have been late in arriving and most of the dealers are sold out of 1993 cars So, auto sales would have been better if the supply had been greater  Tourism and business travel in the District remain quite strong, and Atlanta is doing especially well Our hotel bookings and air travel are at their highest level in three or four years Florida, obviously, is very concerned about the tourism industry due to the tragic events that have occurred not only during the past couple of weeks with respect to foreign tourists but throughout the year And since this is a $60 billion industry in the state, I think that concern is quite well placed It goes beyond tourism actually, because there is concern in light of the adverse press reports that this will affect relocations both of businesses and retirees  Factory activity was mixed as the summer drew to a close There has been some seasonal increase but nondurables and consumer paper products are quite soft And manufacturers indicate that consumer demand has been quite sluggish Real estate activity also is mixed The residential side has been quite healthy In the single- family sector we're seeing more building of spec houses than we had earlier The multifamily sector remains in the doldrums and commercial construction is still soft, although we do notice in many of the cities of the Southeast, particularly Atlanta, that there is some absorption of space But at the same time the lease rates are pretty low and that's not encouraging any speculative building The employers that we talk to around the District report no upward  -12-    9/23/93  pressure on wages, although there is concern about benefits and, of course, about the health care program Prices of raw materials and finished products are steady, although lumber prices have started to rise again In the energy sector, we've had some increase in the rig count, which is good for the economy of Louisiana On the agricultural side, the drought has been quite severe in the Southeast although not quite as bad in our District, I think, as in the Fifth District There has been an estimated loss of about $230 million; that's basically affecting the corn, tobacco, and peanut crops  We had a meeting of our Small Business and Agriculture Advisory Council last week and the small business people continue to complain, rather bitterly I might say, about the lack of credit availability They now say they are not even talking to their banks anymore but are trying to use nonbank sources of funds, including their own internal fund development The farmers, on the other hand, say the banks are quite aggressive in trying to get agricultural loans, so they're not having any trouble at all in finding credit  Finally, with respect to the District, I've been quite interested and surprised that NAFTA seems to be a greater source of conversation among people that I've talked to than the health program And, unfortunately, while there seems to be support in many quarters, the sentiment at the moment is that NAFTA is not going to pass, for what that's worth  Turning to the national economy, our forecast in the near term is very close to that of the Greenbook We do see greater growth in the middle to the latter part of 1994 and our inflation forecast is a little higher That increased growth in our forecast is predicated almost entirely on our assumption that hours worked and overtime can't continue at this level and that at some point employers are going to have to take on additional workers While that's in the forecast, I think employers are still at this point very reluctant to take on additional people; and where they are adding workers at all, they are temporary workers for the most part If we get the Greenbook forecast, which is a bit lower than ours in 1994, I think that would not be a bad result I think at this point we're in the fortunate position of perhaps being able to sit back and wait to see what data come in a little later Thank you "

1924,1993-11-16," Well, most of my questions have been answered because I wanted to ask about this Congressional situation But let me just follow up with one other Is it the judgment of the staff that a subpoena would issue from the Committee in this situation? In other words, do you think Mr Gonzalez will be successful in persuading the other members to issue a subpoena?   Mr Chairman, I think it's very important as we have this discussion to keep in mind what you've already indicated and that is that the thrust of what we're talking about today is the ability of this Committee to formulate and implement monetary policy That is an activity under the law that has been delegated to us by the Congress and if we were to fail in any way to keep the deliberative process and, therefore, impede our ability to make monetary policy we would be failing very, very severely in our responsibilities under the law and to the public Congress did not delegate this authority to an individual member of Congress And, if I might say, in my experience in the Federal Reserve System, I think one of the mistakes that we have made has been being far too forthcoming and far too amenable on the whole to satisfying the particular requests of individual Congressmen I certainly understand the political necessity to do that at times, but when essential issues are involved I think our responsibility is to the Congress and to the duly delegated committees of the Congress and not to individual members But having said that, if whatever the decision turns out to be is not satisfactory to [members of] the public, I think we ought to endure the defense, if we can, of a FOIA suit and take that on And we ought also to take our case to the Committee and to the Congress generally and to the public In other words, whatever we decide, we ought to draw a line in the sand and not go beyond that if we possibly can  On the particulars of the proposal, I think the lightly edited version of the transcripts going back with a five-year lag is quite appropriate and I would support that I don't think it's necessary to have an MOD And going forward, I have favored an MOD in the past and I so indicated that to Chairman Gonzalez in at least one letter I think they do have value And while there are some difficulties in terms of resources in preparing those MODs, I think it would be appropriate to do that I'm not sure that a three-year lag is really long enough; my preference would be for a five-year lag And, if I'm not mistaken, I believe that was the lag with the previous MODs, so I think we do have some precedent to rely on  -27-    11/16/93   My first choice is lightly edited transcripts without annotation and my second choice is raw transcripts with annotation   Yes   Five and three   MOD first; edited transcript second   That's what we're responding to We're responding to the request in his letter We've taken care of that If I may, Mr Chairman, I'd just like to say that while there is some advantage, obviously, to moving forward, it seems to me that it would be very dangerous to do so, given the differences of understanding as to what we're talking about and the differences of opinion I think we would be even more disadvantaged if we moved forward with a vote in that kind of environment We're talking about the future meetings of the FOMC; we need to be very, very clear about what we're talking about And it's in that connection that I'd like to support what Governor Phillips said Whether we have a special meeting or not, we need to have some kind of staff document that clarifies exactly--   That's what I was voting on "
1925,1993-11-16," Mike, if I read the Greenbook correctly, you're anticipating a tightening of policy later in 1994 I was a little confused or baffled by that in light of the deceleration of GDP, a relatively high unemployment rate, and a deceleration of inflation Could you comment on that?  -67-    11/16/93   Well, Mr Chairman, economic activity in our District is picking up again I've been reporting for the last couple of meetings that we were doing a little better than the rest of the  -72-    11/16/93  nation but that the differential was declining That seems to have turned around again Momentum is picking up What's interesting to me is that the sentiment among business people is much more positive than it has been It had been cautiously optimistic for some time but almost universally the business people that I talk to are fairly positive about the outlook While they complain bitterly about competition and not being able to get prices increases, their own businesses seem to be doing pretty well And I think that sentiment is supported by the economic data Consumer spending, for example, has been quite good The apparel people have been increasing their sales, and production has gone up Automobile sales fell off a bit in the summer but they're still well above the pace that we saw at this time last year And retailers generally, not just the automobile people, are expecting a fairly positive Christmas season The number that I hear most commonly is sales [increases of] between 3 and 5 percent over last year We continue to benefit from the strength in housing Residential construction is quite strong in the District and all the industries associated with housing are continuing to do well because of housing Commercial truck production is also up in the District, responding to order backlogs Producers of medical equipment and supplies are also reporting increased shipments Vacancy rates have been declining all year but I think there is now a concern on the part of realtors that consolidation is going to reverse that course and that absorptions will not continue at the rate they had been running We're also seeing on the negative side some cutback in paper producers' production and weak demand from foreign markets both in that industry as well as in the chemical industry, particularly in Louisiana Our employment growth is continuing to outpace that of the nation, and we have no signs of price increases at all or of wage pressures Prices of raw materials are pretty much what they were, although we have had reports recently about increases in lumber prices which we thought were going to be temporary but that temporary period seems to be stretching out a little Loan demand is still fairly weak in the District but it is picking up a little, particularly in the consumer area So in general the momentum in our economy in the Sixth District is picking up and the signs are quite favorable for 1994  With respect to the national economy, we haven't revised our forecast significantly since the last time However, we do see GDP somewhat stronger than the Greenbook We think GDP growth is going to be a bit over 3 percent on a fourth quarter-over-fourth quarter basis For that reason we see the unemployment rate drifting down just a little more and inflation somewhat higher In fact our inflation number is about 3-1/2 percent for 1994 One of the interesting things here to look at--and the Greenbook does allude to this--is what's going to happen to consumer spending With the workweek and hours worked moving up, it's a question as to how long employers are going to be able to maintain this level of employment So I think there is a possibility that employment will increase and, therefore, income and consumer spending The other thing that's interesting to me is the question of whether or not income growth is being underestimated due to the number of self-employed people and small business formations that are occurring If these people are not being captured [in the surveys] and if income growth is actually stronger than the numbers reveal, then consumer spending could be fairly ebullient On the other hand, if one charted [unintelligible], the jury is out on that score, so there is a possibility that consumer spending might not be  -73-    11/16/93  as strong as our forecast has it Another risk to the economy and to the forecast, it seems to me, is the external sector We all know that the projected recovery of the European economies has been repeatedly put off until later in 1994 and that represents a risk to the economy But generally speaking I think things are relatively on track "
1926,1993-11-16," ""B"" symmetric "
1991,1993-12-21," Mr Chairman, I suppose there's no question that these other people would be willing to come, is there? I would assume that they will   Well, you said it very well earlier It is very disagreeable and distasteful that we have to go through this--and perhaps this is overstating it--but I think it's almost a necessity that we take this kind of step Look, we're not going to resolve this issue by doing this Mr Gonzalez and his staff are going to keep after us no matter what we do But if we're being accused of being too secretive, and that's around in the country now--we've seen editorials and so on--I think we've got to dispel that to the extent we can More importantly, we--I wasn't on the call, but you and others--have been accused of lying and being engaged in a conspiracy, and that has to be challenged And it seems to me the only real way to do that is to use the best evidence, which is the call itself All the letters that you write or that anybody else writes are not going to convince anybody unless we get the material out which will prove irrefutably, as I understand it, that this did not occur But I think you've made a very meaningful distinction between this kind of meeting or telephone call and a monetary policy decision And I think we can draw the line there I would say, and I think you've said this before, that we can continue to withhold monetary policy deliberations until the Congress chooses to tell us to do otherwise And I mean the whole Congress That's their business and if they want to change the law, so be it But I wouldn't move beyond this to furnish any monetary policy transcripts unless we're forced to by the whole Congress   Did you change your mind? "
1992,1993-12-21," Mr Chairman, economic activity in our District is continuing to move along at a moderate pace and once again we think that we're outperforming the nation Retail sales in the fall were somewhat disappointing but holiday activity has been quite good through mid-December, and it has certainly been a lot better than most retailers had expected The news from our relatively important tourism sector continues to be mixed; as the busy season in Florida approaches there's still substantial concern about the impacts of the unfavorable publicity related to the crime activity a few months ago At the same time in Mississippi money is pouring into the state as a result of all of the gambling activity along the coast and in the Indian reservations, and it's giving rise to employment I'm not certain this is the way to produce economic activity, but that's another issue Business convention bookings are quite healthy in Atlanta In the manufacturing sector the pace of activity was steady in November after posting quite impressive gains in October And the outlook in this area is becoming steadily more positive in terms of orders, production, and employment I think that's particularly evident in the outlook for capital goods, which has brightened as orders have picked up recently and producers have become more positive that the current period of expansion will be extended Now, on the more negative side, continued cutbacks in defense and aerospace as well as the decline in the important apparel sector are muting the enthusiasm a little Single-family homes continue to sell quite well all around the District Even though inventories are being reduced, we don't have reports of [housing] price increases to any great extent, although some people are trying to pass along some of the recent increases in lumber prices But generally speaking, single- family home prices have not moved up very much at all In the nonresidential and the commercial areas there are signs that a slow but steady improvement has begun to take hold and I think in those areas there's a pretty general feeling that the bottom has been reached and the outlook is more positive In the energy sector the rig count in Louisiana has fallen for the last two months although it's well above the level it had been a year ago There is concern among producers of natural gas that lower oil prices will cause some substitution effects And spot gas prices have been marginally, just marginally, above the $2 level that's needed to make new drilling feasible  On balance we continue to see most of the gains in employment in the District in the service area, although as I've indicated there  -13-    12/21/93  are some positive signs in manufacturing as well We see very little evidence of price pressures The anecdotal information supports that idea that price increases are very difficult to obtain even in this more positive atmosphere And the anecdotal information also confirms all of the positive things that I've talked about There is generally a feeling that things are much better Most business contacts I've had, including our directors, indicate that they feel a momentum is in place in the economy Now, when I go to these meetings I'm often asked about policy and I'm also given requests The most frequent request I get now is ""Please leave things the way they are; don't do anything""  With respect to the national economy, we have not changed our forecast since the last meeting We're in general agreement, as I said last time, with the Greenbook for the near-term outlook But when we get into the latter part of 1994 and 1995 we think that growth is going to be somewhat stronger, the inflation rate higher, and the unemployment rate somewhat lower Basically our difference is in the consumer area where we think that employment and increases in wages and salaries are going to help sustain consumption [growth] probably on the order of about 3 percent in that period Now, having said that our forecast is for somewhat higher growth and higher inflation, there are some continued vulnerabilities and risks to that forecast I would cite particularly the international outlook, although as indicated today the situation does appear to be a little better But we may run the risk of seeing some deceleration in the first quarter, and even in the first half of 1994, although I don't think it's going to be as extreme as it was last year "
1993,1993-12-21," Mr Chairman, if I thought that our forecast were correct and were to be fulfilled, I would certainly want to move sooner rather than later I think the probability is that that forecast will turn out to be the right one But there are enough uncertainties surrounding that forecast for me to want to wait just a little longer to make sure that this recovery and expansion are in fact sustainable So I would prefer to wait and I agree with your prescription on that score I also think it's very important, as others have indicated, that at this crucial time--at this turning point, this crossroads--that we take this action at a meeting So I would also prefer a symmetric directive "
2057,1994-03-22," I have two questions, Ted First, is this proposal contingent in any way on Canada's moving? Second, are these conditions, for example the collateral and consultative apparatus, unique to this arrangement or do the other swap agreements have those as well?   But I take it these conditions are satisfactory to the Mexican authorities?   Mr Chairman, I'm not against disclosure but I would repeat what I said last time, which is that we have not really had an opportunity in this Committee to discuss this fully There are a number of issues surrounding this disclosure matter Tom has just brought up one of them; there are others So from a procedural standpoint alone, I think we need an opportunity to discuss this further If we announce it today, I think we're going to be locked into doing it We said the announcement last time wasn't going to be precedential If we do it twice, I think we are going to be locked in  On more substantive grounds, we haven't really taken into account the effect of this disclosure on the discount rate, the effect on our directors There is a whole host of things that I think we really need to take into account in a more systematic way So I would be strongly opposed to doing anything today I think we ought to revert to our normal practice of not disclosing our decision and let the markets pick this up and then deal as soon as we can with this issue together with the other disclosure issues, as Governor Lindsey has indicated "
2058,1994-03-22," I'll jump in first, Mr Chairman In the Atlanta District, economic activity continues to look quite positive Retail sales, for example, have shown very good gains in both February as well as in early March Businesses are reporting increased traffic and the expectation is that the rest of March will be equally good In fact, they are reporting their expectation that the rest of the  -18-    3/22/94  year will continue to be good Home furnishings and durable goods sales continue to be strong year over year, although they are not quite as strong as they were at the end of last year But even with these good sales, businesses are continuing to keep their inventories quite lean Tourism has picked up in the region with central Florida being the beneficiary of most of it, although I would note that we have had record crowds at Mardi Gras this year in New Orleans and that convention activity has been at record levels That's boosting hotel occupancy rates as well as the retail sector And as I've been reporting for several months now, District casino activity continues to grow and the states are the beneficiaries of that as their Treasuries are continuing to grow  Looking at the production area, our manufacturers' survey for February reported increases in production and shipments, but the expectations for six months out were not quite as optimistic as they had been It's only marginally lower Pent-up demand for new cars is stimulating production for automobile suppliers, although I have to report that the Saturn factory near Nashville announced some production cutbacks But I think that's probably more related to that particular line of car than a reflection of cutbacks generally in the automobile sector because, as I've said, the demand for new cars is certainly stimulating production Building products producers say that they are beginning to reach capacity constraints because of strong residential building  In real estate, single-family sales remain quite strong and inventories are very, very tight in many areas Building costs continue to climb, as both building materials prices and wages of subcontractors have increased, although most builders have been able to pass along most of these cost increases In the Gulf of Mexico, the rig count jumped to 132 in February; that's compared to 95 a year ago and 119 at the time of the last FOMC meeting That's actually the highest level in almost two years and it's almost entirely associated with gas production Commercial real estate is also improving but gradually Absorption and occupancy rates are slowly rising And we find that concessions for office space are almost nonexistent now in the District New construction is fairly limited to retail and build- to-suit as well as public works activities In the financial area, commercial loan demand is showing some signs of picking up, and residential mortgage demand continues to fuel the real estate lending And it's not just refinancing, it's actual originations  Employment in the District continues to outpace the national average Wage pressures continue to be evident only in construction, although we are hearing some reports of pressures beginning outside of the construction area Manufacturers are reporting some more price pressures for raw materials, although they are not expecting those price pressures to continue over the next six months The producers of building products and furniture continue to report increasing raw materials and finished goods prices And lumber prices remain quite volatile, with cost-of-lumber adjustments now a common feature of new residential building contracts Retailers didn't report any price pressures from their suppliers and none of the contacts that we talked to plan to raise prices in the near future  In conversations with business people over the last four or five weeks together with reports from our directors, I would say that  -19-    3/22/94  the attitude is quite positive and very bullish throughout the entire District And those who are doing business nationally and internationally are equally bullish about prospects not only for demand but for inflation as well  As we look at the national situation, our forecast for real GDP growth is stronger than the Greenbook's, although as we get further out in the forecast horizon in 1995, it begins to come down closer to the Greenbook forecast The reason for the difference is that we think the momentum that was generated in the fourth quarter, and perhaps a little in this quarter, will take a little longer to play out than the Greenbook assumes Our forecast for inflation is, in spite of that higher growth, a little lower but the CPI in our forecast picks up later in the forecast horizon I think the risks to our forecast are, frankly, on the down side and I tend to look at the Greenbook forecast as representing sort of a lower bound of where we ought to be So both in terms of the District and the nation, I think we are in reasonably in good shape "
2059,1994-03-22," Mr Chairman, as we try to make a policy decision, I suppose all of us to some extent are guided by the forecasts As I look at the Atlanta forecast, I see very rapid growth for 1994, much stronger than the Greenbook, and inflation at the end of 1995 at clearly unacceptable levels But as I said in my opening remarks, I don't think that's the likely outcome I think growth is probably going to come out somewhere between the Greenbook and the Atlanta forecasts But there is some reasonable probability that the Greenbook forecast could materialize And, therefore, some caution is needed in that regard I think gradualism has served us very well on the down side I would also add that I don't view a 1/4 point increase as very insignificant at this level of interest rates; it really means something in the market In my judgment, a gradual approach will create greater stability than otherwise I also am very persuaded by your remarks about the financial markets I remember very well at the last meeting, when there was an expression of interest on the part of some to move 50 basis points, that your language was in effect ""If we do that, we are going to crack the markets"" We did 25 basis points and I think we came very close to cracking the markets Now, I'm not saying that would happen again at 50 basis points, but I think we run that risk and I don't think that's a risk we should take  Therefore, I think the 25 basis points is clearly appropriate in this particular environment The market is expecting something greater over the course of the next several months, so I don't think it's necessary to meet those expectations at this particular point When I came into the meeting, I was more in favor of a symmetric directive and I still would lean in that direction, but I can certainly support asymmetry In sum, I think 25 basis points is the way we should go "
2116,1994-05-17," Peter, I have a variation on Al Broaddus's question As you know, the Europeans have been somewhat concerned about the effect of our actions on their long-term rates Does the market anticipate or do you yourself think that if we were to take an action today that it would have an upward effect on European rates or have their actions sufficiently decoupled their rates from ours? "
2117,1994-05-17," Thank you, Mr Chairman Conditions in the Sixth District are also very, very good and the expansion is pretty broadly based and relatively balanced Let me just tick off some of the sectors of the economy In the retail sector, sales did taper off a little in April although the activity in recent months has exceeded retailers' expectations by a sizable margin Many of them are planning to add to their inventories Auto sales are still quite strong in most parts of the District The interesting thing to me is that the dealers are expecting continuing growth, although at a somewhat more moderate rate, in this area through the rest of this year and into next year Tourism, as I've reported before, is a source of considerable strength in the region There has been a fall- off in European travelers but that's being taken up by domestic travelers and also by people from the Caribbean and Latin America I won't say anything about the casino gambling again because we all know about that I'm going to bet that it will continue!  On the production side, our survey in April for industrial production suggests that there has been some leveling off in output But the expectations for future activity are above those seen at this time last year There was some effect on production from the Teamsters strike, so that cut down activity a little, and suppliers to the automobile sector are running at near capacity in the District Textiles, particularly in the household area and apparel fabrics, also are sources of strength The only weakness on the production side is in defense and aerospace  -17-    5/17/94  On the real estate side, sales of single-family homes remain quite strong throughout the District Many realtors are reporting that the recent increases in mortgage rates have actually spurred buying on the part of people who were sitting on the fence, as it were Inventories of homes remain quite tight in many areas, and realtors are reporting increases in prices as well Builders are reporting strong increases in the number of homes under construction, although speculative activity is practically nonexistent Traffic through the subdivisions is quite heavy, and that's in contrast to the assertion in a letter that I read this morning that you received, Mr Chairman  On the multifamily side, markets continue to improve, too Building permits were up 50 percent over a year ago in the first quarter Nonresidential real estate is also doing better Commercial real estate agents are more positive now about future activity than they have been in a long time On the financial side in the states, budgetary pressures that were in existence a while ago have practically disappeared due to the new growth  On the price side, in contrast to some of the comments I've heard today, we're finding that price pressures are practically nonexistent, with the exception of construction and perhaps a little bit now in textiles Lumber prices have stabilized in the last few months, but the costs of other building materials have increased and we are also seeing some wage pressures for skilled labor in the construction industry Wage pressures are basically fairly quiet in other sectors Retailers are telling us that intense competition is keeping a lid on prices  In the banking sector, I would echo what Tom Hoenig said, in that banking in our District is quite strong; loan demand is up, particularly in the consumer sector So, Mr Chairman, I think that is probably as positive a report as I've been able to make in quite a long time It's hard to find any weaknesses in our area  With respect to the national economy, I must say that I've been impressed by the strength of the data we've gotten since we last met, notwithstanding the lower-than-expected first quarter I had at the last meeting tended to downplay the rather bullish expectations for growth in our forecast, but I've become a little more convinced that the upsurge in the fourth quarter may continue to play out for a little while longer So, our forecast for GDP is somewhat stronger for 1994, fourth quarter over fourth quarter, although we do show a deceleration in 1995 Also, we don't see inflation reaching a peak until 1995 I won't go into the various differences in the forecast and I wouldn't want to make too much of the differences because while our forecast does differ from the Greenbook in the near term, the forecasts converge in 1995 What I think comes out of both of those forecasts as far as I'm concerned is that some additional move in policy as contemplated in the Greenbook probably is needed and in time will cause inflation to moderate Thank you "
2118,1994-05-17," Mr Chairman, as you know, I've been a proponent of gradualism, but I believe we're at the point where we need to take more aggressive actions I think the gradualistic approach may have created some uncertainty in the market I've heard some of the same comments as were reported earlier People have suggested that if we are going to do something, we ought to take strong action So, I'm really supportive of that action I think there is considerable momentum in the economy Our forecast, as I indicated earlier, is for stronger growth than the Greenbook forecast, and even building in 50 basis points we see the inflation numbers in 1995 as unacceptable So, I think that there ought to be a 50 basis point pass-through to the market, and I would prefer a symmetric directive as well "
2170,1994-08-16," Thank you, Mr Chairman Economic activity in the Sixth District is expanding moderately and we continue to out- perform the nation as a whole The contacts that we have had since the last meeting indicate that their businesses really are doing quite well and there is very clearly an attitude of optimism both among the business people and the consumers that we have talked to I think this optimism is borne out and confirmed by the numbers For example, retail sales rebounded in both June and July and they are expected to remain healthy Apparel, which had been weak for awhile, has been especially strong and again is expected to remain so On the other side, sales of durables are beginning to moderate We have not heard of any unexpected inventory buildup in the retail area As a matter of fact, some retailers are telling us that they plan to add to their inventory stock On the manufacturing side, we did have a tapering off over the summer, but this appears to be seasonal in nature The contacts in our survey have indicated some optimism about orders as well as production six months from now Inventories here also appear to be in line with the desires of manufacturers, and several contacts plan increases in their stocks of materials over the next several months In the energy sector we are seeing better activity, particularly in Louisiana The rig count was up from 127 to 136 in the month of May We did have some tapering off also in single-family housing, but this has been affected by unusually wet weather We do think that there will be a continued deceleration in this area We have had some unexpected strength in multifamily housing in the District There has been a lot of in-migration to the Southeast, and rental markets have tightened in many areas and rents are rising On the commercial side, absorption is reducing inventories of space and effective lease costs are moving up Tourism remains a strong point in the local economy  Since the last meeting, Mr Chairman, I've spoken to several groups of business people around the District and there are two themes that seem to emerge from those meetings The first is that most of them are reporting some input price pressures and, for the first time in a long time, I've heard that now to some extent they are able to pass those price increases through The second theme is that they are experiencing labor shortages, not only for skilled people but for semi-skilled and unskilled In our District at least, it's across the board and some firms are actually paying signup bonuses even for unskilled people I thought that only applied to baseball and football players, but in fact clerks are getting them as well! As an aside, their problem with labor is exacerbated by the fact that as many as 50 percent of the applicants fail the drug test that the firms    8/16/94  are giving That is in spite of the fact that the firms have notices up on the premises that they will test for drugs--   This may be unique to our District, I don't know; but certainly it's been reported almost universally among the people that I've talked to It hasn't translated so far into a lot of wage increases, but I'm sure that will come Just a word on the floods The damages from the floods in south Georgia and a few parts of Florida and Alabama appear to be on the order of magnitude of about $750 million, that is about $250 million less than was originally thought The estimate assumes rebuilding and replacing all damaged property and infrastructure but it does not include an allowance for lost business activity Most of the losses were in the agricultural area The flooding, of course, was extensive and it created many hardships for the people involved, but the economic impacts were quite limited because of the sparse populations in the areas affected  With respect to the national economy, I think that things are moving along at a fairly reasonable rate Our forecast hasn't changed very much since the last meeting We continue to differ with the Greenbook on two counts Except for the very near term, we have somewhat stronger growth for the forecast horizon than does the Greenbook And our inflation forecast in line with the GDP forecast is somewhat higher as well We see inflation creeping up by the end of 1995 to the 3-1/2 percent level In general, as I just indicated, Mr Chairman, I'm really quite pleased with the outlook Of course, our forecast also assumes some tightening of policy as well If we can emerge from this current expansion with a somewhat lower cyclical peak in the inflation rate and we can successfully avert a recession, I'd be quite satisfied Thank you "
2171,1994-08-16," Mr Chairman, I think your conclusion about this expansion having life in it is exactly right I certainly agree that all the numbers and the anecdotal information that we have seen and heard this morning would indicate that the momentum is still there As a matter of fact, in our forecast, we built in a 50 to 75 basis point rate increase and we produced a 1995 GDP of 26 percent, which I think is a desirable kind of deceleration in the economy to appropriate levels much nearer to potential On the other side, if we look at what is happening with inflation, what is likely to happen, we have strong consumer demand, strong loan demand, and the economy is very close to capacity We have higher oil prices that are likely to remain at current levels unless Iraq gets back into the picture, a weak dollar, and the beginnings of labor shortages All of these developments, I think, make a very compelling case that we have to move I think the sooner we move the better I certainly support the notion of 50 basis points because, like you, I think 25 basis points really is not going to have the desired effect, and it's going to cause uncertainty in the markets I also am pleased that the Board is considering a discount rate increase because I think the combined policy actions will have very desirable effects So, I'm completely supportive of what you are suggesting "
2222,1994-09-27," Peter, on the memorandum, what kind of increased risks do we incur by moving to a private party and not working with the central bank?    9/27/94 "
2223,1994-09-27," Thank you, Mr Chairman As I have been reporting for several months now, activity in the Atlanta District remains quite healthy and we see that trend continuing in the future We are benefiting not only from the cyclical gains in activity that have been experienced around the country, but also from continued in- migration from other parts of the country On the retail side, the back-to-school sales were mixed, but retailers nonetheless are quite optimistic Many of them are adding to their inventories and they expect strong hcliday sales As a matter of fact, they are looking at nominal sales gains of 6 to 9 percent Automobile dealers are confirming that model shortages constrained sales over the summer, but they are confident that the problem is being solved, and they expect sales to accelerate in the fourth quarter Those constraints, as we know, are basically in the popular models Tourism has been mixed in the District We have had quite a lot of rain and that has contributed to weakness in the central and southern Florida areas, which has been a negative Also, the slowdown in visitors to Florida from Europe has not been completely offset by growth in travel from Latin America and Asia  Manufacturing activity also rebounded in August after a lull in July--that's a seasonal factor The strength is pretty much across the board--in motor vehicles, chemicals, health care, textiles, carpets, and paper The weaknesses are in apparel and military contracts The outlook for capital expenditures is improving; manufacturers in the District actually are adding to capacity and the District continues to attract new facilities from elsewhere On the other hand, weak natural gas prices incrementally pushed down District rig counts and, with the price of natural gas being below $2, that probably will continue On the housing side, we did have a deceleration of sales of single-family homes throughout the District, but prices are moving up nonetheless, and that's in the face of inventory shortages Construction was hampered by the bad weather that I already have mentioned Multifamily markets continue to improve and the occupancy rate is increasing around the District generally Commercial real estate is doing somewhat better, although activity remains at somewhat low levels In financial services, commercial lending demand is stronger than it has been, and it is about offsetting the softness that we are seeing in consumer loans Growth in District payroll employment has been about half a percent higher than in the nation as a whole  On the price front, we are getting reports of rising prices of raw materials This is not something very new; we have been hearing this for a while, but the reports of rising raw materials prices and other input prices are increasing Nevertheless, our contacts are reporting that they are not able to pass these higher costs through to finished goods because of competitive pressures  On the national economy, our forecast continues to be somewhat stronger over the entire forecast horizon than the one shown in the Greenbook, although we too see a deceleration in growth Part of the difference is the assumption about monetary policy We did not build in any additional tightening of rates But I think we also have a difference because of our view of the policy lags in the price  -13-    9/27/94  determination process We have inflation edging higher until at least the middle of 1996, and that's partly due to our estimate that the responses to policy changes made so far will take a little longer to feed through We do see a cyclical peak in the CPI sometime during 1996 Our forecast really incorporates the view that the current pressure on prices is due to aggregate demand growing more quickly than aggregate supply  We believe that our efforts to reduce inflation over time may already have filtered into price- and wage-setting behaviors so that these cyclical pressures are seen as temporary as opposed to a sustained trend toward higher inflation I think the recent behavior of labor costs, after a long period of falling unemployment, provides some support for this position If this is the case, perhaps we can tolerate some small rise in inflation as the business expansion matures It is possible, of course, that wage and price determinations are dominated by institutional features that, as has been discussed, in part involve an inertia to all of these processes If this view is correct, once inflation starts rising and people build higher inflation into their expectations so that it persists indefinitely in the absence of forceful policy action, we have to act in a way that shows an absolute zero tolerance for higher inflation  It seems to me, Mr Chairman, that our policy behavior over the last several years, perhaps going back as far as 15 years, has increased our credibility as inflation fighters From this standpoint, the outlook would strike me as one that we should be pleased with This is a picture, it seems to me, of an economy entering the mature stages of a business expansion and moving toward a peak in its rate of growth with very few imbalances It is an economy where the rate of inflation also rises to a peak, but one that is significantly lower than in previous expansions and that, it seems to me, is quite desirable It is possible that, in this optimistic framework, the structural responses to our past policies may have raised the economy's potential to grow as well I think both of these scenarios, whether you adopt the inertia or the cyclical peak thesis, are reasonable interpretations of recent data, but at this point it strikes me pretty forcefully that it's simply too early to determine whether we should be worried or not Thank you "
2224,1994-09-27," Mr Chairman, since I believe that a blip is a blip is a blip, I would support your recommendation I, too, don't think we're going to need to move in the intermeeting period, but I think it's wise to have the asymmetry as an insurance policy I agree with your proposal "
2281,1994-11-15," Mr Chairman, as I have been reporting for several meetings now, the Southeast economy is sustaining a broad- based expansion, although we have seen a little slowing of growth recently There really hasn't been very much change in the situation in the Sixth District since the last meeting, so I'm not going to repeat a lot of the detail that I have given at the last couple of meetings Let me hit just a couple of highlights  Retail sales rebounded in October after a somewhat lower September Retailers are expecting strong increases, in some cases even record increases, in sales over the holidays According to our latest manufacturing survey, activity was not quite as robust in October, but an increasing proportion of respondents expect production and shipments to be higher six months out Single-family home sales slowed in most of the District last month, dropping below strong levels seen a year ago On the other hand, multifamily real estate markets continue to improve throughout the District, and that has been going on for a while Commercial real estate markets clearly have hit bottom and are beginning to move up We are beginning to hear some reports of speculative building in that sector, particularly in Atlanta Bank loans overall are growing modestly for the first time this year, although I find it interesting that consumer loans are flat in the District Employment growth picked up a little in the third quarter with services, trade, construction, and durables manufacturing showing the best gains More reports of wage and price pressures are coming in than before The wage pressures are concentrated for the most part in a few localities and in a few areas Respondents in our manufacturing survey are reporting pressures on prices of inputs and finished goods, and they are expecting to be able to pass those through later on Again, although retailers have held the line so  -17-    11/15/94  far, prices are expected to increase as new shipments come in after the first of the year  In sum, the situation in the Sixth District is not very different from what it was at the time of the September meeting There is momentum and the expansion is moving along at a quite good and sustainable level  Now with respect to the national economy, I must say that I was quite surprised at the extent of tightening assumed in the Greenbook and the resultant low level of GDP growth for three or four quarters in the range of 1 to 18 percent As President Boehne indicated, I think this is flirting with recession even in the absence of shocks to the economy There is very little margin for error In the short term, our forecast does show the economy starting to decelerate a little sooner than the Greenbook, but in the longer term even though we have some deceleration, we show stronger growth with lower unemployment and a somewhat higher inflation rate I think that it is going to take less tightening than envisioned in the Greenbook to cause inflation in the current expansion to peak at a level that is well below the one that we had in the last cycle Our forecast assumes that a rise in inflation can be viewed as a cyclical phenomenon and not necessarily the start of a trend But that being said, our view is a little more optimistic and it may not be the correct view; it may be unrealistic The risk, in my judgment, is on the up side, and we need to remain vigilant to inflation I think that the cost of underestimating price pressures can be very high Perhaps I've tipped my hand as to what I would want to do, so I won't go any further at this point Thank you, Mr Chairman "
2282,1994-11-15," Mr Chairman, you haven't mentioned the discount rate   I came into the meeting, Mr Chairman, with a slight preference for a 50 basis point rise, but having heard the discussion around the table and your analysis, I am strongly in support of the 75 basis points As I said earlier, I think that the 150 basis point increase suggested in the Greenbook is too much I hope we can keep an open mind on that issue "
2338,1994-12-20," Thank you, Mr Chairman The economy in the Sixth District continues to expand, although the pace of the expansion has decelerated somewhat from the growth rates we saw earlier in the year Consumer spending is holding up quite well We had a rebound in retail sales right after the Thanksgiving holiday that has continued this month, and most retailers are now expecting that they will exceed last year's strong levels by as much as 6 to 8 percent However, they are also reporting that their sales are dependent to a large extent on special promotions and discounts, and that obviously is cutting into their profit margins Big ticket items are selling particularly well Sales of apparel, which had been weak for some  -13-    12/20/94  time, are also seeing strong gains We have had reports starting in November that automobile sales were slowing, and that has continued through the first half of December Tourism remains a very bright spot in the District economy  Manufacturing activity was relatively flat in the Sixth District last month, although most plants expect to see gains over the next six months Producers of lumber and building materials are operating at or near capacity, but several of them have noted that shipments have begun to decelerate The same pattern is showing up in home furnishings and equipment In contrast, activity at producers of paper, pulp, and chemicals rose substantially, and demand for auto parts is also strong Again, the outlook for capital spending was a little less favorable than a month ago  Home sales in the District fell below strong year-ago levels in most areas, although realtors are reporting that they expect a rebound in sales in the spring Multifamily real estate markets continue to improve and rental rates are rising Commercial real estate is also doing relatively well throughout the region, although I find it interesting that some architects report that demand for their services is in decline; that could imply some softening of construction next year With respect to loan demand, bankers say that it's mixed, with increased commercial real estate lending and declining mortgage lending Automobile lending also declined along with sales  Labor markets haven't changed very much in the District since last month We continue to see labor shortages reported in certain areas It's most pronounced in Tennessee and in Atlanta In Atlanta, it's related partly to the Olympics and partly to retailers who are finding it very difficult to get people for the holiday sales period Skilled construction workers are in strong demand everywhere, and wages in that industry are rising sharply  As for prices, about 50 percent of manufacturers indicate that they are still being pressured by the rising costs of raw materials They are noting difficulty again in passing these costs on to final goods  I would just add with respect to Orange County that we haven't seen any fallout in our District from that episode  Now your fence looms rather large in front of me as I turn to the national economy, but let me go at it this way if I may We, too, were surprised by the rapid rate of growth in 1994 and by the relatively low inflationary response to that growth As opposed to the last couple of meetings, we did not run forecasts with an assumption of tightening We did it with constant federal funds this time It's interesting that our GDP forecast through the fourth quarter of 1996 brings the rate of growth in real GDP down to about the 25, 26 percent level throughout that period without any tightening at all The CPI through that period is higher, as you would expect, than the Board's forecast, but it remains at about a 32, 33 percent level throughout 1995 and 1996, with the unemployment rate somewhat below the Greenbook forecast That raises the question in my mind--and I think I raised this last time--whether or not there is something different going on in the economy this time around that  -14-    12/20/94  would suggest that potential growth is higher and the NAIRU is lower But I think the basic question is whether or not there can be greater growth in the economy with less inflation, thereby implying somewhat less tightening than is forecast in the Greenbook "
2339,1994-12-20," Mr Chairman, I think that the case for not moving today is quite persuasive We did move aggressively just a few weeks ago and I think we have moved aggressively throughout the year The cumulative moves are really quite significant We need to remember the lags in monetary policy and give some time for that to work through the pipeline In fact, I am not convinced that any great further degree of tightening is necessary, but I have an open mind on that score Also, as I tried to indicate before, I think there is now greater flexibility in the economy At the risk of belaboring that point, I think there is a plausible argument that would suggest that the economy can support a greater degree of growth at the present time without incurring inflationary pressures Obviously, this is more theory and argument than anything else, and as has been pointed out this morning there is really not very much empirical evidence Some of the things that you cited with respect to the labor market I think are appropriate and relevant here, so the burden of proof obviously is on those who would suggest that this is a plausible theory, and I think there is a risk in using it in terms of policy deliberation However, I do think it is important to keep this in mind as we go forward because if this is in fact the case we run a risk on the other side of seriously overdoing monetary policy actions For the moment,  -38-    12/20/94  I would support your recommendation I would prefer a symmetric directive, but I could support the asymmetric option as well "
2390,1995-03-28," Spoken like a true Hoosier!   Mr Chairman, the economy in the Southeast has continued to expand in the first quarter, although we are seeing some signs of slowing from last year's very strong fourth quarter Employment growth accelerated in January, and preliminary February data suggest both strong employment growth and a further decline in the District unemployment rate We are now forecasting an unemployment rate in the District of 47 percent when we get the final data There are, of course, signs of deceleration as I have indicated, although I don't view any of these as being signs of real weakness in any sense The slowing that we have had is pretty much along the lines of what we have heard from others for the rest of the country Retail sales were quite disappointing to retailers in February, but this was attributable to particularly wet weather, and the early March data point to some recovery Automobile sales have been declining since 1994, and single-family home sales continued to fall through early March and are now below year-ago levels Manufacturing activity as reported in our manufacturing survey softened a bit in February--that is both in terms of production and shipments--and some of this slowing has been attributed to the situation in Mexico But other reports suggest that inventory shortages in several industries are contributing some strength That is especially true in chemicals, paper, and packaging In Tennessee, the auto plants are operating at full capacity as are the packaging and paperboard facilities throughout the District The strongest increases reported to us are in communications equipment  On the inflation side, there has been some abatement of raw materials price increases, and as I have been reporting for several months, where there have been materials price increases, they generally have not been passed through to the intermediate or consumer levels We still are hearing stories of labor shortages and we too have heard of signing bonuses, although not quite the size of that erroneous figure reported by Mike Moskow Wage increases are still pretty spotty around the District  Travel and tourism are quite mixed, with business and convention travel to Florida, New Orleans, and the Gulf Coast of Mississippi especially strong But in general tourism in Florida remains very lackluster Tourism around the major baseball spring camps has been in decline, as you would imagine Traffic to Florida from Latin America, again not unexpectedly, has slowed And European visitors are still scarce, but that is showing some hints of turning around One of our directors from Florida did report that German visitors are not necessarily all tourists because they are buying the high-priced homes in Palm Beach The Germans are moving in very  -26-    3/28/95  aggressively and the $2 million and above houses are now flying the German flag In Atlanta, the Olympics are beginning to have an effect, both in terms of infrastructure and construction for the venues  With respect to the national economy, we see underlying momentum in the economy as still being pretty strong The signs of weakness or deceleration that we do have seem somewhat unpersuasive to me in the face of the resilient fundamentals that seem to exist in the economy That is, employment and income are still quite strong, as Al Broaddus just mentioned New orders have been strong, as has been business fixed investment I am particularly impressed by the plans that I see for more industrial capacity coming on line this year and next Of course, as I have indicated, we do see some moderation, but less than in the Greenbook And our differences with the Greenbook are the same as they were last time That is, we anticipate somewhat stronger growth with somewhat higher inflation We see the inflation rate moving up in 1995 to 35 percent, but expect it to peak at that level  We have had some discussion about the dollar this morning, Mr Chairman, and I thought I would interject just one comment on that subject Although I found Peter's description of the reasons for the dollar decline quite persuasive, I still am not entirely clear in my mind what the real reasons are There are probably many, but I don't think we really know categorically what they are More importantly for us is the question of what impact the lower dollar will have on the economy It seems to me that there may be few tangible repercussions for real activity and prices if the dollar stabilizes around current levels Perhaps this is preaching to the choir to some extent, but I think as a matter of principle we should not be adjusting policy to achieve some particular external value of the dollar In some sense, I believe this is one of the reasons we have a flexible exchange rate The dollar is a signal, although a noisy one, but I don't think it should be a target Thank you "
2391,1995-03-28," Mr Chairman, as I look at the situation, I think that the economy is in relatively good shape Some might take the position that the dollar would argue against that, but generally speaking the economy looks good to me We are getting some of the deceleration that we had anticipated from our earlier policy moves I think policy has been very, very successful It is true that this deceleration may be temporary; nobody is certain as to whether it is going to be permanent or not Under these circumstances there is no question at all in my mind that alternative B is the right alternative to have at this time With respect to symmetry or asymmetry, I don't feel very strongly about it I do think that the risks are fairly well balanced, and so I would have some preference for symmetry I also wonder what we gain by going to an asymmetric directive at this time because if the expansion does not slow down sufficiently between now and May 23, we will probably make the next move then, be it 25 or 50 basis points The minutes for this meeting come out shortly after that meeting, so I don't really know what difference that makes For those reasons, I would support a symmetric directive But if I had a vote, I certainly would not vote against an asymmetric directive "
2445,1995-05-23," Peter, what effect, if any, would you expect the threatened trade sanctions with Japan to have on the foreign exchange markets? "
2446,1995-05-23," Thank you, Mr Chairman Economic activity in the Southeast has been slowing recently to a more sustainable rate of growth Notwithstanding that slower growth, job expansion in the District continues to outpace that for the nation as a whole, although by a somewhat smaller margin than earlier, and the unemployment rate remains below that in the rest of the country Looking at some of the sectors of the economy, retailers are reporting increasing inventories and slowing sales for both April and early May Auto purchases in particular were weaker than a year ago, but they seem to be stabilizing now rather than continuing to decline Tourism is starting to rebound with the return of European visitors to Florida and business travel has continued strong throughout the region  -12-    5/23/95  The reports we are getting on manufacturing are mixed Production and shipments slowed in April, but new orders and production are expected to rise As Al Broaddus just reported, paper products and chemicals remain quite strong In particular, exports of chemicals are responding rather strongly to the dollar's weakness against the deutschemark, and we are now seeing South American customers ordering from US plants as opposed to their German competitors Building-related materials industries have weakened with the national slowdown in single-family housing, and residential activity continues to slow in our region Home sales have fallen below last year's levels, but realtors are encouraged by the recent declines in mortgage rates Multifamily markets, on the other hand, continue to experience rising occupancy and rental rates along with accelerating construction Nonresidential real estate is pretty much in the same situation Loan demand is steady in the region, with commercial demand stronger than consumer demand, and banks continue to compete pretty aggressively for business loans Wage increases remain stable in most areas of the District, and the extreme shortages of unskilled workers that I was reporting, particularly in Tennessee, are now beginning to abate Skilled construction workers and contractors remain in very short supply generally around the District but particularly in the Atlanta area Finally, manufacturers are reporting fewer price hikes for both materials and finished products  With respect to the national outlook, our forecast has a pattern similar to the one presented in the Greenbook, but we have real growth somewhat higher over the forecast horizon In line with that higher growth, unemployment moves a little lower by the end of 1996 and inflation ends up a little higher--rising to 3-1/2 percent I think both of these forecasts, the Greenbook and our staff forecast, are within the range of reasonable outcomes And while growth is probably going to remain sluggish, as we hope it will in the immediate future, there is a possibility of an acceleration later in the year With respect to inflation, our view continues to be that the rise that we are seeing is largely a cyclical phenomenon as opposed to the continuation of a trend I continue to be persuaded that since we have not accommodated inflationary impulses in recent years, there is no reason for sustained deterioration in prices to emerge past 1996 Thank you "
2447,1995-05-23," Mr Chairman, I think we ought to be fairly happy with the course of monetary policy over the last year and the results that it has achieved in the economy There obviously are uncertainties surrounding the forecast The concerns that you point to with respect to the asset price bubble are real, but I think that those are down the road as you have indicated We have the luxury for a change of sitting back and letting events unfold a little longer before we have to make a move So, I support your recommendation of a ""B"" symmetric directive "
2499,1995-08-22," Dave, you have some fiscal restraint built into your forecast and you just indicated--   Your forecast has some fiscal restraint built into it and you also, as you just indicated, have a relatively lower inflation forecast; and yet I notice that your assumed long-term interest rates remain pretty much at their current levels over the forecast horizon I am a little confused about that I would have expected some decrease in long-term rates   Mr Chairman, after a brief pause earlier in the year, the expansion in the Sixth District has resumed We see broad-based growth continuing for some time to come and this is partly due to continued migration to the region This is a trend that shows very little signs of abating, and it is supporting economic performance that I suspect is stronger than in the nation as a whole Our contacts in the District, including our directors, report that retail sales rebounded in July Apparel is doing fairly well and    8/22/95  household items, particularly those relating to home sales, are doing well also The exception is auto sales, which are mixed Manufacturers have begun using incentives to clear out end-of-year models Tourism has improved markedly in comparison to last year The increasing publicity being given to the Olympic games in 1996 is generating interest generally throughout the District, but perhaps more importantly there has been a return of European visitors to Florida  Our manufacturing survey released just about a week ago showed gains in output but not gains in shipments during July As a result of this, inventories of finished goods appear to have risen, but the expectational elements in that survey were quite positive Business has been particularly strong for manufacturers of electronics, medical equipment, and heavy duty trucks Weakness again is evident in autos and related goods as well as the District's apparel and textile plants, which continue to suffer from import competition Defense is also weak in the District Sales of paper and paper products have been good, but industry representatives express concern about prospects for the continuation of that good growth  Sales of single-family homes improved in July and rose to levels above those of a year ago in many areas Inventories of homes for sale appear tight at the moment; and new home construction, while rising, is still somewhat below last year's level Multifamily markets are also doing quite well, which I think is in contrast with the rest of the country Occupancy and rental rates are rising, although this is probably going to be moderated in 1996 by new units coming on line Commercial construction is also doing quite well and we are beginning to see some speculative office and industrial projects coming on line Again related to the Olympics, we are seeing a lot of building activity, particularly in Atlanta  On the banking side, bankers are reporting moderate growth in loan demand and very, very strong competition That competition unfortunately is reflected in credit terms as well as in price Business loans have been moderate so far this year, but the demand seems to be decelerating Consumer loans are mixed and lenders are somewhat disappointed with the demand for refinancing  Wage pressures in the District remain in check, almost throughout the District Skilled workers are still in high demand in a few places, but reports of labor shortages have diminished quite a lot in the last few months Product prices also seem to be in check with the exception of some pressure in the pulp and paper and the chemical sectors  With respect to the national economy, our forecast is very close to the Greenbook for the balance of this year, but we do show a little greater strength and somewhat more inflation Our forecast does not have any adjustment for fiscal policy changes, so I believe the differences between our two forecasts are consistent I think that the outlook is reasonably good for continued growth and moderate inflation But with the uncertainty surrounding fiscal policy and with the continued softness in the economies of our trading partners abroad, there is some risk of deviation from both of those forecasts  -15-    8/22/95  But at this point, I think the risks are about balanced Thank you, Mr Chairman "
2500,1995-08-22," Ditto, Mr Chairman "
2553,1995-09-26," Mr Chairman, I have felt for a long time that Humphrey-Hawkins was outdated and needed to be revised, and I expressed that opinion in this Committee several times I think this bill is a vast improvement over Humphrey-Hawkins, but I have some of the same concerns that were expressed by a number of people, notably Governor Blinder and Governor Yellen Clearly, the responsibility and the objective of a central bank in the long term should be price stability But this bill does not emphasize the other aspects of the central bank's responsibility, namely economic stabilization, to the extent that I would like To the degree that this bill is codifying what we have been doing, I ask the basic question Why do we need it? I just don't think this kind of thing should be enshrined in legislation I am a little concerned about the view that the language can be finessed That is not what we ought to be doing with the statutory language We should not be in that kind of position The Committee has been operating for several years toward the goal of price stability, and I think any Committee group, however it is constituted, would have the same goal Again, I come back to the fundamental threshold question I have had from the beginning Why have the bill at all? "
2554,1995-09-26," Thank you, Mr Chairman As I reported last time, the economy of the Sixth District is generally quite healthy Activity is continuing to move along the path of moderate expansion and moderate inflation Retailers are reasonably optimistic Tourism continues to be a stimulative in the economy, and construction is improving One of the weak spots, if I can call it that, is  -13-    9/26/95  manufacturing activity, which has been a bit sluggish I had not thought about this, but maybe it's because of the insecurity of the capital stock! [Laughter]  Looking at the individual areas very briefly, reports from retailers around the region parallel the discussion that's in the Greenbook Most saw very, very good if not excellent back-to-school sales Demand for home-related products continues to improve along with home sales Several merchants did note that their inventories are a bit heavy, but they do expect very good holiday sales, and they think such sales will bring them back to more comfortable inventory levels Sales of 1995 automobiles from inventories are coming at the expense of dealer profits and manufacturers' incentives On the travel side, tourism actually is stronger than it was at this time last year even though Florida, particularly south Florida, saw a drop in the latter part of August due to tropical storms and hurricanes But that seems to be a very temporary thing Foreign travel continues to be strong The only disappointing area here, and I was a bit surprised to find this, is that the cruise industry has very soft * bookings, and they are now offering discounts; 20 percent discounts seem to be typical So, the improvement in tourism is not extending to ships  Our manufacturing survey, as I indicated, showed some softness in August, and factories remain very, very cautious about hiring There has been little change in the outlook for capital spending and expansion continues as the District benefits from relocations and diversions of production from other domestic sites In the energy sector, the rig count in Louisiana in July was at its highest level in over four years Single-family sales improved last month, although they were below the very strong levels of a year earlier Retailers are quite optimistic, and they cite favorable mortgage rates and healthy job growth The multifamily sector in our District is quite strong, and I think that's in contrast to the rest of the nation Commercial real estate markets also are continuing to strengthen throughout the region, and we are seeing some speculative office and industrial projects either under construction or in the planning stage It's interesting that bankers are now becoming much more cautious about financing these activities, which I guess is good news Bank lending remains mixed with the strength being in the business area Wage increases remain stable, and the reports of shortages of labor are becoming less frequent than they were even six months ago Prices for finished products were flat in August, although prices of materials in many industries did post some increases The general information we are getting from business people is that it is still very, very difficult to pass along price increases So the situation in the District continues to look good  On the national economy, we have not changed our forecast significantly since the last FOMC meeting However, we did incorporate a further 25 basis point drop in the federal funds rate and that produces somewhat faster growth later in 1996 and in 1997, with the unemployment rate not drifting any higher and not much further improvement occurring in the pace of inflation  As I look at the national economy, Mr Chairman, I feel reasonably happy with the result that has been attained, particularly on the inflation side The concern that I have is that there may be  -14-    9/26/95  more softness out there than is indicated in the numbers, and I am getting that sense in the anecdotal information from directors and other business people As we consider our policy action, I think it might be well to begin to question whether potential in the economy is actually somewhat higher than we think it is and the NAIRU somewhat lower Along those lines, I am also a little concerned that the Greenbook forecast shows a level of growth throughout the forecast horizon that is somewhat below potential as now defined or what we think is potential at about 2-1/2 percent That obviously has all kinds of policy implications that I'll save for the next go around Thank you "
2555,1995-09-26," Mr Chairman, I hate to break the trend that seems to be developing here Your argument is highly reasonable and I hesitate to disagree with you, but I will anyway For many of the reasons that have been advanced, I think we ought to move and we ought to do so today First of all, we all apparently agree that interest rates are high by historical standards, and if maintained I think they are going to be contractionary in the long term Governors Yellen and Blinder have articulated that theory very well There is a trend that is building, and I think we ought to arrest it at this point    9/26/95  In spite of the fact that we have a very dynamic economy in the Sixth District, as I indicated earlier, there are business people who are reporting to me that softness is beginning to develop So, the economy may not be in as good shape as the statistics are indicating Again, as I said earlier, the Greenbook forecast is placing growth below what is currently considered to be potential I think potential is higher than indicated in the Greenbook and therefore that the gap between actual growth and what I consider the real potential of the economy is greater than that in the Greenbook That might give us trouble down the road Inflation is certainly well behaved and whether we are at price stability or not I guess is a matter of definition But I certainly don't see any deterioration in the inflation rate Finally, I think the Fed's credibility is such that we are in a position where we can move today Now, my preference along these lines is irrespective of the fiscal situation, and I certainly respect your view regarding the timing On the other hand, I do think that today may be as good a time as any to move It may be a less sensitive time than it will be later So, my preference would be to move by 25 basis points today "
2615,1995-11-15," Thank you, Mr Chairman Conditions in the Southeast, in the Sixth District, have not changed very much since the last meeting We continue to enjoy moderate economic growth in most sectors and relatively low inflation It is interesting to note that the economy in the Southeast, and I think this is generally true of the nation, has made a successful transition from the rapid growth in the first three years of the current expansion to the more moderate growth that we have experienced this year  Looking at some particular sectors, we have seen a rebound in household spending in early November after some special factors, including Hurricane Opal, had depressed retail sales in October In spite of this rebound, extensive holiday sales promotions have already  -21-    11/15/95  begun that will extend the holiday shopping season by at least several weeks I have seen some reports in the last few days indicating that retailers in the Southeast are expecting sales to be 7 percent above last year's, which I think is a little better than what is reported generally in the nation In the Atlanta area, they are expecting about an 8 percent increase, which is really quite good It remains to be seen whether they will achieve those or not Sales of consumer durables other than autos have strengthened recently along with the second wave of home building In the real estate area, activity in residential markets has been stimulated by recent declines in mortgage rates Nashville and Atlanta remain the strongest markets, but other Southeast metropolitan areas also have had quite good growth relative to last year In the multifamily sector, demand is really strong, and it is not uncommon to see ninety percent occupancy rates in that market Commercial construction is also expanding throughout the District and speculative office and retail developments are regularly reported now In manufacturing, our regional manufacturers' survey indicates that the pace of growth in the Southeast has slowed somewhat since July, and that survey includes housing-related manufacturing and auto production, which had been strong previously The same survey continues to show quite modest pressures on prices at both the input and final product levels, and the expectations are for little change in such prices The Southeast, and especially Atlanta, are experiencing growth in tourism in both traffic and revenue The Olympics are guaranteeing a draw of about 2 to 3 million visitors next summer, which is expected to spill over into each of the District states in one form or another So, the outlook for the Southeast continues to be quite good on both the output side and in terms of prices  With respect to the national economy, for the first time that I can remember, our forecast and the Greenbook forecast are about the same Both forecasts agree that the 42 percent real growth of the third quarter is unsustainable Our forecast shows real growth in the 2-1/4 to 3 percent range quarterly through 1997 and inflation in the 2-1/2 to 3 percent range quarterly Thank you, Mr Chairman "
2616,1995-11-15," Mr Chairman, first of all I would like to associate myself with the remarks that Governors Yellen and Blinder made with respect to the risks to the economy Secondly, as I argued last time, it seems to me that interest rates are on the high side relative to inflation and to history No matter how we think about the Greenbook or the revisions there, I think that we are in a period where economic activity is best characterized as moderate, and in both the Greenbook forecast and our own forecast, moderation is the key word throughout the forecast horizon At the same time, we have relatively low inflation and, given the federal funds rate of 5-3/4 percent, we have a real interest rate of around 3 percent Over time in my view such a rate is going to inhibit investment, job creation, and economic growth That is not going to happen now, to be sure, and I don't think it's critical that we move today, but there are a lot of long-term and short-term arguments that, on balance, lead me to the conclusion that the level of the federal funds rate is too high, that it will have to be reduced eventually, and that any reduction will not have much of an impact on inflation I would therefore be inclined to move right now So, if you were to give me those three or four votes, Mr Chairman, I would cast all of them in that direction [Laughter]   Okay, five   But, again I would like to emphasize that I don't think it is critical in any sense that we move today It certainly will not hurt to wait, but I believe we really need to think about the implications of maintaining the current policy "
