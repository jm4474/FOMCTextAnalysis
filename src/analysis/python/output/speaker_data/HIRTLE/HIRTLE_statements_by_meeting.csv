8352,2008-01-29,"  Mike has described how the rating agencies treated structured-  credit products; a closely related issue is how investors used these ratings  Did  investors rely too much on ratings in making their investment decisions?  Did they  take false comfort from ratings and not really appreciate the risks they were  assuming, leading to excessive growth of the market for subprime structured credit?   As noted in the top panel of exhibit 7, our approach was to examine these questions  through the lens of one representative type of institutional investor  public pension  funds  Public pension funds are an informative example of investor use (and misuse)  of credit ratings for several reasons  First, public pension boards of directors are  composed largely of representatives of the employees and retirees covered by the  pension plan and have only limited financial expertise in some cases  Second, survey  evidence suggests that a high portion of these funds use credit ratings in their  investment guidelines  Finally, relative to some other investors, many public pension  funds provide significant public information about their activities  While we need to  be cautious in generalizing, we believe that practices in the pension fund sector reflect  the tensions faced by other institutional investors in making risk assessments and  investment decisions  We examined the investment practices and fund governance of  11 public pension plans  These plans ranged from the largest fund—CalPERS, with  $250 billion in assets—to six much smaller plans with assets of $6 billion to  $11 billion  We used the funds’ 2006 comprehensive annual financial reports, which  were generally the most recent available, and the funds’ websites to generate our  information  We focused specifically on the funds’ fixed-income segments, since this   January 29–30, 2008 169 of 249    is the asset class in which structured-credit products would likely be held and for  which credit ratings are used        The middle panel lists some key conclusions from this review  The first is that   these funds have developed workable market solutions to address inexperience or  lack of financial sophistication among their managers and board members  These  include hiring professional investment managers to make investment decisions on  their behalf and, perhaps as significantly, hiring investment consultants to structure  asset-allocation strategies, to select investment managers and develop mandates  guiding their actions, and to monitor and assess fund performance  While these funds  clearly obtain significant professional advice in managing their investments, our  review suggests several ways in which these arrangements could be improved in light  of recent financial innovation  Specifically, the mandates guiding investment  managers have not always kept pace with the growth of structured-credit markets   These mandates typically require managers to meet or exceed returns on a benchmark  index or of a peer group of investment managers, while constraining the risk the  managers may assume  Credit ratings play an important role in these risk  constraints—for instance, by imposing a minimum average rating for the portfolio or  a minimum rating on individual securities  However, few of the funds we profiled  made significant distinctions between structured-credit and other securities in these  credit-rating-based constraints, although there were sometimes other limits on the  aggregate share of asset-backed positions  The failure to make this distinction  provides scope for investment managers to generate higher returns by moving into  structured-credit products, without raising warning signals about the additional risk  these positions entail  This is not necessarily a “naïve” use of credit ratings by  investment managers, as they could well have recognized that higher-yielding  structured-credit products embodied significant additional risk relative to similarly  rated corporate debt  Instead, it reflects a previously effective mechanism used by  fund boards to convey risk appetite to these managers falling out-of-date with the  emergence and rapid growth of a new form of credit instrument      As indicated in the bottom panel, our key recommendation is that the pension   fund industry and other investors should re-evaluate the use of credit ratings in  investment mandates  In a narrow sense, these mandates should distinguish between  ratings on structured credit and those on more traditional corporate credit  However,  the more fundamental point is that mandates would do a better job of enforcing  desired risk limits on the overall portfolio if they acknowledged differences in risk,  return, and correlation across instruments rather than relying on generic credit ratings   A second important point is that investors should ensure that their investment  consultants have independent views of the quality and adequacy of credit ratings for  the types of positions in their portfolios  This is particularly important if mandates  guiding investment manager behavior feature credit ratings as a key risk constraint   That completes our prepared remarks  We would be happy to take your questions  before we proceed to the final presentation      Well, I think you’ve identified the key problem that many of these funds   face, and the important entities in many ways are these investment consultants  At least the funds   we looked at all hire one or more of these investment consultants  Many of them are from large,   globally active firms, and the role that those consultants play is precisely to address the issues that   you’ve raised  They help them select the asset manager who is doing the investing  They help them   design the mandates or instructions  They help them monitor what the asset managers are doing and   assess their performance  So to some extent those consultants are a kind of sweet spot for these   funds in terms of where the additional layer of sophistication that doesn’t run just off the rating   could come from    We didn’t do an evaluation of them, but some of them are from very, very   large firms  They are advising funds in the trillions of dollars across all their different clients  That   is the service they are selling, and so they should be—they had better be—in a position to do that  "
