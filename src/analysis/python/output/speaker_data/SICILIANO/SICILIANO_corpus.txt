  That is correct     The reason that we speak to the Justice Department is that there is a  regulation under which the Department [of Justice] indicates that it will not defend an agency  under a Freedom of Information Act suit unless, prior to [the agency’s] taking final action, [the  Department] has been consulted with respect to the agency action     I called the appropriate individuals in the Justice Department before the final documents  were presented to Governor Coldwell about continuing the denial recommendation  He basically  indicated that while he agrees with our position that at least substantially all of the Memoranda  are technically exempt under the Act, he feels that the Department cannot go along with the  denial because denial would be inconsistent with the Department policy which dictates that an  agency should release information unless disclosure would be harmful to some legitimate     8/16/77 - 60 -           interest protected by the act  The Justice Department’s view is that since the documents are  approximately five years old, that no substantial harm would result [from] disclosure     Well, I think to clarify, the Department’s position was based on a  number of rather bad experiences they had in litigation  The Department accepts our view [that]  we have communicated to them, that the Memoranda are substantially exempt under the  technical reading of the statute  I think our chances of succeeding in litigation to an acceptable  degree are substantially impaired if we go into court without the Department  It’s the court [that]     8/16/77 - 69 -           will have to determine which portions of the Memoranda are reasonably segregable and  therefore must be disclosed, and in doing that, it will have the Department’s actions in mind
